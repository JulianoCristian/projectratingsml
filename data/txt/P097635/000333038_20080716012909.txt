1      INTRODUCTION




       The Consortium (the Consultant) led by Environmental Resources
       Management (ERM) Italy and supported by ELC Electroconsult and CSA
       Group Ltd was commissioned by the Kosovo Lignite Power Technical
       Assistance Project (LPTAP) of the Ministry of Energy and Mining of Kosovo
       (MEM), to undertake the assignment "Environmental and Social Safeguards
       Services for Private Sector Participation in the Development of new
       generation capacity, related transmission and the development of the Sibovc
       Lignite Field" between July 2007 and July 2008.
       It is clear from all the studies carried out in Kosovo over the years that the
       potential for power generation from lignite remains far and away the major
       asset and that the Sibovc field singled out as the highest priority for
       development, based on coal quality and overburden. The field contains
       adequate coal reserves to feed a new power plant of 2,000 MW for a period in
       excess of 40 years, which is the period usually assumed for the plant life
       within the economic and financial analysis.


       As stated in the Energy Strategy (Energy Strategy of Kosova, 2005-2015,
       Ministry of Energy and Mining (MEM), July 2005) "the electricity production
       shall be oriented towards fulfilling domestic consumption demands with stable and
       uninterrupted production and competing prices, as well as export of energy surpluses
       to regional and wider markets".
       All the technical and economic indications collected so far point to the fact
       that the proposed 2,000 MW new power generation is viable. Given the
       environmental present conditions around the development area, any further
       air and water emission increase must be carefully evaluated and possibly
       avoided. What above implies that the existing sources of emissions should be
       progressively reduced, according to an agreed time schedule, to the western
       established limits.



1.1    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

       The main scope of the assignment is to provide environmental and social
       safeguards advisory services to the Project Steering Committee of the Kosovo
       Lignite Power Technical Assistance Project (PSC), established jointly by the
       United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and
       MEM of the Kosovo Provisional Institutions of Self-Government. The project
       is funded under a grant to these institutions from the International
       Development Association (IDA) of The World Bank Group.

                environmental and social aspects of lignite development and
                associated power generation.



1.2    SESA REPORT SCOPE OF WORK

       The Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) is one of the main
       component of the environmental and social safeguard support the Consultant
       is requested to provide in order to facilitate the successful development of
       lignite mining and power generation project. Scope of the SESA is to identify
       and discuss the broad range of environmental and social issues associated
       with such development.


       As specifically required by the TOR, the SESA has to be carried out in
       response to and parallel with the New Mining Field Development Plan
       (NMFDP), a regional energy sector development plan, aimed at describing the
       spatial implications of the development of a new mine and associated power
       plants and setting the spatial planning cornerstones and framework for the
       development activity.


       The EU SEA Directive (2001/42/EC) and a new Kosovar regulation presently
       in development has been considered as the point of reference for scoping and
       conducting the SESA.

       This document represents the Final Strategic Environmental and Social
       Assessment (SESA) Report, whose main objectives are the following:


           ·    prepare an environmental and socio-economic baseline in a lignite
                deposit area located northwest of Obiliq town, including Hade,
                Hamidi, Lajthishte, Sibovc villages, hereafter known as New Mining
                Field;

           ·    describe present activities (mainly KEK facilities);

           ·    compare potential development scenarios, including three proposed
                locations, type of technology available (pulverized fired `PF' or
                circulating fluidized bed `CFB'), size of the power plant units (300 or
                500 MW), and phasing of development (rapid or phased). The "zero"
                or no action alternative is also taken into account;

           ·    identify and assessing the environmental and socio-economic impacts
                of projected development alternatives;

           ·    make recommendations on the preferred development scenario and
                integrating SESA results into the New Mining Field Development Plan
                (NMFDP);

           ·    recommend mitigation measures for the development;

           ·    facilitate the process of public consultation.


       The SESA is the preliminary environmental and social assessment of lignite
       sector development. A more detailed analysis is to be carried out by the
       investors in terms of Environmental Assessment and Social Assessment for
       the selected project.



1.3    OVERVIEW OF SESA PROCESS, CONSULTATIONS AND RELATIONSHIP WITH SDP

The SESA included an extensive consultation process aimed at setting
environmental and social priorities within the lignite mining and power
generation development and in particular to:


 ·    ensure that key stakeholders are identified;

 ·    collect public opinions/views/perception on current state of the
      environmental and social issues and expectations for the future;

 ·    provide information on the character, progress and impacts of the project
      to key stakeholders;

 ·    give stakeholders the opportunity to influence the policy priorities that
      affect this process;

 ·    disclose the SESA report to stakeholders for comments to be included in
      the Final SESA Report and Draft Sibovc Development Plan.


The main consultation activities performed within the SESA and the Sibovc
Lignite Field Project are the following:


 ·    Identification of the key project stakeholders (Local and national
      government, employees and KEK existing facilities managers, NGOs,
      policy and research organizations, communities affected by resettlement
      and/or other social and environmental impacts) and assessment of
      stakeholders' key issues and levels of interest and influence.

 ·    First Public Hearing Meeting, held on the 21st of September 2007, aimed
      at (i) presenting current status of the Project; (ii) introducing SESA
      consultation process; (iii) describing SESA scope and objectives and (iv)

      Grabovc, Hade, Sibovc, Lajthishte, Plemetin, Dardhiste, Mazgit, Obliq).
      The village consultation meetings, carried out in the period 22nd October
      ­ 1st November 2007, provided an opportunity for the LPTAP team and
      the affected communities to establish a two-way dialogue and to identify
      key issues of concern of different sectors of the community, especially
      those who may have been excluded from traditional consultation
      methods. Other scope of the village meetings was to identify the most
      appropriate methods for future consultations with these communities.

 ·    Second Public Hearing meeting held on the 11th of December 2007 aimed
      at (i) proposing the development scenarios; (ii) informing about the main
      environmental and social issues investigated in the First Draft SESA
      Report and (iii) collecting public comments and questions which will rise
      upon the First Draft SESA Report disclosure.

 ·    Second phase consultation with affected communities carried on by
      Community Development Forum-CDF starting from January 2008. The
      main purposes of these meetings were: (i) to assist in the implementation

2      SESA LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REVIEW




2.1    INTRODUCTION

       The legislative framework review is a required key component (Task 4/AI) of
       the project "Environmental and Social Safeguard Services". It provides a
       description of the existing legislative framework related to environmental
       management and expropriation/resettlement issues at national, regional and
       local levels and a gap analysis with reference to relevant international
       standards and regulations.


       This gap analysis delivered at the beginning of September 2007 informed the
       Project Committee's Legal and Regulatory Advisors on the development of
       the legislative framework and was used for the preparation of the Diagnostic
       Survey of Legal Issues Associated with Management of Social, Economic and
       Environmental Impacts (26th September 2007).


       The review focuses on key environmental, health and safety and resettlement
       issues related to the lignite sector and related activities. The analysis of the
       division of responsibilities between central and local authorities will be part
       of the review of the existing institutional capacity for the environmental
       management which was included in the Activity II/First Draft Report
       delivered in October 2007.


       The present gap analysis review was carried out taking in consideration the
       laws and instructions on environmental management that have been drafted
       or approved after February 2007 and also on the basis of main findings of the
       Revised Interim Diagnostic Survey of the Legal and Regulatory Advisors (21st
       January 2008).



2.2    METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH

       The review of environmental, health and safety legislation has been
       developed as follows:

        ·    selection of key environmental, health and safety issues based on the
             context of the project (SESA of l ignite extraction and power generation
             program , Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and environmental
             monitoring, Resettlement issues);

        ·    review of existing EHS EU regulation and pertaining enforced EHS
             legislation in Kosovo;

        ·    comparative analysis between EU requirements and WB standards
             versus Kosovo legislation;

        ·    interviews with relevant environmental authorities in Kosovo

        ·    identification of major gaps.

                                                6

The key EHS issues selected include as follows:


 Environmental issues:

 ·    EIA

 ·    SEA-Strategic Environmental Assessment and Spatial Planning issues

 ·    Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC)

 ·    air emissions and air quality;

 ·    water uses and wastewater effluents;

 ·    waste management;

 ·    hazardous substances ­ oils, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos
      and Ozone Depletive Substances (ODS);

 ·    Soil and Groundwater Quality;

 ·    Nature Protection and Biodiversity;

 ·    Environmental Impact Assessment Issues related to Spatial Planning.


 Health and Safety issues:

 ·    Health & Safety Management System;

 ·    Mineral Extracting Industry;

 ·    Fire Prevention and Protection;

 ·    Chemical Exposure at Workplace;

 ·    Physical Exposure (Asbestos) at Workplace.


Resettlement Issue
The emphasis of the gap analysis is on compensation and resettlement, as this
is the most sever impact predicted by the lignite power plant project.
However, as social assessment and public consultation are crucial aspects of a
sound resettlement process, these elements have been included as part of the
legislative review. There is no specific EU directive on resettlement thus the
World Bank OP 4.12 and The IFC performance standards 1 and 5 have been
used as the international benchmarks against which to measure the Kosovo
legislation and regulations.


The following key issues have been analysed as part of the resettlement legal
gap analysis:

 ·    Definitions;

 ·    Resettlement planning and procedural requirements(including social
      assessment);

 ·    Public consultation and participation of project affected communities;

 ·    Extent of compensation and types of assistance to be offered;

 ·    Categories of people eligible for compensation( including vulnerable and
      indigenous people);

 ·    Property measurement and income restoration.

In particular, the LCP Directive contains the following provisions:

1.  Plants licensed after 27 November 2002 will have to comply with
    the emission limit values for SO2, NOx and dust fixed in part B of
    the Annexes III to VII, setting values which are significantly stricter
    than the previous ones.
2.  Plants licensed after 1 July 1987, the date of entry into force of the
    old Directive, and before 27 November 2002, will have to comply
    with the emission limit values fixed in part A of the Annexes III to
    VII of the LCP Directive.
3. The LCP Directive requires significant emission reductions from
   "existing plants" (licensed before 1 July 1987) to be achieved by 1
   January 2008:

    or
    b) through a national emission reduction plan that achieves overall
    reductions calculated using the emission limit values.
4. The Commission considers that it is possible to adopt a "combined
    approach" for the implementation of the LCP Directive for existing
    plants, which may consist of:
a) applying a national emission reduction plan for some plants and an
emission limit value approach for others for all the compliance periods
(2008-2015, 2016-2017, and 2018 onwards), or
b) adopting a national emission reduction plan for a/some compliance
period(s) and complying with emission limit values for the rest of the
compliance periods, or
c) mixing options a) and b) above.

A national emission reduction plan, whether used alone or as part of a
combined approach, must address all the three pollutants covered by
the Directive for all the plants covered by the plan.

The LCP Directive allows existing combustion plants to be exempted
from compliance with emission limit values and from inclusion in a
national emission reduction plan, provided that the operator
undertakes not to operate the plant for more than 20.000 hours starting
from 1 January 2008 and ending no later than 31 December 2015.

2.4    CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

       The gap analysis carried out comparing existing Kosovo legislation with EU
       and other international standards (e.g. World Bank) in the framework of
       Environmental protection, occupational Health and Safety and Resettlement
       issues applicable to lignite mining and power generation activities, has shown
       that, although the process to develop an EHS regulatory framework in
       compliance with EU Directives and other international standards has been
       started, at the moment, only very limited regulations have been developed in
       the Kosovo legislation. A number of framework Laws have been passed such
       as the Environmental Protection Law, the Waste Law and the Water Law, but
       the regulations to make them operational are not yet in place. In parallel,
       efforts are needed to build institutional capacity and operational
       environmental management services.


       The most relevant recommendations in relation to the main issues that have
       been reviewed are noted below; findings and comments on existing
       legislation as included in the (IPA H&W) Revised Interim Diagnostic Report
       are also noted when applicable.



       Strategic Environmental Assessment and Spatial Planning
       The general Principles on assessment of environmental and socio economic
       impact are indicated in the Spatial Planning Law and the Environmental
       Protection Law, but no specific regulation has been developed. The Spatial
       Planning Law indicates that local authorities will decide which plans will
       need to undergo an environmental and socio-economic impact study.
       However, such decision should not be left as a decision to individual local
       authorities, but should be regulated by Law on a general, independent basis.

       A draft SEA Law (dated May 2007) has been submitted to the Assembly and is
       pending approval. Although it was drafted in compliance with the EC SEA
       Directive, the public consultation procedures are not clearly defined. These
       should include making SEA reports available to the public for written
       comments. Guidelines should be prepared to support the SEA process for
       specific plans and programs (energy, spatial planning, transport, agriculture,
       etc...).

       Sectoral environmental regulations (air and water quality standards amongst
       others) should also be prepared and promulgated to allow for the SEA process
       to be implemented.

       The institutional framework for the implementation of the SEA process
       should be defined and specific training planned and provided for all parties
       involved at central and local levels.

       Main comments on the Draft SEA Law as included in the Revised Interim
       Diagnostic Report of IPA H&W are the following.

       Key areas where the draft law is not considered to be compliant with the relevant EC
       SEA Directive include:

There are also some issues where the intent of the Law is not clear in the
English language version.

The IPA H&W Advisors submitted a Draft amendments to the Law as a
separate deliverable (November 2007) and discussed with key members of the
SEA Law drafting group within MESP during a visit by the consultant in
November 2007. The draft was finalized in early 2008 and should be approved
soon by the Assembly.


Environmental Impact Assessment
The EIA regulations in force include Administrative Directive 9 of July 2004,
and Articles 20-21 of the Environmental Protection Law. A new EIA Law
approved by the Assembly in June 2007 is awaiting signature to become
operational.


The new Law has redesigned the EIA procedure, which remains the
responsibility of MESP. Main aspects include the following:


       ·    No part of the procedure is carried out by KEPA as had been
            foreseen by the Administrative Directive of 2004.

       ·    Reportedly, a Commission made up of 5 members will be involved
            in the EIA procedure. These members will be nominated by the
            Permanent Secretary and are employees of MESP.

       ·    A single person, employee of the Ministry, is the focal point and
            coordinator for all EIA processes. A second person is at present on
            maternity leave.

       ·    The Ministry may contract external experts to review the EIA (Article
            18).

       ·    No other Ministries or relevant Institutions are to be involved in the
            EIA.

       ·    The main conclusions and recommendations contained in the EIA
            report and the Opinion-Proposal shall be subject to public debate.
            (Article 19).


The IPA H&W Revised Interim Diagnostic Report includes the following
main comments on Draft EIA Law:


This Draft Law would appear to meet all the main requirements of the 1985 EC EIA
Directive (as amended) and the technical annexes appear to mirror those included
under Community legislation. However, once again the Draft Law on EIA raises a
number of issues relating to the coherence of the entire corpus of existing and proposed
Environmental Laws in Kosovo. Key issues are:


    1.   Questions of coherence / consistency with the Draft Law on Environmental
         Protection arise. For example, Article 7 of the Draft EIA Law purports to
         provide that a project requiring EIA under Article 5 shall not receive the

         Environmental Consent required from MESP without having completed the
         EIA procedure. This provision needs to be checked carefully against the
         various provisions in the Draft Law on Environmental Protection and the
         Draft IPPC and Environmental Permitting Law obliging operators to obtain
         various licenses / permits /authorizations.
    2.   Similarly, Articles 20 and 21 would appear to link the Opinion for
         Environmental Consent directly to the review of the EIA Report, which raises
         a number of issues. First of all, it is not clear whether the Environmental
         Consent merely relates to the adequacy of the EIA Report, the acceptability of
         the proposed project or both. Presuming it relates to the project, it would
         appear to remove a significant element of discretion in decision-making from
         the relevant public officials. Secondly, it might appear more appropriate for
         decision-making in respect of the Environmental Consent, including the right
         to appeal which is set out under Article 22, to be dealt with under the Draft
         IPPC and Environmental Permitting Law. These provisions will need to be
         checked carefully for consistency with the relevant provisions of the Draft
         IPPC and Environmental Permitting Law.


Reportedly, a project to help the enforcement of Environmental Legislation at
the Municipal Level financed by EAR is due to start in January 2008 for a 12
month period. It includes training of municipal inspectors, to make
understandable the Environmental Law and regulation and make them able
to implement them in their municipalities. The TOR specifies the following
target groups: the MESP with its executive agencies KEPA and Inspectorate
and 30 municipalities (Deçan /Decane, Dragash /Dragas, Drenas /Glogovac,
Ferizaj /Urosevac, Fushë-Kosovë /Kosovo-Polje, Gjakovë /Djkovica, Gjilan

Development of sectoral environmental regulations such as air and water
quality standards are fundamental to enable EIA procedures to be
implemented.


IPPC
A Draft Law on IPPC and environmental permitting has been approved by
Assembly but not yet signed by Prime Minster. The following main
considerations are applicable as reported in IPA H&W Interim Diagnostic
Survey Report.


This Draft Law is really quite well drafted and follows the general scheme and
technical annexes of the EC IPPC Directive very closely, thereby making it quite clear
that largescale power generation plant [Annex 1, Part A, 1.1], hazardous waste
disposal activities [Annex 1, Part A, 5.3 and 5.4] and large-scale open-cast extraction
of mineral resources [Annex 1, Part A, 6.2] all require an IPPC Permit. Equally,



ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                      THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                              77

Annex 1, Part B makes clear the thresholds at which such activities would merely
require a Permit from MESP.


However, it would be useful to check this Draft for consistency with a number of other
existing or proposed measures of environmental legislation in Kosovo, including the
Waste Law, Water Law, the Draft Law on Environmental Protection, and the Draft
EIA Law.


Key issues are:
1.  Concerns about the lack of a requirement for public participation in respect of the
    granting of IPPC permits under the Draft Law are obviated by the inclusion of a
    provision requiring such participation under Article 57(1)(c) of the Draft Law on
    Environmental Protection. Also, Article 20.2 of the Draft IPPC and
    Environmental Permitting Law itself provides that,
    `In preparing administrative decisions, the Minister shall inform and consult with
    other interested governmental bodies and the concerned public, and shall take their
    comments into account.'


2.  As Article 7 makes it clear that `Emission limit values' in other laws shall be
    considered as maximum emission limit values for the purposes of the conditions to
    be included in Permits under Article 6.2(b), it would be useful to find out how
    many such measures setting Emission limit values are in force are in preparation.
    Further, it would be useful to check for consistency with Articles 36 and 63 of the
    Draft Law on Environmental Protection. It would also be important to explore the
    extent to which the Draft Law empowers the permitting authority to attach
    technical conditions to the Permits in the absence of such measures in force (i.e.
    without the permitting authority acting ultra vires, etc.).


3.  It would also be useful to check the permitting provisions contained in this Draft
    Law for overlap / duplication with the various provisions in the Draft Law on
    Environmental Protection obliging operators to obtain various licenses / permits /
    authorizations.


Air Emission and Air Quality
The main principles related to air quality monitoring and management are
defined in the Environmental Protection Law. The Law on Air Protection
foresees generators of air emissions to periodically inform the MESP of their
characteristics. A draft Administrative Instruction "On the rules and
standards of the discharges on air by the stationary sources of pollution" has
been approved and signed by the Prime Minister in September 2007. It
contains air emission limits for a wide range of industrial activities.

The instruction states that emission limits for Large Combustion Plants
should be in compliance with EC regulations and that existing plants must
comply with these limits by the end of 2017. Limits for air emissions from
existing plants are a bit higher than the EC Directive limits. The regulation
foresees air emission reduction plans to be negotiated between the single
plants and the Ministry. The English version is sometimes not very clear, it
should therefore be revised giving clear indications on the timing in which
the emission limits will be coming into force.



ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                  THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                           78

No air quality data is presently available in the country as the Ministry and its
operative institutions have no adequate measuring equipment. The Kosovo
Environmental Protection Agency, (KEPA), has only recently started
operating and its environmental monitoring data collection and management
capacity still needs to be built at both central and decentralised levels.
Additional legislative tools will probably be needed to implement air
emission control and air quality management.


Water Supply


The Kosovo Water Law under Section 8 calls for coordination of river basin
management with upstream and downstream riparians in the case of
transboundary river basins system, according to EU policy. Under the Water
Law, the right of use of water is given through issuing a Water Permit (subject
to review every 5 years) or through a Water Concession (no review period
defined).


It appears from the Law that industrial complexes, unlike irrigated agriculture
and fisheries, are not eligible to apply for a water concession, although the
law states that "use of water for technological needs" is eligible to apply for a
concession. No provisions are made in the Law for the transfer of water
permits or concessions from one permit holder to another.


Implementing the institutional setting and water strategy development as
specified in the law is in its early stages. A basic strategy paper (Water
Balance Report, in Albanian) was developed in 2004, based on a 1985 Water
Management Plan, but to date no water management plan or river basin
management plans have been developed. As a result of the absence of a river
basin plan and a comprehensive policy framework, there is limited oversight
regarding the availability of water sources in the Iber system, no clear policy
for strategic allocation of water for various sectors or the issuing of long-term
water usage agreements, nor a well-defined mechanism for the resolution of
competing water demands.


There is a need for a river basin plan and comprehensive policy framework to
guide strategic water allocations to various sectors and define and institute
mechanisms for resolution of competing water demands.


According to EU policy, the Kosovar authorities should endeavor to produce
a single river basin management plan for the Iber-Lepenc system with
upstream and downstream riparians, and if this is not possible, the plan
should at least cover the portion of the international river basin district lying
within Kosovo.


Wastewater


The Water Law sets the general principles for sustainable water and water
resources management. However, no waste discharge limits for waste
effluents have been set in any existing regulatory document, and no standards
for groundwater quality have been developed. An Administrative Regulation

ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                         79

exists to regulate water usage permitting and the nomination of water
inspectors. Specific regulation governing water quality discharges and
assessment and preservation of water body qualities should be developed and
put into force. In addition, it is foreseeable that monitoring data collection and
management capacity still needs to be built at both central and decentralised
levels.


A draft regulation on water quality standards has been prepared, but no
details have yet been made available to the Consultants.


Waste Management
A Framework Waste Law has been issued in 2005 introducing the waste
classification system in compliance with the EU Directive, and a number of
Administrative Regulations have been issued in 2007 to regulate the
management of waste oils, spent batteries, spent vehicles and construction
wastes. However, waste management tools such as national and local waste
management plans to determine the quantities and typologies of wastes
generated in the country and consequently define the needs for treatment and
disposal facilities, need to be developed in parallel to building institutional
capacity and operational waste management services.


Hazardous Substances Management and Handling
No Regulatory framework has been developed for handling of chemicals and
hazardous substances apart from the Waste Law. Specific regulation and
institutional capacity should therefore be developed to include handling of on
Asbestos Containing Materials, PCBs, and Ozone Depletive Substances
amongst others.


Soil and Groundwater Quality
The only existing regulation refers to discharge of liquid waste into the
ground.


Specific guidelines should be developed to regulate the following:

  ·     Soil and groundwater quality standards;

  ·     Soil protection measures (e.g. technical characteristics of storage
        facilities, periodical integrity testing of underground storage tanks,
        etc.); and

  ·     Emergency actions to be undertaken in case of soil and groundwater
        contamination.


Nature and Biodiversity Protection and Conservation
The existing Law for Nature Protection in Kosovo indicates a number of
subsidiary acts that should complete the regulatory framework on nature
conservation on specific issues that include the following:

  ·     The List of Proposed conservation zones and the respective important
        habitat types and or species present, with reference to Habitat Directive

  ·     The Red Book of important species and important habitats which are to
        receive special protection



ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                  THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                           80

   ·    The measures and criteria for landscape protection outside nature
        conservation zones

   ·    The procedure for applying for and obtaining an environmental
        consent for a proposed project within the landscape territories;

   ·    The content and form of reports on measures undertaken with the aim
        of preventing negative impacts on landscapes, in accordance with the
        plans drafted by the competent institutions;

   ·    Prohibited activities in protected territories.
According to the information reviewed these subsidiary acts have not been
approved yet. It is recommended that the legal framework is completed with
the necessary subsidiary acts.


Management of Protected Areas
The Law on Nautre Conservation (2004) does not contain specific provisions
for the institutional arrangements to be envisaged for the Management Body
of the Protected Areas (organizational structure, statute, composition of the
management) nor does it clearly indicate which Institution should finance the
Management Body's costs (personnel, equipment, facilities, running costs, etc.
). This should be addressed.


IUCN Categories
The Category VI of IUCN is not included in the list of the nature conservation
zones. This category is meant to combine nature protection with a sustainable
use of natural resources and with sustainable production practices. Review of
the Law t include also this category can be considered in the future 3-5 years
based on the experience acquired in the application of this Law.


Responsibilities of Municipalities in Nature Protection
The Law assigns a critical role to Municipalities that includes establishing the
management authority for all categories of protection, except for National
Parks. It is recommended to verify and ensure that Municipalities possess the
necessary capacity and resources to comply with this requirements.


Health & Safety Management
A framework legislation is in place in Kosovo governing health and safety at
workplaces. Specific occupational health and safety conditions and risks are
reported to be regulated separately by secondary legislation on the basis of
this general law; specific secondary legislation has not been issued yet.
Aspects that will need to be addressed mainly regard: detailed procedures for
accidents and incidents reporting, a stringent risk evaluation approach, and
its connection with type of medical surveillance programs required for
specific working activities, or personal protective equipment provision,
restrictions applicable to vulnerable workers and assessment procedures for
specific risks (as biological, carcinogenic or mutagenic risks, occupational
noise exposure, manual handling of loads and ergonomics, explosion risks).


Criteria for categorization of premises and areas with respect to fire
prevention and protection measures are yet be implemented, as well as
specific procedures for inspections assigned to authorized legal entities and

related training of persons performing the controls. Hazardous chemicals
substances are required to be stored and used in accordance with European
standards; on the other hand, specific standards and threshold limits for
indoor asbestos exposure limit at workplaces are missing and should be
developed in Kosovo legislation.


New machinery, appliances and safety devices are required to be provided
with certifications in accordance with European standards and yet
requirements should be set for old machinery not provided with CE marking.


Kosovo legislation regarding mineral extracting activities does not set out
framework rules for all stages of mining processes. It is mainly focused on
access to extracting activities in terms of exploration and mining licenses,
permits for special operations, permit procedures, restricted activities with
respect to land use and planning, general commercial rights and royalties,
rather than health and safety. On the other hand in EU, currently there is not
actually a comprehensive legislation regulating the whole range of mining
activities with its different elements (eg prospecting, exploration, extraction,
closure, reclamation, liability). In particular mining legislation was extremely
different (eg procedure for granting and using authorisations) throughout EU
in last years due to historical reasons. European legislation is actually
influencing the mineral extracting industry and national mining laws not
much on a comprehensive basis but more on a sector basis, especially in the
areas of licensing/administrative procedures, health and safety and
environment. Strict Health and safety thresholds parameters are not set and
only general rules are reported in EU legislation. A set of EU Directives
(mainly on machinery, occupational exposure levels, vibrations, explosive
atmospheres, major hazard installations) do not deal specifically with mineral
extracting industry equipment but include it in their scope of application,
with specific provisions or exemptions taking into account requirements of
mineral extracting activities.


Resettlement and Social Issues
Overview
Many of the key tenets of The World Bank's OP 4.12 are partly covered by
current Kosovo law. These include:

·   The requirement to pay compensation in advance where land is
    compulsorily acquired (Draft Law on           Land Expropriation, Article 8,
    2007);
·   The need to compensate based on full market value or through grant of
    another land plot or building of equal quality, size and value (Draft Law
    on Land Expropriation, Chapter 4, Article 17, 2007) ;
·   The requirement to compensate for losses, whether temporary or
    permanent in production or damage to productive assets and crops and
·   Provision for pre-judicial avenues for resolution of disputes and rights of
    appeal.

The OP 4.12 principle of avoidance or minimization or resettlement is
addressed in article 70.4 of the land code, which stipulates that lands can be


ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA

withdrawn only for location of state, municipal or public facilities of high
importance. There are, however, three broad areas where the sponsor's or
borrower's obligation under WB OP 4.12 extends beyond those required
under Kosovo legislation.

·   Definitions
·   Resettlement planning and procedural requirements
·   Public consultation and participation of project affected communities
·   Extent of compensation and types of assistance to be offered
·   Categories of people eligible for compensation
·   Property measurement and income restoration


Definitions
Involuntary resettlement, within Kosovo law there is no clear definition of
involuntary resettlement and therefore no scope for the application of
mitigating instruments' such as Resettlement Action Plan or social
management plan, as required under international guidelines such as WB
OP4.12 and IFC PS 1 and 5, which clearly defines the scope of definition
which protects both the developer and those who are to be resettled.


Resettlement Planning and Procedural Requirements
There is presently no requirement to prepare a formal Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) under Kosovo law, nor to undertake any of the component
activities of a resettlement action plan such as, a `census', socio-economic
survey, consultation with project affected people, monitoring or reporting.
There are no specific references in the legislation to `involuntary resettlement'.
Core WB planning requirements such as the need for community
participation in the resettlement planning process and the requirement to
improve or enhance project affected people's living standards and income and
production levels, are not explicitly addressed in current legislation.


Legal Measures or additions to Kosovo legislation required to ensure
compliance with international best practice should include:

·   Provisions for consultation with potential project-affected people on
    feasible measures for resettlement and rehabilitation
·   Drafting and implementing a full public consultation strategy and
    disclosure plan before construction. Allocation of financial and human
    resources for consultation activities.
·   Carry out a scoping study as soon as possible to identify the need for a
    Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and/or a Land Acquisition Plan (LAP)
·   Assistance with Project Affected People's (PAP) transit costs must be
    offered and financed by the government or private entity who is
    responsible for the project and resettlement.
·   PAPs need to be informed of their rights to assistance and this needs to be
    explained clearly with supporting information and material, if
    appropriate.

Public Consultation and Participation
OP 4.12 specifies that project affected people should be informed about their
options and rights pertaining to resettlement and `...consulted on, offered
choices among, and provided with technically and economically feasible
resettlement alternatives; and provided with prompt and effective

ERM ­ ELC - CSA                               THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                        83

compensation at full replacement.'(Clause 6 (i), (ii)). Additionally, currently
there is no explicit consultation requirement in Kosovo law.


Legal Measures or additions to Kosovo legislation required to ensure
compliance with international best practice should include:

·   Information about the project should be disclosed as early as possible
·   Disclosure of project environmental and social information should be an
    integral part of the public consultation process, with information being
    provided about both benefits and disadvantages of the project
·   Information should be clearly presented in appropriate local languages
    and dialects and in modes that are sensitive to local communities
·   Information should be disclosed in locations that are open to the public
    and that are readily accessible to PAPs

Compensation Eligibility in Kosovo
The categories of people who must be compensated under Kosovo legislation
are narrower than those defined under OP 4.12 or IFC PS 5. Under the
legislation, the only people entitled to compensation are those with registered
property rights, and registered identity documentation. Within the Kosovo
context, these criteria could exclude some of the poorest and vulnerable
people, such as The Roma community, those returning to Kosovo post
conflict. Additionally there is no specific mention of compensation for
commercial businesses and loss of profit due to economic displacement. This
potentially precludes many categories of affected people that would be
entitled to compensation under WB Group policies. These categories would
include, in Kosovo:

·   Users who use land is on the basis of an informal agreement often with a
    relative or extended family member tenant farmers)
·   Owners who occupy land that was transferred by informal agreement
    from another owner
·   Owners who have not registered a change in ownership following a
    family death, marriage annulment or similar situation
·   Internally Displaced People (who have no rights to land)
·   People who make use of communal resources to which they have no
    formal title
·   Informal dwellers, such as The Roma community

OP 4.12 states that land, housing, infrastructure and other forms of
compensation should be provided to the adversely affected population,... OP
4.12 para 7 goes on to specifically state that `...the absence of legal title to
land by such groups should not be a bar to compensation' (Clause 7 Criteria
for Eligibility).


Displaced persons may be classified in one of the following three groups:

·   those who have formal legal rights to land (including customary and
    traditional rights recognized under the laws of the country)
·   those who do not have formal legal rights to land at the time the census
    begins but have a claim to such land or assets--provided that such claims
    are recognized under the laws of the country or become recognized
    through a process identified in the resettlement plan



ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                        84

·   those who have no recognizable legal right or claim to the land they are
    occupying. (Clause 15 (a), (b), (c))

Under the World Bank and IFC policies, the basic criterion for eligibility is to
be adversely or severely affected (physically or economically) by the project.
The World Bank defines `severely affected' as households who lose more than
10% of their landholding as a result of the project. People in this category
would be eligible for income restoration measures and rehabilitation
assistance. In practice, the compensation entitlement of different classes of
PAP will vary, for example, those with no legal title or claim to property will
only be compensated for loss of assets and not land. Additionally, the IFC's
PS 5 requires that people without legal title(squatters) are provided with
security of tenure in their new location.
The WB also singles out as requiring particular attention, what the policy
terms as `vulnerable groups' which are at particular risk in the resettlement
process. Vulnerable groups may include not only indigenous people and
ethnic minorities but also the elderly, the very poor, people with disabilities,
and female-headed households.


Legal Measures or additions to Kosovo legislation required to ensure
compliance with international best practice should include:

·   All users of land (including those with legal documents and those
    without) should be entitled to compensation for loss of land, structures
    and livelihoods. For illegal dwellers, compensation for loss of livelihood
    only is required.    All land users must be informed, in a timely and
    appropriate manner, of their rights and this should be monitored to
    ensure that eligible people are aware of their entitlements. Leaseholders
    and users should be entitled to reasonable compensation subject to
    evidence of use of the land for 2 years or more. Squatters should be

·   Scoping and preliminary census should identify those who are considered
    vulnerable.   Ongoing monitoring should be carried out to check for cases
    of hardship arising from the project.

    to the land but who use the land for lawful activities

·   Rehabilitation assistance will include, for example, free house plots or
    subsidised flats

Extent of Compensation and Resettlement Assistance
Under current legislation in Kosovo, compensation is payable for loss of land,
buildings, crops and other damages arising from the acquisition of land for a
project. Kosovo law on compensation allows only cash to be provided for
compensation and not compensation `in kind'. Nevertheless, since within
international guidelines, including the IFC's performance standard 5,
compensation in kind is recommended for agricultural communities, Kosovo
legislation should amend the law to reflect this recommendation.

Under the World Bank policies, compensation for lost properties is calculated
based on full replacement cost compensation should be equal to what enables
the PAP to restore their livelihood at the level prior to the resettlement.
Under the Kosovo law, compensation is equal to the market value of lost
properties. Theoretically, the two rules mean the same, in that full market
price is equal to the price at which land owners are willing to surrender the
property voluntarily in the open market, which should reflect the cost not
only of the productive value of the land but also that to restore livelihood. In
reality, however, the two can differ since not all PAPs may be aware of what
full replacement cost really means, and hence what is their entitlement. It is
therefore most important that i) the PAP are aware of their entitlements and
ii) the government and project sponsors clearly understand and agree that the
concept of full replacement cost will be used in projects for measurement of
properties.


In addition to compensation for losses of land and productive assets, OP4.12
requires that:

·    resettled people should be assisted with their move and supported during
     their transition period at the resettlement site; and,

·    assisted in their efforts to improve their former living standards, income
     earning capacity and production levels or at least to restore them.

Such assistance is not recognized under the Kosovo law as a responsibility of
the government or sponsoring agency. The WB policy notes that cash
compensation alone may not be adequate to restore lost production.
Other types of loss that are recognised under the WB policy as needing to be
addressed are loss of access to public services, customers and suppliers and
fishing, grazing and forest areas. The policy recognises that such losses
cannot be easily evaluated or compensated in monetary terms, but
emphasises the requirement for attempts to be made to establish access to
equivalent resources.


Legal Measures or additions to Kosovo legislation required to ensure
compliance with international best practice should include:

·    Adequate resettlement sites should be identified and be satisfactory to the
     project affected people


·    Compensation for properties should be at the replacement cost and should
     take account of depreciation.


·    Services such as privileged access to jobs in the project or preferential
     loans for small business start-up should be made available to those people
     identified as survey impacted by the project.

A community needs assessment should be carried out to identify the social
needs of heavily impacted people and communities

Report and to ensure compliance with World Bank/IFC requirements.

3      ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL BASELINE




3.1    APPROACH

       There are many tools used to describe and quantify the environment and the
       socio-economic issues of a specific area and these are constantly being revised
       and adapted to the needs of different users.


       In the present Report the Pressure- State- Response (PSR) Framework, which
       was accepted by many agencies in the early 1990s and is now widely used,
       will be adopted. The PSR Framework uses indicators in order to quantify and
       simplify phenomena and help understand complex realities.


       An indicator tells us something about changes in a system. Whether an
       indicator is useful or not is very much dependent on a particular context.
       Therefore, a careful selection process has been carried out in order to
       determine which indicators may be relevant in the given context in Kosovo.


       Indicators are selected to provide information about the functioning of a
       specific system, for a specific purpose, to support decision making and
       management. An indicator quantifies and aggregates data that can be
       measured and monitored to determine whether change is taking place. But in
       order to understand the process of change, the indicator needs to help
       decision makers to understand why change is taking place.


       There are several important points to bear in mind when using indicators:

           ·    Indicators should be chosen to represent key parameters to be
                measured for the purpose of measurement and implementing the
                desired changes. In order for indicators to be useful, good data needs
                to be collected so that changes in the indicators can be monitored and
                therefore it can be determined if the required changes are being
                obtained;

           ·    Performance measures imply that targets need to be set (i.e. something
                against which performance can be compared);

           ·    Different people living in different places have different values.
                Indicators must therefore be able to take into account different
                locations, people, cultures and institutions;

           ·    Sets of indicators evolve over time;

           ·    Sets of indicators are seldom, if ever, complete;

           ·    Measurement of indicators tends to reduce uncertainty, but does not
                eliminate it;

           ·    Indicators can play an important part in the way in which human
                influences on the environment operate. Changing the indicators will
                most likely also change the system.


       The OECD PSR framework (see Figure 3.1a) states that human activities exert
       pressures (such as pollution emissions or land use changes) on the


       ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                88

               environment, which can induce changes in the state of the environment (for
               example, changes in ambient pollutant levels, habitat diversity, water flows,
               etc.). Society then responds to changes in pressures or state with
               environmental and economic policies and programs intended to prevent,
               reduce or mitigate pressures and/or environmental damage.

Figure 3.1a    PSR Framework




               Indicators can be powerful tools to help identify and support PSR
               relationships, both at the reporting stage and subsequently during policy
               analysis. The aim of the present document is to identify environmental and
               socio-economic indicators useful to describe the present situation in the area
               of interest (mainly due to the existing KEK facilities), in order to compare it
               with the various proposed development alternatives and to identify the "most
               preferred" option with regard to environmental and social impacts.


               Table 3.1a shows the proposed indicators for environmental issues. The last
               column of the Table shows also if the available data are adequate to calculate
               each single indicator ("Y" meaning it was possible to make the calculation,
               "N" meaning it was not, "N/Y" meaning the available data are not adequate
               to quantify the indicator properly) in the present situation.


               The Table intends to provide a sort of summary of the environmental issues
               which have to be investigated further (the "Y" in the last column does not
               necessary mean that some evaluation is possible based on the existing
               information). The indicators considered refer to the following components:
               air, soil and groundwater, surface and wastewater, noise, waste, natural
               environment. Reportedly no radioactive materials are used in the mines and
               in the power plants as well as none were identified during the site visit.
               Moreover, concerning non-ionizing radiations, no issues are raised if electric
               lines and connections are properly designed. Therefore the component
               "Radiations" has not been considered.

              Table 3.1b shows the proposed indicators for socio-economic issues, which
              refer to the following components: demographics, economy, land use, water
              use, infrastructure, health, education, community attitudes.


              In developing socio-economic indicators we have taken into account the need
              to integrate, wherever possible, socio-economic and environmental issues.
              We have also considered the need to capture both qualitative and quantitative
              data. The PSR model has been taken into account for environmental issues,
              but, given its limitations in the area of socio-economic impacts, it has not been
              adopted as the `model' for the indicators to be used to monitor and
              characterise socio-economic impacts and outcomes.

         It is important to note that due to a number of circumstances, data was
         inadequate or unavailable for many of the selected indicators. Conclusions are
         thus based on available data and field observations. Where available,
         summary data tables are provided. Overall, there is a need for environmental
         monitoring equipment to be put in place at the mines and the plants, and
         plans made for such equipment at the proposed new developments. Issues
         requiring further investigation are discussed in detail in the following
         paragraphs.



3.2      FRAMEWORK


3.2.1    Area of Interest

         The area of interest for the proposed development (see Figures 3.2.1a and
         3.2.1b) includes Bardh and Mirash lignite mines, Kosovo A and Kosovo B
         lignite fired thermal power plants (TPP) and the disposal sites related to the
         TPPs and mines, which are located in the municipality of Obiliq, about 3 km
         SW from the city limit of Pristina. The proposed New Mining Field is situated
         north of the Bardh and Mirash mines.

Figure 3.2.1a    General Location of the Area of Interest




                 Figure 3.2.1b shows a more detailed location of the area of interest.


                 Topographical and Geographical Framework

                 The Kosova Coal Basin covers about 85 km from north to south with an
                 average east ­ west extension of 10 km. Hence the deposit comprises some 850
                 km². Morphologically the Kosova Coal Basin forms an extended valley where
                 the differences in elevation do not exceed 80 m. A central plane extends along
                 the river Sitnica followed by a more hilly terrain approaching the mountains
                 Çicavica Golesh and Sharr. The basin is surrounded by an elevated relief with
                 Kopaonik massive, Kozic, Zhegovc Lisic in the East, Montenegro massive in
                 the south and Çicavica, Golesh, Carnaleva as well as Sharr Mountains in the
                 west and north-west. The surrounding mountains reach elevations from 900
                 to more than 1,600 m.




                 ERM ­ ELC - CSA                              THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                        93

The area is located between the Sitnica River valley in the east, with elevations
of about +525 m above sea level, and a mountain chain extending north to
south, with elevations exceeding +750 m above sea level. To the west lies the
Drenica River valley, with elevations of about +550 m above sea level, and
Cicavice hill.
The power plants are located in a flat area.


The future mining field today forms a hilly surface with elevation from
typically +570 mMSL to +670 mMSL. Characteristic landmarks are a N-S
stretched hill with the village of Hade (up to +656 mMSL) and a range of hills
extending in E-W direction between Lajthishte and Shipitulla (up to +666
mMSL). Associated with these hills are valleys following N-S directions east
(down to +570 mMSL) and west (down to +550 mMSL) to the village of Hade
and the valley of the Sibovc river (about +560 mMSL) in the north following
SW-NE directions.


A portion of the municipalities of Fushe Kosova and Vushtrri falls into in the
area of interest. The land surrounding the mining area is mainly used for
agriculture, with only a few small forests in the northern part of the basin.


The most important activities in this area from an environmental point of
view are mining of lignite coal and power generation. Exploitation of the
lignite is carried out since almost 100 years and large-scale operation as it is
seen today with open cast mining and power generation has been going on
for about 40 years without much concern for the impacts on the environment.


Adjacent to the TTPA is located an old and abandoned industrial area where a
gasification plant and a facility producing fertilisers were operating until
more than 10 years ago.


The impact of the previous activities (gasification and fertilisers plants
included) is today seen as contaminated soil and infiltration of trace metals
and salts in the soils resulting in contamination of rivers and groundwater.
Hence, the current contamination of rivers and groundwater is not only
related to the current activities.


There is no other heavy polluting industry in the area and traffic is the only
other source of pollution ( the nearest industrial area is in Mitrovica about 30
km north-northwest of the site).



Socio-Economic Framework

There are 20 towns and villages in the area of interest. Most of them (towns of
Obiliq and Fushe Kosova and villages of Bardh, Grabovc i Poshtem, Hade,
Palaj/Crkvena Vodica, Lajthishte, Sibovc, Dardhishte, Shipitulle and
Plemetin) are located close enough to the existing mines and power plants
sites to be substantially affected by the environmental pollution that they
generate.

         In 2003/2004, due to an increased risk of slope failure, part of Hade village
         was resettled.


         The majority of the population in the area is Kosovo Albanian. The villages of
         Babimoc/Babin Most, Millosheve/Milosevo, Plemetin/Plemetina and
         Palaj/Crkvena Vodica are inhabited primarily by Kosovo Serbs and other
         non-Albanian ethnic minorities.


         Although an official census has not been conducted since 1981,the estimated
         population of Obiliq municipality is around 32,300. There are around 5,300
         inhabitants in town and 27,000 in the rural areas. The average population
         density is 304 persons per km² (higher than the Kosovo average of 193 per
         km²)1. The population density is variable from one settlement to the other.



3.2.2    Brief Description of Existing Facilities

         Korporata Energjetike e Kosovës (Kosovo Energy Corporation, KEK) has
         recently split into two joint associations, KEK J.S.C. and KOSTT J.S.C., as part
         of the process of moving from a publicly-owned enterprise to a joint stock
         company. The mines, TPPs and disposal sites are owned by KEK J.S.C; their
         installed capacity is 1,478 MW but overall effective capacity ranges from 645
         to 710 MW.

         The most important activities in the area are mining of lignite coal and power
         generation. Lignite has been mined here for nearly a century. Large-scale
         open cast mining operations and power generation have been in place for
         about 40 years, for most of that time with little concern for environmental
         impacts. Excavated overburden from initial surface mines was dumped
         outside the open cast mines, with seven dumps now surrounding the present
         mining area.

         Previous Figure 3.2.1b shows the layout of mines, power plants and disposal
         sites.


         Adjacent to the Kosovo A site, where the power plant continues to operate, is
         an abandoned industrial area where a gasification plant and fertilizer factory
         were in operation until 20 years ago. The impact of activities in the area
         (including the gasification and fertilizers plants) is seen today in
         contaminated soil and infiltration of trace metals and salts in the soils leading
         to pollution of rivers and groundwater.


         The following paragraphs present a brief description of the mines and the
         power plants. A full environmental assessment of KEK's existing generation
         and mining installations and facilities is presented in Annex A.

     3.2.2.1      Bardh and Mirash Mines Description

                  Mining operations are carried out in two surface mines, Bardh and Mirash,
                  which cover an area of approximately 9 km2 (see Figure 3.2.1b). Annual coal
                  production is currently around 7 million tons. Bardh and Mirash mines
                  supply Kosovo B andMirash alone supplies Kosovo A. Lignite is excavated by
                  bucket wheel excavators and transported by two belt conveyor lines
                  (transport capacity of 1,400 t/h - 33,000 t/day per belt) to the separation
                  plants. The lignite is deposited close to power plants, in open yards.


                  Both mines work in the same area with opposite advance directions. In 2005
                  restructuring measures became necessary because the two opencast mines of
                  Bardh and Mirash interconnected in increasing scale. Since then both opencast
                  mines have been developed as one mine. Nevertheless, the mines are called
                  further on by their original names. The first excavator was already set free and
                  was moved into the future field of Sibovc-SW (North of Bardh). Presently five
                  overburden lines are in operation in the mine complex, one of them in the
                  future mine.


                  The Bardh Open-Cast Mine (see Figure 3.2.2.1a) has an exploitation area at the
                  length of 2.5 km and width of 1.8 km, namely around 4.5 km2. The open-cast
                  mine has installed equipment with a lignite exploitation capacity of 8.2 x 106
                  t/year and 14 x 106 m3/year of overburden.

                  The Mirash Open-Cut Mine is located in a surface area of ca. 10.2 km2. The
                  design capacity of the mine is 8.6 x 106 t/year of lignite and 14x106 m3/year
                  of overburden.


                  Besides the overburden, the ash of both TPP's was dumped on outside dumps
                  for a long time. Only for TPP B the ash dumping has been changed to inside
                  spoiling in the residual hole of the former Mirash-East mine (see Figure
                   3.2.2.1b).

     3.2.2.2      Kosovo A and Kosovo B Power Plants Description

                  The power plants and the disposal sites are located in the municipality of
                  Obilic (see Figure 3.2.1b), about 3 km from the city of Pristina. The average
                  altitude is around 550 m above sea level.


                  Kosovo A has 5 units that were built in two phases (from 1962 to 1964 and
                  from 1970 to 1975). Kosovo B has 2 units built between 1983 and 1984. The
                  two power plants differ in terms of environmental impact due given their
                  differences in age and technology.


                  Installed and available net capacity of TTP A and TPP B is reported in the
                  following Table 3.2.2.2a together with used fuel and operation year.

                  Units of Kosovo A power plant do not work continuously due principally to
                  maintenance operations:


                      ·    A1 unit is rarely put into operation;

                      ·    A2 unit is out of service since a long time because of the failure of the
                           main transformer;

                      ·    A3 unit is presently working up to 125 MW because of damages in
                           boiler that do not allow pressure to reach the designed value;

                      ·    A4 unit was repaired and is capable of producing 125 MW;

                      ·    A5 unit is no more in function because part of the machinery has been
                           used to repair units A3 and A2.


                  During 2006 and 2007 in the units A3 and A4 the emergency reparation of
                  boilers and capital overhauls of the units has been carried out. Works are
                  undergoing with unit A5, they have been started in 2007 and will be
                  completed in 2008. Commercial operation is expected at the beginning of
                  April 2008.


                  Kosovo B consists of two units, B1 and B2, with thermal capacity of about 850
                  MWth each. Also Units of Kosovo B power plant do not work continuously
                  due principally to maintenance operations. In both units of Kosovo B during
                  2007 capital overhauls have been carried out.

                  Coal is sent by open belt conveyer from the mines to the separation plant and
                  then is distributed by internal belt conveyer systems.


                  Bottom ash (slag) and fly ash are produced in the combustion process in the
                  ration about 1:9. The quantities of ash produced depend mainly on the
                  content of non combustible materials in the lignite (soil).
                  Bottom ash and fly ash from Kosovo A (unit 1 and 2) is transported to the
                  disposal sites as slurry without re-circulation of the water.
                  Fly ash from other unites is dry-transported by air to a temporary storage at
                  the plants where is mixed with water and transported by belt conveyers to the
                  disposal site close to the power plants.
                  Particles of fly ash are typically between 30 µmm and 5 µmm.


                  Kosovo A has five stacks 100 m high, while Kosovo B has only one stack 182
                  meters high. Dust capture is provided by electrostatic precipitators in all
                  units. There is neither desulphurization nor denitrification in both Kosovo A
                  and Kosovo B.


                  The power plants are not provided with waste water treatment plants.


                  The water necessary to the plant to prepare process water is taken from the
                  Llapi river flowing nearby the power plant; when the river flow rate is too
                  low (in summer season) water is taken from the Iber Lepenc channel.
                  The solid residuals from water treatment are disposed together with ashes.
                  The installations are badly maintained.

3.3        ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE


3.3.1      Air


3.3.1.1    Pressure

           The main pressures on air in the study area are related to:


               ·    emissions from lignite mining activities;

               ·    emissions from lignite fired power plants;

               ·    emissions from ash disposal;

               ·    emissions related to traffic and heating systems, especially in Prishtina
                    and Obiliq.


           The Trepca mining/metallurgy complex is in Mitrovica, about 30 km north-
           northwest of the site. Around 20 km west of Prishtina and 10 km from the site
           is the Alferon/Feronikeli mine/smelter.


           Details on air emissions from mines and power plants are reported in Annex A
           (Environmental Assessment Report).




           Mine Activity Emissions

           Particulates are the main air emissions generated by the mines (see Figure
           3.3.1.1a). Coal dust from the active mining area is a large contributor to air
           pollution. According to the consultations conducted, the residents of Grabovc
           i Poshtem village are particularly affected by this, because of their close
           proximity to Sibovc South West mine. Residents of Dardhishte (located
           between Mirash mine and the ash dump at Kosovo A) have concerns about
           the impact of ash and particulate on their quality of life; please see Paragraph
           3.4.17 for further information. Furthermore, the unpaved roads in the mines
           are other sources, as well as excavators, trucks and the lignite smouldering
           fires. No measurements of air emission inside the mines are available.

Figure 3.3.1.1a   Ambient Air Pollution Caused by Mining




                  It can be assumed that dust/particulate matter and exhaust gases from the
                  fires are the major sources of air pollution inside the mines.


                  Fires due to spontaneous combustion of lignite (see Figure 3.3.1.1b) occur in
                  the slope system of the open pits from Mirash and Bardh, and more
                  sporadically, in excavation fronts and lignite storage piles. Lignite seams
                  ignite due to the oxidation of combustible sulphur, which in contact with the
                  atmospheric oxygen produces the heat energy needed for self-combustion.


                  Common methods used to prevent and combat coal fires are:

                          ·     Covering the lignite fires with soil or overburden material to restrict
                                oxygen supply;

                          ·     Excavating and isolating the burning material;

                          ·     Injection of chemical foams or other mixtures into the fractures to
                                extinguish the lignite fire by cutting off the oxygen supply;

                          ·     Fighting the fires with water.

Figure 3.3.1.1b   Self-Combustion




                  At KEK's mines, some isolated measures have been taken in order to stop
                  severe fires, such as local covering with overburden clay material or injection
                  of bentonite. However, there is no action plan to fight this problem so far.


                  Main environmental effects on air of lignite spontaneous combustion are:


                          ·     Greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. CO2, CH4, NOx, etc);

                          ·     Emission of toxic gases and their immission in the area such as CO,
                                N2O, SOx etc.


                  Air pollution is a health risk for workers and others living nearby the mines.
                  Residents of Dardhishte, Hade, Palaj and Grabovc i Poshtem are particularly
                  concerned about health issues that they associate with the mines and power
                  plants. Respiratory diseases are prevalent health complaints in these
                  communities (for further information please see Paragraph 3.4.12). During
                  project community consultations, residents have complained about the poor
                  air quality and effects of pollution (please see Paragraph 3.4.15). During the
                  winter, the smoke combined with the micro-climate conditions generates a
                  dense fog, which causes visibility problems.



                  Power Plants Emissions

                  Combustion of lignite in Kosovo A and Kosovo B power plants results in
                  emissions of:

                       ·    particulate;

                       ·    SO2 and NOx;

                   ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                 THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA

    ·    soot, CO and hydrocarbons from incomplete combustion; and

    ·    greenhouse gas CO2.


In Kosovo A there are 5 stacks each 100 meters high, while Kosovo B has a
single stack 182 meters high.
Electrostatic precipitators for the removal of solid particles are installed at
both power plants, but are functioning at far lower efficiencies than designed.
KEK personnel reported that, after the overhaul, dust emissions were reduced
to about 400-500 mg/m3 for Kosovo A and to 150 mg/m3 for Kosovo B, also
due to the fact that the power plants are operating not at full load.
There is no desulphurisation or denitrification process at either plant.


Odor is another concern in the villages close to the plants (please see
Paragraph 3.4.15 for more information about effect of smell on residents). No
odor measurement is available.



Emissions from Ash Disposal

At Kosovo A, ash handling is hydraulic for two of the units (A1-A2) and
mechanical, using conveyor belts, for the other three (A3-A5): the ash is
carried to ash dumps located in the direct vicinity of the plant.
The system has been in operation for over 40 years and is in poor condition;
particulate emission rates are high and have a serious impact on the
environment. Particulate pollution occurs at all operation points, at the
bunkers, along the belt conveyors, at the discharge points, and during the
dumping and levelling process.



Traffic and Heating System Emissions

At present, there is limited information on the number or type of motor
vehicles in the area. Data on the heating systems, both district heating and
household oil/coal/wood fired heating systems is also poor. Therefore, it is
not possible at present to accurately estimate the impact from these types of
emissions on air quality in the area.


Motor vehicles in Kosovo are generally quite old, class of emission Euro 1 to
Euro 3. As a consequence, specific emission rate per vehicle should be quite
high. Nevertheless, the impact of traffic emissions on the air quality of the
interested area should be negligible: most of the traffic is concentrated in
Pristina, more than 3 km far from the boundary of the area interested by the
development, and traffic emissions influence significantly air quality up to
about 500 m from emission sources.


Although Termokos during heating season burns heavy quantity of oil
(around 15,000 tons), due to the distance of the area from Pristina, emissions
from the heating system should also not impact significantly the area.

                 Emissions of Greenhouse Gasses


                 Mines

                 There is no emission monitoring at the mines, therefore the respective air
                 emissions can only be estimated. Carl Bro EA Report (2002) estimated that
                 about 2.5 million tons of lignite are burned annually and affect an area of
                 about 1 km2, producing about 1,743,000 t of CO2 and about 423,000 t of CH4.


                 It has to be taken into account that the greenhouse effectiveness of methane,
                 produced during lignite self combustion, is approximately 21 times higher
                 than the one of carbon dioxide, and that the CH4 annual emissions from coal
                 self-burning would be only 6.4 times lower than the total CH4 emissions in
                 Germany.



                 Power Plants

                 Calculation performed by KEK Environmental Department on CO2 emissions
                 (t/year) from Kosovo A and B for the period 2003-2006, as reported in KEK
                 Environment Report 2006, are presented in the following Table 3.3.1.1a.

                 The CO2 emission indicator, as reported by KEK, is considered quite reliable:
                  these emissions are calculated from total lignite used and according to lignite
                  composition measurements carried out on a regular basis. The method used
                  for the calculation is not known.


                  Less reliable appear the emission calculations of CO2 and CH4 from mines.
                 These evaluations are based on assumptions not clearly detailed.



                 Emissions of CO, SO2, NOx, Particulate

                 No measurements of emissions from the mines are available. Reportedly, in
                 the past one complaint has been filed by the population of Grabovc, West of
                 the Mines, relating to dust emissions due to the operation of the mine.

                  A monitoring plan for air emissions (including NOx, SOx and particulate) from
                  both Kosovo A and Kosovo B power plants is available but is not carried out
                  due mainly to limited budget availability.


                  The air emissions for the power plants have been calculated based on fuel
                  characteristics and combustion process parameters (Stein methodology for
                  SOx and particulate).
                  Kosovo B power plant is provided with equipment for online monitoring of
                  particulate; nevertheless measuring equipment is neither calibrated nor
                  properly maintained. Monitored values are compared with calculated values.


                  In summary there is practically no monitoring at the stacks. INKOS, the
                  research and development institute of the Kosovo Electricity Company (KEK),
                  is responsible for monitoring the plants' environmental pollution. However,
                  INKOS does not have sufficient equipment to carry out its responsibilities
                  adequately.
                  An efficient monitoring system is needed to obtain accurate measurements.


                  No emergency plan to be adopted in case of threshold limits exceedances is
                  available.


                  No reliable data are available for Kosovo A and B emissions. Some indicative
                  estimates are presented in Table 3.3.1.1b.

                  Kosova A units have been designed for a maximum particulate emissions of
                  560 mg/Nm3. Nevertheless, at the current lignite quality and maintenance of
                  electrostatic precipitators, the emission levels at Kosovo A power plant are
                  higher. KEK personnel reported that, after the overhaul, dust emissions were
                  reduced to about 400-500 mg/m3 for Kosovo A and to 150 mg/m3 for Kosovo
                  B, also due to the fact that the power plants are operating not at full load.


                  Elektrowatt-Ekono carried out emissions measurements on both lines of
                  electrostatic precipitators of Kosovo B1 boiler in October 2005.

                  The report of EAR "Prefeasibility Study of pollution mitigation measures at
                  Kosovo B Power Plant" presents the following remarks about dust emissions:
                  "During the site visit the continuous measurements showed values of about 510 - 520
                  mg/m3 in the control room, but the newly installed measuring equipment at Kosovo B
                  unit B2 was said not to be calibrated and to be wrongly installed (vibrations).
                  The results of the dust emission measurements of unit B1 in October 2005 were 526 -
                  577 mg/Nm3 (dry gasses, standard conditions, 6 % O2). The dust emissions from unit
                  B2 could not be measured as the unit was being repaired during the measuring period.



                  As the ESP of unit B2 has been reconstructed recently it is likely that the dust
                  emissions from this unit are at least somewhat lower.

With the calculated consumption of lignite and air the emissions of dust from Kosovo
B in the year 2002 Carl Bro Group (2003) calculated the dust emissions as follows:
                                        Kosovo B
                             Unit B1     Unit B2      Total
                               2 218 t     2 109 t     4 327 t
                           250 mg/m3 250 mg/m3          n/a


Much lower values were reported by KEK. As the dust emissions of unit B1 were
measured to be more than double that of the estimated emissions in the table above it
can be concluded, that the total dust emissions of Kosovo B are currently most likely
significantly higher than the amounts calculated by Carl Bro Group in 2003.
The annual quantity particulate matter emissions from Kosovo B are significant and
dust also forms a significant health problem for the workers at the plant."


According to the European Union (EU) Large Combustion Plants (LCP)
directive1, the emissions limits set for existing power plants above 500 MWth
for particulate, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are as
presented in Table 3.3.1.1f; emission limits for CO are not defined in the LCP
directive.

                  The Kosovo Administrative Instruction on "The Rules and Standards of the

                  values by stationary sources, methods and frequencies of air monitoring.
                  The Administrative Instruction is under approval at the Assembly of Kosovo.


                  The temporary threshold values (ELV) for large combustion plants using solid
                  fuel are set in Article 90. Different emission limit values are fixed based on the
                  following categories of heating power:


                       ·   from 50 MW to 100 MW;

                  range 400 (500 MW) and 2000 (100 MW).
                  2The right values for TPP A is to be defined based on linear progression in the
                  range 450 (500 MW) and 800 (50 MW).


                  Based on the Administrative Instruction, TPP A and TPP B shall draw up
                  appropriate programs for the progressive reduction of air emissions (SO2,
                 NOx and particulate) not later than 31 March 2008. Criteria of cooperation to
                 prepare the "Program for efficient reduction" will be set up by MESP.


                  Furthermore, both power plants, in relation to plans for pollution reduction,
                  are obligated to fulfil EU air emission standards before 31 December 2007.


                  In summary, Kosovo A and Kosovo B after 1 January 2008 will not be
                  compliant to the LCP-directive and other international limits and will have to
                  identify a road map to reduce their emissions.



                  Pressure Indicators ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

                  The emission values are estimated through balances, therefore they give an
                  idea of the real situation, but need to be better defined implementing an
                  efficient monitoring system.


                  Nevertheless, the data available, while incomplete, demonstrate the heavy
                  pressures on the environment:


                      ·    SO2, NOx and particulate emissions are not in compliance with current
                           EU standards and no efficient abatement systems are currently in
                           place;

                      ·    uncovered ash dumps at both Kosovo A and Kosovo B and mine
                           operations at Kosovo A constitute an extremely heavy source of
                           particulate emissions, which is further aggravated in case of strong
                           winds and dry periods. Mitigation measures are completely lacking.


                  Based upon the above, it may be concluded that:


                  ·   an air emission reduction program should be prepared and implemented
                      for Kosovo A and B;

                  ·   ash should be disposed of using hydraulics rather than mechanical
                      systems all locations to reduce dust;

                  ·   the slopes of the ash dumps should be flattened and vegetation
                      established, to prevent further particulate emissions.

                  Climate

                  The Kosovo basin is characterized by continental climate with dry and warm
                  summers and variable winter temperatures depending on the influence of
                  high-pressure systems from Siberia or low-pressure ones from the Atlantic
                  Ocean.


                  The average annual temperature is about +10°C. For the years 1979 to 1991 the
                  range of temperatures is shown in the following Figure 3.3.1.2a with minimum
                  temperatures in January and maximum in July. Lowest temperature ever

                  The Hydro-Meteorological Institute of Kosovo produced a study in 1999
                  showing the monthly average precipitation for a period of 25 years. The
                  Institute provided also monthly values for the years 1979 to 1995. By adding
                  values for the years 2001 to 2004 this data base was widened to cover a period
                  of 25 years (1979 ­ 2004). The data base was completed by an existing
                  evaluation for the period 1948 to 1978.
                  The average annual precipitation is about 600 mm. Minimum precipitation is
                  described by the 1990 data at 372 mm. Using monthly values maximum
                  annual precipitation was recorded at 1010 mm in the year 1995. A higher
                  value of 1028 mm has been presented by Rudarski Institute (1985) but the year
                  of appearance is lacking in the document.


                  The following Figure 3.3.1.2d shows the variation of average monthly
                  precipitation. Statistically precipitation is rather evenly distributed with lower
                  values from January to March and higher values throughout summer and
                  autumn.

Figure 3.3.1.2d   Long-Term Variation of Monthly Precipitation




                  The range of monthly precipitation can be described on the basis of values
                  recorded from the years 1979 until 2004. The average monthly precipitation is
                  56 mm. The following Figure 3.3.1.2e shows the range of possible monthly
                  precipitation. For example within the month of August a minimum of 5 mm
                  (year 1992) was recorded versus a maximum of 184 mm (year 2002). The
                  Figure also shows that more than 80 mm of precipitation per month are
                  possible all over the year.

                  As discussed above, Kosovo A and B power plants (mainly when electrostatic
                  precipitators are not working properly), ash dumping operations, the mines
                  and ash dumps are today the largest sources of air pollution in Kosovo,

                  although the current poor air quality is also affected by private traffic (Euro 0
                  and Euro1 cars), private heating and seasonal burning of dry farm land.


                  Two air quality monitoring stations are present and were functioning in 2006:
                  the first in Obiliq city and the second at the INKOS Institute near Kosovo A.

                  (2)PM10 (particulates smaller than 10 micrometer) are fine particulates and the fractions of
                  particulates that are particularly harmful for public health. Soot has to be read as PM10 in
                  former Yugoslavia methodology. The annual average standard is 30/50 µg/m3, according to
                  former Yugoslavia legislation, and 50/100 µg/m3, according to WB Guidelines. EU standards
                  have an annual average limit of 40 µg/m3 and a daily limit of 50 µg/m3 not to be exceeded
                  more than 35 days per year.


                  Compared to air quality standards, the situation recorded at the monitoring
                  stations does not appear critical. Nevertheless, not all relevant parameters are
                  recorded and the reliability of the recorded values is uncertain. Other air
                  quality measurements, reported from other sources, indicate that the situation
                  is even worse. However, not enough information is available about the
                  reliability and details of these measurements.



                  Air quality monitoring activity carried out in June 2007 in the sole Kastriot
                  monitoring station, reported the following average concentrations:

                      ·    SO2: 24.36 g/m3;

                      ·    Soot: 6.7 g/m3.


                  The KEK Environmental Report also contains information on particulate
                  deposition rates from two locations: the first close to the separation facility
                  and the second at Bardh mine.

                  presented in mg/(m2d). Sediment samples are used to determine total dust
                  and soluble and insoluble matters. Sediments are analysed in:

                  At the separation facility, the deposition rate consistently exceeds (in both
                  years) the limit of 300 mg/m2d set by former Yugoslavia and WHO legislation
                  (see Table 3.3.1.2k). At Bardh mine, the situation is slightly better but still
                  critical: no exceeding for total deposition recorded in 2005, but values
                  exceeded the limits for three months in 2006, even if the average annual value
                  remains below the limit. Also pH limits are exceeded.

                  State Indicators ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

                  Climate
                  Climatological data are scarce and only few are routinely recorded.
                  Monitoring stations maintenance program is not known.


                  No data are available on atmospheric stability classes, statistics on wind
                  direction or intensity or on temperature gradient; pollutant dispersion
                  parameters therefore cannot be calculated.


                  New monitoring stations for meteorological parameters are needed and
                  existing ones should be improved through installation of radiometers to
                  measure solar radiation and temperature gradient, in order to be able to
                  reconstruct stability classes.


                  The available data indicate that the prevailing wind comes from the N-NE.
                  This means that villages more affected by air pollution are those located S-SW
                  from Kosovo A and Kosovo B power plants, ash dumps and mine operating
                  front.


                  Air Quality
                  Air quality data is limited and unsystematic. There is no data on NOx
                  concentrations, for example.
                  Information on data collection methodology and equipment maintenance
                  programs was unobtainable, making the available data difficult to interpret.
                  That said, the information available shows that air quality in the area is likely
                  not in compliance with EU standards.


                  Particulate deposition measurements indicate heavy particulate pollution
                  although soot concentrations appear to be below former Yugoslavia limits.


                  An air quality monitoring network, including continuous monitoring
                  equipment, should be established as soon as possible (see Section 6) in the
                  area of interest.

           In summary, although data are not complete and further work is necessary to
           better quantify the air quality problems around the site, it appears evident
           that particulate pollution is the main problem to be solved around mines and
           power plants.



3.3.2      Soil and Groundwater


3.3.2.1    Pressure

           The existing KEK facilities, as all industrial sites, represent a pressure on the
           environment, mainly in terms of occupied land and contamination of soil and
           groundwater and water abstraction.



           Groundwater Abstraction

           Presently no water abstraction wells are reportedly operated by the mines and
           the power plants. On the contrary there are some underground private wells
           used by the settlements of Shipitullë, Grabovc, Sibovc, Hamidi, Kozaricë,
           Bajmoc and Breznicë. The indicator "Groundwater abstraction" will not be
           calculated, since the project will not increase groundwater abstraction.



           Landslides

           Coal fires and mine activity may cause landslides and land subsidence in the
           affected area. Presently, there are no investigations about the extent of coal
           fires and their influence in reported landslides and the risks of subsidence in
           the deposit area, therefore the indicator "Landslides" cannot be calculated.


           The recent Inception Report of the work "Site Investigation,
           Technical/Organizational Planning and Determination of Environmental Impact
           Assessment and Preparation of Environmental Management Plans Contract 4075 /
           23.07.07" (shortly Kosovo A site investigation) indicates the possibility of slides
           in the Kosovo A ash dump site, with possible consequence for workers and
           environmental damages.


           Occupied Land

           In mining activities, as a result of removal of solid materials for unveiling
           lignite layers, a large surface area of land is covered and degraded: the solid
           material is distributed in several areas, in a form of landfills, which are often
           called overburden dumps.


           Figure 3.3.2.1a gives an idea of the land occupied by existing KEK facilities.
           The areas degraded by overburden and ash cover an area of around 300
           hectares.

                  In particular, the largest surfaces are occupied by:

                       ·    Bardh open-cast mine, which has an exploitation area at the length of
                            2.5 km and width of 1.8 km and covers an area of approximately 4.5
                            km2;

                       ·    Mirash open-cast mine, which is located in a surface area of
                            approximately 10.2 km2. In this area is also comprised the Mirash_East
                            dumping area where, beside the overburden dumping, Kosovo B
                            power plant ashes are disposed of;

                       ·    the South and West Overburden dumps, which cover more or less 6.5
                            km2. The surface of the dump is more or less revegetated with a lot of
                            sinks that are often water filled;

                       ·    the other overburden dumps, which cover more or less 9 km2;

                       ·    TTP A landfill with overburden, which occupies an area of
                            approximately 240 ha;

                       ·    TPP B landfill occupies 55 - 60 ha.


                  Minor areas are occupied by the plants:

                       ·    Kosovo A and Kosovo B power plants;

                       ·    Gasification plant (no more in use), situated adjacent to TPP A, which
                            covers an estimated area of roughly 102 ha;

                       ·    Fertilizer plant (no more in use), situated adjacent to TPP A.


                  Sources of Soil and Groundwater Contamination

                  Both groundwater and soil are most likely contaminated around mines and
                  power plants.



                   ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                 THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                            124

Underground mining of the lignite was performed in a period from
approximately 1922 to 1966 (STEAG 2006). Remains of old underground
mining are situated in the south-eastern part of the Sibovc field, connected
with the old mining structures, which are currently exposed along the coal
cuts in Mirash West and on the Mirash northern slope, and underneath the
ash dump of TPP A (STEAG 2006).


The gasification and fertilizer plants, which were in operation close to Kosovo
A site until more than 10 years ago, represent a special problem.
The occurrence of phenol deposits derived from the gasification plant have
been described in several studies: quantities of phenol/water (about 15,000
m3) and concentrated phenol (about 1,000 m3) are stored at the gasification site
with potential signs of leaching, but the quantities are reported small.


Reportedly condensates as PAH and Phenols of the gasification plant were
dumped in the old underground mining galleries. The tar-like substance is
hardened on the surface only, underneath the substance is viscous and
degasses. The spatial distribution of this material is not sure up to now
(VEM/DMT 2007).


Presently no monitoring results are available, but the groundwater in the area
is most likely contaminated with phenols from this plant and oils (probably
from gas production) and other contaminants from the fertilizer plant. The
contamination of soil is visible all over the area and no actions have been
taken so far to remove it.


At present, several heavy oil waste (tar) ponds have been identified in the ash
dump sites of Kosovo A power plant.


Reportedly, the tar originating from the old oil gasification plant (about 1-2
m3/d) was daily discharged in the ash dump of Kosovo A.


In mining activities, as a result of removal of top soil and other layers
covering the lignite deposits, large areas of land are covered with these
materials ("overburden") and have degraded. The materials have been
distributed in several areas, in the form of heaps, which are often called
"overburden dumps."

A "Site Investigation, Technical and Organisational Planning and
Determination of Environmental Impact" was initiated in July 2007 as part of
the Clean up and Land Reclamation Project (CLRP), which is intended to
identify the extent of contamination and improve the environment around
and in the KEK mines and power plants, by reducing particulate emissions
from the existing Kosovo A ash dump.


Final goal of the project is to reclaim the ash landfill area of Kosovo A power
plant. Three alternatives have been examined: the first foresees the ash
relocation to exhausted existing mine, the second the relocation to an
identified Sitnica field area and the third a redistribution of ash at the ash
dump area. The third alternative seems at the moment the most probable.

The CLRP includes the following main investigation activities on the ash
dumps/overburden and surrounding areas:


-   geological exploration including drilling of 16 new boreholes; the
    additional 163 boreholes already drilled in the surrounding area of ash
    dump were also analysed to improve the interpretation results for the
    dump area;
-   geo-mechanical laboratory analysis of the soil samples taken;
-   geochemical analysis on soil samples;
-   chemical analyses on,new boreholes and open pits located downstream of
    ash dumps TPP A, water discharge from Mirash East existing mines;
    groundwater quality in the quaternary deposit and water samples from
    private wells in the nearby villages.

                  Field investigations at the central part of the dump reported clearly that,
                  besides the ashes, also hydrocarbons were dumped, which obviously derived
                  from the gasification plant. Those materials, which appear similar to tar, can
                  be found either on the surface of the dump either filled into unsealed basins

(with floor spaces of more than 100 m²) or brought into especially erected
drilled boreholes.


In the area around the nearby Dragodan overburden dump as well as at the
ash dump close to Kosova A, many illegal garbage dumpsites were found
containing municipal waste, building waste, other wastes from power plants,
old rubber belts, metal scrap, etc.


The geochemical analysis included analysis of soil samples taken at different
depths (from 0.50 to 80 meter) in 11 new boreholes for the detection of pH,
calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and metals. Referring to Italian
regulations on threshold values for soil quality, the analysis found several
exceedances for some metals, especially Hg and Cr, and limited exceedances
for Ni and Cd.


To the west of the ash dump, some 200 meters from the village of Dardhishte,
a former ventilation shaft has been used for dumping tar and phenol
residuals. This same practice has taken place at other former underground
mines. Moreover, the open dumps do not have adequate lining or other soil
protection devices and no mitigation measures are in place to avoid storm
water runoff contamination.



The water sampling of groundwater and free surface water included the
detection of BTEX, PAH and metals and reported exceedences of Benzene in
groundwater samples downstream ash dump, probably due to the presence of
tar-like by-products in the ash dumps and a limited exceedence of As.


Exploration drillings, carried out to identify the presence of hydrocarbons
inside the ash or inside the soil and groundwater, did not detect any
additional pollution.


Another source of possible soil and groundwater contamination is the ash
landfill of Kosovo B power plant: the disposal areas do not have any
structural protection against pollution of surface or groundwater and it is
obvious that harmful substances infiltrate to the groundwater and/or flow to
the river Sitnica.


INKOS has newly established monitoring points around the disposal sites.
Some monitoring results are shown in Paragraph 3.3.3.1, Table 3.3.3.1b. The
groundwater points are namely P2, Pa, Pb, Pc and Pd. Trace elements were not
analysed. Anyhow, the results show values of suspended solids and KMnO4
very high, even higher than the allowed surface water values.


A detailed mapping of the site, systematic soil and groundwater sampling
and analyses are urgently required.

                  Reference Legislation

                  As far as soil quality is concerned, no regulatory requirement has been yet set
                  up at the European level. In response to concerns about the degradation of
                  soils in the EU, the European Commission published in April 2002 a
                  Communication "Towards a Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection". This
                  Communication outlined the first steps that lead to the development of a
                  Thematic Strategy to protect soils in the European Union. The strategy is one
                  of seven 'thematic strategies' foreseen under the EU's 6th Environment Action
                  Programme.


                  The Directive 80/68/EEC on the protection of groundwater is aimed at
                  preventing the pollution of groundwater by substances belonging to the
                  families and groups of substances in lists I or II in the Annex. Member States
                  shall prevent the introduction into groundwater of substances in list I and
                  limit the introduction into groundwater of substances in list II so as to avoid
                  pollution of this water by these substances. List I includes those substances
                  with high risk of toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation (such as mercury,
                  cadmium, mineral oils and hydrocarbons, cyanides, carcinogenic substances,
                  etc.), while List II contains substances, which could have a harmful effect on
                  groundwater (such as zinc, copper, nickel, chrome, lead, selenium, arsenic,
                  biocides, etc.).


                  A number of EU members have issued standard limits for soil and
                  groundwater contamination (Germany, Italy, France, etc.), some of them have
                  chosen a more risk-assessment approach (e.g. the UK and recently Italy).


                  Italian standards set for key parameters for soil (both for residential and
                  industrial land use) and for groundwater are reported as a reference in the
                  following Table 3.3.2.1a. The meaning of the limit is: after some exceeding of
                  the represented limits is discovered, according to a well established sampling
                  procedure, a risk analysis is necessary and, after that, the remediation to the
                  extent that risk analysis outcome deems necessary.

agricultural land and quality of water for irrigation. Suggested values are
similar to the Italian ones.


No WB Guidelines are available for soil.


Pressure Indicators ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

The main potential sources of soil and groundwater contamination identified
include:


     ·   Wet or dry deposition of air pollutants from the power plants,
         particulate from mining activity and from the ash dumps; previously
         there was also pollutant deposition from the gasification and fertilizer
         plants;

     ·   leakages of oily substances and other chemicals, in particular at the
         former gasification and fertilizer plant sites;
     ·   past dumping of chemicals in former underground mines;
     ·   past and current waste dumping at the ash dumps, in particular at the
         Kosovo A ash dump and in the old mine (municipal waste landfill);
         and

     ·   past and current discharge of untreated wastewater effluents in rivers
         that is a likely source of sediment contamination in the Sitnica river.


With regard to the deposition of air pollutants, land degradation is likely
related to chemical variation of surface soil composition although not enough
information is available.


No information about composition of the ash dump at Kosovo B is available.
It is likely that it contains other types of solid waste, such as old tires and
other industrial residues. The ash dump is often flooded. This condition has
likely caused contamination of Sitnica sediments. Kosovo B ash dump
generates substantially less particulate than Kosovo A but limited data is
available on local groundwater conditions. A survey is needed. Detailed
mapping of the site, systematic soil and groundwater sampling and analyses
are urgently required.



No information about soil contamination at the old gasification and fertiliser
plants is available.

The investigation found hot spots with a high level of phenolic residuals,
phenolic waters and tars in the Kosovo A ash dump, although the dump was
not used on a regular basis for dumping of these materials. Two basins on top
of the mid-part of the Kosovo A ash dump and some drill holes beside one of
these basins have been identified as dumping areas. The total amount of these
residuals is very limited and they supposedly seem to be acceptably
contained. The ash stored at the ash dump contains elevated levels of heavy
metals, but due to the chemical composition of the ash the potential for
leaching processes is limited. Elevated levels for some heavy metals were also
found at the overburden dumps but these were similar to those found
naturally in the area.
While results of the study indicated contaminated groundwater, there was no
clear connection to the waste materials from the ash dump. Polluted mining
galleries also may pose a serious risk to local groundwater systems and wells,
but this requires further investigation.

In summary ash dumps are probably mixed with different type of waste and
particularly ash dump of Kosovo A is contaminated with tar and phenolic
water coming from the old gasification plant. The open dumps are not
provided with adequate lining/soil protection devices and no mitigation
measures are in place to avoid storm water runoff contamination. This
situation is likely to have led to soil and groundwater contamination. Further
more soil of old fertilizer and gasification plant is likely to be contaminated
and a survey is necessary to identify contamination extent.


To prevent existing ash dumps to continue to contaminate groundwater a
solution (to be confirmed after a risk analysis) could be flanks stabilisation
and a capping with final vegetation and possible relocation only of identified
hot spots.
In particular measures suggested in the above mentioned Kosovo A site
investigation should initiate. At the same time an accurate survey at the TPP B
ash dump and at the gasification and fertiliser plant areas should be carried
out and the state of contamination of existing ground water wells in the area
should be verified.


The underground of the old fertilizer and gasification plant is likely to be
contaminated. Under the CLRP a survey is scheduled to start in 2008 to
identify contamination extent.

Also under the CLRP, investments for remediation works at Kosovo A ash
dump and overburden dumps have been included in a draft final design
(April 2008). After formal approval, the proposed measures for reshaping,
partial removal of unstable parts, coverage and re-vegetation should provide
an adequate solution against particulate generation, possible
soil/groundwater pollution and contamination of runoff water.

3.3.2.2    State

           Geology

           Kosovo geology is varied and its evolution over time has been dictated by its
           location in an active tectonic zone. That tectonic activity has seen the
           formation and subsequent closure of an oceanic basin, leading to the
           development and preservation of a variety of economically exploitable
           mineral deposits.

           The basement of the Kosovo Basin and the exposed surrounding areas are
           built up by Palaeozoic to Mezozoic crystillane rocks (see Figure 3.3.2.2a).
           The basin fill consists of Upper Cretaceous strata which are unconformably
           overlain by Tertiary clays in which lignite is interbedded.


           Towards the West the lignite deposition is tectonically bounded by a series of
           predominantly NNW-SSE striking faults. The eastern limit is characterized by
           sedimentological pinch-out.


           The Palaeozoic formations are mainly build up by marble and schists. The
           schist is composed of grey coloured shale, phyllites, phyllites mica-shale,
           quartzite, quartzite-phyllites and rare amphibolite shale.
           The crystalline series outcrop in the western periphery of the basin and are
           extending from the River Brusnik to Shipitulla, whilst the outcrops in the
           eastern periphery reach from Grabovc southward up to Ferizaj and Nerodime.
           In the northern section of the eastern periphery, near the region of the River
           Llap strike outcrops of andesite and dacite occur, submerge in the region near
           Mitrivica and appear again on the surface in the eastern part of this town.
           Most of the Palaeozoic succession within the frame of the Kosovo Basin are
           build up of crystalline limestones, which are tectonically stressed, and
           therefore, their origin is difficult to determine.
           Within the western part of the basin, the crystalline limestones appears as
           intermediate lenses, which are sometimes silicated, and therefore, difficult to
           distinguish from phyllites quartzite.


           The lower part of the Mesozoic section consist of serpentinite and peridotite. It
           is covered by Upper Cretaceous flysch and limestone. The outcrops of
           serpentinite are located in the western section of the Kosovo Basin, creating
           the Lubovec-Galicë and the Golesh Massives. Towards the south, there are
           some further areas which show Serpentinite, but in these areas within a frame
           of rudist limestone, flysch and shale. The quantity of serpintinite outcrops
           decreases eastbound.
           Uppermost Cretaceous Flysch and limestones crop out within a NNW-SSE
           oriented area along the main bounding faults of the Kosovo Basin.


           Besides the already mentioned clay and lignite deposits, Tertiary volcanic
           rocks from the Miocene and Quaternary unconsolidated sediments as sands
           and gravel are present within the Cenozoic.

                  The Tertiary volcanites (andesite-dacite rocks) are distributed in Northeast of
                  the basin (Kopaonik-Trepça zone).
                  The Pliocene sediments can generally be subdivided in coal
                  productive/unproductive areas:

                       ·    Southern area unproductive

                       ·    Northern area unproductive

                       ·    Central area productive


                  The central area, the "Coal Kosovo Basin" (limits are marked in red in Figure
                   3.3.2.2a), is spreading out at a surface of approximately 300 km². Simplified,
                   the succession can be subdivided as follows:

                       ·    Bottom Series (green Clay)

                       ·    Coal Series (Lignite Formation)

                  An hydrogeological study has been carried out in the frame of the "Site
                  Investigation, Technical/Organizational Planning and Determination of
                  Environmental Impact Assessment and Preparation of Environmental
                  Management Plans (CLRP)". The Project area includes ash dump TPP A and
                  outside dumps South, Kalaja, Lugu I Thell and Vasilev, located to the South-
                  West of TPP A site and existing Mirash/Bardh mines.


                  The scheme of a representative hydrogeological section in the area of interest
                  is reported in the following Figure 3.3.2.2d.

                  As reported in the "Complementary Mining Plan for Sibovc SW - Part III ­
                   Environmental Assessment" (European Agency for Reconstruction, STEAG
                  Consortium, 2006) and summarized in the following, the hydrogeological
                  situation of the area is defined by three main hydrogeological layers. The
                  basis is represented by an aquiclude (low permeability) formed by the "green
                  clay" consisting of clay and silt with a general thickness of more than 100m. In
                  general, the overlaying lignite having a thickness up to 70m has a low
                  permeability but, due to fissures and cracks within the lignite, groundwater
                  can circulate in the lignite layers, which are therefore recognized as an
                  aquifer.
                  Above the coal follows the overburden mainly consisting of silt and clay with
                  partial presence of sand and gravel layers. Embedded layers with masses of
                  snail shells are characteristic. Locally the "grey clay" changed its appearance
                  to "yellow clay" as a result of oxidation of the iron content within the
                  material. The clay material generally behaves like an aquiclude but because of
                  fissures and cracks reaching depths of 10 m to 15 m from the surface water
                  can penetrate the rock. Hence groundwater appears either when the fissures
                  are dug up by excavation or where those fissures are connected to better
                  permeable layers within the clay such as the snail shell layers or gravel layers.
                  Therefore the hydraulic conductivity of the layer depends on the locally
                  presence of clay and fissures.


                  The "yellow clay" horizon is frequently used to supply houses and smaller
                  villages with water, e.g. in the village of Hade and in the valley west of
                  Lajthishte.
                  Information about the spreading of yellow clay strata can be given using a
                  map presented by Rudarski Institut (1985) which shows the elevation of the

                  bottom of yellow clay for the area west of Hade village (see Figure 3.3.2.2e).
                  The map gives an impression about the altitude of the basis of yellow clay.
                  The bottom generally follows the surface with the alteration zone reaching
                  down to 12 m depth. This again pleads for weathered grey clay with the
                  precipitation leading to oxidization of the iron content within the soil forming
                  the typical yellow color. The elaboration furthermore shows that at least in
                  September 1985 a groundwater level was observable with groundwater
                  covering up to 10 m of the yellow clay. It can be suggested that these facts can
                  be found in other areas as well, where Pliocene clay reaches near the surface.
                  The observed water levels and the alteration in color from grey to yellow
                  indicate that this groundwater horizon is directly fed by precipitation and it is
                  assessed that groundwater predominately circulates near the surface.

Based on available information from hydrogeological maps (e.g., Rudarski
Institute, 1985) as well as studies carried out in the mining site and
surroundings, the groundwater flow is generally northeast to west (or
southwest) to the Sitnica River. Review of the older documents and field
observations shows that the quantity of groundwater descending the
overburden at the mines is rather small. At the slopes groundwater can be
observed after rainy periods favoured in coarse layers of the "yellow clay"
and, along fissures, within the "grey clay".
Additional vadose water horizons can appear within courser layers of the
grey clay especially where it contains larger amounts of snail shells. Locally
the overburden is eroded to a thickness of meters or less and as abandoned
underground works with broken roofs give direct access to the surface,
precipitation can directly infiltrate the coal in larger areas whereby larger
quantities of groundwater might be produced.


Use of groundwater is mainly through private wells about 10 to 15 m deep in
the overburden clay. Production quantities defined by Rudaski Institute
(1985) show hydraulic conductivities in the range of kf = 10-9 m/sec to kf =
10-6 m/sec. In the surroundings of Laitishte some artificial wells have been
drilled some 5 m to 7 m deep into the "yellow clay", to serve as water supply
for a village.


The hydraulic conductivity can reach values up to 10-4 m/s or even greater in
the quaternary deposits along the river Sitnica containing coarser materials
with sand and gravel contents.
Towards the depth these sediments hold growing contents of silt and clay and
are underlain by grey clay preventing a direct contact between the surface
water and the coal seam.
Because of the hydraulic properties of the clay in case of rainfall an enriched
surface run-off can be expected.


The Sibovc-Field is nearly wholly located in less water bearing overburden. In
the valley of Sibovc river artesian groundwater outflow was observed in
harvest of 2004.


The above figure presenting the multiple aquifers does not include the aquifer
changes due to underground mining works.


Based on the available information given from hydrogeological maps (e.g.
Rudarski Institute, 1985) as well as studies carried out in the mining site and
surroundings, the groundwater flow is generally directed North-East to West
(or South-West) to the Sitnica River.


Since recentRecent measurements on the quantity of groundwater and
detailed flow directions are not available. Therefore, it has not been possible
to calculate properly (quantitatively) the indicator.


The geological layers with clay on top and on bottom of the coal seam divide
the layers from each other. Nevertheless, previous experience in the

abandoned mining activities in Krusevac mining area showed that excavation
led to subsidences with visible depressions on the surface. This leads to the
conclusion that separate layers are interconnected, at least in the area of the
ash dump of TPP A. Any contamination deriving from the ash dump can
pollute all overburden aquifers as well as the groundwater inside the coal
layer. On the other side the presence of fissures and cracks, either in the
lignite layer and in surface clay, does not guarantee a protection of the aquifer
circulating in the area.



Quality of Groundwater and Soil

The KEK industrial area is one of the areas with the highest land and
groundwater pollution. There is no adequate measurement, but based on
investigation and continuous inspection, it may be assumed so.
As already said (see indicator "Sources of Soil and groundwater contamination"),
a complex problem is represented by gasification and fertilizer facilities (no
more in use), located within the TPP Kosovo A area.


As per the findings of the Poiry study (2007) regarding soil pollution:


    ·    "the soil pollution investigated originates from the airborne deposition
         of heavy metals accumulated up to today and will be a fact for many
         years;

    ·    the area concerned which may be unsuitable for the production of
         foodstuff is about 18 km²;

    ·    mitigation would be feasible (whereas costly) only for areas which
         cause unacceptable risks for other resources and people. This is the
         case at Kosovo A site as well as at Kosovo B site (ash pile)."


No data are available for soil or groundwater properties for the existing
mines. For future Sibovc mine data were compiled in STEAG 20061. In
particular, investigations on the qualities of soils came to the conclusion that
most expressive information is given by "Soil map of SAP Kosovo", scale
1:50,000 (N. Povicevic et al., Institute for development of water resources,
Belgrade; 1974). An update of the soil classification based on FAO standards
was presented by the agricultural faculty of Pristina University. The following
Figure 3.3.2.2f shows the situation for the planned mining field including a
border area of 1 km width.

                  Within the New Mining Field, vertisol soil types cover nearly 100 % of the
                  area. Only some 0.4 ha at the outer northwestern edge contains reddish
                  sediments at the geological rim of the coal basin.
                  Vertisol soil types are generally used for grazing of cattle or sheep. It is not
                  unknown for livestock to be injured through falling into cracks in dry periods.
                  However, the shrink-swell activity allows rapid recovery from compaction.

When irrigation is available, crops such as cotton, wheat, sorghum and rice
can be grown. Vertisols are especially suitable for rice because they are almost
impermeable when saturated. Rainfed farming is very difficult because
vertisols can be worked only under a very narrow range of moisture
conditions: they are very hard when dry and very sticky when wet. The poor
quality of soil has also been identified by a number of people living in the
area, for further information please see Paragraph 3.4.10.


In fact, site visits showed that the New Mining Field area is constituted
mainly of uncultivated land, with some subsistence farming.


A "Site Investigation, Technical Organisation, Planning and Determination of
Environmental Impact" was initiated in July 2007 as part of the Clean up and
Land Reclamation Project (CLRP) devoted to identify the extent of
contamination and improve the environmental situation in the surroundings
of KEK mines and power stations, with particular reference to the reduction
of dust emissions from the existing TPP A ash dump (see also Paragraph
3.3.2.1).


Main project's components are the following:

    ·    preparation of Mirash open pit mine for ash and waste reception;

    ·    relocation of Kosovo A ash dumps into Mirash open pit mine (about
         35 million m3);

    ·    adaptation of ash disposal system of Kosovo A power plant for direct
         discharge into Mirash open pit mine;

    ·    reshaping and grading of South and West Overburden dumps (around
         6.5 km2);

    ·    removal of chemicals from gasification plant.


With reference to the preparation of a concept for the final design of the TPP
A ash landfill and some selected overburden outside dumps, the project shall
deal with the following tasks:

    ·    site investigations and topographic survey for the eastern area of
         Mirash open pit mine, TPP A ash dump and South field and Western
         Bardh overburden dumps;

    ·    detailed design, cost confirmation as well as equipment and personnel
         planning for:
              a) Mirash ash disposal area preparation;
              b) excavation operations at Kosovo A ash dump; and
              c) reshaping and recultivation of South Field and Western Bardh
                 overburden dumps;

    ·    environmental Impacts and preparation of Environmental
         Management Plans (EMPs) including mitigation measures for the
         projects and works mentioned above.


Concerning the component "removal of chemicals from gasification plant", the
following main activities have been already performed:

    ·    analysis of the physical properties of the site;



ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                        141

    ·    identification of the environmental/health hazards, implications and
         (positive) impacts;

    ·    identification of needs for further investigations, project risks and the
         reclamation potential;

    ·    preparation of an action plan, including an investment plan for the
         physical clean up and a proposed prioritization of investments.


The testing of groundwater and free surface water in the CLRP site
investigation phase showed slightly elevated levels of BTEX (Benzene,
Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes) and PAH (polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons) in some samples. Metals were within drinking water standards
(WHO, EU) except for arsenic, which was found at concentrations (12 and 13
microgram/L) marginally above drinking water standards (10 microgram/L)
in samples west of the Kosovo A ash dump. These arsenic concentrations
could very well be related to the natural occurrence of this element in the
area's geology. The conclusion is that test results could not identify any
significant contamination of groundwater downstream of the ash dump.
There is verbal reporting of contaminated groundwater in wells, this seems
now more likely to be related to the disposal of chemicals in old mine galleries
but this needs further investigation. Some shallow wells showed elevated
levels of electric conductivity (from salts) suggesting influence from ash dust
or ash dump surface water run-off.



State Indicators ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

The environmental situation in the area is very complex for a number of
different reasons. First of all, the environmental setting has been deeply
influenced by historical mining activities, with particular regard to geology,
hydrogeology and hydrology characteristics. Furthermore, air pollution,
especially due to particulate, has been heavily influencing soil quality. See
comments on pressure indicators.


Beside ash landfills, other contaminated areas are the old gasification and
fertilisers plants and the exhausted mines. Further monitoring activity is
necessary in such areas.


Soil in old plants areas does not show visual evidence of being heavily
contaminated, but the presence of tanks related to former operations not
properly decommissioned and limited waste storage areas represent
important issues. This old industrial area at Kosovo A will require clean-up
and a soil quality monitoring program is needed.


As pointed out in the previous paragraph, a monitoring campaign has to be
launched to better define soil quality conditions.

3.3.3      Surface Water and Wastewater


3.3.3.1    Pressure

           Kosovo does not have proper municipal or industrial wastewater treatment
           systems. The number of households connected to a sewage system is very
           limited (28%). In villages and other small settlements, wastewater is disposed
           of in open channels, which leads to contamination of surface and
           groundwater. Poor quality drinking water (from wells) and inadequate waste
           disposal are common complaints of the communities living in the area of
           interest; for further information please see Paragraph 3.4.17.


           No wastewater treatment plants are installed at the mines or power plants;
           industrial effluents are discharged directly into the rivers. The main sources of
           surface water contamination in the area of interest are wastewater discharges
           from KEK facilities and contaminated run off from the ash dumps. In
           addition, wastewater from urban areas (Municipalities of Lipjan, Fushe
           Kosova, Prishtina) and other industries are discharged upstream of the KEK
           facilities.


           Permanent monitoring of upstream and downstream flows of Sitnica River is
           not routinely implemented. Furthermore monitoring program appears
           insufficient in terms of monitoring points, frequencies and investigated
           parameters (heavy and rare metals are for example not included).



           Surface Water Consumption

           Water uses for the mines include the following:

               ·    firefighting;

               ·    sanitary uses in repair stations;

               ·    washing of trucks, etc.


           Water is supplied by public mains and is transported by tank trucks to the
           sites and repair stations.


           Based on Carl Bro Report the estimated total quantity of water use for the
           mines is around 350,000 m3/y.


           Main water uses in Kosovo A and Kosovo B power plants include:

               ·    Cooling water make up;

               ·    Boiler make up;

               ·    Sanitary use;

               ·    Washing water;

               ·    Water added to ashes to minimize particulate emission at Kosovo A;
                    and

               ·    Slurry preparation for ash transportation at Kosovo B (the ratio
                    between ash and water is 1:1).

Kosovo A water is supplied by the Llapi River; the Iber-Lepenc canal supplies
Kosovo B. In emergency conditions (especially during dry season), the canal
(see Paragraph 3.3.3.2 for details) is opened to let additional water flow to the
river to supply Kosovo A. Both power plants discharge to the Sitnica River.


As stated in the KEK Environmental Report 2006, calculated water
consumption is high: while Kosovo B uses around 2.7 m3/MWh, Kosovo A
water demand may reach up to 5.3 m3/MWh. Since the power plant does not
have a flow rate measurement system, the total water consumption is not
known.


Assuming valid the above stated data from KEK, the average water
consumptions for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 years, determined on the basis also
of the electric domestic production, should have been as shown in the
following Table 3.3.3.1a.

                 The Final Report of the study Water supply from the Iber Lepenc hydro system for
                  the proposed Kosovo C power plant - (February 2008 ) funded by the European
                 Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) and developed by COWI consortium
                 reports the same figure for the existing TPPs water consumptions, and in
                 particular:

                      ·    0.20 m3/s for TPPA in dry season (0.08 m3/s the average yearly
                           consumption);

                      ·    0.50 m3/s for TPPB (average monthly and yearly value).


                 The average annual water consumptions reported in the EAR Water Supply
                 study calculated on the basis of these figures are the following:

                      ·    2,630,000 m3;

                      ·    15,770,000 m3.


                 Total water consumption for the existing TPPs, as reported in the EAR Water
                 Supply study, is estimated at 18,400,000 m3 per year, with a return from the
                 cooling towers of 60%, or 11 M m3 per year.
                 No detailed procedures to measure water flow rates are set at the existing
                 facilities, therefore a precise quantification of the indicator is not possible.




                 Generation of Wastewater

                 The water received at the existing facilities leaves by evaporation, discharged
                 to rivers and lakes or infiltrates the surface and ends in the groundwater. A
                 detailed water balance, as reported in Carl Bro (2003), is shown in Table

The balance is based on rough estimates as no detailed recording of water
consumption and discharge is available.


In the following is presented a brief description of all wastewater production
sources1:


    ·     Surface dewatering is required in the mines due to rainfall and to the
          fact that lignite exploitation is carried out below the level of river
          Sitnica in the Mirash mine. There are no settlement ponds for these
          waters, they are directly pumped out and discharged into the rivers.
          Annually, it is estimated that about 918,000 m3 of untreated mine
          effluents are discharged into the rivers Sitnica (Mirash mine) and
          Drenica (Bardh mine). At the Bardh mine, there are mine drainage
          channels running to the river Drenica. However, a major network of
          ditches is absent at both mines. Frequently, the mine waters are used
          to extinguish fires in the mines.

    ·     The main source of water to the gasification site was rainfall: about
          600,000 m3, of which about 420,000 m3 evaporated, 130,000 m3 was
          discharged to rivers and 50,000 m3 infiltrated the groundwater.

    ·     The main source of water to the coal yards is rainfall, while only small
          quantities of raw water is used for fire fighting. The surplus of water is
          contaminated from the lignite, discharged mainly untreated to the
          rivers or infiltrates the groundwater. Carl Bro (2003) presents an
          estimate of about 5,000 m3 of wastewater discharged to the rivers and
          about 3,000 m3 infiltrated the groundwater.

    ·     The main sources of water for power plants and drying plant are raw
          water and prepared water for processes (boiler water), while the
          impact of rainfall is limited. Large quantities are evaporated in the
          cooling and in the drying processes. This emission is normally
          considered harmless. Most contaminated wastewater is collected and
          discharged practically directly to the river systems or infiltrate the
          groundwater. In fact, the main source of water to the water treatment
          plants is waste water from demineralisation plant. The water treatment
          process comprises sedimentation and neutralization. Sludge from
          water treatment plant is highly contaminated with salts and trace
          elements. Currently the residuals are temporary stored in an
          underground tank and disposed in the ash disposal.

    ·     The main sources of water to the ash disposal sites are rainfall and water
          from transport of bottom ash. Water is not recycled and consequently
          large quantities are discharged to the rivers or infiltrate the

          groundwater. No recording of water consumption is available but Carl
          Bro presents an estimate of about 1,000,000 m3 discharged to the rivers
          and about 250,000 m3 infiltrating the groundwater, as no precautions
          are taken to avoid infiltration.


Apart from the quantity of evaporated water from the cooling tower process,
all the wastewater generated in TPP A and TPP B plants, including industrial
effluents, sanitary effluents and rainfall is discharged in Sitnica River without
any treatment.


The discharging system includes 22 discharging points into the main sewage
system and 3 main discharging points into Sitnica River.


The main pollutants in the wastewater are:

    ·     fuel residuals;

    ·     ash residuals;

    ·     oil and chemical residuals;

    ·     sanitary water.


These residuals contain salts and trace metals, which can be harmful for
humans and ecosystem.


Wastewater discharges from the power plants are monitored by INKOS
through 17 surface water and 5 underground water monitoring points (5
piezometers, installed around the ash dump at Kosovo B to monitor
groundwater quality). Results of wastewater monitoring are included in the
KEK monthly environmental report.


Permanent monitoring of upstream and downstream flows of Sitnica River is
not routinely implemented. Existing monitoring programs appear insufficient
in terms of monitoring points, frequencies and investigated parameters
(heavy and rare metals are not included, for example).


The map of wastewater discharge monitoring points for KEK existing
facilities, as reported in KEK Environmental Report 2006, is presented in
Figure 3.3.3.1a. Table 3.3.3.1c from the KEK report contains the results of the
monitoring program carried out between January and June 2007.
Beside surface water (discharge and rivers), Table 3.3.3.1c shows also chemical
analysis of underground water (points P2, Pa, Pb, Pc, Pd). The results show a
very polluted ground water (concentration of some parameters is higher than
former Yugoslavia limits set for discharge water).


Table 3.3.3.1c shows also discharge limits established by former Yugoslavia for
the different classes of rivers.1 Based on the results of the analysis reported in



1Class I: water that, in natural state or after disinfection, can be used for drinking water
supply, food industry and fine fish (salmonidae) breeding.
Class II: water appropriate for bathing, recreation, water sports, less fine fish (cyprinidae)
breeding, including water that, after basic treatment methods (coagulation, filtration and

water exceed the discharge limits (suspended solids, KMnO4 etc).

in two further subclasses: sub-class IIa and sub-class IIb.
Class III: water that can be used for irrigation and industries except food industry.
Class IV: water that can be used only after special treatment).

                 According to KEK report "from the analysis it results that the key parameters which
                  exceed maximum allowed values1 are the pH values, suspended matters and use of
                  KMnO4. The main sources of exceeding of these values are in effluents of the ash
                  deposit, waters from the gasification area, and the technological waters of TPP A and
                  B. Still, even in recipients there are often very high values, especially near the
                  discharge of waste waters, such as Fushe-Kosova, Kastrioti, etc..


                 Regarding the mines, acid drainage is a common process in coal mine areas all
                 over the world as the result of sulphide oxidation, mainly pyrite (iron
                 sulphide), which reaction decreases the pH and favours the mobility of heavy
                 metals. Inspections at the mine sites did not show evidences of acid drainage
                 and chemical analyses of these waters confirmed field observations (pH
                 values around 8). This is mainly due to the occurrence of carbonate layers
                 within the lignite seams, which neutralizes the acidity generated. Mine water
                 quality is presented in Table 3.3.3.1d, as per Carl Bro (2003).

                 A major environmental issue is the elevated concentration of suspended
                 substances in the mine water reaching 900 mg/l, which exceeds 36 times the
                 EU-fish water guideline limit (25 mg/l). Sulphate concentrations in mine
                 waters are also high (up to 2,300 mg/l) and may damage the river fauna and
                 flora in case of excessive discharges. Phenol concentrations in the Mirash
                 mine waters are elevated and exceed 2.5 times the respective EU standard for
                 drinking water, which is 0.02 mg/l. Heavy metals are within maximum
                 permit limits for drinking water according to EU standards, excepting Ni,
                 which is a bit higher than the limit (20 micrograms/l). Lead is also close to the
                 limit of 10 micrograms/l.


                 The release of large amounts of toxic substances in a short time can impact the
                 whole ecological system of the rivers. At the same time, chronic pollution
                 with rather constant toxic emissions of relatively low concentration during
                 long periods may also cause a severe damage on local ecosystems. Surface
                 mine waters are also potential sources of ground water and soil pollution due
                 to in situ leaching of toxic substances. For these reasons, preventive measures
                 should be taken immediately.


                  1As standards, the INKOS has used the maximum value parameters, allowed by water category, namely four

                  categories. Exceeded values have been recorded when these values have exceeded the values for III category of waters.

                  The expected quality of mine drainage water without any treatment can be
                  assessed using the quality parameters from the water pumped out of the
                  Mirash mine, as presented in STEAG 2006 (see Figure 3.3.3.1b). It has to be
                  taken into consideration that the sampling point does not always represent
                  the quality of pumped mine water since dilution by rainwater might have
                  influenced the sample.

                  The concentrations indicate a potential need for mine water treatment
                  depending on the quantity of mine water discharge and the quality and
                  quantity of the receiving stream. Minimum standard would be to install
                  settling ponds to reduce the load of suspended solids and coal dust (STEAG
                  2006). Natural ponds are being used for this and a drainage system exists.



                  Pressure Indicators ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

                  There are no water flow rate measurements at the intakes or outfalls of the
                  plants; a monitoring system should be implemented, in order to measure both
                  water intake and wastewater discharge.
                  Also the quality of wastewater should be monitored.


                  Moreover, in emergency conditions (especially during dry season) water for
                  the power plants is supplied by Iber Lepenc canal. Nevertheless the matter
                  has to be investigated: water is a precious good and in perspective new
                  agreement has to be established with Serbia, located downstream of the Iber
                  Lepenc derivation. A rationalisation of the distribution system is strongly
                  recommendable (see also the comments on Water State Indicators).

                  Surface Water Reserves

                  Kosovo's watershed encompasses four river basins that drain into three seas:
                  the Adriatic, the Aegean and the Black Sea. The Drini i Bardhe is the largest of
                  the four basins (4,649 km2); the second largest is the Iber river basin (4,009
                   km2), which includes the mountain area in the north of Kosovo. The third
                   basin is the Morave e Binges (1,564 km2), and the fourth is the Lepenc basin
                  (685 km2) in the south of Kosovo.


                  Figure 3.3.3.2a shows main rivers and catchments in Kosovo region.

There are practically no natural lakes in Kosovo. Owing to the high flow
variations, five reservoirs have been constructed with the maximum capacity
of 568 million m3. They are used for water supply, fishery, irrigation,
recreation and flood protection.


The Kosovo C TPP project will be located in the Kosovo river basin. The
Kosovo basin forms a smoothly shaped plain that is bordered by hills and
mountains. This basin includes a well developed hydrological network with the
River Sitnica as its main collector. This river crosses the basin from south to
north and drains about 80 % of the accumulating surface water in a northern
direction. Major tributary rivers are the Drenica River in the west and the
Llapi River in the east.
The Sitnica run-off varies between a minimum of 0.5 ­ 1.5 m³/s and a
maximum of 50 ­ 120 m³/s with an average of 5 ­ 10 m³/s. In flooding
periods, the course of the river reaches a width of up to 1,000 m in the
flooding areas. On 3 May 1958 a maximum run-off for the river Sitnica near to
the mines was measured at 90.3 m³/s.


Due to the lack of actual run-off data the quantities of water discharged by
tributary rivers and creeks can only be assessed on the basis of a map of
catchment areas, developed from topographical maps.


Figure 3.3.3.2b shows the areas with potential for flooding.


As noted earlier, part of Kosovo A water and all of the water for Kosovo B
comes from the Iber-Lepenc canal, which runs parallel to the Iber and Sitnica
Rivers. The Iber-Lepenc system is one of the three hydrosystems in Kosovo,
completed in 1985 as a multi-purpose project providing water for hydro-
electric, domestic, industrial and irrigation purposes. The Lepenc section has
not yet been constructed.


The Iber-Lepenc system, administered by the publicly-owned Iber Lepenc
Enterprise (ILE), is comprised of the Ujman/Gazivoda reservoir, dam and
hydroelectric installation, discharging into the lower Pridvorice reservoir,
which acts as a regulator for releases into the Iber River and the 52 km Iber-
Lepenc canal.


The European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) recently awarded a project on
the Iber Lepenc Hydro System aimed at proving that the Iber Lepenc Hydro
system can support the additional water demand from the new thermo power
plant Kosovo C.


The Water Supply for the Iber Lepenc Hydro System for the proposed Kosovo C Power
Plant Project was carried out from December 2007 to February 2008 by a
consortium lead by COWI.


The Consultant included in the present section most relevant data of the EAR
Water Supply Project Final Report (February 2008).

Gazivoda dam is fed by Iber River. Iber River originates from six springs on
the Hajla Mountain in eastern Montenegro, runs in Montenegro, Kosovo and
Serbia and flows into the Zapadna Morava, central Serbia, near Kraljevo.


The reservoir created behind the dam has an active volume of 328.75 million
m3. The big active volume of the reservoir in relation to the average annual
inflows (410.772 m3 as estimated in EAR Water Supply study) allows
multiyear regulation. This means that some water inflowing in the reservoir
in one year can be stored and used the next year or later.
The average multiyear (for the period 1947 ­ 1973) discharge of the river is
13.06 m3/s.


The simplified physical and operational structure of the Iber-Lepenc hydro
system is illustrated in Figure 3.3.3.2c, as presented in the above mentioned
EAR Study. It reproduces schematically the real system as follows:

    ·    Most of the water used for domestic consumption is taken nearby
         Mitrovica, at the beginning of the canal;

    ·    Industrial factories are mainly Ferronikeli and Trepca, whose
         consumption has fallen sharply in the last years;

    ·    Kosovo B (plus partly A and foreseen C) are supplied with water at
         the end of the canal;

    ·    Most of the irrigated area lies between these two points.

Hydro-power plant is installed at Gazivoda dam, one kilometer downstream.
The power plant includes two turbines installed in 1983 and now requires
relatively costly maintenance. Power distribution is carried out by KOSST
(Independent Transmission System and Market Operator) under new power
trading rules starting in 2007 in Kosovo. ILE sells power to Kosovo Electricity
Company (KEK) through KOSST. The Gazivode Power Station has an
installed capacity of 33.35 MW; the production (and sales) of electricity in
2004 ­ 2006 was 109 GWh.


Immediately downstream the Gazivode Power Station, the Pridvorice dam is
located, which creates a reservoir with 480,000 m3 active volume. The
Pridvorice ­ Obiliq canal, with a designed capacity of 22.2 m3/s, starts from
the Pridvorice dam with a direction to the south and to the cities of Mitrovice
and Pristina in order to cover the needs of different type of consumers.


Losses from this canal, as well as from the total length of the Iber Lepenc
canals (147 km) are reportedly very high due to technical (infrastructure
damages and lack of maintenance operations) and administration (illegal
consumers) reasons.
Estimated total losses are around 50-60 % of average water capacity.


The Pridvorice-Obiliq canal serves industrial, domestic and irrigation
consumers.

Domestic water use includes urban population of the following four different
municipalities:

·   Mitrovice, Skenderaj and Vushtrri supplied by Mitrovica Water Supply
    Company;

·   Drenas supplied by Pristina Water Supply Company.


In case of emergency (dry season) water from Pridvorice-Obiliq canal is used
to feed Badovci Lake supplying water to the Pristina Water Supply Company.


Data on average monthly water use estimation for 2006, as provided by Iber
Lepenc, are reported in Figure 3.3.3.2d.

                   Based on Iber-Lepenc data, the average yearly water use in 2006 was 2.39
                   m3/s (about 75 million m3/year), while maximum water use registered in July
                  2006 was around 6 m3/s.


                  In the above figure the availability of water resource is assumed 33,844,500
                  m3/month. In reality this figure represents the total average flow of Iber
                   Lepenc Canal and therefore has to be reduced to take into account the
                   minimum vital flow (see Figure 3.3.3.2c), water losses and possible
                  requirement of potential downstream consumer (Serbian population) ­ (see
                  next paragraphs for discussion).

                  Present and Future Water Demand and Water Resource

                  Data on present and future water demand in the region of Iber Lepenc water
                  system are not available at present. In the Balwois International Conference
                  (Macedonia, 2004) on water and climate the Kosovo Ministry of Environment
                  and Spatial Planning representative stated that "There is no reliable information
                  about the present state of water resources and water use in Kosova".


                  The Consultant during the preparation of the environmental baseline has
                  identified the following three main reference documents for the evaluation of
                  the present and future water demand for different uses:


                   ·   Water Master Plan of Kosovo;

                   ·   Water Balance Report, Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning;

                   ·   Water Resource and Future Water Demand (EAR Water Supply Study).

Existing water Master Plan of Kosovo was prepared in 1985 and therefore
does not properly represent the actual water demand in the region, since it
does not include the socio-economic changes occurred after the last conflict.


Water Balance Report (2004) seems to be not available at the Ministry of
Environment and Spatial Planning.


The main findings of Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning
representative in Balwois International Conference (Macedonia, 2004) were
the following:


·   "Kosova has been classified as one of the water-poor areas of Europe and water
    unevenly distributed.

·   Water resources are relatively small in Kosovo, compared to population and arable
    land.

·   Good quality ground or spring water resources are unevenly distributed (mainly
    in the western part) and are only partly available for water supply.

·   In eastern Kosovo rocks and sediments are more impermeable and groundwater
    cannot be easily exploited."


Furthermore in Kosovo region only 44% of the total population, and 8.4% of
the rural population, has access to the water distribution system.
People in rural areas rely on village water-supply systems, their own wells or
on springs and surface water. Rural wells are generally in bad conditions and
the water quality is poor mainly due to organic contamination.


Iber Lepenc water system was originally designed to feed industrial facilities
and agricultural land. Nevertheless, on the basis of the previous
considerations with particular reference to scarcity of drinkable water, lack of
alternative water sources and expected increase of water demand for domestic
purposes in the near future, the Iber Lepenc water system use for domestic
purposes could be a solution for the existing water shortage problems through
the realisation of proper water treatment plants.


A number of water users currently obtain their water from the Iber-Lepenc
system:


    ·    Domestic water use includes the urban population of four
         municipalities:
         -    Mitrovica, Skenderaj and Vushtrri supplied by Mitrovica Water
              Supply Company;
         -    Gllogovc supplied by Prishtina Water Supply Company;
    ·    Mitrovica's domestic water consumption, and emergency supplies for
         Pristina in case of water shortages;
    ·    Prishtina's domestic water consumption from the Gazivoda;
    ·    Industrial consumption from the Trepca factory. Although the factory
         is not in use at present, it is unclear what the future industrial water
         consumption will be for that area;
    ·    Industrial consumption by the Feronikeli factory;

    ·    Environmental flows;
    ·    In addition, losses from abstractions from the system along the 52 km
         of the Iber-Lepenc canal are estimated at around 50% of canal flow.


Water Resource and Future Water Demand (EAR Water Supply Study)

In this paragraph the main findings of the EAR Water Supply study are
presented in order to assess the present conditions in terms of:


·   Water Demand from Iber Lepenc Hydro System;

·   Water Resources in the Gazivoda Lake or main lake.


The EAR estimation was performed through the evaluation of:


·   water balance of secondary reservoir;

·   water balance, water volume and water excess in the Gazivoda lake,
    including total discharges to Iber River.


Water Demand Estimation
Estimation of current water demand is a very difficult exercise: it depends on
the real and urgent needs of the different competing users of the Iber-Lepenc
System. The EAR report assumes the figures shown in the following.

The analysis was carried out for the two following cases:


·   Total Water Demand for 5,000 ha to be irrigated (most probable present
    situation);

·   Total Water Demand for 10,000 ha to be irrigated.


Nevertheless, other sources indicate a total water demand for 18,000 hectars to
be irrigated.


The EAR study, here utilized, was based on the following hypothesis:


·   the outflow from the secondary reservoir must cover at least the
    compulsory minimum inflow to the main canal (Iber Lepenc canal) and
    the minimum biological flow for the Iber River;

·   the minimum inflow to the main canal was determined considering the
    useful water consumptions plus losses from the canal mainly due by
    leakages. Current losses are estimated to be around 50% of the total
    inflow;

·   the minimum biological flow is the minimum flow the Iber River
    downstream of Gazivoda lake must have to preserve the environment.
    The minimum biological flow is 0.50 m3/s;

·   the Gazivoda lake and the secondary reservoir (0.480 million m3) are able
    to stabilize natural inflow modulating hydroelectric production. The
    Hydroelectric utilization for the year 2004-2006 is reported in the

         The Total User Water Demand in the two above cases were estimated on the
         basis of the following considerations:


         ·    the estimated quantity of water supplied by the Iber-Lepenc hydro system
              to municipal water companies is around 15 million m3/year, as estimated
              by ILE. Assuming a specific consumption of 200 l/capita/day (specific
              consumption standard for western country1), the number of users would
              be around 200,000 people; instead, the recorded number of user is a lot
              less, resulting in an apparent average daily specific consumption of about
              340 litres/capita/day. This apparent specific consumption shows that
              there is a a huge number of "illegal clients", connected to the network but
              not recorded;


         ·    in 2006, the amount of irrigated land was 668 ha out of a total of 20,000 ha
              (against 547 ha in 2005 and 526 ha in 2004). Studies and other documents
              of the Ministry of Agriculture report that the land area that could be
              irrigated in the near future is much greater (between 5,000 and 10,000 ha).
              In the above figures, the estimated values are utilised to evaluate the
              present needs;


         ·    the Kosovo A plant will be in operation until 2020, and the water supplied
              by the Iber-Lepenc hydro system (via the Llab river) amounts to 0.20 m3/s,
              but only 5 months per year, resulting in an annual average net flow of 0.08
              m3/s (see also Paragraph 3.3.3.1);


         ·    as for the Kosovo B plant, the net water consumption should be around
              0.50 m3/s (see also Paragraph 3.3.3.1);


         ·    the average net water consumption of the other industries (metallurgic
              factories and manufacturing plants) is estimated to be around 1.00 m3/s
              until 2020.


         Water Resource Estimation
         Water availability in the Iber-Lepenc system is dependent on the the water
         balance in the Gazivoda reservoir. The water balance in Gazivoda is
         calculated considering the water inflow to the main lake, which consists in the
         natural inflow, and the water outflow, represented by the inflow to the

                  hydroelectric power plant and by the possible excess of water by-passing the
                  turbines to ensure the minimum inflow to the secondary reservoir.


                  In the EAR Water Supply study, total inflow to the Gazivoda lake was
                  determined on the basis of the statistical water inflow data for the period
                  1948-1972 (only available data), provided by ILE.
                  Even the Institute for Hydro-Meteorology in Prishtina was not able to provide
                  more recent data on rain flows in the catchments' area.
                  The water inflow to the Gazivoda Lake was determined on the basis of the
                  above mentioned data provided by ILE that refer to the period 1948 ­ 1972.
                  Although this data are old (dating back before the construction of the dam),
                  they are the only available data.

                  Quality of River Water

                  Contamination of rivers and streams is high all over the project sites.
                  Although chemical-industrial, mineral and metallurgical production,
                  previously discharging into surface water, has decreased in the area of
                  interest, no significant improvement in river water quality has been reported.
                  Main findings from the Water Surface Quality (MESP Water Department,
                  2006) are the following:

                      ·    Presence of detergent in rivers is reported. This is due to large use of
                           detergent in household and industry.

                           hydrocarbons) is not properly carried out in all Kosovo rivers.

                      ·    High values of phenols are reported especially in Sitnica River and its
                           tributaries. This is probably due to sewage discharges from ash landfill
                           where phenol waste were disposed of.

         industry, except for food industry, or can be used only after specific
         treatment process). Sitnica River during 1980s was considered as
         "dead" river; it regenerated a little after closure of Fertilizing Plant and
         Gasification Plant.


Based on MESP Water Surface Quality Report, Sitnica River and its tributaries
are highly polluted, principally due to the large amount of sewage and
industrial discharges, making the Sitnica-Iber river system an open drain of
industrial effluent.

Monitoring results of waste waters discharges from TPP A and B to the
Recipient Sitnica, as provided by KEK, are presented in Paragraph 3.3.3.1.


As reference standards, former Jugoslavia regulation points out the legal
framework for protection of surface water by means of classification in four
classes according to water pollution level and use. Limits are summarized in
Table 3.3.3.2c as presented in Order on water classification, official Gazette of
Social Republic of Serbia, No. 5/68 (ecological quality parameters) and official
Gazette of Social Republic of Serbia, No. 31/82 (chemical quality parameters).
With regard to chemical quality parameters, a selection of the most
representative is presented in the Table. As a matter of fact, iron, copper,
nickel, cadmium, zinc, arsenic and cyanides are the most frequently found in
water streams in concentrations above former Yugoslavia and other threshold
values.


Indicated classes are:


    ·    Class I: water that, in natural state or after disinfection, can be used for
         drinking water supply, food industry and fine fish (salmonidae)
         breeding;

    ·    Class II: water appropriate for bathing, recreation, water sports, less
         fine fish (cyprinidae) breeding, including water that, after basic
         treatment methods (coagulation, filtration and disinfection), can be
         used for drinking water supply and food industry. Class II is then
         divided in two further subclasses - sub-class IIa and sub-class IIb;

    ·    Class III: water that can be used for irrigation and industries except
         food industry;

    ·    Class IV: water that can be used only after special treatment.

                  % Population with Adequate Water Facilities

                  In Kosovo region, as stated by Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning
                  representative in Balwois International Conference (Macedonia, 2004), only
                  44% of the total population, and 8.4% of the rural population, has access to the
                  water distribution system.


                  People in rural areas rely on village water-supply systems, their own wells or
                  on springs and surface water. Rural wells are generally in bad conditions and
                  the water quality is poor, due to organic contamination.
                  Domestic water supply is further hampered by several problems, including
                  pipe failures, interrupted power supply and limited storage capacity; the
                  result is very high per capita water consumption of around 340 l/ca.day.
                  Water distribution networks are generally very old and in poor condition as
                  they suffer from a lack of investment and maintenance. Few utilities are able
                  to provide adequate amounts of water to the population. There is an ongoing
                  problem with the collection of fees for water use, owing, in large part, to the
                  lack of functioning water meters.

Twenty percent of Obiliq town is supplied by Prishtina Water Supply
Company through the potable water supply network,, which gets its water
from Batllava and Badovci Lakes.
Water quality samples are taken in Obiliq, both from raw water and from the
network. The monthly results of 2006 show an exceedance of the limit for total
coliform during three months (January, July and December) in waters from
the network.


The World Health Organization (WHO), in cooperation with the Institute for
Public Health, has developed and distributed instructions to local and
international NGOs and communities on standard methods of water
sampling, the minimum standard of rehabilitation, protection and
disinfection of wells and the frequency of routine sampling for drinking water
from the distribution system in each municipality. Municipal sanitary
inspectors were trained by WHO and the Institute to carry out the sampling
and reporting. In 2000, as part of the routine sampling of the urban drinking-
water network, 4000 samples were taken in Prishtinë/Pristina and between
600 and 1000 in Pejë/Pec, Prizren/Prizren, Gjilan/Gnjilane,
Gjakovë/Dakovica and Mitrovicë/Mitrovica. The results show that water
companies have improved drinking-water quality since early 2000; however,
there are ongoing failures. This can be attributed to a number of factors,
including the poor state of the network, the lack of chlorine and chlorination
points, and, in some cases, poorly protected water sources. As a result,
drinking water poses significant risks of water-borne bacteriological diseases.


In Obiliq Municipality, the National Public Health Institute has carried out
measurements of the quality of drinking water from wells in rural areas,
based on the Regulation on drinking water quality monitoring. Two samples
of drinking water have been collected in each of the following villages:
Shipitulle, Hade, Bakshi, Millosheve, Hamidi, Lajthishte, Sibovc,
Babimoc/Babin Most, Breznice and Kozarice.


The sampling has been carried out in four different periods during 2002:
February, July, November and December. In the following are presented the
results.


In February, the samples were taken in the two most frequented points of
each village: the Health House and the school (when not existing, samples
were taken from individual wells of inhabitants of that village). 20
bacteriological and 20 chemical samples were analyzed. Results consistently
show a high level of contamination:


    ·    95% of samples show contamination of faecal origin or total coli-form,
         not in compliance with WHO indications;

    ·    55% of samples have high values of nitrites and nitrates, not in
         compliance with with WHO indications;

    ·    100% of samples are not drinkable and do not comply with AI 2/99
         MSHMS.

In July, the samples were taken from individual wells of inhabitants of the
villages. 20 bacteriological and 20 chemical samples were analyzed. Results
showed a high level of contamination:


    ·    90% of samples show contamination of faecal origin or total coli-form
         and do not comply with WHO indications;

    ·    45% of samples have high values of nitrites and nitrates and do not
         comply with AI 2/99 MSHMS;

    ·    97.5% of samples are not drinkable and do not comply with AI 2/99
         MSHMS.


In November, the samples were taken from individual wells of inhabitants of
the villages, schools and Health House (from the total number of samples, 6
were taken from school wells and 1 in the health house). 15 bacteriological
and 15 chemical samples were analyzed. Results show a high level of
contamination:


    ·    87% of samples show contamination of faecal origin or total coli-form
         and do not comply with AI 2/99 MSHMS;

    ·    13% of samples have high values of nitrites and nitrates and do not
         comply with AI 2/99 MSHMS;

    ·    100% of samples are not drinkable and do not comply with AI 2/99
         MSHMS.


In December, the samples were taken from individual wells of inhabitants of
the villages of Millosheve, Raskove, Bakshi and Bajmovc. 8 bacteriological and
8 chemical samples were analyzed. Results show a high level of
contamination:


    ·    38% of samples show contamination of faecal origin or total coli-form
         and do not comply with AI 2/99 MSHMS;

    ·    38% of samples have high values of nitrites and nitrates and do not
         comply with AI 2/99 MSHMS;

    ·    100% of samples are not drinkable and do not comply with AI 2/99
         MSHMS.


In conclusion, results always show a high level of contamination.
It has to be added that the analyses did not investigate trace element such as
heavy metals, phenols and other contaminants potentially present in the
investigated area. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence from the Project's social
baseline survey and consultations shows that a number of communities are
concerned with the low quality and quantity of water in their villages. For
further information please see Paragraph 3.4 and Tables in Paragraph 3.4.


Moreover, while collecting samples, also the sanitary-hygienic conditions of
each well have been reviewed, with the following results:

            Raskove, Bakshi and Bajmovc) no data are available.


No complete inventory of water facilities exists, therefore the indicator cannot
be calculated.



State Indicators ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions



Water Reserves

Data on water availability in Kosovo Region do not appear sufficient to
clearly define the present situation: water inflow in Gazivoda lake are 36
years old e no systematic data were found on the presence of exploitable
aquifers or other water sources in the Kosovo Region from Pristina to
Mitrovica.


Nevertheless, if we assume:


      ·     valid the existing data on Gazivoda Lake inflow;

      ·     that Gazivoda lake is practically the only reliable source of water for
            the Region of interest;

      ·     that the irrigation area is going to be soon at least 10,000 ha;

      ·     that the real present potable water consumption supplied with Iber
            Lepenc Canal is around 15 Mm3/y (0,46 m3/s);


the water exploitation index (WEI)1, defined as the ratio of water demand
over water availability, for the area in a near future will assume the value of:


WEI = 6,48/13,02 = 0,5.


According to EAR study, in average, median and worst year, total water
availability remains higher than water demand. However, the system is under
stress from potentially competing demands, as indicated by the (WEI), an



(1) The water exploitation index (WEI) is part of the Core Set of Indicators of the European Environmental Agency and is
    1

defined as the mean annual total abstraction of freshwater divided by the mean annual total renewable freshwater resource
at the country level, expressed in percentage terms.

           indicator used by the European Environmental Agency to identify water
           stressed regions or river basins.

           As pointed out by Kosovo Lignite Power Technical Assistance - Technical
           Mission Report of March 2008 "the warning threshold for the (WEI), which
           distinguishes a non-stressed from a stressed region, is around 20 %. Severe water
           stress can occur where the WEI exceeds 40 %, indicating unsustainable water use".


           According to the EAR estimation, the WEI (calculated on the present water
           demand as shown in the previous table) is around 50% for the average year.
           This high WEI indicates the potential for conflicting demands from various
           water users and stresses the need for a comprehensive policy, institutional
           and planning framework for water resource management in the Iber-Lepenc
           system.

           Water stress already occurs, as there are frequent shortages in summer in the
           potable water supply to Prishtina and other municipalities supplied by the
           Prishtina Water Supply Company.

           Furthermore, it was not considered that part of the Gazivoda Lake inflow
           could be used downstream the dams, where Iber river crosses the Serbian
           border.


           As a consequence more information has to be collected on water availability
           in Kosovo and water resources management plans have to be prepared taking
           into account the Kosovo Water Law (Law No. 2004/24).


           The actual situation presents apparently some criticalities and any further
           increase in water consumption should be evaluated carefully and together
           with the realization of a proper water management plan.


           It is clear that the reduction of canal losses to more reasonable values (no
           more than 25%) and the installation of a proper monitoring network (river
           flow rates, potable water volume gauges etc.,) will diminish criticalities.



           Water Quality

           Data on water quality are available. Nevertheless the monitoring system
           should be improved and the analysis should be carried out on a periodic (and
           frequent) basis.



3.3.4      Noise


3.3.4.1    Pressure

           Noise is a serious concern for the health and safety of workers at the plants
           and mines.
           Key noise sources at mines include vehicles, excavation and transport
           equipment, and belt conveyors.

           ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                  THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA

           Noise coming from mining activities and transport of coal is present mainly
           during daytime.


           People living in villages and towns close to the mines report noise as one of
           the main environmental problems: whereas workers may wear personal
           protection equipment, residents do not have the means to protect themselves
           from mine-related noise.


           No monitoring data are available to date with regard to noise impact from the
           mining site.


           Power plant noise comes from belt conveyors, crushing equipment, burners,
           turbines, generator, ventilators, compressors, pumps, cooling towers and
           stacks.
           In several places inside power plants areas, noise emissions likely exceed 85
           dB(A), which is generally considered the limit not to be exceeded at 1 m
           distant.


           No monitoring data are available to date with regard to noise emissions.
           However, since power plants are not positioned in the immediate vicinity of
           sensitive receptors such as houses, significant noise impact from them is
           considered unlikely.


           Nevertheless, meteorological conditions, mainly wind direction and speed,
           surface and atmospheric absorption and air humidity may influence the level
           and distribution of noise; a monitoring campaign is necessary to evaluate the
           indicator "Noise emissions" for the sites of plants and mines.



           Pressure Indicators ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

           There is currently no noise monitoring data: based on limited information
           available and ERM experience, noise emission has to be considered a key
           aspect to be addressed for mine development. A noise survey should be
           undertaken and comparison made with applicable standards, to ascertain
           potential non compliance and necessary mitigation measures for the
           protection of both workers and residents.




3.3.4.2    State

           A number of residents from villages close to the existing mining facilities have
           raised concerns about noise levels (for further information please see Sections
           3.4.3, 3.4.4.3, 3.4.11.1 and Table 3. 4.1.2a, Table 3. 4.16c). However, detailed
           noise mapping has not been carried out. Without a detailed noise baseline,
           Carl Bro (2003) has calculated the noise as presented in Table 3.3.4.2a.

                 During daytime, no noise problems have been recorded in the neighborhood.
                 During the night, noise in Obiliq municipality, around 500 m away from the
                 TPP Kosovo B, seems to exceed the rate for inhabited areas according to Carl
                 Bro; and again, during nighttime the noise is probably above the level (see
                 next paragraph) for residential area.


                 During the public consultation meetings, residents of settlements located close
                 to the mines, especially Grabovc i Poshtem, raised concerns about the noise
                 emitted by conveyer belts and mining operations.


                 Reportedly, measurements performed revealed exceedances of noise limit
                 values by approximately 10 dB(A) for night time. An earth dam is planned as
                 mitigation measure to reduce noise levels.


                 Mitigation measures for noise have to be provided for health and safety
                 protection of the workers and vicinity population.


                 Local authorities have not defined any acoustic zoning plan, therefore it was
                 not possible to completely define the indicator "Zoning Plan and Noise
                 Immissions ".  1



                 Reference Legislation

                 The EU Exposure to Noise Directive (2003/10/EC) sets exposure limit values
                 and exposure action values in respect of the daily occupational noise exposure
                 levels and peak sound pressure. The daily exposure limit values are the
                 following:

                      ·    exposure limit values: LEX,8h = 87 dB(A);

                      ·    upper exposure action values: LEX,8h 85 dB(A);

                      ·    lower exposure action values: LEX,8h = 80 dB(A).


                 The exposure levels to which workers are subject are calculated as being the
                 time weighted average ­ over eight hours for the daily noise exposure and
                 over five eight-hour days for the weekly noise exposure. Employers have a
                 duty to undertake a risk assessment and, if considered necessary, measure the
                 noise to which employees are subjected. Where the risks of damage from
                 exposure to noise cannot be prevented by other means (such as removal or
                 enclosure of the noise source, limiting the time of exposure), the employer is
                 required to provide employees with adequate hearing protection.

                  Employers of workers exposed to occupational noise are required to provide
                  health surveillance. Those workers exposed to noise levels above the upper
                  exposure action value has the right to have his/her hearing checked by a
                  doctor.


                  Preventive hearing testing must also be available for those workers whose
                  exposure exceeds the lower exposure action values where the risk assessment
                  considers it necessary.


                  The World Bank/ IFC guidelines recommend that noise levels, measured at
                  receptors outside the project operations boundary, should achieve either the
                  levels shown in Table 3.3.4.2c or a maximum increase in background levels of
                  3 dB(A).

           State Indicators ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

           As outlined in the previous paragraph, data are scarce and environmental and
           occupational noise should be considered as a problem. The scarce indications
           available do show very probable exceedance of noise immission standards
           (EU, WB and former Yugoslavia) in the residential areas around mine
           boundaries and sometimes in the residential areas near Kosovo B.
           Monitoring of environmental noise should be undertaken and appropriate
           mitigation measures designed.



3.3.5      Solid Waste


3.3.5.1    Pressure

           Waste, both municipal and industrial, is a major environmental challenge in
           Kosovo, especially mine tailings and flotation sludge. Old waste sites did not
           have waterproof lining to prevent seepage from polluting groundwater, they
           were not covered with inert material to keep rainwater out nor did they have
           gas extraction systems to prevent methane explosions.


           The main issues connected with waste production from mines and power
           plants are the following:


               ·    production of ashes;

               ·    generation of solid waste;

               ·    generation of hazardous wastes.



           Production of Ashes

           Lignite contains non-combustible materials that forms ash during the
           combustion process. Ashes from the power plants (Kosovo A and Kosovo B)
           are fly ash and bottom ash. The electrical precipitators collect the largest
           quantities of fly ash but some are released as dust emissions through the
           stacks.


           The quantity of residuals becomes higher if combustion efficiency drops, or
           the quality of the lignite is poor.


           TTPB fly ash is now hydraulically transported as a suspension of water and
           ash to the ash landfill where it is discharged in the residual hole of the former
           Mirash-East mine. Bottom ash is transported to the landfill with trucks and
           conveyors.
           TTPA ashes are transported to the existing ash landfill by means of belt
           conveyors after humidification.




           ERM ­ ELC - CSA                              THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                   176

                 The ashes contain salts and trace metals, which, once wet, can leach out to
                 infiltrate groundwater and surface water. The ash from both plants is either
                 slurry or damp, and is disposed of without protection against rainfall.
                 Unfortunately, no analyses of trace elements are performed, as INKOS has no
                 equipment for this.


                 Amounts of ash produced by the plants in the period 2005-2006 (as per the
                 KEK report) are presented in Table 3.3.5.1a.

                 The methods used to determine these quantities are not known and the exact
                 quantity is not confirmed.


                 A typical complete Chemical analysis of ash (slug and fly ashes) is reported in
                 Table 39 of KEK report, but no indication is given about the leaching capacity
                 and whether dangerous substances (such as chromium and heavy metals) are
                 present in very soluble form or insoluble form.


                 Two disposal sites for ash are used near the Kosovo A and B power plants.
                 Kosovo B ash is hydraulically transported in a slurry and disposed of in a
                 depleted area of the Mirash-East mine, which serves as an ash landfill. Ash
                 from Kosovo A is transported to the landfill by means of belt conveyors after
                 humidification. The ash landfills have exceeded the originally intended
                 volume and heaps of ash form a visually dominant element of the landscape.
                 TTP A landfill with overburden occupies an area of approximately 240 ha,
                 while TPP B landfill occupies 55 - 60 ha.

                 Both landfills have at certain times in the past been used to dispose of other
                 solid and liquid waste (for example, in Kosovo A landfill, oil and phenol
                 ponds were identified); see soil component (Paragraph 3.3.2) for details.
                 INKOS is testing various grass species for covering the ash dumps.


                 The filter ash of the lignite-fired power plants could be used as a cement
                 substitute for concrete production as well as for the production of masonry
                 bricks and for road construction. Another option that has been proposed is to
                 transport the fly ash to parts of the mine that have been exhausted. No clear
                 implementation plan seems to have been developed by either KEK or the
                 Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning.


                 For further details on the ashes in TPP A ash dump, please refer also to the
                 Clean up and Land Reclamation Project (CLRP), devoted to identify the extent

surroundings of KEK mines and power plants, by a reduction of dust
emission from the existing TPPA ash dump (Paragraph 3.3.2.1).



Generation of Industrial Solid Waste

Waste management in general needs improvement in Kosovo, particularly for
industrial facilities. Data on solid waste production (urban and industrial) are
not easily available due to a lack of waste policies.


In the following an estimation of solid waste production by the mines and the
power plants is attempted.


No inventory of wastes generated by the mines exists. Apart from ash, solid
wastes come from mine offices and repair stations, which are collected by the
municipal waste collection and disposal services.
TPP B uses a slurry pipeline to transport ash to the Mirash East.


The main sources of solid waste from the power plants are:

    ·    Combustion residuals (ashes);

    ·    Worn out equipment and materials;

    ·    Residue from water treatment;

    ·    used machinery oil and other hazardous waste.


Waste from both the power plants is managed by a special division within
Central Maintenance Department.



Waste inventory for Kosovo includes 32 waste types; ashes are by far the
largest problem in terms of quantity (see indicator "Production of ashes").


Metals are the only waste separately collected and sold to METALKOS; the
total amount of scraps removed by the firm in 2006 was around 975,198 t.
Other solid waste (a part metals) is collected in containers and disposed off by
the municipal waste services company. Spent oil reportedly is recycled by
specialised companies.


Like ash, solid waste residuals from the water treatment processes may
contain trace metals and salts. Quantities are estimated at about 6 m3/d form
Kosovo A and 3 m3/d from Kosovo B. As dry material this equals about 2,100
m3/y of solid waste. The waste is removed as mud and disposed together
with the ash.


KEK has a department for management of waste materials and the following
quantities were recorded:

    ·    Steel: 2,466.8 t

    ·    Metals: 20.0 t

    ·    Copper: 13.0 t

     ·   Rubber: 19.5 t

     ·   Lead: 3.6 t


Contaminated soil, dropped lignite, ashes and other solid products was
collected and disposed in the ash disposals. There are no record of quantities
and content of trace elements and salts. A rough estimate of the disposed
quantities is 30,000 t of waste from cleaning-up.


Only indicative solid waste production quantities are available.


Hazardous materials and waste are currently stored in deplorable conditions at
many sites in Kosovo, mainly in the industrial complexes where they were
used or generated. There are no proper storage facilities for hazardous waste,
although there is a plan to build temporary storage facilities.


No inventory of wastes generated by mines exists. Hazardous waste
produced in mines are spent oil (motor, hydraulic, trafo); reportedly there are
no spent batteries.


Hazardous waste or potentially hazardous waste (among which transformers
oil, batteries, cables, insulation, chemicals, chemicals packaging) from power
plants is stored in special areas and disposed of. Specific procedures for waste
transportation and disposal are still under preparation.


Asbestos was used mainly for installation during construction of Kosovo A, the
drying plant and the gasification plant and can be found all over the plants.
No asbestos was used for Kosovo B. Asbestos was mainly used for insulation
and can be found all over the plants.
Reportedly, no asbestos is present in the mining area and none was identified
during the site visit.


Reconstruction must have left huge quantities of solid waste with content of
asbestos. The materials are mainly disposed together with ashes but there is
no record of quantities and disposal places.


Urgent measures should immediately be taken to protect workers from any
exposure to asbestos fibres. It primary means controlling of the spread of
asbestos within the enclosure. Whenever practical, the point of removal
should be isolated, enclosed, covered, or shielded from the workers in the
area.


Waste containing asbestos materials must be bagged during or immediately
after removal. The material must remain saturated until the waste container is
sealed. Waste material with sharp points or corners must be placed in hard
airtight containers rather than bags. Whenever possible, large components
should be sealed in plastic sheeting and removed intact. Bags or containers of
waste must be moved to a special waste area, washed, and wrapped in a bag
with the appropriate labels.

According to data available, oil containing PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls)
is not a significant issue at the power plants. Taking into account how old the
equipment is and the lack of regular maintenance, it is almost certain that
some pieces of equipment contain oils with PCB. Since there is no special care
of waste oils discarded into drums without specific labels there is no labelling
of oil, which may or may not contain PCB. There are no procedures or
instructions for oil control or if there are some, they have not been
implemented. There is also no testing on PCB presence in the Kosovo A or B,
which have to be provided in future.


The KEK Environmental Report mentions 5 transformers that contain PCBs
but are out of operation and 14 transformers containing PCBs that are still
functioning at Kosovo B. These transformers should be replaced and properly
disposed of in near future.


Larger quantities of PCBs containing transformers were used in the past and
have been dismantled and are probably disposed in a not specified area of
Kosovo B site.


Only indicative hazardous waste production quantities are available.



Municipal Waste Generation and Disposal

Services for the collection, transport and disposal of municipal waste
predominantly cover urban areas, but they are now being expanded into rural
areas. According to the 2002 Human Development Report, the total
population is estimated to range between 1.8 and 2 million; about 35% of the
population in Kosovo lives in urban areas and 65% in rural areas. About 60-
80% of all municipal waste is collected in urban areas; rural areas have almost
no public services.


Nine new landfills are planned. Eight of these are currently in the design
phase or under development and construction. Two of them will serve single
municipalities that are too remote for waste transport.


Following the 1999 conflict virtually all waste collection ceased. There has
been considerable improvement as a result of donations of funds and
equipment from the international community, but equipment and transport
are still inadequate for the proper collection and disposal of all municipal
waste.


There are 30 municipalities in Kosovo, and waste is either dumped at either
municipal or regional landfills. In a number of municipalities, dumpsites have
been rehabilitated and are being used by waste companies until regional or
new landfills can be completed. Rehabilitation has been undertaken in
Gjakovë/ Dakovica, Gllogovc/ Glogovac, Istog/Istok, Klinë/Klina,
Kamenicë/Kamenica, Mitrovicë/Mitrovica, Lipjan/ Lipljan, Rahovec/
Orahovac, Podujevë/Podujevo, Suharekë/Suva Reka, and Ferizaj/Urosevac.

In Novobërdë/Novo Brdo, Obiliq/Obilic, Pejë/Pec, Skenderaj/Srbica,
Shtime/Stimlje, Vushtrri/Vucitrn and Zubin Potok/Zubin Potok, the dumps
have been decommissioned. In the remaining municipalities, dumpsites have
not been rehabilitated and are still in use. For example, the present dumpsite
for the largest municipality, Prishtinë/Pristina, is situated about 2 km from
the city, in the northeastern corner of Mirash East mine. Prishtina Regional
Waste Company manages the Municipal Landfill of Prishtina which is
equipped with a leachate pond. The waste is not covered daily with a layer of
earth; there is no drainage system and no monitoring. Parts of the waste site
are regularly burned by scavengers, resulting in high emissions of dioxins.


Programmes of assistance, primarily from the European Agency of
Reconstruction (EAR), the Danish Agency for Development Assistance
(DANIDA) and German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), have led to significant
improvements in waste collection and disposal since June 1999.


Some of the uncontrolled dumps have been rehabilitated, with open surfaces
now covered and a layer of clay to reduce the infiltration of water into the
site. However, the majority of sites will continue to pollute the groundwater.
These sites are vented, but, owing to their size and the expense involved, none
has a gas extraction system. EAR has financed a program of investments into
the rehabilitation of old uncontrolled landfills and a program of engineered
regional landfills. The key priority will be to ensure that these sites are
licensed and operated in accordance with defined environmental objectives
and set standards.


There are no recycling facilities in Kosovo except for some minor initiatives
for aluminium cans, collected for a small smelter in Janjeva/Janjevo, and a
nonfunctioning paper and plastic recycling plant.


Separation and recycling of potential secondary resources from municipal
waste will not contribute significantly to resource savings without massive
investment in the collection and recycling infrastructure, as well as in public
participation and awareness raising. This is currently well beyond the
available resources. The major gains are to be found in recycling and reusing
commercial and industrial waste. If investment is available it should be
targeted at commerce and industry. Here small investments in waste
minimization and recycling techniques can produce significant reductions in
waste requiring disposal. Schemes targeted at household waste should be
undertaken only when they can be demonstrated to be commercially viable
without large public subsidy.



Pressure Indicators ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

Mines and interviews conducted at the site show that waste have historically
been abandoned/dumped on site, waiting to be re-used or sold out.


There is a lack of awareness of waste management issues such as waste
minimisation, safe storage and handling of waste, waste labelling or

           segregated collection. Actions to prevent open dumping at industrial sites
           should be taken and generated waste should be adequately stored in order to
           prevent soil and groundwater runoff contamination and to allow
           recycling/reuse of secondary raw materials. Existing open dumps need to be
           reclaimed.



3.3.5.2    State

           No specific waste state indicator has been identified. Nevertheless, waste
           issues are directly linked to other state indicators, such as Air quality (see
           Paragraph 3.3.1.2) and Soil quality (see Paragraph 3.3.2.2).


           For the sake of completeness, we remind that Kosovo waste law is devoted to
           protect the environment and human health from pollution and risk of harm
           from waste through environmentally sound waste management by
           establishing conditions for prevention and reduction of waste production and
           its harmfulness.
           In particular, the Waste Law (2005) addresses a number of waste management
           issues including the following:


               ·    Polluter pays principle

               ·    Priorities in waste management: waste reduction, recycle, reuse,
                    thermal treatment (without energy recovery), final disposal.

               ·    Waste classification based on the European Waste Catalogue

               ·    Defines Management Planning documents:

               ·    Waste Management Strategic Plan for Kosovo (Responsibility of
                    Ministry)

               ·    Local Waste Plans (Responsibility of Municipalities)

               ·    Defines Plan for equipment and facilities for waste management

               ·    Defines an operational waste management plant for operators.

               ·    Defines authorizations requirements for transport and storage of waste

               ·    Defines documents to be used for annual declarations

               ·    Defines competent authorities.


           More recent Administrative Instructions address several specific issues. No
           specific regulation relative to hazardous waste management has been
           developed in Kosovo at the present time.



3.3.6      Natural Environment


3.3.6.1    Pressure

           The pressure on nature and biodiversity comes mainly from forest
           exploitation, agriculture, industry and illegal construction.




           ERM ­ ELC - CSA                               THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                   182

Forest exploitation is putting increasing pressure on the long-term
sustainability of Kosovo's forests and their ecosystems. Since the end of the
conflict, the increased need for firewood due to the lack of alternative means
of heating, and timber for reconstruction, has led to uncontrolled and illegal
felling, with the current cut probably twice the sustainable yield. A quarter of
all residents stated during consultations they earn extra income cutting and
selling wood for heating. It is not known whether this is on owned or
communal land (see Paragraph 3.4.9). Uncontrolled and illegal logging has also
increased the risk of erosion in the mountainous areas.


At present, environmental impacts from agriculture are not significant,
because fertilizer and agrochemical use is low. This will change as the rural
economy improves and fertilizers and pesticides use increases.


Likewise, there is not much pollution from industry because of lack of
activity. Nevertheless, former sites of heavy industry remain a source of
environmental pollution, since they are contaminated with metal processing
waste and various chemicals, which are leaking into surface and
groundwater. Particulate from the mines is discussed elsewhere.


Uncontrolled land use and illegal construction also have a marked impact on
biodiversity. Illegal houses have been built on forestland and protected areas,
including in the Sharr/Sar Mountains National Park. In addition, illegal
quarrying is still taking place on a large scale. An overview of the area of
interest should be carried out, to include these illegal activities.


Due to the unavailability of detailed data, it was not possible to quantify the
indicator "Impact on natural habitats".


Landscape ­ Visual Impact

In terms of visual impacts, there are seven dumps located NW, SW, S and SE
of Bardh and Mirash mines, which occupy an area of 10 km2 and contain 260
million m3 of clays and silts and significant amounts of organic materials. The
environmental damage caused by the dumps located outside the mine area is
mainly due to the lack of dump management, questionable long-term geo-
technical stability, and lack of revegetation (e.g. the youngest dump dates
from 1990). Landslides have occurred in the Mirash West pit due to dump
slope instability (which exceed advised height limits - about 10 m - at least 3
times).


Visual estimations show that no more than 10% of the outside dumps have
been recultivated. These dumps constitute a potential source of particulate for
mining workers and the villages of Bardh and Hade, notably during the
summer. At present, there are no plans to start rehabilitation works.


Site inspections carried out in April-May 2003 showed that:

·   although dumps have modified the original landscape, with their
    irregular morphology, the area was not much affected because some of the
    dumps were deposited in valleys;

                   ·   a natural recovery of soils by spontaneous grass vegetation in the dumps
                       improves the local environment; trees and bushes are absent;

                   ·   some small lakes have naturally formed in the valleys between dumps,
                       with typical fishery and wetland plants.


                  In the following are presented some pictures (see Figures 3.3.6.1a ­ 3.3.6.1e) of
                  the typical landscape in the area of interest, considering both the industrial
                  context and the nearest village of Hade.

                  No data are available for the area of interest in terms of impact on natural
                  habitats. An overview of the whole area should be carried out, mainly taking
                  into account the illegal activities ongoing.



     3.3.6.2      State

                  Natural and Protected Areas

                  Kosovo has a high diversity of ecosystems and habitats. Its total protected
                  area is around 46,000 ha, or 4.27% of its territory; according to Kosovo State of
                  the Environment Report 2002, protected areas in Kosovo include 1 national
                  park (39,000 ha), 11 wildlife sanctuaries (700 ha), 38 natural monuments (4,900
                  ha) and 2 protected landscapes (1,700 ha).


                  The area of the Sharr/Sar Mountains was declared a national park by decision
                  of the Assembly of the Province of Kosovo on 28 March 1986. The national
                  park is a mountainous area linked with the Bjeshket e Nemuna/Prokletije
                  Mountains, Durmitor and the coastal Dinara mountains. These mountain
                  ranges, with Sharr/Sar in the middle, represent the Balkan centre of endemic
                  biodiversity. There are more than 2,000 species of vascular flora in the
                  Sharr/Sar Mountain area. That is about 26% of Balkan and 18% of European
                  flora. Analyses of the mountain range show that endemic (about 29%) and
                  sub-endemic taxa (about 10%) are the most numerous, accounting for almost
                  40% of endemic flora of Sharr/Sar. Among its species, 86 have been declared
                  internationally significant, 26 are included in the European Red List of

Globally Threatened Animals and Plants, and 32 are included in the World
Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Plants.
The current tasks are the re-establishment of an effective administration,
immediate remediation measures, the drafting of a priority action programme
and the preparation of a long-term strategy for sustainable integrated
development.


The Bjeshket e Nemuna/Prokletije Mountains are another important site of
European and Balkan biodiversity. The whole massif is known for its floristic
richness with over 750 species of alpine ascular flora, of which 18 are local and
100 Balkan endemic species. In 1985, a proposal was made to make the
Bjeshket e Nemuna/Prokletije Mountains a national park. The Mountains
stretch across the northeast of Kosovo, and into Albania and Montenegro. The
Montenegrin Government has also initiated action to designate them a
national park.

                  The Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning has provided information

                  Poiry study, is presented in Figure 3.3.6.2b. These objects are mostly trees or
                  springs, and were identified in surveys in 2003-2004. None are located within
                  or in the vicinity of the TPP sites.

                  In general, data on natural and protected areas are quite old, and should be
                  updated.



                  Flora and Fauna

                  A field survey of the fauna, flora and habitats in the area of interest was
                  carried out by two biologists in the period 11-15 April 2007.


                  Several excursions were undertaken to the three potential plant sites, at
                  different times of day (early morning, late morning and dusk) to observe as
                  many vertebrates as possible. The flora and vegetation was mapped at the
                  same time, although the time of the year was not optimal for this task. In
                  order to compare and assess the value of the three sites on a national level,
                  visits were made to areas outside of the area of interest as well.




                   ERM ­ ELC - CSA                             THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA

In addition, the vegetation of the following alternative potential sites was
investigated more thoroughly:

    ·    the south-west side of Plemetin (including Kosovo B site);

    ·    environs of Bivolak and Berisha villages (including Bivolak site).


Most species of plants (trees, bushes and herbs) were identified. The natural
plant communities and those resulting from anthropogenic factors were
noted, as were their biotopes. The biotope of which the plant communities
form a part was also identified.
The fauna, vegetation and biotopes for the Kosovo B site and the Bivolak site
were described, including prevalence of typical habitats and environs and
their ecological value (biodiversity, endangered species and habitats as
indicators on a national and European level).
The Kosovo A site was not investigated as it is a wholly industrial area with
no natural values.


The biotopes have a high biodiversity of fauna and flora, indicated by
protected and endangered species at a national level (fide Dr. Schneider-Jacoby,
Euronature), such as the White Stork (Ciconia ciconia) Garganey, (Anas
querquedula), Redshank, (Tringa totanus) and the likelihood of the especially
endangered Corncrake (Crex crex) and Little Bittern (Ixobrychus minutus). The
White Stork, Little Bittern and Corncrake, which are listed in Annex I of the
EU-Wild Birds Directive as endangered species, are not endemic; all three are
found across Europe and parts of Asia as well as elsewhere.


Most of the locations investigated are under anthropogenic influence, i.e.
influenced by man. The majority of meadows and forest vegetation are
managed by agriculture associations.
In the vicinity of villages there is evidence of ruderal vegetation. Natural
biotopes are found close to the Sitnica River and include wet meadows
between Bivolak and Prelluzha, willow forests around the river and other wet
places; other natural biotopes include bushland around Bivolak and the oak
forest west of Bivolak.
A more complete survey of flora and fauna in the area of interest as well as a
specific catalogue of endangered species should be prepared.

                 "Green" areas (including agriculture, forestry and water areas) constitute
                 some 95% of Kosovo's land area. In addition, Kosovo has a great variety in
                 surface types: mountainous, hilly, flat. This means that in principle the
                 conditions for biodiversity are very favourable, provided the environment is
                 kept clean.


                 Nearly 51% of all cultivable land (representing 53% of Kosovo) is used to
                 grow crops, less than 1% is used for vineyards, 45% is pasture land and
                 meadows, and the remaining 2% is planted with fruit trees. About 88% of the
                 agricultural land is privately owned while the rest is socially owned.


                 Forty per cent of the forests are privately owned, while the remaining 60% is
                 under State ownership. The forestry sector has received very little attention in
                 recent years. The wood-processing industry is facing considerable difficulties.
                 The main reasons are the uncertain supply of energy, the unstable supply of
                 logs at competitive prices, the lack of spare parts and the lack of funding.
                 Because of this, production has been badly hampered and the financial
                 situation of the companies is generally poor.

State Indicators ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

Available data on natural and protected areas are quite old, more updated
data should be collected. Also detailed information on the floral and faunistic
population is not available and would be necessary to adequately qualify the
existing situation.
As shown in Table 3.3.6.2b, most of the study area is devoted to agricultural
activities. Nevertheless, this is a subsistence farming with vast areas not
cultivated, also because of the characteristics of the terrains (mainly clay)
which do not allow the development of extensive farming.


Data on the real consistency of agricultural land, cultivated species and
uncultivated areas would be useful to give a correct view of the social
implications of the project.
A discussion on this is attempted in the following sections.

3.4      SOCIO-ECONOMIC BASELINE


3.4.1    Context

         Kosovo is a post conflict country which is still undergoing a process of
         rehabilitation and reconstruction. As such, comprehensive and up to date
         census information on the Sibovc mine area was not readily available. The
         information gathered for this social baseline was drawn from reports and
         discussions with Kosovo government ministries, NGOs, donor organisations
         and affected communities. Whilst these provided an adequate baseline and
         overview for the quantative issues in the area, specific social and economic
         information about residents in the affected area was insufficient. The need for
         additional surveys and consultations was identified during the drafting of the
         first version of the SESA.


         3.4.2   Area of Interest and Population

         Obiliq municipality is located immediately northwest of Prishtina on the main
         road to Mitrovica. It was part of the Prishtina municipality until 1989. The
         municipality now comprises a total of 20 villages including the town of Obiliq
         itself. Primary data has been gathered from ten of the twenty settlements in
         Obiliq municipality. These are Hade, Lajthishte, Dardhishte, Sibovc, Grabovc
         i Poshtem, Shipitulle, Hamidi, Palaj/Crkvena Vodica and Obiliq.


         There are around 5,300 inhabitants in the town of Obiliq, and around 27,000
         inhabitants in rural areas. Population density is variable from one settlement
         to the other. A large proportion of the population are young and settlements
         are divided by ethnicity. Although the majority of the population is Kosovo
         Albanian, villages such as Babimoc/Babin Most, Millosheve/Milosevo,
         Plemetin/Plemetina and Palaj/Crkvena Vodica are mostly inhabited by
         Kosovo Serbs and other non-Albanian ethnic minorities. Obiliq town was also
         a multi-ethnic area before mid-March 2005, but all remaining Kosovo Serbs
         and some Roma have left the town and settled in Plemetin/Plemetina and
         other villages.


         3.4.3 Public Consultation and Stakeholder Identification


         During the preparation of the LPTAP project there was considerable public
         consultation of key stakeholders in order to introduce the project to
         communities in the project area (Environmental and Social Safeguards
         Framework, see Annex C for consultation details). The information gathering
         and public consultation of the project has been staged in three phases:


         ·   Initial key stakeholder definition and identification;


         ·   Initial consultation of key stakeholders, including affected villages and
             communities, to identify potential project impacts and concerns of
             communities; and

                                                195

           ·     Extensive household survey of affected communities and detailed
                 consultation and focus groups to provide a robust and up to date social
                 base line and to explore further the impacts identified during the first
                 phase of the consultation.


           The definition of stakeholder used for identification purposes was taken from
           the Kosovo-based organization's Reiinvest report ­ Community Consultation
           Guidelines for Mining in Kosovo. It states that: "Stakeholders refers to people who
           have an interest in mining activities. This includes people who can influence activities
           , as well as those affected by them. Local communities are themselves stakeholders. but
           stakeholders also include others from outside the local area, such as non-governmental
           organisations, businesses, national government , municipalities and employees from
           outside the community. These broader stakeholders need to be involved in the
           consultation because they may...be responsible for delivering commitments made
           through consultation to ensure that the community has sufficient capacity to get
           involved, or verifying information to ensure that it's credible."


           The first step in the consultation and information gathering process was to
           identify who would be directly and indirectly affected both positively and
           negatively by the project. An initial preliminary stakeholder identification
           was undertaken between January and July 2007 by the Ministry of Mines and
           Energy and the LPATP office (see Annex C for log of consultation).


3.4.3.1    Village Consultations

           As a first step, a series of village consultation meetings was held from October
           22 to November 1, 2007 in Shipitulle, Grabovc i Poshtem, Hade, Sibovc,
           Lajthishte, Plemetin, Dardhishte, Hamidi, and Obiliq. In addition to the
           individual village meetings, the project office held a final meeting with village
           representatives to disclose the findings of the nine village meetings                                         (1), to
           verify information and to discuss key requests of residents. Attendance was
           high, with an average number of seventy people at each meeting. The
           meetings identified key issues that were further explored for the social
           assessment baseline and have informed the methodology of subsequent
           consultations with village communities in the area of interest.




           (1) A complete attendance list for each meeting is available from the LPTAP project office. Specifically, the objectives of

           these initial meetings were to: establish a two-way dialogue, identify key issues of concern and the most appropriate
           methods for future consultations with these communities; indentity specific issues for different community groups,

           especially those who may have been excluded from traditional consultation methods on the basis of ethnicity, age or

           gender; and discuss the key issues and potential impacts of the project.

     3.4.3.2      Stakeholders' Key Issues and Levels of Interest and Influence

                 The stakeholders in this project are quite diverse and have a range of issues
                 that concern them. In order to deliver a more effective consultation
                 programme the Project disaggregated the stakeholders according to their key
                 issues and areas of influence. By doing this the appropriate methodology for
                 each stakeholder can be applied it also ensures that key issues are addressed

from the perspective of those who have raised them and are affected by them.
Equally important is the inclusion of people from less powerful groups or
those who have little influence. For example, during initial consultations the
villagers of Plemetin (a largely Serbian community) stated that the potential
impact of the project was great but that they had little influence or power to
change or mitigate the effect of the project. For this reason the stakeholder
analysis has been refined to map the level of interest and influence that
stakeholders have in relation to the project. These are defined as:


·   Influence- the power a stakeholder has to help, stop or hinder the project


·   Importance ­ the priority given to stakeholder's interests and needs by the
    project


·   Interest ­ the level of interest the stakeholder has in the project.


The key issues of concern for each stakeholder and their levels of influence
and interest in relation to the project respectively are captured in Table 3.4.3.2a
and Table 3.4.3.2b. The information in these tables is based on discussions and
meetings with key stakeholders.

     3.4.4      Household Surveys and Focussed Community Consultation

                In order to address data gaps, LPTAP commissioned two Kosovo-based
                companies (Prism Research and Community Development Fund-CDF) to
                carry out a detailed household survey and ongoing consultation with affected
                communities and villages. The purpose of the household survey was to
                provide accurate and up to date primary social data. Information from the
                household survey was used to supplement the secondary data and to provide
                qualitative information on people's attitudes, perceptions and concerns about
                current and future mine and plant development

                Participants frequently identified community meetings that would represent
                their village's concerns and act as a point of contact between the project and
                the community as good mechanisms for ongoing consultation. In line with
                this expressed interest and with the Community Consultation Guidelines (see
                footnote 8), Community Development Forums have been established for the
                majority of affected communities and have had active participation from
                community members.


     3.4.4.1    Primary Household Survey Methodology

                Prism Research consultancy used the following methodologies for their
                household survey, carried out between January and March 2008:


                ·   Quantitative Survey Research.

                ·   Qualitative Survey Research


                Presented below is a description of the main research components, and the
                order in which the various components were carried out.

     3.4.4.2     Quantitative Research ­ Household Survey

                 Prior to initiation of the field work in each settlement included in the sample,
                 Prism's staff were present at meetings organized with the general community
                 in the respective settlements where the field work took place. The primary
                 aim of these meetings was to inform them about the activities that were
                 planned to commence in their settlement (implementation of a survey and
                 establishing of Community Development Forums). The information
                 pertaining to the survey included background on the methodology that was
                 going to be used, description of the information that the research project was
                 interested to obtain from local inhabitants and agreement with them on the
                 date when the field work could commence. These meetings were facilitated by
                 other stakeholders in the project (primarily Community Development
                 Foundation) and all meetings were generally well attended by local
                 inhabitants.


                 At each meeting there was an opportunity for all participants to pose
                 questions or provide comments they considered relevant for all stakeholders.

                 Method of Interviewing

                 The survey was based on face-to-face interviews. The questionnaire contained
                 both open-ended and closed questions. Interviewers read aloud the closed



                  (1) Whenever the head of the household was not present, the survey was carried out with a person who was appointed by
                  the head of the household (partner, oldest son, etc.). This information (for the substitution of the information-provider)

                  was explained to the general population in the General Community Meetings, where they were informed that they needed

                  to appoint a family member ­ in case they are absent ­ on the given period when interviewers visited each settlement to

                  provide information about the household.
                  (2) Methodology utilized in four locations that are planned to be dislocated (Hade, Dardhishte, Lajthishte and Sibovc)

                  consisted of surveying all households in these locations, whereas for others the approach of random selection was used.

                interviewers only read the question. Throughout the interview, the
                interviewers held a copy of questionnaire on which they recorded the answers
                (please see Annex D for full Prism report).

     3.4.4.3    Community Consultation and Development Forum Methodology

                Following on from the initial consultation in October 2007 The Community
                Development Fund conducted a second phase of consultation between
                February and March 08. The purpose of these meetings was as follows:


                ·   Assist in the implementation of the consultation guidelines (as laid out
                    above);

                ·   Co-ordinate and document the project's consultation with affected
                    communities;

                ·   Assist in the development and implementation of a grievance mechanism;

                ·   Establish and facilitate community development forums;

                ·   Define the roles and responsibilities within the community forums; and

                ·   Liaise with other consultation teams and local authorities to limit
                    information duplication.


                This exercise was a more targeted approach to consultation with the aim of
                consulting with previously identified marginalized groups, such as women
                and youths. A total of 57 community meetings were organized and comprised
                of preliminary, general community and focus group meetings in addition to
                nine forum establishment meetings.

                The meetings were held in Hade, Lajthishte, Dardhishtë, Grabovc, Shipitulle,
                Hamidid, Obiliq, Crkvena Vodica/Janjine Vode and Palaj/Mirash. Two
                additional meetings were organized in Sibovc and Plemetin, but are pending
                or abandoned due to a reported lack of readiness or refusal to participate.


                Establishment of the community forums, including assignment of roles and
                responsibilities, was conducted using a voting procedure. A total of 230
                participants were present in the meetings, each of which averaged between 4-
                10 members.



3.4.5           National Context

                Until February 2008 Kosovo was under a United Nations' (UN) interim
                administration (UNMIK), pursuant to UN security Council Resolution 1244
                (1999) of June 10, 1992, supported by a NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR), and
                with increasingly autonomous Provisional Institutions of Self-Government
                (PISG). Its population of about 2 million inhabitants is among the youngest in
                Europe, with half the population under 25. The population is predominantly
                Albanian. Other ethnic groups represent less than 12 percent of the
                population and are composed predominantly of Serbs, Slav Muslims and
                Roma. Kosovo is also the poorest economy in the Balkans, with a GDP per
                capita of approximately US$790 in 2003 [Source: World Bank Poverty
                Assessment].



   3.4.6        Project Area and Population

                Obiliq municipality is located immediately north-west of Pristina on the main
                road to Mitrovica. The municipality was created in 1989, prior to which it
                formed part of Pristina municipality. It now comprises a total of 20 villages
                including the town itself and the Plemetina camp for internally displaced
                persons (IDPs), which has recently closed. Primary data has been gathered
                from ten of the twenty settlements in Obliq municipality. These are Hade,
                Lajthishte, Dardhishte, Sibovc, Grabovc, Shipihille, Hamidi, Crkvena Vodica,
                Palaj and Obiliq. Table 3.4.6a presents the total number of people and

The population of this municipality is estimated to be around 32,300, but
accurate figures do not exist. There are around 5,300 inhabitants in the town
and around 27,000 inhabitants in rural areas. The average population density
is 304 inh/km² (beyond the Kosovo average). The population density,
although large (304 inh/km²), is variable from one settlement to the other.


The largest concentration of the population is in the urban areas (Source:2006:
Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, "Spatial Analysis of Obliq").
The population is very young with the average age being approximately 24.
Since a population census has not been made since 1981, accurate figures on
gender and ethnic structure and the population age is not available (Spatial
Planning Analysis of Obliq).


Information gathered from the ten surveyed settlements shows that 32% of
the population are aged between 26-45 and 14% are between 19-25 and 46-60
respectively. There is an even split between men and women and just under
half the population (42.5%) is married.


Although the majority of the population is Kosovo Albanian, villages such as
Babin Most/Babimoc, Milosevo/Milloshevë, Plemetin/Plemetina and
Caravodicë/Crkvena Vodica are mostly inhabited by Kosovo Serbs and other
non-Albanian ethnic minorities. Obiliq town was also a multi-ethnic area
before the Mid-March troubles of 2005, but unfortunately, due to the violence,
all remaining Kosovo Serbs and some Roma have fled the town and sought
refuge in Plemetin/Plemetina and other villages inhabited mostly by Kosovo
Serbs [Source: 2005:OSCE `Municipal Profile:Obliq].


Summary - Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

Following years of conflict and ongoing ethnic divisions Kosovo is in the
process of nation building after the declaration of independence from Serbia
in February 2008. Accurate population figures are limited, therefore
identifying trends is not precise. The introduction of a national census would
help to address this and identify the social characteristics of Kosovo.

                 The Project area consists of a large rural population, with varying population
                 density. A large proportion of the population is young and settlements are
                 divided by ethnicity. Information has been gathered for the purpose of this
                 report, however there are a number of gaps and limitations. Ethnic tensions
                 resulted in limited data collection in certain settlements. In order to obtain
                 more in depth data and analysis further study will be required.



     3.4.7       Migration

                 The phenomenon of `depopulation' is prevalent in the Municipality of Obiliq
                 (see Figure 3.4.7a), and specifically accentuated in settlements at greater
                 distances from Obiliq town centre. According to government sources, this is
                 due to the difficult conditions present in these settlements, conditions caused
                 by natural, economic and social factors, undeveloped infrastructure, and poor
                 service levels. Anecdotal evidence from local communities confirms this view.

Figure 3.4.7a    Depopulation




                 The population data, above, shows that after 1999, the greatest depopulation
                 trend took place in the Obiliq town, Dardhishtë (Krushevc) and Hade
                 Villages. A major cause of this depopulation, especially in Obiliq town itself
                 was the dislocation of the non-Albanian population, especially the Serbian
                 population after 1999. The Albanian depopulation phenomenon also affected
                 other settlements including Hade, Krushevc, Grabovc, Bakshi and Kozaricë.
                 The majority of inhabitants of these settlements went to live in Obiliq town
                 after 1999, due to better opportunities for work in Obliq.


                 Economic and social circumstances have resulted in a large population
                 movement towards urban areas, transforming daily and weekly commuters


                 ERM ­ ELC - CSA                               THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA

           into permanent migrants. The migration from the rural areas has impacted
           rural areas as the young and educated labour force move into towns
           abandoning agricultural land and causing a decline in the number of
           marriages and births. Urban areas have also been affected as immigration has
           increased property prices, raised the cost of living and lead to unplanned and
           uncontrolled expansion of towns and cities. (2006: Ministry of Environment
           and Spatial Planning, "Spatial Analysis of Obliq").



3.4.7.1    Returnees

           According to UNHCR information, there are currently 8,615 persons
           originally from this municipality displaced in Serbia and Montenegro and 170
           people in FYR Macedonia. By December 2003 635 internally displaced persons
           (IDPs) had returned to their place of origin. Many Kosovo Serbs and Ashkali
           IDP families have shown a genuine interest in returning. A Municipal
           Working Group on Returns (MWGR) has been established to improve the
           `returns' coordination process. Riots in March 2004 increased the number of
           IDPs. All remaining urban Kosovo Serbs, and some Roma, fled and their
           properties were burned or vandalized. The activity of the MWGR was
           suspended for more than two months, but has now resumed. The
           reconstruction process of the damaged and the burned houses, and also of the
           apartment buildings in this Municipality has been mostly finished, with the
           exception of some 20 families who have returned to the so called "School
           centre" and five families that have returned to their newly reconstructed
           houses, there is no major return of the March IDPs.


           In February 2005, Municipal authorities of Obiliq and Kosovo's PISG, together
           with the municipalities of Mitrovica, Fushë Kosovë, Srbica and Lipjan began
           implementing an agreement to remove IDPs from the Plemetin camp back
           into the municipality of their origin. Each municipality will be responsible for
           providing accommodation for their residents [2005: OSCE `Municipal Profile:
           Obliq].


           Summary - Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

           Conflict in and around the Project area have lead many people to flee the area.
           A working group has been established to try to assist the process of returning
           displaced people to their original settlements. Riots in 2004 temporary
           disrupted this process, however work has now resumed.



3.4.8      Cultural Properties


           There are eight mosques in the municipality; two are located in Obiliq town,
           while six are in villages with an Imam as leader of the municipality's Islamic
           Union. A new mosque was recently built in 2005, in the centre of Obiliq town.
           There are also small Serbian Orthodox churches in the villages of Babin
           Most/Babimoc and Plemetin/Plemetina, covered by the same Orthodox
           priest. During the March 2004 events the Serbian Orthodox Church in Obiliq

                   town was severely damaged. There is also a House of Culture in the
                   municipality owned by the Kosovo Energy Corporation (KEK), but it is not
                   functioning and needs renovation [2005: OSCE `Municipal Profile: Obliq].

         Summary - Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

         There are a number of cultural properties located within the municipality, the
         majority of which are centred around religious buildings. There are a number
         of war memorials and monuments, but only one youth centre for the whole
         population.



3.4.9    Economic Environment

         Prior to the 1999 conflict, KEK was the main source of employment in the
         area, through its two main power stations, service provision, and facility
         building and maintenance. KEK is still an important employer in the
         municipality and owns the Ambulance, Culture House, Sports Ground, Fire
         Station, and other properties.


         Based on the number of jobseekers registered by the municipal employment
         office, the unemployment rate in Obiliq is around 16%. However, this figure
         only represents those registered and is based on available population figures,
         which are not up to date. The real figure is likely to be higher as the majority
         of jobseekers do not register (2006: MESP, "Spatial Analysis of Obiliq").
         Evidence suggests that the municipal figure is as high if not higher than the
         national average (41.4%, as reported in 2006 Report of the Statistical Office of
         Kosovo), and the figure differs across settlements.


         Information gathered from the ten surveyed settlements showed that 21% of
         the population are permanently employed and 13% of those employed work
         for KEK. 19% of the population are housewives and 17% were unemployed.
         The economic base of Obiliq is sustained by the large mine. However, levels
         of employment and support by KEK have been reduced and the municipality
         has suffered economically as a result, particularly Kosovo Serbs who have
         been unable to resume work since the conflict. According to the household
         survey, alternative income generation in the area is limited. A quarter of all
         residents earn extra income cutting and selling wood for heating. Agricultural
         production for income generation is focused on a small number of
         settlements.


         As a result of poor economic and employment opportunities in the area 23%
         of the surveyed population reported that they do not have enough money to
         buy food and 16% consider that they live a "hand to mouth" existence, which
         equates to living on the poverty line. A further 40% stated that they have
         enough food, but do not have enough income to buy clothes. There were few
         differences noted between the urban and rural population, the only marked
         difference is in the perception of income generation: 42% of the urban
         population believed they earn below the average income, whereas this figure
         is 36% for the rural population. However, the rural population is more likely
         to live at or near the poverty line. Incomes vary, but the highest proportion of
         the population (33%) earn between 101-250 Euros a month. The remaining

                                                 213

22% earn 251-500 Euros/month, 16% earn 51-100 Euros/month, 11% earn
over 501 Euros a month and the remaining 8% earn between 30-50 Euros
monthly.


Summary - Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

The municipality has a high unemployment rate and alternative sources of
income are limited. Income levels are low and most inhabitants are reliant on
subsistence farmed for some, if not all, of their food supply. Additional
income is generated through agricultural production, wood cutting and small
scale farming.


The Project would provide limited paid employment for some residents,
however, economic advantages are limited for most.


3.4.10 Land Use and Potential Loss

According to data obtained from the DBKO, the Municipality is spread out
over a total of 1.0531 ha of land, 6.677 ha is privately owned and 3.854 ha is
communal. The GIS Analysis shows that 48% of the Obiliq Municipality
territory is agricultural land and 37% is forestry (see Paragraph 3.3.2 for further
detail regarding land use). Ownership and usage varies across settlements.
All residents own land around their houses or `yards' on which 80-97% grow
crops and cereals for household consumption. 38.7% of the surveyed
settlements also owned arable land and fields. The highest was found in
Shipitulle where 92% of population own arable land and 84% own forests. A
large proportion of residents in Hamidi, Lajthishte, Sibovc and Palaj also own
arable land. It was found that the largest land ownership in terms of area was
in Palaj.


Land ownership is often based around traditional forms of transferral. There
is no formal sale and oral or written agreements are not officially registered.
It is common for land to be transferred along family lines, passing from father
to son or grandfather to grandson. For this reason the land officially
registered to an inhabitant is often less than the land they own. The majority
of land is owned in close proximity of residents and renting of land is not a
common practice in the area.


The New Mining Field area is mainly inhabited by large families who work in
agricultural enterprises or independently as subsistence farmers.
Approximately 60% of the population living in the region are farmers. The
production and sale of agricultural products is cited as an important source of
income support by local residents. The area of interest is representative of the
municipality as agriculture and forestry are the most important forms of land
use, although their importance is decreasing.


The new mine will acquire approximately 13% of the territory of the Obiliq
Municipality. This area, planned for mining development, is largely

          composed of fertile land, while the remaining parts are settlements, roads or
          forests (2006: MESP, "Spatial Analysis of Obiliq").
          Summary ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

          A large proportion of land is used for agricultural purposes (48%) followed by
          forestry (37%). Land ownership varies between settlements, but the majority
          of residents own the land they inhabit and a `yard' area used for subsistence
          farming. The Project will acquire most of the fertile land in the surrounding
          area.


          There is no information at this stage on how communities will be
          compensated for the loss of land, as this is dependent on the designed project.
          Compensation for any lost land is especially important due to the reliance on
          agricultural production for both subsistence farming and as an additional
          source of income. This should be taken into consideration during the decision
          making process and project planning.



3.4.11    Resettlement

          At present, the old resettlement law dates back to the Serbian era and is still
          applicable. A new law is only available in a draft version. Therefore, all issues
          relevant to resettlement have to be decided by the Parliament, which can be a
          lengthy process. In order to ensure the legal bases of lignite extraction and
          future land purchase, it is necessary to declare the Sibovc field a reserved
          mining area. This pre-requisite was established with the UN-Resolution
          dated 18.11.2004 when The Special Representative of the UN-Secretary-

          of special interest and property assessment criteria have been devised, all of
          which are included in Executive decision No. 2004/28 of the 18th of Nov
          2004" (Source: "Complementary Mining Plan for Sibovc SW - Part III ­
          Environmental Assessment", European Agency for Reconstruction, STEAG
          Consortium, 2006).


          Respondents who saw the possible need to move away from the area due to
          the project as a problem were the most numerous in Hamidi (43%) and Obiliq
          (39%) and least numerous in Dardhishte (16%). Also, Palaj/Crkvena Vodica
          and Hade had the greatest number of respondents who said that introduction
          of significant limitations on construction of new or reconstruction of old
          buildings related to the building of Kosovo C would be a problem (54% and
          49%). Shipitulle had the least number of respondents supporting the latter
          opinion (12%).


          Most participants in the focus groups supported the idea of resettlement, as
          all the villages included in the focus groups experience negative impacts from
          the current power plant on their lives. In this regard, the explicit request
          coming from the majority of focus group respondents in two settlements,
          Hade and the Serb community living in Crkvena Vodica, was immediate
          relocation of all households living in these two villages. Their request comes
          as a result of current pollution levels, extensive noise coming from current

              activities at the power plant and insecurity about the future progress of the
              new mine. Respondents from Grabovc i Poshtem/Lagja e Berisheve also
              indicated a great need for immediate action, as KEK's excavator is operating
              very near their houses and the noise coming from this operation is continuous
              and causes frustration.


  3.4.11.1    Hade

              The village of Hade has a population about 2,500 inhabitants and is located at
              the northern edge of the Bardh/ Mirash mine. The village is situated above a
              steep slope and there is a danger of it sliding into the mine. In the interest of
              public safety and lignite supply security, a total of 158 families (664
              individuals) from the village were resettled between 2004-2005.


              All inhabitants of Hade, especially the families living close to the mine edge,
              were informed about the necessity of resettlement (see Box 3.3). A safety
              (emergency) zone was declared around their land and 65 families were
              ordered by UNMIK in March 2004 to vacate the zone by December 2004. Last
              registration of property of the village Hade (dated 22.05.2003) was enforced
              by the Independent Housing Inspection Team and 22 families were forcibly
              removed in June 2005.



Box 3.3       Hade Resettlement


              Due to potential slope failure, part of the village of Hade had to be urgently evacuated. There
              are 85 resettled families living in temporary accommodation in Obiliq town; others (mainly
              landowning non-residents) have been compensated in the form of a cash payment. There are
              495 families remaining on the site who will need to be resettled before the planned mining
              works and safety measures can continue. Group discussions showed that the remaining
              residents of Hade are keen to be resettled as a group. Conditions for those still occupying the
              village are poor, with 26% earning significantly below average income and 21% living on less
              that 30 Euros a month. Environmental conditions are also a leading factor. The close proximity
              of the mine results in impacts from noise, particulate and safety issues related to the large
              trucks traveling on local roads.




              Eighty-five of the resettled families are living in temporary accommodation in
              Obiliq town, others (mainly landowning non-residents) have been
              compensated in the form of a cash payment. There are 495 families remaining
              on the site who will need to be resettled before the planned mining works and
              safety measures can continue. Group discussions showed that the remaining
              residents of Hade are keen to be resettled. Conditions for those still
              occupying the village are poor, with 26% earning significantly below average
              income and 21% living on less that 30 Euros a month. Environmental
              conditions are also a leading factor. The close proximity of the mine results in
              impacts from noise, dust and safety issues resulting from large trucks
              travelling on local roads (for environmental baseline information on noise,
              and dust please see Sections 3.3.1.1 and 3.3.4).

          Summary ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

          Resettlement has already had an extremely adverse impact on the community
          of Hade and it is expected that other settlements will be resettled as a result of
          project activities. There are mixed views among local residents regarding
          future resettlement. Certain settlements are in favour of a move due to poor
          environmental and social conditions in their current location.
          Prior to any future resettlement it is recommended that a full Resettlement
          Action Plan is conducted. The aim of this is to minimise future negative
          impacts and gain an understanding of the issues facing communities.
          Additional data collection will be used to adequately compensate affected
          communities and work to enhance positive impacts.



3.4.12    Employment

          According to Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare's Department of Labour
          and Employment the national unemployment figure for registered job seekers
          is 42% (Source: 2006: Department of Labour and Employment `Annual
          Report').


          Based on the number of jobseekers registered as unemployed by the
          Employment office at a municipal level, the unemployment rate in Obiliq is
          around 16%. However, this figure only represents the number of unemployed
          registered by the employment office and is based on available population
          figures, which are not kept up to date. The real figure is likely to be higher as
          the majority of jobseekers do not register at the office (2006: Ministry of
          Environment and Spatial Planning, "Spatial Analysis of Obliq"). Evidence
          suggests that the Municipal figure is as high if not higher than the national
          average, and the figure differs across settlements. Figure 3.4.12a represents the
          different levels of unemployment across the Obiliq municipality.

Figure 3.4.12a   Unemployment Rates in Obiliq Municipality




                  The above figure suggests that the highest rate of unemployment is found in
                  the villages of: Breznica, Obiliq, Plemetin and Kozaricë. The factors affecting
                  the high unemployment rate are different and they may be classified into
                  three groups, physical-geographical (natural conditions), economic and social,
                  as follows.


                  ·   Physical-geographical factors ­ hilly-mountainous areas.


                  ·   Economic factors have a direct impact on the high unemployment rate in
                      these areas. Economic activities exist only at a lower level in these areas.
                      They also enjoy less agricultural land areas, less developed infrastructure,
                      and are characterized by a smaller number of trade activities and other
                      businesses.


                  ·   Social factors such as poor education (especially among women), large
                      families and a mainly agricultural population, are also contributory factors
                      to unemployment (2006: Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning,
                      "Spatial Analysis of Obiliq").


                 Information gathered from the ten surveyed settlements showed that 21% of
                 the population are permanently employed and 13% of those employed work
                 for KEK. 19% of the population are housewives and 17% were classed as
                 unemployed. As mentioned in the previous section agricultural production is
                 an important source of income for the local population and the majority of the
                 population are involved either commercially or more commonly for

                  ERM ­ ELC - CSA                              THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA

           subsistence purposes. The lack of permanent employment is substituted with
           casual or part time work and remittances from relatives working abroad.


           Summary ­ Comments on Available Data Suggestions

           Official figures on unemployment rates in the municipality are lower than
           estimated. Both national and regional unemployment rates are high with less
           than a quarter of the local population permanently employed.


           Methods used for collecting data on unemployment mean that only those
           registered as unemployed are recorded. This is a distorted figure due to the
           nature of income generation in Kosovo and a high dependence on subsistence
           farming in the project area.



3.4.13      Infrastructure


3.4.13.1    Roads

           Regional roads connect larger settlements and the majority are asphalted. Due
           to the high level of usage they constantly require rehabilitation and
           maintenance. Only a small number of regional roads connect to the
           Municipality of Obiliq (2006: Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning,
           "Spatial Analysis of Obliq").


           The local road network is good with 150 kilometres of roads connecting
           villages and towns throughout the municipality. However, road conditions
           are poor with only 30 paved roads and the majority of these are heavily pot-
           holed. From a total of 20 settlements of the municipality, only 8 settlements
           have asphalted roads (main and regional roads), or 40% of settlements.
           Outside Obiliq town, paved roads are only found near other population
           centres while the rest are connected by dirt and gravel roads. At least three
           villages are effectively cut off during periods of extended rain and heavy
           snow.


           The main road M2 Prishtina-Mitrovica passes through the Municipal territory.
           This road connects the municipality of Obiliq and its centre with other
           municipalities, such as Prishtina and Vushtrri. The M2 road is asphalted, but
           like all regional roads it has been damaged over time and requires constant
           repair due to volumes of heavy traffic. Settlements which are served by the
           main M2 Prishtina-Mitrovica road are: Bainoc, Miloshevë, Llazarevë, Mazgit
           and Shkabaj.


           A further issue arose during the household surveys related to KEK related
           traffic. Respondents complained that local roads are not safe to travel on as
           they are frequently used by KEK transport vehicles (see Sections 3.2.1, 3.3.1.1).
           The condition of the roads is not suitable for this type of vehicle and the level
           of usage.

            Summary ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

            There is a well developed road network around the project site, however road
            conditions and quality are poor. Local roads are unable to cope with large
            vehicles and volumes of traffic. A full traffic assessment has not been
            conducted, therefore accurate data on traffic numbers and future road
            improvement projects are not available.



3.4.13.2    Public Transport

            Public transport services with bus and mini-vans are provided to 14
            settlements, or 65% of settlements, while 7 settlements, or 35%, do not have
            access to public transport. The public transport service for the municipal
            territory is relatively satisfactory, although not provided to all settlements.
            The settlements with access to public transport are: Obiliq (New and Old
            Obiliq), Palaj, Hade, Lajthishtë, Sibofc, Hamidi, Muzakaj, Raskovë, Bakshi,
            Llazarevë, Breznicë, Kozaricë, Shkabaj. Settlements without access to public
            transport are: Mazgit I, Mazgit II, Dradhishtë, Shipitullë, Grabovc, Plemetin,
            Bajmoc (2006: Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, "Spatial
            Analysis of Obliq").


            The issue of public transport was raised during the household surveys.
            Although a large percentage of those surveyed have access to public transport
            (82%), rural households face problems due to a lack of provision or irregular
            service. 23% of the surveyed population have issues with the distance of
            public transport stops. The average walking time to transport stops is 23
            minutes, but residents of reported a walking time of 37 minutes.


            Summary ­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

            Around two thirds of the settlements within the Project Area are connected to
            the public transport system. Rural settlements often experience difficulty
            accessing the available transport and often complain about the irregular
            service and or the distance between stops.



3.4.13.3    Electricity Supply

            Electricity supply is provided by KEK. However, despite the fact that the sole
            location of electricity generation capacity is within Obiliq's territory itself,
            there are shortages and deficiencies in electricity supply. The supply grid is
            rather outdated. The duration of daily electricity supply cuts varies from zone
            to zone, with the average daily reduction being 3 hours. According to
            information from municipal institutions, all settlements have electricity
            transformer stations. 16 settlements have a normal voltage in electricity
            supply, while 5 settlements have a poorer supply (2006: Ministry of
            Environment and Spatial Planning, "Spatial Analysis of Obliq").

            Summary­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

            Electricity supply is intermittent and unreliable despite the close proximity of
            KEK. All settlements have access to electricity, but the system is in need of
            repair and 5 settlements are classed as having a poor supply.



3.4.13.4    Water Supply

            The main water supplies in the municipality are the Batllava Company and
            the Regional Water Supply Company of Prishtina or `Prishtina' Water Supply.
            Prishtina supply water to 13 settlements, or 65% of settlements. Not all
            households within these 13 settlements are connected to the local water
            supply, as only 60% of the population is provided with water from these
            systems (for further information on water supply please see Sections: 3.2.1,
            3.3.3.1).


            Settlements which are supplied from the regional public water supply system
            in Prishtina, and the municipal systems, are: Obiliq, Mazgit 1, Mazgit 2,
            Dardhishtë, Palaj, Hade, Lajthishtë, Plemetin, Muzakaj, Raskovë, Bashki,
            Llazarevë and Shkabaj.


            The water quality is good in these settlements. The municipal water supply
            system has a capacity of 42 l/sec. The supply, despite experiencing
            restrictions, is at a satisfactory level. Small or remote villages do not have
            access to the main water supply system due to infrastructure neglect, damage,
            or lack of access. This is a particular problem for villages in the west of the
            municipality where the quality of water is poor and much of the population
            has to fetch their supplies. Many villages also suffer from the lack of an
            adequate sewage system, which poses a threat to basic health and hygiene
            [2005: OSCE `Municipal Profile: Obliq].


            The most frequent shortages occur during the summer season and villagers
            are often reluctant to drink the well water from fear of contamination.
            Contamination is also an issue for the inhabitants of the cities due to the age
            of the water supply network.


            Water supply from wells is used in 7 settlements, or 35% of municipal
            settlements. The ground water is generally of good quality and reaches the
            minimum standard for drinking water. This is not true for the settlements
            close to KEK facilities, such as Hade, Lajthishtë and Hamidi where
            groundwater has been contaminated (please see Sections: 3.2.1, 3.3.3). The
            settlements using wells are: Shipitullë, Grabovc, Sibovc, Hamidi, Kozaricë,
            Bajmoc and Breznicë.


            According to municipal sources, investment has been made in the distribution
            and expansion of the water supply systems in the Municipality of Obiliq.
            These investments include:

          A priority objective of the municipality is installation of water supply grids in
          villages of Sibovc, Breznicë, Kozaricë and Babimoc. Development of a water
          production facility in the Obiliq territory is also proposed.


          The water supply for the whole of the Kosovo is an issue as only around 50-
          60% of the population is supplied with water from water supply systems and
          for those using other sources water quality is unknown (2006: Ministry of
          Environment and Spatial Planning, "Spatial Analysis of Obliq").


          Summary­ Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

          Not all of the 13 settlements in the local area are connected to the main water
          supply due to infrastructure neglect, damage or lack of access. Those that are
          connected are provided with good quality water. The alternative water
          supply for those not connected is often of a poor standard as local waterways
          have been contaminated by environmental pollution. Improvements to the
          local water supply system are a priority for the Municipality. Specific data on

          Health care facilities are divided along ethnic lines. Three health centres
          cover the Kosovo Serb population from the villages of Babin Most/Babimoc,
          Plemetin/Plemetina, and Caravodicë/Crkvina Vodica. An additional three
          health centres cover the Kosovo Albanian population from the villages of
          Breznicë/Breznica, Siboc/Sibovac and Milosevo/Milloshevë. The main
          primary family health centre in Obiliq/Obili Municipality provides health
          care services for all patients from the whole population of the municipal
          geographical area (2005: OSCE Municipal Profile ­ Obliq).


          Information gathered from the household surveys showed that the five main
          health issues affecting communities are: respiratory diseases, heart and lung
          disease, cancer, mental health problems and diabetes. Respiratory diseases
          are the most prevalent health issue in Hade, Palaj and Grabovc, all of which
          are in close proximity to the existing Kosovo A and B sites. However, 38% of
          all respondents are smokers. Cancer was cited as being the most common

          cause of death for residents of Dardhishte and Sibovc. Twenty-six per cent of
          all respondents stated that they or members of their household had
          experienced serious health problems in the last 5 years (Source: 2008: Prism
          Research LPTAP Household Survey).


          The surveyed communities reported that when experiencing health problems
          (of any kind) 50% visited a doctor in the local medical facility, 39% were
          treated at a hospital and 21% received treatment from a private doctor. The
          reasons sited for limited access and not seeking health care were the cost of
          transport, mistrust of health care providers, previously received a poor service
          and the cost.


          Summary - Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

          Health care facilities are ethnically divided with both Serb and Albanian
          Kosovans having access to three health care centres. The main centre at
          Obiliq serves all ethnic groups from the surrounding area and municipality as
          a whole. Local communities reported the major health care issues affecting
          them are respiratory disease, heart and lung disease and cancer. The main
          factors limiting access to health care are poor infrastructure and transport
          links and cost.



3.4.15    Education

          The schools in the municipality are separated by age groups, with the
          exception of a Kosovo Albanian school, which opened in Plemetin in 2000 and
          operates under a shift system. There is one Kosovo Albanian high school in
          Obiliq town and seven Kosovo Albanian primary schools situated in Plemetin
          Milosev, Babin, Hade and Breznica. Approximately 5,240 pupils attend school
          within the municipal area (Source: Municipal Education Department cited in
          (2005: OSCE Municipal Profile ­ Obliq).


          Details about the levels of education of the residents in the mine development
          area are not well documented, however, anecdotal evidence from discussions
          with villagers would suggest that there is a significant number of people, both
          women and men educated at the tertiary level with skills in engineering,
          teaching, electrical maintenance and languages               (1)
                                                                         .


          Figure 3.4.15a shows the level of education in the surveyed settlements. 40%
          of respondents completed secondary education (all 4 grades), but very few
          residents went onto higher education with only 2.2% completing education to
          degree level. 21% of the population did not progress past primary school
          level education.

                 Summary - Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

                 There is limited information on education levels by settlement, however local
                 levels suggest that a high percentage of the local population complete
                 secondary school education. A small number go on to tertiary level
                 education, however, many in the wider area are trained teachers, engineers
                 and electrical maintenance.



     3.4.16      Social Networks

                 When asked about socialising and social interactions, surveyed communities
                 stated that they did not believe there were any major differences between
                 residents within a community and that all residents were closely connected.
                 All communities socialised on a regular basis, often sharing meals with
                 friends or neighbours. Sixty per cent of respondents had shared a meal with
                 someone of a different social or economic status in the last 30 days.
                 Differences between urban and rural populations were small. Socializing
                 with someone of a different religion or ethnic group was more likely in urban
                 areas than rural, but both are rare. Respondents felt that they could rely on
                 the community to help in times of need.


                 Summary - Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

                 Social networks are important to local communities with many settlements
                 centred around family groups. A large proportion of the population regularly
                 socialize with their neighbours and often sharing a meal.

     3.4.17      Community Aspirations, Attitudes and Concerns and Consultation

                 Initial village community meetings were held during October 2007. The main
                 objectives of these meetings were to gather some preliminary information
                 about the concerns and current situation of people living and working in the
                 Sibovc mine development area and to inform the design of the detailed
                 household survey and consultation. The meetings also provided local
                 residents with key project information and details of how their specific
                 community would be affected by the power plant mine development                                              (1)
                                                                                                                                .
                 Table 3.4.17a provides a summary of key outcomes and issues raised in all
                  meetings. Subsequent Tables 3.4.17b-i provide details with an explanatory
                  narrative of issues raised in individual villages.

                 As mentioned in the previous sections eight focus group meetings were
                 conducted in March 2008 in addition to household surveys. There were two
                 general public meetings in Hade and Lajhishte, two youth group in Hade and
                 Grabovc, two women focus groups in Hade and Dardhishte and two minority
                 community meetings in Crkvena Vodica. Each focus group had between 8 to
                 10 participants.


                 In addition to focus group meetings the Community Development Fund
                 conducted meetings in nine of the affected communities: Hade, Lajthishte,
                 Dardhishte, Grabovc, Shiptulle, Hamidi, Crkvena Vocica and Janjine Vode
                 and Palaj and Mirash. A total of 230 people participated in the meetings. The
                 findings from these meetings are in line with the previous findings from
                 October 07 meetings. The most common issues and concerns are detailed in
                 Table 3.4.17a.

                  Although certain project concerns were more prevalent in some communities
                  than others, there were general points raised in all the public consultations.
                  96% of all participants were informed about the upgrade to the project site,
                  however, the level of detail varied. Most public meetings were attended by
                  the heads of households and/or men, therefore women and youths tended to
                  be less informed. 31% want to be told information by the municipality
                  authority representatives, 22% wanted representatives from the mine, 16%
                  favoured public meetings/gatherings and 13% wanted to be informed via
                  television. 67% of the total population want to take part in the project
                  planning process.


                  Half the populations of Grabovc, Hade and Lajthishte strongly support the
                  project and believe it will bring positive economic impacts. Hade also
                  believes that the project will have a positive economic impact and 83% of all
                  participants believe the project will create employment opportunities.


                  Although the project gains support due to the expectation that it will have a
                  positive impact on the local economy and employment opportunities many
                  residents feel there will be negative impacts. 58% of all residents believe the
                  project will have a negative impact on the environment and in Hamidi this
                  figure rises to 77%. One participant from Crkvena Vodica stated:


                         " Pollution with the old power plants is enormous. Since the new
                         power plant will also use coal to produce electricity, then it will not
                         have any positive impact in the environment, and on the health of the
                         people living here."

                 There is concern that the current pollution problem will increase and the area
                 will become uninhabitable. 23% of the Dardhishte population strongly
                 opposes the project and a further 27% view the project as very negative.
                 Other issues brought up during focus group meetings include the concern
                 that employment opportunities will not favour local workers and that they
                 will have to put up with pollution and poor environmental conditions
                 without gaining any benefits.


                 Resettlement was favoured by some, but not by others. 66% of the total
                 population surveyed believes resettlement will not create a problem, 33%
                 believed it will be a problem. Resettlement is a concern for some as
                 communities do not want to be split from each other, which makes them feel
                 insecure.


                 Individual settlement concerns are further discussed in Table 3.4.17b to Table

Employment                                 ·  According to residents 225 people have applied to KEK for work and only 5 people have been             High
                                              employed. Residents feel that they suffer from discrimination. Have a very high unemployment rate.
                                              Many people requested guaranteed employment of 230 people by KEK.

                                           ·  People are supportive of Kosovo C as they hope it will be more efficient and cleaner than Kosovo A
                                              and B.


Infrastructure (sewage and roads)          Residents believe that Grabovc suffered the worst impacts of the war and that nothing has been properly    High
                                           rehabilitated since the war. They claim there is no sewage system ­ one was constructed in 2006 but has
                                           not been completed. Raw sewage leaks onto the road. Requests for KEK to mend the roads


Air pollution                              People said that they have been negatively impacted by the mine since 1963. Dust is a big issue for them   Medium
                                           and asked why the power plants A and B do not have filters to decrease the pollution.


Resettlement                               Because of the noise and dust pollution people want to be resettled immediately. Some claim that people    Medium
                                           are concerns about the cancer risk of living in the area and that some residents have already moved away




Compensation                               People want adequate compensation from 2003 damage. Compensation of 9,000Euros per hectare was            High
                                           paid, which they believe is inadequate. People also want compensation for damaged property caused by
                                           landslides and general tectonic movement.

Project Participation                       ·    Residents would like to have a memorandum of understanding between the village and the project      High
                                                 in order to discuss and resolve some of these key concerns and to be kept up to date one issue and
                                                 to identify roles and responsibilities of communities and the project.

                                            ·    People have not been consulted under old the regime. According to the municipal assembly 70% of

Summary - Comments on Available Data and Suggestions

Community knowledge of the proposed project is generally high, although
the level of detailed knowledge varies. There are a number of common
concerns with employment and environmental pollution being the most
frequent. Generally, communities are in favour of the project and hope that it
will bring with it economic and employment opportunities. Most
communities believe that it is unlikely that the project will result in
improvements to local pollution and environmental damage.


Focus groups were not formed in two villages and a number of communities
were not fully consulted. In the case of the focus groups there were two main
reasons: refusal to participate in a democratic voting system or lack refusal to
participate in focus group meetings. Consultation was limited due to some
hostility towards the data collection team by some communities, who did not
want to take part in the household survey.

     4.1.1       The Energy Sector


     4.1.1.1     Energy Production and Demand

                 Historically, energy and mining were mainstays of the Kosovo economy,
                 providing direct and indirect employment, sources of revenue, export
                 earnings, and inputs to downstream industries.
                 However, from being a contributor to economic growth, the power sector has
                 become a drain on public resources. In addition, unreliable electricity supply
                 has emerged as one of the main obstacles to growth. Kosovo continues to
                 suffer from regular electricity black-outs.
                 Surveyed companies in Kosovo reported the lack of reliable electricity supply
                 as the main barrier to their operations, causing losses of sales and additional
                 costs for purchasing and operating generators.
                 The electricity sector in Kosovo has been dominated for a long period by
                 Korporata Energjetike e Kosovës - KEK, a vertically integrated system
                 composed of two lignite mines at Bardh and Mirash, two lignite fired power
                 plants Kosovo A and B, with an overall effective capacity of 645 to 710 MW
                 (from an installed capacity of 1478 MW), and the Ujmani HPP, with an
                 installed capacity of 35 MW, transmission and dispatching system,
                 distribution network and supply.
                 In recent times an unbundling process has taken place, with the formation of
                 two joint associations, namely KEK sh.a and KOSTT sh.a.
                 Table 4.1.1.1a and 4.1.1.1b, extracted from the Poyry study on the electric

                  It may be noticed the very high amount of the transmission and distribution
                  losses, which can be partly (about 18%) attributed to technical reasons, but for
                  the remaining portion are related to non technical reasons, such as illegal
                  connections and metering problems.
                  The most comprehensive forecasts of electricity demand in Kosovo are
                  available in key publications such as the ESTAP1 and GIS2 studies. The
                 forecast from each of these sources have been used to put in context the
                 supply/demand balance for the coming years.
                 The Poyry study3 (see Table 2.1.1.1c) represents the most recent forecast,
                 extending to the year 2020, and prepared on the assumption of a medium
                 growth scenario (MGS).
                 Technical losses are expected to decrease from the present level of 18% to 13%
                 in 2020, while non technical losses, included within the "electricity
                 consumption" item, are expected to drop within the same year from 29% to
                 5%.

                  demand


                  Under the same MGS hypothesis, the maximum capacity demand is expected
                  to reach a level of close to 1,400 MW in 2020. This would correspond to a Load
                  Factor of 0.51 (well below the potential Load Factor of the TPPs), wherefore it
                  can be stated that the reported value of capacity makes allowance for reserves
                  and maintenance.


                  In the high growth scenario (HGS), on the other hand, the total electricity
                  demand is expected to reach 8,477 MW in the year 2020 and the maximum
                  capacity demand almost 1,900 MW in the same year.


                  Regardless of the actual future level of growth, it is evident that a very
                  significant gap exists between electrical generation capacity and demand.
                  Even assuming that Kosovo B can continue operation beyond the year 2020,
                  the new Kosovo C plant would need to dedicate close to 1,000 MW of
                  available capacity just to satisfy the demand of the whole Kosovo. Another
                  important element to be underlined is the fact that industry and services
                  demand is expected to grow at a much higher rate than the households one.
                  This means that an adequate supply of electricity represents a basic
                  requirement for the economic development of the country.


                  As refers to the integration of the Kosovo electrical system within the regional
                  context of South Eastern Europe (SEE), a strategy has been developed to
                  create modern and efficient energy infrastructure networks (for electricity, oil
                  and gas), in order to ensure that the energy system of the region can meet the
                  energy demands of each country. The development of energy infrastructures
                  should therefore ensure an adequate supply of energy, the region's security of
                  supply and the necessary interconnection between the region and the
                  neighbouring systems. It should also develop interconnections of regional
                  interest within SSE, achieve lower prices for consumers and create
                  opportunities for investments.

                 For this purpose, in November 20021, UNMIK signed the Athens
                  Memorandum of Understanding for the establishment of the Regional
                  Electrical Energy Market in South Eastern Europe. In December 2003, UNMIK
                  signed the second Memorandum of Understanding, including the
                  establishment of the regional gas market and the proposal for a common
                  approach on environment.


                  In October 2005 UNMIK, on behalf of PISG, signed, together with the
                  European Union and eight other parties of SEE (Croatia, Bosnia and
                  Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, FYROM, Albania, Romania and Bulgaria)
                  the Treaty relevant to the Energy Community of the South Eastern Europe
                  (ECSEE), due to create a legal framework for an integrated energy market.
                  In this aspect, the Kosovo Government is facing a huge challenge to develop
                  the energy sector for a short and medium term in order to:


                  ·   Comply with all commitments put forward for the establishment and
                      operation of the Energy Community, and at the same time

                  ·   Qualify for exploitation of all opportunities that come out from its
                      involvement in the Regional Energy Market of South Eastern Europe.


                 As refers to the complete range of energy sources besides electricity, the
                 figures of Table 4.1.1.1d, derived from the ESTAP I study2, show the primary
                 energy consumption of Kosovo in the years 2000 and 2015 (projected).

                  As shown in the table, total energy demand is expected to almost double
                  within 2015 compared with the data of the year 2000, in particular with
                  respect to lignite and oil consumption.
                  The large lignite increase may became even greater if the current plan of
                  involving private investors in the development of new mines and power
                  plants will be fully successful and Kosovo will became a net exporter of
                  electricity.
                  For the oil sector in absolute volumes the transport sector doubles its
                  consumption. The residential sector will see a steep relative increase from the

                  conversion to CHP of existing thermal power plants, the oil sector will lose an
                  important "client", i.e. Prishtina DH.

                  The consumption of firewood is stable over the period (consequently reducing

                  by the values reported in the study by MEM on energy demand forecast in the
                  year 20071. According to this study, in 2006 the primary energy consumption
                  in Kosovo was as presented in the following Table.

                  Regardless of the considered information sources, it can be observed that
                  lignite plays a predominant role in primary energy consumption, both at
                  present and in future projections, accounting for 55-60% of the total.
                  The entire primary energy consumption of coal, oil and wood can then be
                  divided into four main energy sectors (residential, industrial, commercial and
                  transport - plus conversion, i.e. production of electricity).


                  The power sector consumes about 57% of all primary energy in Kosovo as the
                  other sectors mainly rely on the electricity produced there. Of the primary
                  energy used for power production less than 30% becomes today electricity,
                  indicating an average conversion efficiency of less than 30%. The situation
                  may significantly improve in the future with the construction of thermal
                  power plants with higher efficiency.


                  The transport sector use of gasoline and other oil products will increases
                  significantly. The main shift for the residential sector is mostly related to an
                  increased consumption of oil, which presently is very low.



     4.1.1.2      The Role of Lignite in the Energy Strategy of Kosovo

                  It is clear from all the work done in Kosovo over the years that the potential
                  for power generation from lignite remains far and away the major asset. The
                  Energy Strategy takes the view that these resources could be used to meet the
                  demand of Kosovo and that of neighboring countries. This would allow
                  Kosovo not only to substitute imports, but also to gain foreign currency from
                  exports.

                                                                       240

A review of the energy sector in South-Eastern Europe1, conducted as an
extension of the GIS (Generation Investment Study), concluded that the
development of lignite mining in Kosovo for power generation and sale to the
regional market is part of the least-cost solution to close the emerging gap in
generation capacity in the region.


Elimination of the non-cost effective rehabilitation projects has a direct impact
on the investment requirements for the new generation capacity. The
investment requirements increase proportionally to replace the retiring non-
competitive capacity of existing plants. Also, some lignite-fired plants are
displaced especially when carbon credits are taken into account. However,
low-cost lignite-fired capacity continues to play an important role in the
generation expansion of the region. In particular, lignite plants in Kosovo
remained the least-cost option for the region; in fact, as carbon credit values
increase and existing power plants become less cost-effective, there is need for
more efficient plants burning Kosovo lignite; more specifically, the baseline
plan included 4,200 MW of new plants burning Kosovo lignite, but when the
carbon credits were included, the new plant capacity burning Kosovo lignite
increases to 5,500 MW over the planning period (2005-2020).
Moreover, as stated in the Energy Strategy2, the importance of the energy
sector for the future development of Kosovo should be seen from two aspects:


a) At the function of the establishment of energy infrastructure for a
     dynamic economic and social development.

b) The importance of considerable primary energy resources, in particular
     lignite and its rational exploitation, in the context of the overall [economic]
     development strategy of Kosovo.

The Energy Strategy clearly identifies few key aspects:
c) The importance of lignite as national energy source;

d) The importance of a well functioning electricity sector as a driver for the
     economic and social development of Kosovo;

e) The importance of the electricity sector itself, seen as a major industry
     creating job opportunities and well being.


The following paragraphs will discuss these aspects, but it may be useful to
report here a sentence of the Project Appraisal Document3 of the World Bank:
Kosovo's key energy resource is its extensive lignite deposits; the New Mining
Field alone is estimated to hold about one billion tons of geological reserves.
Kosovo has no other fossil fuel resource and only a very modest hydroelectric
potential. It does not import natural gas and has limited gas supply
infrastructure, consisting of about 250 km of lines, presently unusable due to

4.1.1.3    Economic Justification of the Development of Lignite

           In order to better frame the economic convenience of developing lignite for
           electricity generation within the context of the country, the main socio-
           economic features of Kosovo are summarized here after, as extracted from the
           recently completed study on the heat market in Kosovo1.

           ·   a rapid reduction of outside Donors

           ·   the first steps of the Government, and

           ·   a persistent level of investments in the housing sector even after the end of
               the emergency period after 2001.

                 Table 4.1.1.3b shows the huge export / import unbalance of Kosovo. Such
                 unbalance will not disappear in the near future and it will represent a
                 constant characteristic of the economic outlook of Kosovo.
                 Such export / import unbalance of Kosovo suggests the opportunity to
                 carefully evaluate any massive use of foreign "imported" fuel.
                 Therefore the "valorization" of local lignite represents not only an important
                 driver to economic development (as suggested and practically supported by
                 the World Bank through an 8.5 millions US$ technical assistance) but also one
                 of the few alternatives, apart from emigrant remittances, to reduce the current
                 trade unbalance.

                  On the basis of the above presented economic aspects, it can be concluded
                  that the development of the local lignite resources, through the installation of
                  a new TPP due to satisfy local demand and to generate surplus energy for
                  export, is basically justified by the following expected results:


                  ·   The use of local energy source can ensure, at least in the long-term, the
                      equilibrium of the balance of payment, providing at the same time an
                      opportunity to significantly boost trade links between Kosovo and
                      Southeast Europe and thus facilitate closer integration with the rest of
                      Europe.

                  ·   The "industry" of generating electricity creates, besides a direct impulse to
                      the economy (it should be mentioned that KEK is a major provider of job in
                      Kosovo, employing presently about 8,000 people, of which nearly one half
                      are in lignite mine operations), additional benefits related with the
                      associated economic development (industries, agriculture, handicraft, etc.)
                      and can thus contribute to a significant reduction of the presently very
                      high unemployment rate and of the number of people falling below the
                      poverty line.


                  An attempt of quantifying the economic direct and indirect benefits
                  associated with the installation of a new lignite fired power plant with a
                  600 MW capacity is contained in the PAD of the Lignite Power Technical
                  Assistance Project1, as in the following.

                                                                            244

           The proposed New Mine/Plant will generate substantial direct and indirect benefits to
           Kosovo. The benefits would be as follows:

           ·   Royalties payable to the government for mining and selling lignite to the owners of
               the power plant for generating electricity. The present value of these royalties is
               estimated at approximately  7 millions;

           ·   Economic rents payable to the government for the use of lignite by the owners of
               the power plant for exporting electricity. The present value of the economic rent to
               the government is estimated at approximately  41 millions;

           ·   The tax revenues to the government are estimated at around  5-6 millions from the
               mine and  78 millions from the power plant in present value terms;

           ·   The new power plant will substantially reduce the need to import power from
               neighboring countries and also improve the overall reliability of supply for
               domestic consumption. The present value of these benefits to the government is
               estimated at  228 millions;

           ·   Kosovo will benefit from increased employment of approximately 2,000 jobs during
               the construction of the New Mine/Plant from 2008 through 2012 and 1,300 jobs
               during the operations period from 2012 through 2038. A multiplier of 2.2 thus
               would result in approximately 4,000 jobs in Kosovo. The present value of the
               employment increase is estimated at approximately  57 millions.


           In addition to the direct benefits, there are substantial indirect benefits to Kosovo
           as a result of the proposed New Mine/Plant. There is an investment made by the
           private sector (approximately 300 million for the mine and approximately  770
           million over a six-year period: 2008-2013).


           This is a substantial increase in overall investment compared to the recent figures and
           will undoubtedly provide some impetus to economic growth in Kosovo. Based on a
           simple accelerator macro model, it is estimated that by 2013 the GDP is approximately
            150 million or 4.8% higher than without the Project. The average annual rate of
           growth of GDP without the Project over the period 2008-2013 is 3.2% and with the
           Project it is 3.6%.


           It should be stressed that, considering that the overall development of the
           power plant is due to be well over the 600 MW assumed in the PAD economic
           analysis, the corresponding benefits shall be proportionally much higher.


           It is also worth adding that, besides the economic benefits identified by the
           World Bank, an extremely important "social" benefit would derive from the
           possibility of providing reliable, low cost power to meet domestic needs. In
           this respect, some of the above mentioned direct benefits, e.g. the lignite
           royalties, may be at least partly converted to allow affordable electricity to the
           poorest sector of the population.



4.1.1.4    Lack of Valuable Local Alternatives

           Numerous studies have been carried out to identify local alternatives, which
           may replace at least partly lignite as energy source for the production of both
           electricity and of heat for space and tap water heating. These studies were in
           part specifically addressed to the reduction of environmental problems

           ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                   THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA

related with the emission of pollutant elements from the lignite mines and
from the operating plants of Kosovo A and Kosovo B, which are critically
affecting the air quality in the area of Prishtina. As detailed here after, some
alternatives have been identified, which however can only marginally
contribute to the energy requirements of the country.


Hydro resources

The only operating hydroelectric plant in Kosovo is the Ujmani one, with an
installed capacity of 35 MW and a production in the year 2006 of 101 GWh.
In a study carried out by the Albanian Association of Energy and
Environment for Sustainable Development1, 18 sites were identified for the
installation of hydro power plants with a capacity ranging between 0.3 MW
and 8.3 MW, while 5 more existing sites were singled out as deserving
rehabilitation activities. The total capacity which could be achieved through
the construction and rehabilitation process amounts to about 70 MW and the
annual energy production to 300 GWh.


With reference to the potential development of these resources, the following
sub-program PG 05 was identified in the Program for the implementation of
the Kosovo Energy Strategy for the Period 2006-20082:


MEM, in coordination with ERO and the respective distribution companies owning
the small hydro plants of Dikance, Istog, and Radavc, will investigate the possibilities
for establishment of public-private partnerships, in the form of Build (revitalise) ­
Operate ­ Transfer, or similar, for the revitalization of these plants. For the
investigation and eventually the preparation of tender documents, specialized
technical assistance will be provided through an appropriate arrangement with donors.
The requirements concerning environmental protection in accordance with the
existing legislation and regulations as well as the provisions of the EU Directives for
old plants will apply.


In this context it should be mentioned that the Lumbardh HPP, with a
capacity of 8.3 MW and an annual production of about 22 GWh, has been
given for rent and rehabilitation by private capital.


The same report of the Albanian Association mentions the additional
hydroelectric potential present along the Drini I Bardhe and Ibri rivers, close
to the Albanian border and with a potential energy production of about
700 GWh/year. The most important prospect corresponds to the Zhur HPP,
studied at feasibility level by the Croatian company Electroprojekt and having
an estimated capacity of 293 MW and annual production of about 400 GWh3.

                  Similarly to the small hydro plants, the Zhur one is also foreseen to be offered
                  to private investors for construction through concession and to start operation
                  in the year 2016. At any rate, all these units are not going to contribute to the
                  coverage of the base load, since they are due to operate for supplying peak
                  energy.


                  In consideration of the above, the full exploitation of the hydroelectric
                  resources of Kosovo can be considered as a useful integrative measure, but
                  can not definitely be classified as a global solution to satisfy the future
                  electricity demand.


                  Solar and Aeolian

                  The exploitation of solar energy for electricity production is viewed as a long
                  term solution to counteract the future depletion of fossil fuels. At the present
                  state of arts, large scale production requires very sophisticated technology
                  and is not competitive from the economic viewpoint with alternative sources.
                  For the above reasons, solar energy can become an opportunity in Kosovo for
                  tap water heating, but is not viewed, at least in the medium-term period, as a
                  viable source for generation of electricity.


                  Similar concepts are applicable to the Aeolian energy as well, although in
                  principle the country offers favourable physiographic conditions for its
                  exploitation in terms of average wind speed and of hilly configuration.


                  Geothermal

                  Some low enthalpy geothermal prospects are known to exist in Kosovo. As
                  shown in Table 4.1.1.4a, they are characterized by relatively high salinity and
                  by low flow rate. These conditions, together with their maximum temperature
                  of just over 50 °C, make the prospects totally unsuitable for energetic
                  production (heat or electricity).

                  Agricultural and Urban Wastes

                  Important amounts of biomass are available in Kosovo from agricultural
                  waste (in particular wheat straws and corn poles and cobs) and from urban
                  solid waste. The utilization of such material for production of electricity is
                  associated with considerable technological and environmental problems,
                  which make their potential role totally marginal, at least in the short to
                  medium term period.

           Wood

           Wood is largely used in Kosovo for space heating, tap water heating and
           cooking, with an estimated yearly consumption of 2.5 million m3 of stacked
           wood1. Wood presently covers the following portion of the energy demand
           for domestic uses:

           ·   Space heating: 48%

           ·   Tap water heating: 10%

           ·   Cooking: 25%


           On the base of an analysis conducted within the framework of the study on
           the Kosovo heat market2, the total available wood deriving from the natural
           growth of the existing Kosovo forests amounts to some 1.2 to 1.5 million
           m3/year. Such value was estimated assuming the following parameters:

           ·   Total area forested in Kosovo: 450,000 ha;

           ·   Yearly volume increase of wood: 4/4.5 m3/ha (corresponding to about 5%
               of the whole wood stock);

           ·   Useful percentage of increased volume for logging purpose: 60-80%.


           The important unbalance between wood demand and local availability
           indicates that the present consumption not only poses a severe strain on the
           forestry resources of the country, but also that a significant portion of the
           demand is satisfied by material smuggled from neighbouring countries.
           Under this situation, it is unconceivable to consider wood as an alternative
           energy source for electrical generation, even more taking into account the
           negative effects on the air quality which would be generated by the wood fed
           boilers.



4.1.1.5    Heat Market and Poor Perspective of Direct Use of Lignite

           The lignite market in Kosovo is clearly dominated by the demand of the local
           thermal power plants, which makes up for 98% of the total lignite production.
           The minor part of the lignite production is being used as payment in kind for
           the KEK workers (sold at a discounted price) and processed - wet - at the
           "lignite drying plant" to be sold to industrial consumers (Table 4.1.1.5a). There
           is presently no market for District Heating facilities and very limited market
           for private households.

                 The commercial exploitation of raw lignite for purposes other than electricity
                 production is in principle limited, due to its very low calorific value and high
                 volatile matter compared to other fuels, which results in high specific
                 transport costs. This makes lignite a fuel for local or regional use rather than
                 an export product. Moreover, private households have to deal with residues
                 and bad smell when using raw lignite in stoves or fireplaces.


                 In Kosovo, however, infrastructures and availability of competitive fuels are
                 limited at the time being, so that selling of minor quantities of raw lignite to
                 other customers besides the thermal power plants can be considered.


                 In the past it was often assumed that the availability of alternative fuels
                 would have improved during the mid- and long-term period, so that any
                 market for raw lignite would shrink rather than expand. Actually, the higher
                 than expected price of oil and gas products and the resumed operations of the
                 railway offer a slightly better perspective to a market that will remain anyway
                 limited.


                 A lignite drying plant presently exists next to the Kosovo A power plant
                 complex and it operates according to the Fleissner principle. About 1 t of
                 dried lignite is produced out of 2 t of wet lignite, 0.4 t of steam are required to
                 produce 1 t of dry lignite,1 t of mined lignite is required to produce 7.5 t of
                 steam.
                 The plant had no production in the year 2006 and is presently undergoing a
                 restructuring program which may bring its potential production back to close
                 to 400,000 t/year, although there is some uncertainty whether the cost
                 situation will allow for an economic operation of the drying plant in the long -
                 term prospect.


                 At present, in the industrial sector dry lignite has a potential market (partly
                 supported by letters of interest) of around 200,000 t/year, including export.
                 Moreover, a higher share of dry lignite consumption might be achieved in the
                 future, especially in the public sector with central heating systems, as a result
                 of the increased costs of the oil products.


                 An eventual wider use of dry lignite in the industry, central heating systems
                 and residential market would require the development and enforcement of
                 strict technical standards for combustion devices and the enforcement of
                 environmental regulations at municipal level. The potential environmental

           impacts of high temperature combustion devices with closed combustion
           chamber in densely populated areas should be seriously considered.
           In synthesis, perspectives for a large expansion of the lignite market, either
           dry or wet, in the industrial, district and individual heating and commercial
           sectors, appear anyway rather weak, wherefore also in the future it is
           expected that the largely predominant share of lignite utilization shall
           correspond to electricity generation.



4.1.2      Size of the Planned Expansion

           No final decision has been taken yet on the overall capacity of the Kosovo C
           TPP or on the sequence of installation. Several factors concur in singling out a
           final capacity of 2,000 MW as the optimum solution in view of the physical,
           economic and regional context. A justification of such opinion is provided in
           the following paragraphs.


           Moreover, a project on the Iber-Lepenc Hydro System aimed at proving that
           the Iber-Lepenc Hydro system can support the additional water demand from
           the new thermo power plant Kosovo C has been recently carried out, funded
           by the EAR. According to this report, 2,000 MW is compatible with water
           resources availability.



4.1.2.1    A Strategic Decision

           As stated in the Energy Strategy1, "electricity production shall be oriented towards
           fulfilling domestic consumption demands with stable and uninterrupted production
           and competing prices, as well as export of energy surpluses to regional and wider
           markets.


           In accordance with this objective, by the year 2015 full domestic energy
           demand should be met, while 30-50% of the available energy could be
           exported, and the net system capacity would be around 1800-2000 MW. This
           goal assumes a series of events, besides the installation of 1,000 MW at
           Kosovo C, which not necessarily are going to verify, namely the rehabilitation
           of Kosovo A, the construction of the Zhur HPP (total installed capacity of
           293 MW, for a foreseen electricity production of around 400 GWh) and the
           construction of small HPP by private investors.


           The Energy Strategy adds that construction of new capacities above the mentioned
           level in existing location of TPP Kosova B or other locations is an option that requires
           further study and assessment of its developmental impact on Kosovo, possibilities of
           export having in mind regional demand but also effects on urban and spatial
           development, environment and use of water. Depending on these possibilities Kosovo
           remains open and interested to cooperate with strategic investors (independent power
           producers) within Kosovo and abroad.

           ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                    THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                      250

           While it is agreed that further studies are required for a final decision, it is our
           opinion that the 2,000 MW final capacity is very likely to constitute the
           optimum option, not only for the reasons expressed in the next three
           paragraphs, but also considering that the assumptions stated in the Energy
           Strategy, in particular the rehabilitation of Kosovo A and the construction
           within the next decade of Zhur HPP and of the mini-hydro power plants, not
           necessarily are going to materialize. Finally, it should be mentioned that any
           new hydropower development would be geared towards peak and not base
           load capacity.



4.1.2.2    The Size to Fit the New Mining Field

           The New Mining Field, singled out as the highest priority for development
           based on coal quality and overburden (see Paragraph 4.2.1), contains adequate
           coal reserves to feed a new power plant of 2,000 MW for a period in excess of
           40 years, which is the timeframe usually assumed for the life of the plant in
           economic and financial analyses. Such value has been calculated in
           accordance with the minable reserves (830 Mtons of lignite), the specific
           consumption of lignite (1.1 tons/MWh) and the yearly generation of the
           2,000 MW power plant (15,000 GWh/year assuming a plant factor of 0.85).
           Considering that Kosovo B shall be also operating for the next two decades,
           the overall requirement of lignite for electricity generation would amount to
           about 20 Mtons/year.


           It is obvious that, in the process of implementation of an energy project, the
           mine is chosen as a function of the installed capacity of the power plant to be
           fed and not vice versa. However, it is useful to underline that a continuous
           development of the mine itself up to its full potential is more cost-effective as
           compared with a development associated with long interruption periods.



4.1.2.3    Economy of Scale

           All the technical and economic indications collected to date support the
           viability of the proposed 2,000 MW new power plant. Provided that the
           investor has sufficient risk taking and funding capability, it would be quite
           advantageous to build the complete plant without dismantling the
           construction organization, i.e. units should follow each other with 12-18
           month interval. The economy of scale of such size, partially supported by
           export, should ameliorate the economics of the project.



4.1.2.4    A Regional Market Opportunity

           As mentioned in Paragraph 4.1.1.1, the participation of Kosovo in the Regional
           Electrical Energy Market in South Eastern Europe poses huge challenges to
           the Government in terms of adequate development of the energy sector, but at

                  the same time offers important opportunities for a market badly in need of
                  power, as examined in detail in the above mentioned GIS studies.


                  These concepts are well expressed in the Poyry study1, through an estimate of
                  the sales potential in the region (Table 4.1.2.4a) and a summary list of the items
                  of major relevance in the future electric market situation. The potential sales
                  shown in the table below refer to what is called the "first tier of markets", that
                  is to those neighboring countries with direct grid connection and politically
                  acceptable. In principle, additional markets could correspond to more remote
                  countries with more complicated grid access (e.g. Bulgaria) or to countries
                  outside the area (e.g. Italy).

4.1.3      Other Potential Development Projects


4.1.3.1    Potential Development Projects in the Energy Sector

           In the study on the Kosovo heat market1, several potential alternatives were
           identified to the present predominant use of wood and electricity for space
           and water heating, namely heat pumps, solar energy and LPG. On the other
           hand, the only significant alternative to the use of lignite for electricity
           generation, besides the limited contribution which can be provided by hydro
           resources (see Paragraph 4.1.1.4), corresponds to natural gas.
           In various documents and officially published maps, Kosovo is foreseen as
           potential transit territory for major natural gas flow from the Black Sea area
           toward Western Europe.
           Security of supply of natural gas to Kosovo could be based on two options
           that ideally may be combined:


                ·   Kosovo as a transit area for natural gas flow to third markets and
                    integration of regional gas grids, in which case security is based on
                    interrelations between major suppliers and consumers,

                ·   Kosovo supplied from a number of different sources of natural gas via
                    few distinct routes.


           Taking into account such potential security of supply, the above mentioned
           heat market study examined the possibility and convenience of introducing
           gas as a fuel for space and water heating, as well as for cooking, in
           combination with the use of gas for power generation. The following
           considerations could be made:


                ·   In a reasonable future there is not room for gas in the power
                    generation sector of Kosovo, unless urgency to provide additional
                    power, private investors desires or comparative feasibility study
                    completed on behalf of the competent decision making authorities
                    favor the distributed gas fired generation against large centralized
                    lignite fuelled generation. At this stage, it seem not probable that an
                    international project will cross Kosovo or ­ even less probable ­ that
                    regional funding from the European Commission could support the
                    gas development.

                ·   Without the need of gas for generation or massive transit to third
                    markets, the capital cost of the infrastructure is considerably high.

                ·   Obviously, import of large quantities of gas for power generation
                    would significantly affect in a negative way the already critical trade
                    balance of the country.


           The Energy Strategy reports that natural gas may be supplied in Kosovo through
           the pipeline branches of the neighboring countries. It is not anticipated in the near
           future for any bulk transit gas pipelines to cross the western Balkans. The only project

           currently under preliminary consideration in Southeast Europe is the Nabucco trans
           gas pipeline that is scheduled to start from Turkey, and through Bulgaria, Romania,
           and Hungary to reach Vienna. One of the opportunities for new gas pipelines from the
           Caspic Sea give possibility for Kosova to be as transit road which is foreseen to reach
           Vienna in Central Europe.
           It is also stated that the assessment of the domestic natural gas market for
           power generation should focus on its use for the firing of open cycle gas
           turbines for system load modulation and reserve capacities, as well as a
           substitution of petroleum and HFO for flame support in the existing TPP
           Under this situation, it is felt that gas can not be considered as a viable
           alternative to lignite for power generation, although, in view of its potential
           utilization in the heat market, special attention should be paid to all
           international projects that foresee the possibility of constructing a pipeline
           passing through Kosovo.



4.1.3.2    Potential Development Projects in the Same Geographical Area

           No specific large scale economic development and infrastructural projects are
           known to exist in the general area of the new Kosovo C TPP. The only
           significant "direct" effect of the TPP construction over the non-energy-related
           sector refers to the proposed clean-up and reclamation project, which is
           expected to make available about 6 km2 of land for industrial, agricultural and
           commercial purposes. Some doubts exist over the utilization of the reclaimed
           land for community development, due to the existence of some residual
           contamination levels, although the Clean-up Project sponsored by the World
           Bank mentions the possibility of use for "new housing developments or
           recreation".
           Moreover, a mention is made of the possibility of constructing a motorway in
           the area, due to pass across Field D.



4.2        ANALYSIS OF KEK PLANS

           With reference to the previous Paragraph 4.1.1.2, in which a general outlook on
           the strategic importance of lignite as key energy source of Kosovo has been
           provided, the present paragraph details the present and future potentialities
           of the KEK resources with respect to the possible Lignite development.



4.2.1      Existing Mines and Future Supply

           The present situation of the lignite resources in Kosovo can be summarized as
           follows1:
           The main energy resources in Kosova are located in two big lignite basins, named
           "Kosova" and "Dukagjini" with exploitable lignite reserves of good quality (Figure
           4.2.1a). The estimated lignite quantity is between 11.55 - 14 billion tons. Lignite

reserves have low content of sulfur, relatively good concentration of lime (calcium
oxide) for partial sulfur absorption during burning. The proportion between the
wasteland and lignite is very favourable, a fact that makes mines very attractive for
exploitation.

                 Two open mines of lignite (Bardh and Mirash) operate from 1963/64.
                 Currently these two mines supply two power plants with approximately 7
                 million tons of lignite per year. According to last estimates existing mines will
                 exhaust completely until 2007/2009, which depends from the intensity of
                 energy generation compared to the lignite reserves in existing mines. In view
                 of this occurrence, overburden stripping is already ongoing in the proposed
                 New Mining Field.
                 The quality of the lignite presently under exploitation is shown in Table 4.2.1a
                 The same table indicates the characteristics of one of the new fields identified
                 in the same area (Sibovc), due to feed both the existing TPPs and the new one.

                 (Figure 4.2.1b), namely:


                     ·    Sibovc, which is located north of and adjacent to the Bardh mine;

                In the 2005 report, Vattenfall reported that:


                     ·    the mining of the Sibovc field offers the best possibility to supply coal
                          to a new large power plant as well as to the existing ones;

                     ·    the mining of Field South is the most expensive due to less favourable
                          geology and stripping ratios;

                     ·    Field D has limited coal reserves, although it is characterized by low
                          overburden thickness and limited environmental and social impact.


                Subsequently Vattenfall and STEAG proposed that the optimal solution is to
                plan on developing the Sibovc SW field as soon as possible, with the
                opportunity later to develop the rest of the Sibovc field. In this scenario, the
                proposed new Kosovo C TPP was rated at 1,000 MW, at least in the initial
                stages, with an additional two 500 MW units added by 2025.

a) address environmental legacy issues related to open dumping of ashes on
    land;

b) enable KEK to free land currently taken by overburden material for
    community development purposes and to enable KEK to remove Kosovo
    A ash dump; and

c) build capacity in KEK for continued cleanup and environmentally
    conscious mining operations.


The Project included the following components and activities:


Component A. Preparation of Mirash Open Pit Mine for Ash Management
This component objective was to include site preparation works at the
existing Mirash open pit mine to develop proper conditions for sustainable
storage of ash and overburden materials collected from the ash dump
facilities and future lignite mining developments. A separate component will
include direct ash disposal into the Mirash Open Pit Mine from the current
Kosovo A thermal power plant operation.
The Mirash open pit mine offers sufficient capacity and favorable geotechnical
and hydrogeological conditions for the safe storage of ash and overburden
materials of up to 200 million m3. However, proper preparation work is
necessary to allow sustainable ash disposal such as the construction of a base
liner and cell structures for hydro-transported ash using clay from
overburden material. Currently, the open mine area is covered by a thin layer
of overburden materials and in many parts the coal is exposed. As far as ash
disposal is concerned there is still discussion how to proceed. In any case after
rehabilitation of Kosova A the transport will be carried out by hydraulic
transport system.


Component B. Study of Relocation of Kosovo A Ash Dumps into Mirash
Open Pit Mine
The objective of this component was to remove the ash and overburden
materials of the Kosovo A storage facility and ash dump which have to be
transported to the engineered disposal sites in Mirash Open Pit Mine,
dumped and properly backfilled. After the first evaluation it was proposed to
hydraulically transport ashes from TTP A to Mirash Mine but to maintain old
ashes in the existing landfill after proper reshaping and vegetation.


Component C. Reclamation of Overburden Dump Sites
This component objective was to mobilize existing KEK earth moving
equipment (budgets for spare parts) and reclaim about 6.5 km2 of land
through reshaping and re-cultivating the South Field overburden dump and
the overburden dump west of the Bardh mine. The reclaimed land should
represent in the future an area suitable for community development, e.g. for
agriculture, new housing developments or recreation.


Component D. Project Management
This component objective was to provide support to KEK to implement the
project. It will include support for: (i) project management and technical

         assistance in such areas as detailed design, construction supervision,
         procurement and financial management; and (ii) monitoring and evaluation
         of project impacts, including implementation of an environmental
         management plan for construction activities carried out under the project.


         Following the first results of these activities "It has to be assessed that the
                                                                              1

         practically realisation of the main concept of the pre-feasibility study (i.e. relocation of
         Kosovo A ash dump) is difficult and coupled with manifold dependencies, assumptions
         and high expenditures. This reassessment was necessary because of changed situation
         in the mines and on the international mechanical engineering market. The
         Complementary Mine Plan Sibovc South West is delayed, major refurbishments are
         delayed or cancelled that means KEK CPD may require more existing mining
         equipment for the opening up of the new mine to ensure the coal supply to the existing
         power plants. Moreover, the goal of a short term improvement of environmental
         impacts caused by the ash dump can not be achieved by realisation of this concept."
         Following this reassessment "The main concept is the redistribution of masses from
         the dangerous and contaminated parts of the ash dump to other ash dump parts,
         respectively to depositing areas in case of contamination. Goal is the construction of an
         ash dump with a more or less homogeneous design. Fast reduction of dust emissions
         can be achieved by rearranging TPP A ash removal system to wet type ash removal.
         Moreover this alternative offers the possibility for additional lignite extraction in the
         western part of the ash dump inside the KEK property. So the fuel supply to the TPPs
         can be improved in mid term period additionally".


         As a consequence of this first result it is likely that Kosovo A ash dump will
         be reshaped and vegetated and that TPP A ash will be transported
         hydraulically to the old Mirash mine.


         No action plans are foreseen for Kosovo B ash dump.


         A project devoted to identify soil contamination in the old fertiliser and
         gasification plants is in progress.



4.2.3    Kosovo A TPP

         The viability of rehabilitating the Kosovo A power plant has been analyzed in
         the year 2005 by a Consortium led by Aets through a study financed by EAR
         for the benefit of MEM2. In the following a brief summary.


         The Kosovo A TPP includes 5 units with a total installed generating capacity of 800
         MW, of which only 145 MW are presently available. The following Table 4.2.3a shows

                specific cost of new equivalent power unit and also lower than equivalent imported
                energy the rehabilitation plan is fully justified, and strongly recommended".............
                In the present operational context of Kosovo A, the capital rehabilitation concerns only
                units A4 and A5, consequently the Consultant recommends as follows:


                          To rehabilitate unit A4. In the logic to keep the working units in operation,
                          A4 which is out of order should be the first unit to rehabilitate. Moreover, the
                          decision should be taken as soon as possible because any delay would reduce
                          the return on investment. With a decision taken at an early stage, unit A4
                          might be back to commercial operation only 16 months after beginning of its
                          construction.
                          To rehabilitate unit A5. Therefore, A5 rehabilitation should proceed only
                          after A4 is back in operation.
                          To overhaul unit A1. The unit is still in operation, however considering the
                          short remaining life time, a decision to perform the overhaul should be taken as
                          soon as possible. After a very long period without any overhaul, the turbo-
                          generator presents the risk of an unforeseen major breakdown.
                          To overhaul unit A3. As previously mentioned and when the time for
                          overhaul will come back, some time between 2009 and 2010, the Consultant
                          suggests either to continue overhauling the unit or to study the possibility of
                          CR, depending on the energy context.


                The current situation has been modified as follows:
                          Units A3 and A4 are now in operation;
                          Unit A5 will be ready to operate from the beginning of April 2008;
                          Lignite will be taken from a small mining are near Sitnica river (Sitnica
                          project).


                Following the presentation of the above recommendations, the following sub-
                program PG 04 was identified in the Program for the implementation of the
                Kosovo Energy Strategy for the Period 2006-20081:
                An EAR funded study on the technical and economic feasibility of rehabilitating
                "Kosovo A" units has just been completed, concluding positively on whether such an
                action should proceed against decommissioning of respected units and the required
                energy being imported. In accordance with the recommendations of the study, KEK,
                under MEM's supervision, should proceed with the following works:

         Major Overhaul of unit A3, to be carried out in 2009-2010.
         The requirements concerning environmental protection in accordance with the
         existing legislation and regulations as well as the provisions of the EU Directives for
         old plants should apply.


         It should be mentioned however that the convenience of proceeding with the
         rehabilitation of the Kosovo A TPP is not universally accepted. As expressed
         in the World Bank PAD relevant to the "Lignite Power Technical Assistance
         Project"1, as for Kosovo A, rehabilitation of three units (A3, A4 and A5 each with a
         200 MW nominal capacity) to extend operating life by about 12 to 15 years is
         technically feasible; but since the cost of environmental compliance with EU standards
         would be costly, these units are not expected to be cost-effective compared with a new
         power plant. As an alternative to a full rehabilitation, the overhaul of these three
         Kosovo A units for limited life extension, until a new power plant becomes
         operational, is deemed feasible. Further, there is a looming shortage of lignite supply
         from 2009 onwards, since the existing mines (Bardh and Mirash) are nearing
         exhaustion and the start of development works at KEK's next mine (the Sibovc SW
         Mine) has suffered delays due to lack of financing.


         Actually, in accordance with the latest decisions of KEK, an intermediate
         approach between the two extreme above mentioned options is going to be
         adopted, wherefore interventions of partial rehabilitations will be carried out,
         by which the plant is expected to extend its operations until the year 2017
         with a total capacity of 280 MW.



4.2.4    Kosovo B TPP


         It is assumed that both units of Kosovo B plant would be shut down for
         rehabilitation in early 2010's, with Kosovo B1 expected to undergo 18-month
         rehabilitation period around 2013 and Kosovo B2 to be rehabilitated in 2015 in
         a similar manner. In the long run, unit Kosovo B1 is expected to be
         operational until 2029 and unit B2 until 2030.


         It is assumed that both units of Kosovo B plant will undergo minor
         rehabilitation (change of rotors) in the year 2009, wherefore the overall
         capacity of the plant shall increase from 580 MW to 610 MW. Major
         interventions shall be carried out in sequence over both units during the
         period 2014-2016, determining a shut down of 18 months for each unit. In the
         long run, unit Kosovo B1 is expected to be operational until 2029 and unit B2
         until 2030 with a capacity of 305 MW each.


         As refers to the operation of the power plant, the following is foreseen:

             ·    The load factor of the plant will be in the order of 0.6-0.67, stabilizing
                  at 0.64 after the year 2012.

             ·    The total time availability of both units would be 79%. Outage is
                  assumed 12% planned, 9% unplanned.

                  lignite/MWh net generated.



4.3      DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS

         In considering alternative development scenarios for the proposed Kosovo C
         power plant and New Mining Field development, sector strategies were
         reviewed, in terms of energy production and demand, role of lignite and
         economic justification for its development, lack of viable local alternatives,
         size of the planned expansion, and other related development plans. KEK
         planning for clean up of mines and ash and overburden dumps, as well as
         future supply, was also reviewed. Based on all the studies noted above, the
         energy development plans include the following:


             ·    new lignite fired power plants (Kosovo C) using modern technology;

             ·    up to 2,000 MW of new power generation; and

             ·    New Mining Field development.


         Alternative scenarios for development of the Kosovo C TPP were evaluated,
         with a view to selecting the "preferred option" from environmental and social
         viewpoints. The "alternative zero" (no new power plants) was also
         considered.


         The following paragraphs present all relevant variables in terms of different
         development scenarios analysis and the foreseen environmental and social
         interferences of the potential development plan.



4.3.1    Key Assumptions Common to all Scenarios Definition

         There are several key assumptions common to all scenarios, as far as the SESA
         Report is concerned, which refer to the future role of TPP Kosovo A and TPP
         Kosovo B as described in the following. Moreover, also the future role of
         Kosovo C is a constant to all scenarios.


         In particular, the impact evaluation included in the present document and the
         comparison between different scenarios depends on the following key
         assumptions (common to all scenarios):


             ·    in order to supply domestic demand, Kosovo A TPP will need to
                  remain in operation until it can be replaced by Kosovo C (with a short
                  overlap for reasons of energy security). As mentioned in Paragraph
                  4.2.3, it is expected that Kosovo A will undergo some rehabilitation, so


         ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                  263

                             that it can remain operational until 2017 with a capacity of 280 MW.
                             Kosovo C will then allow Kosovo A units to be retired completely or
                             used as cold reserve for seasonal peaks; any other continued use of
                             Kosovo A would depend on further rehabilitation based on EU
                             environmental requirements;

                       ·     both units of Kosovo B will undergo rehabilitation (proposed schedule
                             2014-2016, during which time it will operate at reduced capacity),
                             remaining in operation until 2030 (Paragraph 4.2.4) with a nominal net
                             capacity of 2x305 MW;

                       ·     the first unit of Kosovo C will begin operation in 2014, with one or two
                             new units to be installed, one every 18 months thereafter. It is assumed
                             that the initial installed capacity will be 900-1,000 MW, depending on
                             the choice of unit size (300 or 500 MW).


                  As already mentioned, Kosovo A and B are both far from achieving
                  environmental compliance with EU standards. In particular, according to the
                  Large Combustion Plants (LCP) Directive (2001/80/EC), existing plants must
                  fully comply with LCP standards after December 31, 2015. The values of the
                  emissions, as extracted from the SEEC study1, are shown in Table 4.3.3.1a,
                  together with the standards indicated in the LCPD (2001/80/EC), referred to
                  existing plants with a capacity of 100-500 MW.

                  It can be observed that the situation is especially critical with respect to the
                  emissions of particulate, which, in the case of Kosovo A, are 7 to 10 times
                  more than the LCPD standard.


                  Within the operations which are foreseen for the rehabilitation of Kosovo B, it
                  is recognized the necessity to implement interventions, in order to comply
                  with the European standards.


                  As stated in the Electrowatt/Ekono study2, if the Kosovo B units shall
                  continue unlimited operation well into the future it will be necessary to
                  improve the level of environmental mitigation measures of the plant

           significantly. Dust and NOx emissions will have to be reduced, which will
           require investments in abatement technology.

           a Flue Gas Desulphurization System, although the present values are already

4.3.2      Significant Variables for Scenarios Definition

           Based on what discussed in Chapter 1 and proceeding from the assumption
           that the overall capacity of the TPP will reach 2,000 MW, the principal aspects
           of the alternative scenarios to be compared are the following:


               ·    Timing of Power Plant Development;

               ·    Timing of New Mining Field development;

               ·    Power Plant Location;

               ·    Unit size; and

               ·    Plant technology.


           All the above are briefly described in the following.



4.3.2.1    Timing of Power Plant Development

           As already discussed, many elements point to the opportunity to achieve a
           final capacity of 2,000 MW for Kosovo C TPP. However, such capacity can be
           reached within a different range of time, through different schemes of
           evolution that is proceeding with the continuous installation of the units or
           adopting a phased approach. To simplify the assessment of the scenarios, two
           approaches were considered in reaching final capacity of 2,000 MW for
           Kosovo C TPP, namely:


               ·    Approach A: Rapid Development. Under this approach, units are
                    installed in sequence, one after the other (construction time about 18
                    months for each unit), until the final programmed capacity of the TPP
                    is achieved. For example, assuming that 500 MW units are selected
                    and that construction starts in 2010/2011, the first unit would be in
                    operation by January 2014 and the final capacity of 2,000 MW would
                    be achieved by June 30, 2018 (see Table 4.3.2.1a). The first 1,000 MW
                    could be obtained either with two 500 MW size power plants or with
                    three about 300-350 MWe size power plants, depending on electric
                    network problems (see Paragraph 4.2.3). In this latter case the full
                    capacity will be obtained a little later but in terms of environmental
                    and social impacts the situation will be very similar (as discussed in
                    Paragraph 4.2.3). Power plants size will be therefore decided after the
                    EIA procedure;

     ·   Approach B: Phased Development. Under this approach, the first
         units are installed as a function of current local demand, with
         additional units installed (one after the other) on an as needed basis.
         Again, assuming that 500 MW units are selected and that construction
         starts in year 2010/2011, 1,000 MW capacity would be achieved by 30
         June 2015, with the additional 1,000 MW to be installed as soon as it
         becomes apparent that the energy/power demand curve in a medium
         growth scenario will exceed the installed supply (this is tentatively
         estimated to be between 5 and 10 years from now, depending on the
         evolution of the local and regional power market - see Table 4.3.2.1b as
         an example).


Table 4.3.2.1a and Table 4.3.2.1b represent an attempt to estimate the energy
balance which is achieved under the two hypotheses in the period 2008-2025.
For this purpose, the following parameters are taken into account:


     ·   Capacity of Kosovo A, B and C TPPs and of Zhur HPP, expected to
         start production in the year 2016 with a capacity of 293 MW and a
         yearly generation of about 400 GWh.


     ·   Electric energy generation of Kosovo A, B and C TPPs, assuming
         values of load factor partly derived from the historical data (although,
         in case of Kosovo B, a sharp improvement of the load factor is foreseen
         after the rehabilitation interventions) and partly on forecasts of the
         new plant operation.


     ·   Lignite production of the existing and new mines, assuming unit
         consumption of the three TPPs differentiated according to their
         efficiency.


     ·   Electricity demand, both in terms of power and energy, as derived
         from the Poyry study under the hypotheses of medium and high
         growth scenarios (MGS and HGS).


     ·   Balance of power and energy (supply minus demand) under the MGS
         and HGS hypotheses.


The resulting balance of power and energy, under the hypothesis of MGS, is
represented in a graphic form in Figures 4.3.2.1a and 4.3.2.1b.


It is evident that the resulting balances are purely indicative, since they are
based on theoretical assumptions, especially with reference to the load factor.
At any rate, some useful elements can be derived, due to have a significant
impact of the future choices about Kosovo C implementation:


·      The two development strategies (fast and phased) are essentially the
       same in terms of absolute values, differing with respect to the year when
       these values are reached.

·      The indicated quantities of lignite production correspond to the ones
       shown in Table 4.3.2.1b and depend on the assumed load factor of the
       various plants. At any rate, it can be noticed that the full production of
       about 21 Mtons/year in the New Mining Field must be achieved within
       the year 2019 in case of rapid development.

·      Under the MGS hypothesis, the critical situation of electrical supply,
       requiring the import of significant amounts of energy, extends until the
       year 2013-2014 for both fast and phased strategies.

·      Following that year, the excess of capacity and energy allowing export
       of electricity is relatively modest in case of phased development, at least
       until the year 2022, and well below the potential opportunities of the
       regional market.

·      Under the HGS hypothesis and in case of phased strategy, the power
       capacity balance remains negative throughout a large portion of the
       considered period and the energy surplus is relatively limited,
       precluding the possibility of an important export.

·      Under the same HGS hypothesis and in case of rapid development, for a
       period of 10 years the excess capacity is in the order of 600-1100 MW and
       the energy surplus of 8-11 TWh/year, wherefore electricity export
       would represent an important asset towards the trade balance objective.

                  The operation of Kosovo C TPP shall obviously generate emissions to air
                  which, for a small period of time (up to Kosovo A and B rehabilitation) will
                  add to the emissions of the other TPPs in the area. An estimate of the amount
                  of the emissions (particulate, NOx and SO2) which shall take place in the
                  hypothesis of the fast and phased developments are presented in Table 4.3.2.1a
                  and Table 4.3.2.1b.


                  The base for this estimate has been the study carried out by Poyry, which
                  however assumes unrealistically high load factors (0.85 for Kosovo A and B
                  and 0.9 for Kosovo C), therefore the calculated emissions have to be
                  considered as high figure while the real ones are probably lower than those
                  shown in the table. The following assumptions have been adopted for the
                  estimate:


                  ·    Load factor and coal consumption (tons/MWh) as shown in Table 4.3.2.1a
                       and Table 4.3.2.1b.

                  ·    Operation of Kosovo A, B and C as shown in Table 4.3.2.1a and Table
                       4.3.2.1b (including rehabilitation of Kosovo B in the period 2014-2016).

                  ·    Emissions of the TPPs, expressed as percentage of the coal burned as
                       reported in the Poyry study:
                                o Kosovo A: particulate 0.29%; NOx 0.42%; SO2 0.19%
                                o Kosovo B (before rehabilitation): particulate 0.063%; NOx
                                   0.28%; SO2 0.23%
                                o Kosovo B (after rehabilitation): particulate 0.027%; NOx 0.11%;
                                   SO2 0.23%
                                o Kosovo C: particulate 0.013%; NOx 0.09%; SO2 0.09%.


                  On the base of the above assumptions, the estimated emissions of the TPPs for
                  the period 2008-2018 are shown in Tables 4.3.2.1c and 4.3.2.1d.

                  It may be observed from the tables that the improved technology to be
                  adopted for emissions control compensates to a large extent the foreseen
                  larger generation.


                  In fact, making reference to the rapid development, in spite of the fact that
                  electrical generation is due to almost quadruple from 2008 to 2018, total
                  emissions of particulate are expected to be reduced to less than a half (as soon
                  as Kosovo A stops operation) and NOx ones to remain the same. Only in case
                  of SO2 an increase of air emissions is expected, unless a DeSOx plant is
                  installed to comply with European standards during rehabilitation. A similar
                  outcome is registered in case of phased development, although the effects of
                  the increase of SO2 emissions are delayed.


                  It should be remembered, at any rate, that the interruption of production from
                  Kosovo B, expected to take place around the year 2030, is due to generate a
                  very important improvement in the air quality, especially with respect to SO2.



     4.3.2.2      Timing of New Mining Field Development

                  As mentioned in Paragraph 4.2.1, the criteria used by the previous Consultants
                  (in particular Vattenfall and STEAG) to rank the mining fields have been
                  reviewed. Briefly, the conclusions of the studies can be stated as follows:


                  ·    The New Mining Field contains adequate coal reserves to supply the
                       current TPPs until the end of their producing lives and the proposed new
                       Kosovo C plant with up to 2,000 MW capacity for in excess of 40 years;


                  ·    Field South has the most unfavorable geological conditions and the large
                       overburden thickness would make this the most expensive and least
                       favorable option for development;


                  ERM ­ ELC - CSA                               THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                         272

                   ·   Field D would be the most favorable site in terms of environmental and
                       social impact, as well as of post mining use. The stripping ratio is
                       comparable to that of the New Mining Field. However, the field does not
                       contain enough coal reserves to supply the proposed increased TPP
                       capacity and the net calorific value is lower than in Sibovc. In addition
                       there would be conflict with the spatial planning proposals for the area, as
                       there is a proposal to construct a motorway through the area, which could
                       effectively sterilize part of the minable lignite.


                  Based on the above considerations, all indications concur in pointing out the
                  New Mining Field as the most convenient one for exploitation.


                  The present Consultant concurs with this recommendation. It is noted that the
                  site visit in September 2007 established that KEK has already started
                  preparatory works to strip the overburden at the southern end of Sibovc SW.
                  The main characteristics of the Sibovc lignite are listed here after:


                   ·   Heat value: 8,300 kJ/kg (range of 6,000-10,000 kJ/kg)
                   ·   Moisture: 42%
                   ·   Ash: 15%
                   ·   Sulphur: 1.1% total, 0.35% combustible (range of combustible: 0.1-0.7%)
                   ·   Harmful elements: Cl, F, Na, K, Hg, V, Pb, Zn, Cd
                   ·   Ample calcium for desulphurization
                   ·   Ash sintering temperature: <1,000 °C; melting point: 1,300 °C.


                  The future development of the mine, as related with the progressive phasing
                  off of the Bardh and Mirash mines, is represented in a schematic form in
                  Figure 4.3.2.2a.

                  The rate of development of New Mining Field, which has adequate reserves to
                  supply a 2,000 MW plant for a period in excess of 40 years, depends on the

                 development strategy chosen for Kosovo C TPP and will be linked to
                 progressive phase out of the Bardh and Mirash mines. Adoption of Approach
                 A would imply highly accelerated development of the mine, which would
                 have to be capable of producing about 20 million tons/year of lignite by 2019.
                 Major efforts would be required in operational organization and equipment
                 purchase in order to achieve such goal.


                 A typical demand profile ( se also previous Table 4.3.2.1b) in the hypothesis of
                 phased development would look like Table 4.3.2.2a below (reported values are
                  obviously approximate, since they depend on the actual load factor of the
                  TPPs, as well as on the unit consumption of coal for each generated MWh).

                  (1)    In Italics lignite supplied by existing Bardh/Mirash mines
                  (2)    It is assumed that Kosovo A ends production in 2017, while Kosovo B continues until
                  2030


                  It is noted that this demand profile assumes that in a first stage the Kosovo C
                  plant will consist of two 500 MW units (1,000 MW), to be followed by a
                  second set of two units after 2022.


                  Up to 2014 the demand is also consistent with the scenario provided in the
                  original Vattenfall report of 2005 , although the assumptions regarding the
                  power plants were different. However, in subsequent years the required coal
                  demand prediction rises up to 21 Mtons/year.


                  Should it be decided that the two additional 500 MW units should be
                  provided at an earlier stage (i.e. a total capacity at Kosovo C of 2,000 MW),
                  then the coal supply would increase to about 21 Mtons/year from the year
                  2019 (see Table 4.3.2.1a).


                  All the scenarios assume that the coal produced from the New Mining Field
                  will come on stream in 2010-2011, which is assessed to be the last period of
                  significant production from Mirash/Bardh mines. Thus, whichever scenario is
                  adopted, the preparatory work for developing the New Mining area should



                  ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                       THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                                  274

be progressing now. This is consistent with the finding that overburden
stripping is already underway.


For the purposes of the following analyses, limiting criteria will be assumed,
as follows:

·   the earliest date that significant production can be produced from the
    New Mining Filed is 2010/2012;
·   Sibovc will be in full production in 2012.


The principal differences in the scenarios relate to the year when the
maximum production of 21 Mtons/year shall be achieved, that is to the
timing of the impacts.


As refers to the development of the New Mining Field, the following
considerations are expressed in the above mentioned Vattenfall report
(relevant to the high production scenario):


The lacking advance in the preparation works of the opening-up of Sibovc is
problematic. Therefore, a high capacity will be required right at the beginning of
works. Already in 2008 a new equipment complex consisting of BWE (bucket wheel
excavator), conveyor belt (1.8 m width, belt speed of 6.5 m/s and capable of
transporting about 2,200 t/h) and spreader will have to be commissioned. Nevertheless
considerable overburden removal works will be required using shovel / truck. This
service should be contracted with third parties.
The following main equipment will be used:
Overburden - E 8B SRs 1300
               - E 9B SRs 1300
               - New BWE
               - E 9M SchRs 650 and in coal operation
Coal           - E 10M SchRs 650
               - E 8M SRs 1300
               - E 10B SRs 1300
               - New SchRs 650 or SRs 1300 or equivalent (2016).
In addition there are two spreaders A2RsB-5200 and one A2RsB-4400. The new
spreader should have a capacity of 8000 lcm/h matching the new BWE.


The capacity for overburden removal with the afore-mentioned equipment would
amount to 19.8 Mm3/year as reliable assumption and to 25.2 Mm3/year as maximum
assumption. On the other hand, the nominal capacity for the coal excavation would
amount to20.5 Mt/year as reliable assumption and to 25.0 Mt/year as maximum
assumption.


Owing to the existing overburden to coal ratio of the mine, this equipment complex is
suited for the long-term operation of Sibovc.


With reference to the employment level to be achieved in the New Mine, it
should be mentioned that currently the Mirash and Bardh mines employ
some 3,420 persons. On the other hand, it is acknowledged that this level of
employment is high by world standards and that if a private sector company



ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                  THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                          275

           is asked to acquire and manage the future mines, the employment level will
           be significantly lower.


           The predictions for the level of employment for the two main scenarios
           described above are as follows:

               ·    Production rising to 21Mt/year: 2,700 (by 2012)
               ·    Production at 9 Mt/year:                1,420 (by 2012)

           However, it should be noted that these estimates are still higher than the
           manning that would be expected from an internationally competitive mine
           and so the diminution of jobs in the medium to long term may be greater than
           anticipated above.


           In compensation for the loss of jobs, it is likely that the fewer jobs would be
           better paid for the improved productivity.


           The maps presented in Figures 4.3.4c and 4.3.4d show indicative mine
           development lines in 2023 and 2033, under the phased Approach B.



4.3.2.3    Power Plant Location

           In terms of site requirements for the new power plants, the results of the "Pre-
           Feasibility Studies for New Lignite Fired Power Plant and for Pollution
           Mitigation Measures at Kosovo B Power Plant" were also taken into
           consideration1. Requirements for plant sites include the following:


               ·    Unoccupied free land or able to be easily vacated, preferably zoned for
                    industrial activity;

               ·    Relatively flat topography;

               ·    Reasonable soil conditions, no seismic faults nearby, not prone to
                    flooding;

               ·    Downwind from population centres and no large population centres
                    in immediate vicinity;

               ·    No natural parks, wildlife and archaeological sites nearby;

               ·    Not highly visible; and

               ·    Satisfactory economics evaluation.


           The area required to accommodate the power plant, including offices, water
           treatment, oil storage and maintenance shops, depends on the actual design of
           the structures (e.g. need or less of a flue gas desulphurization plant), but is
           anyway in the order of 600 x 400 m for a 4x500 MW plant. An additional
           surface of 200 x 500 m should be foreseen for lignite storage.


           The following connection requirements must be also considered (reported
           values refer to the full capacity of 2,000 MW):

           Measures at Kosovo B Power Plant," Electrowatt/Econo, on behalf of EAR, February 2006.


           ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                     THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                         276

     ·      Lignite fuel. Assuming a unit consumption of 1.1 tons/MWh,
            2,200 tons/h of lignite are needed during the plant operation period.
            Such lignite shall come from the New Mine through a belt conveyor
            system, wherefore the distance between mine and plant becomes an
            essential element.


     ·      Water. Raw water requirements, mostly for the cooling tower, amount
            to about 5,600 m3/h, corresponding to around 43 million m3/year.
            Such water needs pre-treatment prior to its use. Water can be
            delivered through the already existing multipurpose (irrigation and
            industrial use) system, consisting of a 40 km long channel which
            originates from the Gazivodo Lake and is operated by Ibër-Lepenc, a
            public enterprise created for the task.


     ·      Electric power. Regardless of the chosen location, the electric power
            from the plant has to be transferred by means of 400 kV lines to the
            400 kV switchyard located close to Kosovo B TPP, from where all the
            cross border lines, including the new one to Albania, are leaving.


     ·      Ash disposal. Approximately 400 tons/h of ash are produced during
            plant operation, for a total of around 93 million tons during the life of
            the plant. Its disposal through dumping must be strictly controlled to
            avoid soil and groundwater contamination from ash derived alkaline
            waters, wherefore adequate sealing of the dumps bottom has to be
            foreseen.


     ·      Water disposal. About 20% of the plant water consumption has to be
            disposed of, following a process of purification / neutralization. Such
            percentage may drop to about 15%, in case the hydraulic system for
            ashes transportation is adopted.


     ·      Access. A good access to the plant site, by road or rail or both is a
            must, especially during the construction phase, when pieces of as
            much as 500 tons are transported for installation.


In accordance with the TOR, three development scenarios need to be
investigated for the potential location of the new TPP.
A prefeasibility study in 2006 initially identified three sites: Kosovo B, Bivolak
and Grabovc i Poshtem In early 2007, another potential site next to Kosovo A
TPP was added, replacing Grabovc i Poshtem, which had been found
unsuitable.


The three sites (Kosovo B, Bivolak and Kosovo A ­ see Figure 4.3.2.3a) have
been analysed in a study commissioned from EAR to a consortium formed by
Poyry, CESI, Terna and Decon as Task 4 of a more exhaustive study and the
corresponding (draft report was submitted in June 20071).

                  From a technical point of view (morphology, foundation, distance from
                  existing facilities, etc.) the three sites, which are separated by only a few
                  kilometers, are quite similar. As noted in the 2007 Poyry study1, however,
                  they have very different environmental and social characteristics. The final
                  choice of location will thus depend on these considerations (see Section 5).

                  Kosovo B Site

                  There is free space to the north of the existing power plant reserved for future blocks as
                  plans to locate 2,100 MW generating capacity to the site have existed since the 1980's
                  (Figure 4.3.2.3b).

The site topography is flat. The site is just outside of the lignite seam. The foundation
conditions are reasonable. The existing plant structures (350 MW units) are sitting on
a reinforced concrete slab of 3.5 metres thick immersed at 7 metres depth.


The site is bordered by the Sitnica River in the west. There is a risk of flooding along
the river banks. In February-March 2006 the heavy rainfall associated with melting
snow in the mountains raised the level of the river by 2.9 meters in 24 hours. The
lignite yard and lignite handling facilities were submerged and the plant operations
had to be stopped.


To the west of this free area there is a huge fly ash dump of approximately 15 million
tons. The ash dump occupies an area of 50 - 60 hectares (600 x 1000 m). The ash dump
is no longer utilized for ash disposal as the ash is now taken to the Mirash mine
through a new double pipeline. The ash dump, or at least a part of it have to be
relocated if Kosovo C including the lignite yard is going to fit there.


The 400 kV switchyard receives all the cross border 400 kV lines and it is located less
than a kilometer to NE from the site.


There is a double conveyor belt system feeding the existing B1 and B2 units from the
mines.


The water supply channel to the plant has been designed for 21.000 m3/h and only
1.500 ­ 2.000 m3/h is currently used by the plant. The delivery limit between Ibër-
Lepenc and KEK is on the western side of the Sitnica River about 1 km from the plant.
There is a screening and metering plant at the supply point and the water flows to the
plant by gravity.


The operation at this site makes it possible to have many joint auxiliary functions with
Kosovo B units if considered advantageous and acceptable for both parties.

                  Bivolac Site

                  The area outside of the north-eastern corner of the Sibovc field is a slightly undulating
                  hilly agricultural area. The area is fairly densely populated, and the village Bivolak is
                  located close to the site (Figure 4.3.2.3c).


                  Some 15% of the site is in the Sitnica floodplain, the rest on the top of the lignite seam.
                  The seam thickness is less than 10 meters, and the overburden thickness is less than 10
                  meters as well. The site of the existing Kosovo B TPP is similar, and the foundation
                  systems could be similar as there. More extensive site preparation and excavations
                  would, however, be required as the height difference between the floodplain and the hill
                  top is about 25 to 30 m.


                  The water supply is close as the bifurcation station of Ibër-Lepenc (Feronikel and
                  Kosovo B) is located at the site.

                  The area needs a new two lane access road and the Sitnica River and river plain have
                  to be crossed with a good bridge. The estimated length of the access road is 5 - 6 km
                  from Miloshevo.


                  There are 400 kV transmission lines crossing the area. The distance to the 400 kV
                  Kosovo B substation is approximately 3 km.

Figure 4.3.2.3c   Bivolac Site




                  Kosovo A Site

                  The Kosovo A site is located just to the west from the existing Kosovo A TPP. There
                  are old currently abandoned fertilizer, gasification and heating plant facilities. That
                  area can be used after dismantling the existing fertlization and gasification structures
                  for the new power plant (Figure 4.3.2.3d).


                  The site topography is flat. The site is just outside of the lignite seam. The foundation
                  systems could be similar as for the existing TPP's.


                  The site is recognized as a probable source of extensive phenol contamination in the
                  river Sitnica and needs to be rehabilitated. No exact figures on the extent of the soil
                  and river pollution exist.

                  There is a double conveyor belt system feeding the existing Kosovo A from the Mirash
                  mine. The site is bordered to the west by a railroad to Obiliq. Road access is good.


                  The 400 kV switchyard at Kosovo B receives all the cross border 400 kV lines and it is
                  located some 2 kilometers from the site. At the site in its eastern side there are 110 and
                  220 kV switchyards.
                  For water supply either the Ibër-Lepenc channel system has to be lengthened or the
                  actual supply source for Kosova A TPP can be used. Currently the Kosovo A TPP
                  receives its water from a pump house located some 4 km to NE in Prukovc village.
                  There are 3 x 600 l/s and one 300 l/s pumps. The pipeline can transfer more than 2
                  m3/s water to the plant.1


                   The operation at this site makes it possible to have many joint auxiliary functions with

                                                                             282

4.3.2.4    Unit Size

           Different sizes of individual units were considered - 125, 300, 500 and
           750 MW. In principle, the largest possible size is the most efficient. However,
           other factors influence the decision, in particular the characteristics of the
           transmission network and the selected plant technology. In the present case,
           the existing network cannot support units any larger than 500 MW, in order
           not to lose synchronicity on the grid in case of transmission line loss. With
           regard to plant technology, the choice of CFB technology (see next Paragraph)
           would mean a unit size of 300 MW.


           The smallest unit size of 125 MW was eliminated from consideration because
           it does not meet the high efficiency standards required to minimize carbon
           dioxide or other emissions (the consolidate industry design for such unit
           foresees a less sophisticated thermodynamic cycle). In addition, such units
           occupy larger areas per MW installed and have higher unit costs than larger
           ones. The only two principles that theoretically would justify this choice do
           not apply here. Indeed, the system stability does not require so small units
           (see the size of Kosovo B) or the characteristics of the demand and demand
           growth. As a matter of fact all previous studies do not consider 125 MW a
           viable option or mostly do not consider the 125 MW units at all.


           The final unit size will therefore be either 300 or 500 MW and will depend on
           the technology chosen.



4.3.2.5    Plant Technology

           Different technologies are potentially applicable for the power plant. Their
           adoption must take into account, among others, the size of the individual
           units (due to problems connected to the electric grid stability, in Kosovo the
           maximum viable net capacity is limited to 500 MW).


           With respect to the technology to be adopted in the plant, in accordance with
           the Poyry study the most probable concept is 4x500 MW net (around 535 MW
           gross) pulverized fired (PF) plant with supercritical steam parameters (260-
           275 bar/580-600 °C with reheat and condenser pressure of 0.045 bar).
           Its efficiency would be 42-43%, versus the 30% of the presently operating
           plants, and it will be equipped with wet flue gas desulphurization plant after
           the actual steam boiler.


           The plant cleans its flue gases from dust in the electrostatic precipitators.
           Thereafter the flue gases are planned to be taken into the large cooling tower
           and mixed with the exiting water vapour of the tower, i.e. the highly visible
           stack is eliminated.


           The final flue gas emissions, in accordance with the EU LCP rules for
           >500 MW TPPs, shall be as follows (values are lower than those shown in
           Table 4.3.2.1a, since they refer to new TPPs):

               ·    Sulphur dioxide, SO2         <200 mg/nm3


           ERM ­ ELC - CSA                               THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                   283

    ·    Nitrogen oxides, NOx         <200 mg/nm3
    ·    Particulates                 <30 mg/nm3


The main characteristics of the pulverized firing (PF) technology are reported
here after:


    ·    Traditional method for large scale plants 100-2000 MW, heat release
         capacity in single boiler (1100 MWe).

    ·    Needs uniform fine particle size for complete combustion, <0,1 mm.

    ·    Maximum temperature leakage point and half ball around or above
         the ash melting point of Sibovc lignite,

    ·    Lignite dried with hot flue gases from the furnace in the beater wheel
         pulverizer.

    ·    Low NOx-burners reduce nitrogen oxides production and for Kosovar
         lignite is enough to meet the limits.

    ·    Emissions normally to be handled after the furnace by separate
         systems.


As an alternative, a similar plant with the same steam parameters but
applying circulating fluidized bed (CFB) might be adopted, with slightly
lower efficiency and no need for wet flue gas desulphurization. However, the
largest CFB lignite fired boiler currently in operation has a capacity of
300 MW (one of 460 MW is now under construction), thus the applicability of
such technology to larger units hass not yet been tested. The main
characteristics of the circulating fluidized bed (CFB) technology are reported
here after:


    ·    Combustion takes place at constant temperature around 900 °C ­ air is
         introduced at different levels.

    ·    Suitable for wet or hard to ignite fuels as hot bed material dries and
         ignites the fuel ­ high ash is allowed.

    ·    Accepts coarse fuel < 10 mm maximum particle size.

    ·    Ideal temperature for calcination if limestone present ­
         desulphurization takes place in the bed, Ca/S mole ratio >3 required
         for 90% S capture.

    ·    Low combustion temperature keeps NOx formation low.


Various fuels can be combusted simultaneously.


In consideration of the above, it can be stated that the 500 MW unit size offers
several advantages, including the possibility of applying more efficient
technologies and supercritical steam production, the lower emission of
greenhouse gases and the smaller land required to fit the complete 2,000 MW
power plant.


The 300 MW unit size, on the other hand, is associated with a higher
operation flexibility and can adopt without restrictions the CFB technology.

     4.3.3      Scenarios Identification

                In conclusion, it is deemed that the initial choice among the various scenarios
                shall concern the development strategy (fast or phased), which largely
                depends on the macro-economic context of the country and is only marginally
                affected by the above described aspects.
                Within each strategy, however, the above described aspects have a very
                important bearing (as shown at qualitative level in Table 4.3.3a) and must be
                closely analyzed to come up with the best solution.

                  Fair impact


                Table 4.3.3a shows that the main issues impacting social conditions and
                environment are the timing of development (of power plants and therefore of
                New Mining Field) and the location of the power plants.


                Nevertheless, the SESA will focus only on the location of the power plant.
                However, a brief analysis of advantages/disadvantages connected to all other
                parameters identified (timing of power plants and mine development, plant
                size and plant technology) will be presented in Section 5.


                Section 5 will therefore present a detailed comparison between different site
                alternatives in terms of environmental and social impacts, while Section 6 will
                identify potential mitigation and compensation measures. All other
                parameters (timing of power plants and mine development, plant size and
                plant technology) will be considered as constants in each identified scenario
                and no indication of the "preferred option" will be given; such assumption is
                based on the fact that the other variables have limited influence on
                environmental and social aspects.


                Moreover, also the assumptions specified in Paragraph 4.3.1 on the future role
                of TPP A and TPP B will have the same environmental and social impacts on
                all scenarios, while from an economical and financial point of view they
                present big differences.

         Based on the above, the SESA (Section 5) will therefore compare the impacts
         related to the three identified scenarios concerning site location: Kosovo B,
         Bivolac and Kosovo A. Such three scenarios will be examined and discussed
         (through the help of proper environmental/social indicators), in order to
         identify the most suitable option for future development, in terms of site
         location.



4.3.4    Foreseen Environmental and Social Interferences in TPP Development

         Starting from the present situation (2008) already described in Section 3, two
         alternatives are considered: no development (aternative zero) or development
         (phased or rapid) of Kosovo C (2,000 MW).
         Two different time sequences are reviewed: short term (2023, when the first
         unit of Kosovo C will come on line and Kosovo A will have shut down) and
         long term (2033, when Kosovo C will be fully operational at 2,000 MW, and
         Kosovo A and B will have shut down), both assuming a phased development.
         Figures 4.3.4a-d present respectively:


         a.  alternative zero in 2023;
         b.  alternative zero in 2033;
         c.  development of Kosovo C in 2023;

                 There are a number of issues that can affect the project, irrespective of the

                2.  TPP B load factor for alternative zero: 0,65; Zhur load factor for alternative zero: 0,155;
                    medium growth scenario (MGS)

                4.  Occupied land =:land occupied by plants and mines (industrial areas) + overburden dumps
                    + ash dumps ­ reclaimed land
                5.  SO2 concentration in emission of Kosovo B rehabilitated 400mg/Nm3
                6.  Waste water from Power plants




                 The zero alternative is theoretical: in such case, huge quantities of energy
                 would need to be imported from other countries and the corresponding
                 impacts would begin at the border. Furthermore, the country's economics
                 would be heavily impacted by the need for large expenditures to cover energy
                 imports. This option is thus provided as touchstone to identify impacts.


                 The main anticipated issue is connected to water availability and water
                 balances. For such reason Paragraph 5.1.4 presents a detailed analysis of
                 surface water demand and reserves.
                 Another important impact is the increase of CO2 emissions. At present the
                 project foresees plants for CO2 capture; should the final design differ from
                 this, other alternatives would need to be investigated.


                 There is no available quantitative data relating to the positive and negative
                 aspects of each project option, therefore, the above Table does not include
                 figures for the socioeconomic issues. The development project will result in
                 resettlement. As noted in the social baseline section, local communities are
                 willing to be resettled but would prefer to be moved in one phase or at least
                 over a short amount of time. The prospect of being resettled in 2033, for
                 example, means for many of them that it is difficult to plan for their future

and a number of residents have said that they would move anyway before the
proposed date for development. Uncertainty or a protracted period of
"planning blight" is likely to exacerbate impacts on communities.
Findings from the consultations and the households survey suggest that the
preferred option is to develop Kosovo C; in particular, residents surveyed and
consulted believe that the current situation, living near to the existing power
plants and mine, is either bad or intolerable (alternative zero). The
communities of Hade, Lajthishte and Grabovc i Poshtem/Lagja e Berisheve
would like to be resettled immediately as they believe that the pollution of air
and soil is having a negative impact on their health and agricultural
production. As to site options, little difference was noted. Further, since the
existing Kosova A and B do not meet current required EU emission standards,
any development that cleans up the existing plants and leads to a new and
cleaner plant will have a positive impact. Additionally, all communities
consulted believe that the construction and establishment of Kosovo C will
bring a number of benefits to them. These include: improved health, cleaner
air and employment opportunities.


The number of people employed in mining activities will decrease (due to
modern available technologies), but will be more than compensated by the
increase of people employed in the power plants and in induced activities.

5          IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS




           The following paragraphs discuss anticipated environmental and social
           impacts of the proposed development plans.


           Impacts focus on the area of mine development but take into consideration
           the interaction of various activities in nearby areas.


           Figure 5a presents the area of impacts with the location of present and future
           facilities, including the three potential sites for power plant development.
           In Paragraph 5.4, using environmental and social parameters/indicators, a
           ranking of the different future power plants sites is attempted in order to
           suggest the "preferred option" (in terms of site location).



5.1        ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS


5.1.1      Preamble


           As anticipated in Section 3, several Pressure- State- Response indicators have
           been identified and (whenever possible) quantified to describe the present
           environmental situation in Kosovo (mainly due to the existing KEK facilities).


           In the present Section, a discussion is given on potential modification of the
           indicators (for each environmental component) with reference to the future
           situation; whenever the available data are not adequate to properly quantify
           the indicators (in both present and future scenarios), a qualitative evaluation
           is presented, based on professional judgment.



5.1.2      Air


5.1.2.1    Pressure Indicators

           Emissions of Greenhouse Gasses

           Lignite is an important source of energy and international Community
           reliance on this fossil fuel for electricity generation is growing. The
           combustion of lignite, however, adds a significant amount of carbon dioxide
           to the atmosphere per unit of heat energy, more than the combustion of other
           fossil fuels.


           Nevertheless, new power plants, with higher conversion efficiency, are able to
           reduce specific emissions (emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of electrical
           energy production).


           Table 4.3.4 shows the anticipated increase in CO2 emissions from the present
           value of about 5.2 Mtons/y to about 17.1 Mt/y, when 2,000 MW will be

installed. The table shows also that the specific emission will drop from about
1.2 t/MWh to 0.9 t/MWh.


The above values are of course approximate since the right value depends on
the technology and the size of the plants, which are still under design.


We must however recall that greenhouse gases emission is a global problem,
since it influences climate, and that the quantity (quote) of carbon dioxide
emission that will be attributed to Kosovo for its energetic development is still
under discussion.


Among the different solutions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, one of the
most realistic is the Carbon Sequestration (CS).


This is an approach to mitigate global warming by capturing carbon dioxide
from large point sources, such as fossil fuel power plants, and storing it
instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. Technology for large scale capture
of CO2 is already commercially available and fairly well developed. This
consists in "washing" flue gases with absorption by alkaline solutions, such as
ammines, in order to separate, liquefy carbon dioxide and reinject it in
impervious underground reservoir.


Although CO2 has been injected into geological formations for various
purposes, the long term storage of CO2 is a relatively untried concept and yet
no large scale power plant operates with a full carbon capture and storage
system.


Carbon sequestration (CS) applied to a modern conventional power plant
could reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80-90%
compared to a plant without carbon sequestration. Nevertheless, capturing
and compressing CO2 requires energy and would increase the fuel needs of a
coal-fired plant with CS by about 25%, therefore increasing the cost of energy
from a new power plant with CS by more than 25%.


Furthermore C S applies to locations where an underground storage reservoir
is near, i.e. where suitable geological formations capable of receiving and
maintaining underground the CO2 exist.


For the present project the problem of CO2 reduction has to be investigated
taking into account international agreements, site potentiality and overall
economics of the project: a partial sequestration could be a viable solution.


Nevertheless, the proposed preliminary layout of future plants, as presented
in Section 4 (see Figures 4.3.4c-d), includes also an area, for each plant, in which
CO2 will be captured.

Emissions of SO2, NOx, Particulate

As above mentioned, emissions from the new plant will depend on the choice
of technology and the size of the units, which are still under design, although
in general, new power plants, which have higher conversion efficiency, are
able to reduce specific emissions (emissions per unit of electrical energy
production).


As shown in Tables 4.3.2.1d and 4.3.2.1e, the emissions of NOx, SO2 and
particulates will be reduced as soon as the first Kosovo C unit will be put into
operation and, as a consequence, the production from Kosovo A, the most
impacting power plant, will be reduced and then closed.


The situation could sooner be improved with some intervention on Kosovo A
and B power plants.


In fact, concerning policy requirements, the environmental performance of
existing plants will have to comply with the Letter of Energy Sector Development
Policy (LESDP, June 2006), which recommends full compliance with EU
regulations. LESDP, in particular, has the following list of urgent
environmental investment:

    ·    Waste water treatment;

    ·    Electrostatic precipitators;

    ·    Ash handling;

    ·    Environmental monitoring.


Some activities to improve the environmental performance of Kosovo A units
are in program and/or in progress (ex. Electrostatic precipitators. ahs
handling, Clean up project).


Moreover, the Athens Treaty (ECSEE) sets obligations for existing TPPs to
fully comply with LCP Directive after 31 December 2017. There is no policy in
place that might allow these units to run a limited number of hours after 31
December 2017. LCP Directive states that "plants may be exempted from
compliance with the emission limit values and from their inclusion in the national
emission reduction plan if the operator of an existing plant undertakes a written
declaration not to operate the plant for more than 20 000 operational hours starting
from1 January 2008 and ending no later than 31 December 2015". It is assumed
that any power plant operating in Kosovo after 2017 will comply with LCP
directive (therefore both TPP A and TPP B).


The future situation at regime (TPP C 2,000 MW) will improve due to more
efficient technology: for example, particulate emissions from the plants (as
already presented in Table 4.3.4a) will be 2.8 Mt/y, compared to the present
value which is about 7.8 Mt/y; NOx emissions will be also slightly reduced
from 20.3 Mt/y to19.1 Mt/y, while SO2 could increase from present 13.8 Mt/y
to 19.1 Mt/y.

5.1.2.2    State Indicators

           Climate

           The new plants will not have an impact on climate features of the area.


           As above discussed, CO2 emissions may impact climate but on a large scale
           and no influence is foreseen in the interested area.


           On the contrary, local climate conditions influence the impacts of the
           development, mainly in terms of wind direction (downwind areas are more
           affected by air emissions ­ see Paragraph 5.3).


           Air Quality

           When Kosovo C is fully operational, the air quality will improve (due to the
           fact that the new power plant will comply with the LCP Directive and the
           existing plants will be shut down).


           In fact:

                ·     particulate emissions will drop significantly, NOx emissions will
                      decrease and SO2 emissions will slightly increase;

                ·     flue gas dispersion will occur inside the cooling towers. This method
                      will allow a good mixing of pollutants with air and will increase
                      plume rise in such a way to disperd pollutant over a wider area,
                      therefore decreasing ground concentration. This is confirmed by the
                      study carried out by Poiry et al (EAR Reconstruction, Contract nr
                      05KOS01/04/005 - Studies to support the development of new

                      operation is estimated. The results show that concerning "the maxima
                      of the immission and deposition caused by the stack, current and future
                      emissions of all TPPs are below 10 % of the limit values. The maxima are
                      situated about 8 km SSW from Kosovo Bsite and about 800 to 1,000 m north
                      of Bardh";

                      belt conveyor to hydraulic transportation, Kosovo A and B ash dumps

           the operation of Kosovo A and Kosovo B not yet revamped to comply with air

           emissions and therefore a slight increase of NOx and SO2 concentrations.

5.1.3      Soil and Groundwater


5.1.3.1    Pressure Indicators

           Occupied Land

           In the present situation, the main areas occupied, directly or indirectly, by
           energy production facilities include the following:

               ·    Power plants;

               ·    Mining areas;

               ·    Overburden dumps;

               ·    Ash dumps.


           The proposed new power plants, new mining development areas and
           connected infrastructures will require additional land. Nevertheless, areas
           currently occupied by ash and overburden dumps would be reclaimed. As
           already presented in Table 4.3.4a (and shown in Figures 4.3.4a-d), occupied
           land would decrease from the existing 2,900 ha to approximately 800 in 2033.


           Moreover, a large residual pit of about 5 km² will remain in the northern part
           of the New Mining Field. In the long term (about 40-50 years from now), this
           pit could be developed as a recreational lake, surrounded by a greenbelt,
           located within easy reach of Prishtina.


           Sources of Soil and Groundwater Contamination

           Current and past operations have had an important role as sources of soil and
           groundwater contamination.


           When Kosovo C is fully operational, existing facilities will be shut down,
           allowing the areas they occupied to be better investigated, cleaned up as
           necessary and reclaimed.


           Modern technologies, which will be adopted for Kosovo C and new mining
           development, comply with legislative standards and best practices; therefore,
           the quality of soil and groundwater is not anticipated to be significantly
           affected by their operation. Deposition of air pollutants should also improve
           in future, since particulate emissions will sharply decrease, as discussed in the
           previous paragraph.


5.1.3.2    State Indicators

           Geology

           The proposed new plants and mining development will not have an impact
           on the geology of the area. On the contrary, the geologic conditions will be
           analyzed in detailed in order to select the best location for the new plants.

                  Hydrogeology

                  The proposed new plants and mining development will not have an impact
                  on the hydrogeology of the area, since it is anticipated that the water supply
                  for the new power plants will come from surface water resources and/or
                  canals.


                  Quality of Groundwater and Soil

                  At present, the areas occupied by energy production facilities (including
                  power plants, mines, ash dumps and overburden dumps) present high levels
                  of soil and groundwater contamination.


                  As already mentioned, modern technologies, which will be adopted for
                  Kosovo C and new mining development, grant compliance with legislative
                  standards and best practices. Therefore the quality of soil and groundwater
                  will not be impacted significantly by the operation of new plants.


                  Moreover, when Kosovo C will be fully operational, the existing plants will be
                  shut down and the areas at present occupied by all facilities will be cleaned
                  up (as necessary) and reclaimed.


                  Since air emissions will decrease, also the quality of soil, connected with the
                  deposition of air pollutants, will improve in the future situation.

     5.1.4.1      Pressure Indicators

                  Surface Water Consumption

                  According to EAR Study, raw water consumption from the Kosovo C TPP will
                  be around 47.93 Mm3 per year.
                  Specific consumption (consumption per unit of generated energy) will
                  improve when Kosovo C is fully operational (2,000 MW) thanks to more
                  modern and efficient technology.


                  The future Total Water Demand in the area as reported in the "EAR Water
                  Supply study", including Kosovo C water use, is presented in Tables 5.1.4.1a-b,
                  for the following two circumstances (see also Paragraph 3.3.3.2):


                  ·      Total Water Demand for 5,000 ha to be irrigated;
                  ·      Total Water Demand for 10,000 ha to be irrigated.

                      The Total Water Demand was determined on the basis of the foreseen water
                      uses, as reported in Paragraph 3.3.3.2 of the this Report, and considering a
                      specific water consumption for Kosovo C of 1.52 m3/s, that corresponds to the
                      most water-consuming technology.


                      Raw water will be taken from Iber-Lepenc Hydro system. A monitoring
                      system will need to be in place to measure water take. Major issues are
                      connected to water availability, therefore please refer to indicator "Surface
                      water reserves" for a complete analysis of the foreseen impacts and water
                      balance.


                      Generation of Wastewater

                      The present and past operations have generated wastewater stream which has
                      been discharged to surface water without any treatment producing significant
                      impact on rivers and surface water.


                      Kosovo C wastewater production will decrease, passing from the present 9.5
                      Mm3/y to about 7.4 Mm3/y (as noted in Table 4.3.4a), as a result of recycling
                      and utilization of wastewater for hydraulic ash transport.


                      Kosovo C will need to be fitted with an adequate water treatment plant
                      (WWTP) that collects all polluted streams from the power plant (boiler blow

                                                               301

           down, oily waters, cooling tower blow down, demineralization effluent etc).
           The WWTP has to be designed to comply with all EU standards for surface
           water discharge. The use of water coming from the WWTP for cooling tower
           make up is also recommended to further minimize water consumption (see
           following paragraph).


           At the same time TPPA and B will have to be rendered compliant with EU
           standards.


           Also the new mining development will grant compliance with legislative
           standards and best practices, so that mine wastewater will be collected
           separately, monitored and treated before discharge.


           In summary, a significant improvement is anticipated at the discharge point
           in Sitnica River.
           A monitoring system will be needed to measure wastewater quality.



5.1.4.2    State Indicators

           Surface Water Reserves

           As already anticipated, the new plant will require additional water, which
           will be taken from the Iber-Lepenc Hydro system. No modification to the
           existing surface water resources are foreseen but the planned development
           anticipates that the Iber-Lepenc water system will be upgraded to reduce
           losses from leakage and that a monitoring system will be implemented, in
           order to measure water flow rates.


           The impacts of Kosovo C water use on the Iber-Lepenc water system were
           analyzed in detail in the above mentioned "EAR Water Supply study", which
           considered two cases of Total Water Demand (5,000 and 10,000 ha to be
           irrigated) and was based on the assumptions described in Paragraph 3.3.3.2.
           together with the following further assumptions:


               ·    the losses will be reduced to 25% of the total inflow to the system;

               ·    the estimated quantity of water supplied by the Iber-Lepenc hydro
                    system to municipal water companies will remain around 15 million
                    m3/year, that means capable of supplying 200,000 people with an
                    average consumption of 200 l/day/capita;

               ·    other assumptions, as discussed in the previous paragraph on pressure
                    indicators, i.e Kosovo C consumption of about 1.5 m3/s, Kosovo A and
                    Kosovo B at the present consumption of 0,08 and 0,4 m3/s
                    respectively, other industrial requirements at 1 m3/s.


           The total projected future demand from the Iber-Lepenc system for 2016

            ** Kosovo A is included for illustration purposes only. The three power plants (A, B and C) will not be operating at
            full capacity at the same time.


                      If we compare the future situation with the present situation (see Tables
                      3.3.3.2b and 3.3.3.2c), we note that through improvements in the Iber-Lepenc
                      canal, the increased water demand from Kosovo C will be mainly balanced by
                      a reduction in losses in the overall system. Nevertheless, the Water
                      Exploitation Index (WEI) for the Iber-Lepenc system will increase to 57%, 65%
                      and 93% for the average, median and worst year respectively, a stark increase
                      as compared to the current situation. The high WEI indicates that conflicting
                      demands from various water users on the system will increase. These are
                      rated as likely to emerge in the medium term (5-10 years) and very likely to
                      emerge in the longer term. Since potable water supply and environmental
                      flows have priority use, the sectors most likely to be competing for water use
                      will be the industrial sector, including Kosovo C TPP, and irrigated

agriculture. Emphasis should therefore be placed on development of a
comprehensive policy, institutional and planning framework for water
resource management in the Iber-Lepenc system.


The EAR Water Supply report suggests the following main conclusions:


    ·    For multi-annual average inflows, if the total losses from the canal are lower
         than 25%, the system is able to supply enough water to cover all users' needs
         (as defined above); for the multi-annual average inflow to the main lake, the
         maximum permissible losses are 68%.

    ·    Even if the inflows to the main lake are equal to the worst year values (1950),
         the system is able to supply enough water to all users, including to the 10,000
         ha of irrigated area; for the worst year inflows to the main lake, the maximum
         permissible losses are 38%.

    ·    In the first hypothesis (multi-annual average flows and 5,000 ha irrigated) the
         water reserve is effective: the annual inflow to the main lake may decrease from
         410 million m3 to around 201 million m3 without affecting the users, but the
         total volume of the main lake at the end of the year will be lower. This value is
         equal to the total annual outflow from the main lake.

    ·    In the 25 years of available data, the total inflow has never gone below 201
         million m3 per year.

    ·    In the second hypothesis (worst year flows and 10,000 ha irrigated), the water
         reserve is also effective: the annual inflow to the main lake may decrease from
         410 million m3 to around 220 million m3 without affecting the users, but the
         total volume of the main lake at the end of the year will be lower. This value is
         equal to the total annual outflow from the main lake.

    ·     In the 25 years of available data, the total inflow has never been lower than
         220 million m3 per year.

    ·    At the same time, it is very important to use current flow compensation with
         the secondary reservoir's spillways and the excess water from the main lake to
         ensure the necessary flow to the main canal.


The EAR report concludes that the Iber-Lepenc system can supply the
planned development, provided that:


    ·    the main canal is repaired, so as to reduce its losses to 25%. If current
         estimated losses (50%) remain unchanged, the system will be able to supply
         enough water to all users, but the annual inflow to the main lake will have to
         be greater than 271 million m3, otherwise the lake will empty. During the
         1948-1972 period, the annual rainfall has been lower than this value twice, in
         1950 and 1956;

    ·    a buffer basin is built at the end of the main canal, with a capacity
         corresponding to 10 days of Kosovo C and B's average consumption
         (approximately 1,750,000 m3)) in order to ensure a regular and permanent
         supply, even in emergency cases, and to enable to make the necessary repairs
         to the main canal;

    ·    the water compensation in the secondary reservoir is made with accuracy;

    ·    the weather does not change drastically and the average rainfall does not
         decrease dramatically (below the worst year ­ 1950).


Provided these measures are undertaken and competing demands are
managed within a comprehensive framework, the conclusion of the EAR
report, that the Iber-Lepenc hydro system will be able to supply water to the
Kosovo C power plant in 2016, remains valid.



Further Comment s on Water Resources Issues related to Kosovo C TPP

Concerns about water resources availability were also raised by a World Bank
technical mission that took place in March 2008, aimed at assessing water
resources issues related to the proposed new Kosovo C power plant and to
contribute to the SESA. The main findings of the mission with regard to the
water issues were as follows:


    ·    EAR Water Supply study does not take in consideration current and planned
         additional use of water resource for Pristina water supply by the Pristina
         Regional Water Company (around 1 m3/s to reduce water shortage to Pristina
         Municipality).

    ·    The study includes two different scenarios for the agriculture irrigation
         developments, i.e. 5,000 and 10,000 ha, that are far-away the figure considered
         as reference value at the time of the canal construction (20,000 ha). The
         Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development foresees bringing
         18,000 ha under irrigation (with water from the Iber irrigation canal) to
         further develop the agriculture sector in the medium (5-10 years) to long-
         term.

    ·    The assumption of the study to reduce the specific water consumption from the
         current 340 l/ca.day to 200 l/ca.day by 2016 is realistic only if significant
         investments in the internal potable water distribution network are made and
         water demand management is introduced in Mitrovica and Pristina
         Municipalities.

    ·    The study does not take into account return flows from the power plant to the
         Iber-Lepenc river basin. These return flows are approximately 60% of the
         intake volumes of the plants and can likely be used for irrigation.

    ·    The Water Exploitation Index (WEI), calculated on the basis of the yearly
         average water demand (198 million m3), and the yearly water availability,
         equal to 410 million m3 as the multi-annual average and 250 million m3 as the
         worst year case, is 48% and 79% respectively which are significantly above
         the WEI warning threshold of 20%, distinguishing the non-stressed from a
         stressed region. Sever water stress can occur where the WEI exceeds 40%
         indicating unsuitable water uses.

    ·    Competing water demands are likely to emerge in the medium-term (5-10
         years) and very likely to occur in the longer term.

    ·    Institutional settings and water strategy development as specified in the
         Kosovo Water Law (Law No, 2004/24) is at its first stage considering that at
         this moment no water management plan or river basin management plan have
         been prepared. As a result there is a limited oversight regarding the
         availability of water resources in the Iber system, non clear policy for strategic

         allocation of water over various sectors or the issuing of long-term water usage
         agreements, nor a well done mechanism for the resolution of competing water
         demand.


Furthermore, the EAR Water Supply study does not include the analysis of
water demand associated to Iber river downstream Gazivoda lake. A
comprehensive study of existing and planned water uses in the complete Iber
River basin should be carried out in order to develop a single river basin
management plan as recommended by the 2000/60/EC Directive.

Moreover, with reference to the World Bank OP 7.5 on Projects on International
Waterways, the following recommendations have to be applied:

    ·    the cooperation and goodwill of riparians is essential for the efficient use and
         protection of the waterway. Therefore, it attaches great importance to
         riparians' making appropriate agreements or arrangements for these purposes
         for the entire waterway or any part thereof.

    ·    The beneficiary state is required, if it has not already done, formally to
         notify the other riparians of the pro-posed project and its Project Details

    ·    Furthermore it shall be ascertained whether the riparians have entered into
         agreements or arrangements or have established any institutional framework
         for the international waterway concerned.


In conclusion, a number of steps are recommended to ensure the long-term
reliability and sustainability of water supply to the Kosovo C TPP and water
resources in the Iber-Lepenc system overall. Key steps include:


    ·    allocating funds to rehabilitation of the Iber-Lepenc canal;


    ·    developing a river basin management plan for the Iber-Lepenc system
         along the guidelines specified in the EU Water Framework Directive;


    ·    development of water infrastructure investment plans and feasibility
         studies for the Iber-Lepenc system, identified in the river basin
         management plan;


    ·    revising the water legal framework to allow for long-term water usage
         rights for industrial water users and mechanisms for addressing
         competing water demands; and


    ·    developing a policy framework and criteria to guide strategic
         allocation of water resources to various water using sectors with
         competing water demands.



In addition, based on a more thorough assessment conducted within the
framework of a river basin management plan, greater use might be made of
more water efficient technologies in Kosovo C, such as a dry cooling tower
system, in order to reduce water consumption from the Iber-Lepenc system,
making it more available to other uses

           Impact of this design change over the economics of the project and over the
           cabon dioxide emissions as a consequence of the reduced efficiency of the
           power station should be deeply investigated.


           Quality of River Water

           Contamination of rivers and streams is high all over the project sites. Modern
           technologies, which will be adopted for Kosovo C and new mining
           development, will comply with legislative standards and best practices. In
           particular, the new plant will monitor and treat wastewaters prior to
           discharge into rivers. Water quality should therefore improve.


           The existing monitoring system will be improved, in order to keep always
           surface water quality under control.


           % Population with Adequate Water Facilities

           At present, no complete inventory of water facilities exists. Nevertheless,
           water distribution networks are generally very old and in poor condition and
           few utilities are able to provide adequate amounts of water to the population.


           The future project will improve the situation, since new facilities will be built

           of water.



5.1.5      Noise


5.1.5.1    Pressure Indicators

           Noise Emissions

           Considering present operating plants and mines (and belt conveyors), noise is
           perceived by the population as a serious problem.


           The planned project would be developed according to legislation in force (all
           equipment will comply with noise standards and guidelines) and the power
           plant and mines will be located as far as possible from villages; should the
           future situation become intolerable, people would be resettled (see Paragraph
           5.2.5).


           The houses most affected are those located within 1,000 m from the power
           plants and 100 m from the belt conveyors.


           Monitoring activities will be carried out to identify hot spots, mitigate impacts
           as necessary and verify compliance with applicable standards, both for
           workers and residents.

5.1.5.2    State Indicators

           Zoning Plan and Noise Immissions

           A detailed noise mapping has never been considered necessary and carried
           out.
           As resulted during the public consultation meetings (see Paragraph 3.4), the
           resettlements located close to the mines, especially Grabovc and Hade
           villages, are affected by noise emitted by conveyer belts and mining
           operations.


           A similar situation will likely occur also in the future, meaning that the
           receptors closer to the mines and belt conveyors and to the power plants will
           be exposed to continuous noise levels.


           Good equipment design, monitoring before and during project
           implementation, and use of natural or artificial barriers will need to be
           adopted for Kosovo C and new mining development, and the development
           will need to comply with legislative standards and best practices.


           As a consequence an improvement is foreseen.


           A monitoring campaign of environmental noise will be carried out.



5.1.6      Solid Waste


5.1.6.1    Pressure Indicators

           Production of Ashes

           Waste production in terms of ashes and sludge, when Kosovo C is fully
           operational (2,000 MW), will increase, passing from the present 1 Mt/y to
           about 3.2 Mt/y (as already presented in Table 4.3.4a).
           However, ashes produced by Kosovo C will be used to fill exploited parts of
           the new mine and will contribute to land reclamation at the end of mine
           development (see Figures 4.3.4c and 4.3.4d for indicative mine development
           lines in 2023 and 2033, assuming a phased development).



           Generation of Industrial Solid Waste

           At present, only indicative solid waste production quantities are available.
           Under Kosovo C, measures will be taken to collect and manage industrial
           waste according to best practices as applicable (specific procedures to be
           defined).


           Hazardous materials and potentially hazardous waste from the power plant
           (such as transformer oil, batteries, cables, insulation, chemicals and chemical

           Kosovo C power plants or connected facilities.



5.1.6.2    State Indicators

           Municipal Waste Generation and Disposal

           Household waste generation will not be impacted by the project. No new
           landfills are foreseen in the area of interest.


           There are no recycling facilities in Kosovo except for some minor initiatives.
           Waste have historically been abandoned/dumped on site; such procedure
           will no longer be adopted for the future plants and mining facilities
           (particular attention will be devoted to recycling, reuse and disposal).


           As compensation measure to the project, investment in the collection and
           recycling infrastructure, as well as in public participation and awareness
           raising, could be proposed.



5.1.7      Natural Environment


5.1.7.1    Pressure Indicators

           Landscape - Visual Impact

           The area in which the development is planned has no special value in terms of
           natural environment.
           Future plans for the area of existing mines, ash dumps and overburden
           dumps include reclamation and revegetation, which will improve the visual
           impact of the area of interest.


           On the other hand, new power plant units will be built (with a visual impact
           for neighbouring villages) and a new mining field will be opened. That said, it
           is planned that the new mine will be reclaimed in a phased process.



5.1.7.2    State Indicators

           Natural and Protected Areas

           The project will not interfere with any natural or protected area.


           Flora and Fauna

           Based on a survey carried out in 2007 in the area of interest, most of the
           investigated locations appear under anthropogenic influence, i.e. influenced
           by man. Most parts of (semi)natural meadows and forest vegetation are found
           among the agriculture associations.

The Kosovo A site was not investigated as it is entirely an industrial area
without any natural value.


Considering the potential site locations, the project will not interfere with
endangered species.


Land Use

Figure 3.3.6.2c and Table 3.3.6.2b shows actual land use in the study area. The
prevalent land use is agriculture, followed by forest and then residential and
industrial areas.


As already presented in Table 4.3.4a, after the project, the situation will
improve: areas at present industrial (including power plants, mines, ash
dumps, overburden dumps) will be reclaimed and revegetated, therefore the
percentage of natural areas in the area of interest will significantly grow (see
also Paragraph 5.1.3.1).

     5.2        SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS


     5.2.1      Introduction and Methodology

                This section of the SESA report will describe the potential impacts on the
                residents of the power plants and mine development area.
                Information from the household baseline survey and the various community
                consultations has informed the impact analysis. The impact analysis will also
                identify data gaps and where additional assessments or studies need to be
                conducted in order to ascertain the significance of certain impacts as well as
                the distribution of those impacts.
                In some cases the exact site location is unlikely to have major significance for
                individual indicators or issues. This will be clearly identified in the report.


                Table 5.2.1a summarizes the key impacts and areas of concern identified
                during the SESA process via the community survey, consultation meetings
                and the meetings of the Community Development Forums. In addition to the
                issues presented in the table, concerns were also raised about the performance
                of the current management team of KEK in terms of the relationship between
                the mine and surrounding communities. There are expectations that this
                relationship will improve in the future.

5.2.2    Demographics


         Current information highlights only resettlement as a direct impact on those
         communities to be moved (see Paragraph 5.2.5 for further information). Project
         construction and operation could also have impacts on the structure and
         profile of the area. Figures are not currently available for the number of
         construction and operational workforce, where this workforce will be sourced
         from and whether worker housing is required. The introduction of a large
         workforce will impact local communities in both the long and short term.
         Further information is needed to adequately assess the level of impact the
         project will have on demographics. Furthermore there are currently non-
         project related impacts on the demographics such as high out migration,
         especially from the young which is predicted to continue.



5.2.3    Economic Environment

         The impacts of land acquisition involve much more than the loss of housing.
         In the first place, given that the affected areas are largely rural, it could result
         in a significant loss of livelihoods. The results of the consultations suggest that
         there are high levels of unemployment and under-employment in the area;
         this means that people depend on their farmland for a significant part of their
         subsistence and cash income. This makes resettlement particularly difficult,
         since international standards rightly require affected families to be
         compensated for the loss of their livelihoods and/or subsistence. In addition
         the land take for the mines and power plant may affect some small businesses
         and result in people losing employment.

                                                  312

5.2.4    Employment

         There are very high expectations related to employment issues among the
         affected communities. This is seen as an important aspect of the project and
         underpins the positive views of the project in many of the communities. It
         will be important that current channels of communication are maintained and
         that information on significant topics, such as the likely levels of employment
         for local people, is communicated clearly and in sufficient time. The
         Community Development Forum could fulfill a valuable role in this process.


         Regarding employment, the number of people employed in mining activities
         will decrease (due to modernization of technology), but at least until 2017 this
         will be more than compensated by the increase in people employed in the
         new power plants and in induced activities. Currently the Mirash and Bardh
         mines employ some 3,420 persons. This level of employment is high by world
         standards; if a private sector company manages the future mines, the
         employment level will likely be significantly lower. The predictions for the
         level of employment, assuming a phased development, are as follows:


         ·      Production rising to 21Mt/year:     2,700 (by 2025);
         ·      Production at 9 Mt/year:            1,420 (by 2015).


         These estimates are still higher than what would be expected from an
         internationally competitive mine; the decrease in jobs in the medium to long
         term thus may be greater than anticipated. It is likely that these fewer jobs
         would be better paid given improved productivity. Furthermore, Kosovo C
         will require both directly and indirectly employed personnel, therefore the
         total number of employees is likely to be the same (induced activities will
         bring new employment opportunities and compensate the loss).


         On a strategic level there needs to be more collaboration between the
         education and labor ministries so that young people are better prepared for
         the current and future labor market in terms of training and technical
         education. There is a good network of vocational training centers, managed
         by the Ministry of Labor in Obiliq, which is not fully utilised. The Ministry of
         Labor has stated that it would welcome more involvement in the analysis of
         skills in the area and provide relevant training programs where there is a
         skills deficit.


5.2.5    Land Use and Resettlement

         The legacy of the resettlement in 2003-2004 in the area has left both those
         remaining and those resettled extremely angry about the process. Residents
         are concerned that the Hade experience will be repeated. In the immediate
         future, resettlement is an issue that affects the village of Hade. However,
         discussions with communities and relevant ministries revealed that the social
         impact of future planned resettlement is already being felt by several
         communities. For example, in villages such as Lajthishte, which are not

                                                 313

         scheduled to be moved until 2035, or in others not scheduled until 2038,
         people are concerned about their property prices and many young people
         have already left the communities to live abroad or in other parts of Kosovo,
         as they see no economic future in the area.


         The process and timing of resettlement should be clearly communicated and
         the information on this topic should be regularly updated. Uncertainty over
         the extent and timing of any resettlement is likely to exacerbate real or
         perceived economic disadvantage. The potential role of the Community
         Development Forums in this process should be carefully evaluated. They have
         the potential to provide a valuable engagement tool on this issue.


5.2.6    Infrastructure

         Roads

         As discussed in the baseline section of this report current road conditions
         around the Project site are poor (Paragraph 3.4.13.1). Communities
         complained of large vehicles travelling on local roads increasing levels of dust
         and noise and causing road safety issues (Paragraph 3.4.17). If the road
         network is not upgraded and regularly maintained road safety will become a
         major impact to local communities. It is understood that some improvements
         are planned, however, this may not be adequate to limit the impact of
         increased road usage on local communities.


         Water Supply

         Current local water supply is inconsistent with some communities connected
         to the mains and others reliant on other sources. Local waterways and
         groundwater are contaminated and not safe for drinking. It is understood
         that the project will invest in waste water treatment and address local water
         pollution with the aim of meeting international standards. This will be a
         significant improvement and therefore have a positive impact on local
         communities.


         The Project will require substantial amounts of water for operations, which it
         plans on sourcing from the local water system through pipelines.


         Sewage

         As discussed in previous sections the Project is required to build a waste
         water treatment plant. It is anticipated that some communities will be able to
         utilize this for household waste water. At present villages and other small
         settlements dispose of wastewater in open channels contaminating surface
         and groundwater. The introduction of a waste water treatment plant in the
         area will improve the environmental conditions of local water ways, therefore
         this is viewed as being a positive impact for local communities.

         Solid and Liquid Waste Management

         Waste management is addressed in Sections 3.3.5 and 5.1.6. Waste
         management will be addressed through improvements to ash management
         and overburden. The current method of disposal of ash at Kosovo A will be
         stopped and a safe waste storage facility will be developed at the Mirash
         Open Pit Mine. Improvements to waste management will have a positive
         impact on local communities who cited air pollution from waste ash as an
         issue [see Table 3.4.16a]. All transportation of waste materials outside and
         between sites will need to be addressed to ensure waste is properly secured,
         safely transported and traffic movements are limited. Measures to address
         these issues are also cited within this report.



5.2.7    Health

         Health concerns have been raised during consultation with local communities
         and participants believe that current operations have resulted in direct health
         problems (Paragraph 3.4.14). Respiratory disease was sited as the most
         prevalent health condition in surveyed communities. It is understood that
         current levels of air, noise and water pollution in the local area are significant
         and it is likely that this has had an impact on the health of local communities.
         The Project aims to improve current levels of pollution in the long term, but
         there may be some increased pollution in the short term, depending on the
         chosen development model. Associated impacts to the health of local
         communities should be monitored, which will require a detailed health
         baseline showing current conditions.


         Data collected during this assessment only contains limited data on health
         and a detailed health assessment has not been conducted. Determining the
         level of health impact will require further data gathering and monitoring of
         health conditions, along with noise, air and water quality. The extent and
         level of impact can not be determined at this stage, however health is believed
         to be a major impact by surveyed communities.



5.2.8    Social Networks

         Another significant impact of land acquisition and the other changes brought
         by the project is the disruption of social networks if people have to move
         away from their relatives, friends and neighbours or a large influx of contract
         workers moves to the area. There will be a loss of cultural heritage and local
         memories. The project affected communities have already been adversely
         impacted by the vagaries of war and the challenges of living near the mine
         and power plants. Apart from the environmental effects this has had an
         impact on the social structure and fabric of the communities. Anecdotal
         evidence from some local authorities suggests that the incidence of depression
         has increased in the area which in turn has an impact on families and
         communities. However, some level of mitigation could be achieved through a
         sensitive social support programme that would take local people's concerns

         and expectations into account. This would include measures to remove and
         restore local historical and cultural sites, such as mosques, cemeteries,
         churches and war memorials. It could also include assistance to help the most
         vulnerable people, especially the elderly, readjust to their new homes and
         new locations, for instance, facilitating contact with social and health services
         at their new site.



5.2.9    Community Aspirations, Attitudes and Concerns

         Consultation with affected communities found that support for the project is
         mixed. Half the populations of Grabovc i Poshtem, Hade and Lajthishte
         strongly support the project and believe it will bring positive economic
         impacts. Eighty-three percent of all participants believe the project will create
         employment opportunities.


         Participants in the focus groups also indicated that their expectations are that
         job opportunities will increase. However, they are skeptical how the
         recruitment procedure will be organized, as they mentioned many cases
         where workers in the power plant are being recruited without any criteria.
         They see as a project pre-condition that employment will be provided to those
         who deserve it the most; they hope therefore that the foreign investor will
         apply appropriate recruitment procedures. In this regard, all agree that they
         (in each group, all participants presented their own village as being the most
         negatively affected by mine activities) should be given priority in
         employment opportunities, as they are the ones who suffer the most from air
         pollution, or were previously excluded from employment opportunities, or
         again, municipal authorities failed to provide adequate conditions for living
         (poor infrastructure).


         Although the project has support due to the expectation that it will have a
         positive impact on the local economy and employment opportunities, many
         residents feel there will be negative impacts. In terms of the effects of Kosovo
         C on the environment, the majority of respondents to the household survey
         expected it to be negative (58.3%), primarily because of the pollution which
         they fear will destroy the environment, while another 20.8% expected it to be
         positive. Only 5.8% of the respondents expect the building of Kosovo C not to
         have any impact on the environment. Rural respondents are more likely to
         expect the building of Kosovo C to have very positive impacts on the
         environment, while urban respondents are more likely to expect it to have
         somewhat positive or somewhat negative effects. There were no differences
         by other socio-demographic variables.


         In terms of the impact of Kosovo C on the natural environment in their
         settlements, Hade had the greatest number of respondents (24%) who
         expected it to be very positive, while Hamidi had the greatest number of
         respondents who expected it to be very negative (77%).




         ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                 316

          Focus group discussions support the data obtained from the household
          survey, where most respondents claim that they are skeptical about the
          environmental impact the new power plant will have. Since all participants
          complained about current conditions pertaining to the environmental issues
          in their settlements, the construction of a new power plant is expected to have
          further impact on the environment. Since it is a coal-based power plant, the
          belief of these participants is that it is not possible for the power plant to be
          environmentally friendly.


          At household level the survey indicates that most respondents expect the
          building of Kosovo C to have positive effects (32% somewhat and 36% very
          positive), a little over a tenth (12%) expect it to have negative effects and 9%
          expect it not to have any economic effects on their household. Urban
          respondents are more likely not to expect building of Kosovo C to have any
          economic effects on their households, while rural participants are more likely
          to expect negative effects from it. The main reasons why respondents expect
          positive economic effects of the project include increased employment
          opportunities and increased quantities of electric power for export.


          At present, from the surveys carried out and other stakeholder engagement
          activities, the project is expected to have both positive (employment and
          economic) and negative (pollution) impacts on surrounding communities.
          Resettlement is also an area of potential concern.


          Most residents of the area of interest have a generally positive opinion about
          the plan/activities for the mine and voice their support for it (37% strongly
          and 35% generally support the plan). Rural respondents were more likely to
          support (41% strongly and 35% generally support) and urban respondents
          were more likely to oppose (13% strongly and 16% generally oppose) the plan.


          Grabovc i Poshtem (53%), Hade (48%) and Lajthishte (46%) had the greatest
          number of strong supporters of these activities, while Dardhishte had the
          greatest number of respondents who strongly oppose them (23%).


5.2.10    Consultation

          Past consultation in the area has been poor or non-existent. The majority of
          people support the building of Kosovo C and further mine development, but
          also want to play a meaningful part in the decision-making process of the
          project. The project provides a good opportunity to establish a comprehensive
          and representative consultation mechanism. If the project's current approach
          to informed consultation continues (through community development forums
          and communication with key stakeholders, including Obiliq municipality)
          during mine development, this is likely to be beneficial to the overall
          sustainability of the project and the communities of the area of interest.

5.3      IMPACTS RELATED TO SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT VARIABLES COMMON TO ALL
         SCENARIOS

         As detailed in Section 4, the following aspects may influence choices relevant
         to the implementation of the new TPP:


             ·    Timing of power plants and associated New Mining Field
                  development;

             ·    Location of the power plants; and

             ·    Size of the units and plant technology.


         The impacts connected to all the above aspects have already been partly
         discussed in Section 4 (see Paragraph 4.3.2) and will be further examined in the
         following. In particular, the impacts connected with site location will be
         analyzed in more detail in Paragraph 5.4.



5.3.1    New Lignite Mine Development and Timing of Power Plants


         The development of the mine is linked to the TPP development strategy and
         coal demand in the existing plants; the additional impact identified,
         independent of the chosen alternative, is related to the required acquisition of
         86% of Obiliq territory, an area of mostly fertile land, for the development of
         the New Mining Field.
         During community consultation the lack of fertile land was raised as an issue
         (see Paragraph 3.4.10), however, most residents reported that they were not
         planning on extending current land ownership by purchasing additional land
         (Prism Research 08). This in addition to the planned resettlement should
         therefore limit the impact of this additional land acquisition.


         Rapid development is associated with the following potential advantages:


             ·    significantly improving the currently unfavorable trade balance
                  through electricity export to neighboring countries (see Section 4);

             ·    cost savings by building the whole plant without having to dismantle
                  the construction organization and completing construction in a shorter
                  time. This would also reduce environmental impacts related to
                  construction activities; and

             ·    faster employment increase.


         On the other hand, the rapid strategy has the following potential
         disadvantages:


             ·    accelerated need to organize resettlement (see Section 4) and hence

             ·    accelerated need for financial and economic resources; and

             ·    accelerated need to identify appropriate solution to issues of access to
                  water resources.

                                                 318

Phased development has the following potential advantages:


    ·    extended timeframe for funding requirements, with a consequent
         increase in number of potential private investors;

    ·    reduction of financial risks, due to ability to adjust timing of
         installation in response to evolution in electricity market; and

    ·    possibility to install the second 1,000 MW phase on the site of Kosovo
         A (which will be out of operation after 2017).


On the other hand, phased development has the following potential
disadvantages:


    ·    need to dismantle construction organization between the two 1,000
         MW phases; hence

    ·    major construction phase impact (longer total construction phase).


Rapid development would reduce the time communities are disrupted by
construction impacts (traffic, noise etc) and limit the time between closure of
Kosovo A and opening of Kosovo C. This would contribute to limiting further
environmental pollution impacts from the plants on local settlements.


However, the need for rapid resettlement resulting from this option would
exacerbate the current impacts discussed in Paragraph 3.4.11 of the baseline
Chapter and Paragraph 5.2.5 of this Chapter. Resettlement has been identified
as a major impact and communities have been impacted by previous
resettlement. Without adequate planning and consultation further
resettlement could lead to an increased impact significance.


The phased development option would increase the disruption to local
communities caused by construction and lessen employment levels over the
near term.


On the other hand, this approach would allow for appropriate levels of
forward planning for resettlement of affected communities, including
adequate consultation and allocation of alternative accommodation. A
carefully planned schedule may assist in lowering the impact significance of
resettlement on affected communities.


The advantages and disadvantages connected to different development of the
mine are strictly connected to the chosen TPP development strategy; the only
additional impact identified is related to the required acquisition of 86% of the
Obiliq territory, an area of mostly fertile land, for the development of the New
Mining Field.


During community consultation the lack of fertile land was raised as an issue
(see Paragraph 3.4.10), however, most residents reported that they were not
planning on extending the current land ownership by purchasing additional
land (Prism Research 08). This in addition to the planned resettlement should
therefore limit the impact of this additional land acquisition.

5.3.2    Size of the Units and Plant Technology

         Please refer to Section 4 for a detailed comparison of different plant
         technologies (pulverized fired ­ PF or circulating fluidized bed - CFB) in
         terms of efficiency and applicable unit size.


         In summary the advantages associated with different unit sizes are the
         following:


             ·    300 MW: higher operating flexibility; possibility to use CPB technology
                  and as a consequence avoid large wet desulphurization units (DeSOx);
                  no need for limestone; impacts from lengthy construction phase (for
                  larger space requirements) avoided;

             ·    500 MW: more efficient technologies applicable; lower greenhouse
                  gases emissions; supercritical steam production applicable; all units
                  required (to reach 2,000 MW) would fit in a smaller site.


         The disadvantages associated with different unit sizes are the following:


             ·    300 MW: lower efficiency and as a consequence higher greenhouse
                  gases emissions; more units required (to reach 2,000 MW), larger land
                  take required;

             ·    500 MW: lower operating flexibility; need for DeSOx equipment and,
                  as a consequence, major raw material need (limestone) and major
                  waste production (gypsum).


         As already pointed out in Paragraph 5.1.4, water resources availability could
         be a problem for the foreseen development. There are two options for the
         cooling system: wet and dry cooling towers.


         Dry cooling towers, i.e. a cooling system utilizing air instead of water, could
         drastically reduce water consumption and avoid the need for a pond at the
         Kosovo C power station.
         Dry cooling towers are very expensive, however, and significantly increase
         unit energy consumption and decrease net efficiency. In addition, they occupy
         larger areas for lower net cooling: condenser pressure is higher and overall
         efficiency of the power plant is decreased, with higher greenhouse gas
         emissions.


         An hybrid solution could be the most viable solution.

5.4      COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS (SITE LOCATION)


5.4.1    Preamble

         In the present Section, the most important environmental and socio-economic
         parameters/indicators impacted directly by site selection are presented, in
         order to compare the three different scenarios identified with the present
         situation and suggest the "most preferred" option (in terms of site location).


         In particular, the following paragraphs present:


             ·    the identification and analysis of environmental and socio-economic
                  parameters/indicators directly/indirectly connected and relevant to
                  site selection (Paragraph 5.4.2);

             ·    the proposed methodology for indicators/parameters significance
                  evaluation (Paragraph 5.4.3);

             ·    the comparison of alternative sites (Paragraph 5.4.4).



5.4.2    Parameters/Indicators Directly/Indirectly Connected and Relevant for Site
         Selection

         Not all the above described/evaluated indicators (see Paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2)
         have different direct/indirect influence concerning site selection and
         requirements for power plants development.
         This section refers only to the variables that have an influence on site
         selection; the parameters analyzed elsewhere are considered not linked to the
         selection of the site and are therefore not considered here.


         The most important environmental and socio-economic parameters/
         indicators impacted directly by site selection (and therefore relevant for the
         comparison of the three different scenarios identified in terms of site location)
         are:


             ·    Climate and Air quality: population downwind of the future power
                  plants;

             ·    Geology: type of soil;

             ·    Seismicity;

             ·    Morphology: hilly or flat site;

             ·    Quality of groundwater and soil (a contaminated soil is preferred
                  provided that soil is reclaimed before power plant construction);

             ·    Land use: occupation of greenfield or brownfield (brownfield is
                  preferred);

             ·    Surface water reserves: distance from areas at risk of flooding;

             ·    Noise: number of houses less than 1,000 m from the boundary of the
                  power plants (and within 200 m from the belt conveyors);

             ·    Landscape - visual impact: distance from nearest village;

         Moreover, the social analysis of the potential impacts on affected communities
         does not lend itself to strict parameters and indicators of significance using a
         quantative approach. The majority of the information we have gained from
         communities is largely subjective and these impacts cannot be directly linked
         or `de-linked' with the project without further specific assessment. There are
         two main issues that are having and will continue to have an impact on local
         communities and these are land acquisition and resettlement and air and
         noise pollution, which are discussed in detail in other parts of the report.
         Moreover, such parameters, as well as employment, depend mainly on
         mining development rather than on power plants location.


         Nevertehless, the following socio-economic parameters/indicators will be
         considered in the evaluation:


             ·    Land acquisition and resettlement of communities;

             ·    Health and related impacts such as air, water and noise pollution
                  (indirect indicator, already included in the above environmental
                  parameters);

             ·    Employment and labour rationalisation (indirect indicator, since the
                  type of skills needed to work in the mine development are dependent
                  on prevailing training and education capacity of the local communities
                  and local and national government).



5.4.3    Proposed Methodology for Indicators Significance Evaluation

         Since the parameters/indicators presented in the previous paragraph have
         been identified mainly to describe and compare the different development
         scenarios, the potential impact connected to site selection will be evaluated
         assigning to each parameter/indicator a different weight in terms of
         significance of the impact, taking into account:


              ·     the area of impact: impacting large or small area and many or few
                    people/households;

              ·     the impacted resources: protected/rare resources or renewable.


         Based on the above, the significance of each parameter/indicator will be
         evaluated according to the matrix presented in Table 5.4.3a.

     Table 5.4.4b compares the likely levels of impact across the three development
     scenarios. In particular, for each parameter/indicator, the three alternative
     sites are given different values:


         ·    1 meaning the best solution (lowest impact);

         ·    2 meaning the mean solution (mean impact);

         ·    3 meaning the worst solution (highest impact).


     In case the impact is the same in all sites, all will have a value equal to 2; in
     case two sites are equal and one is better (or worse), two sites will have 3 and
     the other will have 1 (or two sites will have 1 and the other 3).


     The result presented for each parameter/indicator and in each site is obtained
     multiplying the global weight of the indicator (as defined in Table 5.4.3b) for
     the corresponding value for the site.
     The global result is the sum of the results of each single indicator.

5.4.4.1    Explanation of Score Assigned to Each Parameter/Indicator

           Climate and Air Quality: Population Downwind of the Future Power Plants

           The emissions from the new plants will be the same for the three sites (they
           depend only on technology and size of the plants), therefore no differences
           are foreseen due to site selection, even considering that the possible
           overlapping of operation of Kosovo A and Kosovo C will produce an increase
           of the present level of air emissions.


           The emissions from the new plants will be the same for the three sites (they
           depend only on technology and size of the plants), therefore no differences
           are foreseen due to site selection (the impact extension is an area of about 15
           km radius).


           Given the height of the stack, the dilution of flue gas with air of cooling
           towers, the large quantity and temperature of the flue gas, it is expected that
           the largest immission values will occur at about 10 km from the emission
           point and that ground concentration will be low as compared with EU
           standard (see Poyry study). Therefore, the location of the power plant will
           have a scarce influence of this issue.


           Although the future power plant and lignite supply system will be properly
           designed, it is likely that some dust emission will occur. This emission is
           likely to impact local population and climate conditions (mainly wind
           direction, which is predominantly blowing from north and northeast) may
           have an effect on air quality. Therefore the three potential locations present
           differences in terms of the approximate number of houses downwind
           (considering the prevailing wind direction and a buffer zone of 1 km):


               ·    31 for the site close to TPP A (see Figure 5.4.4.1a);

               ·    0 for the site close to TPP B (see Figure 5.4.4.1b);

               ·    140 for the site close to Bivolac (see Figure 5.4.4.1c).


           Geology: Type of Soil

           In terms of terrain foundation, the three alternative sites are quite similar:
           while sites close to Kosovo A and Kosovo B are alluvium, the one close to
           Bivolac is lignite and alluvium.


           Seismicity

           According to the information provided by the Seismologic Institute of
           Ministry of Energy and Mines1, the three proposed locations are characterized
           by the same seismic conditions.

Additional geophysics study for micro seismic conditions will be required
during project development.


Morphology: Hilly or Flat Site

In terms of morphology, the three alternative sites are quite different: while
the sites close to Kosovo A and Kosovo B are flat (and do not need any
modeling), the one close to Bivolac is undulating hill.
Moreover, from a landscape point of view Kosovo A and B are preferable also
considering they are already impacted and no significant change in visual is
foreseen.


Quality of Groundwater and Soil

In terms of potential soil pollution, the situation is the following:

    ·    Site close to Kosovo B: presence of a huge ash dump, to be removed;

    ·    Site close to Kosovo A: old structures to be dismantled; big question
         mark on environmental liabilities (extensive phenol contamination);

    ·    Site close to Bivolac: the green area is probably clean.


The score has been considered assuming that the best location is the one in the
most polluted area, because such selection implies the necessity for clean up
and remediation activities before the construction of the new plants.


Land Use: Occupation of Greenfield or Brownfield

In terms of land use, the three alternative sites are quite different: while the
sites close to Kosovo A and Kosovo B are dedicated (industrial), the one close
to Bivolac is agricultural.


Surface Water Reserves: Distance from Areas at Risk of Flooding

Considering the flooding risk:


    ·    The site close to Kosovo B is inside the flooding risk from Sitnica river
         (see Figure 5.4.4.1b);

    ·    The site close to Kosovo A is outside the flooding risk from Sitnica
         river (see Figure 5.4.4.1a);

    ·    A small part of the layout in the site close to Bivolac is inside the
         flooding risk from Sitnica river (see Figure 5.4.4.1c).


Figure 5a presents the overall flooding area.


Noise: Number of Houses less than 1,000 m from the Boundary of the Power Plants
(and within 200 m from Belt Conveyors)

The three potential locations present differences in terms of number of houses
within 1,000 m (buffer zone) from the power plants:

    ·    906 for the site close to TPP A (see Figure 5.4.4.1a);

    ·    330 for the site close to TPP B (see Figure 5.4.4.1b);

    ·    338 for the site close to Bivolac (see Figure 5.4.4.1c).


Landscape - Visual Impact: Distance from Nearest Village

In terms of distances between the center of the power plant and the center of
the nearest villages, the situation (see Figure 5a) is the following:


    ·    the site close to TPP A is about 1,700 m from the center of Obiliq;

    ·    the site close to TPP B is about 1,400 m from the center of Obiliq and
         about 1,700 m from the center of Plementina;

    ·    the site close to Bivolac is about 700 m from the center of Bivolac.


Natural and Protected Areas: Vicinity of Protected Areas

No natural or protected area is present in the area of interest.


Flora and Fauna: Number/Quality of Impacted Species

No particular species will be impacted by the project. Nevertheless Bivolac
site is a green field and therefore some trouble to the existing vegetation and
fauna is foreseen.


Natural Resources: Distance from Lignite Mine

In terms of vicinity of lignite fuel (see Figure 5a), the three alternative sites are
quite different:


    ·    The site close to Kosovo B is 4 km from Sibovc SW;

    ·    The site close to Kosovo A is 5 km from Sibovc SW;

    ·    The site close to Bivolac is 5 km from Sibovc SW.


Electric Line: Vicinity of 400 kV Switchyard

In terms of vicinity of the 400 kV switchyard (see Figure 5a), the three
alternative sites are quite different:


    ·    the 400 kV switchyard is located less than a kilometre to NE from
         Kosovo B site;

    ·    the 400 kV switchyard is located some 2 kilometres from Kosovo A
         site;

    ·    Bivolac is 3 km from the switchyard.

Land Ownership: Proportion of KEK and Privately Owned Land

In terms of land ownership (see Figure 5a), the three alternative sites are quite
different: while the sites close to Kosovo A and Kosovo B are KEK owned, the
one close to Bivolac is private.


Belt Conveyors: Existing or New Required

In terms of existence of belt conveyors (see Figure 5a), the three alternative
sites are quite different: while for the sites close to Kosovo A and Kosovo B a
double conveyor belt from Bardh/Mirash mines is already in place, for the
site close to Bivolac a new belt would be required.


Connections (Railways, Roads, Water Canal): Existing or New Required

In terms of connections (see Figure 5a), the three alternative sites are quite
different: while the sites close to Kosovo A and Kosovo B have existing good
rail and road connection, for the site close to Bivolac a new 5-6 km access road
with bridge would be required.
Moreover, in terms of water supply, the three alternative sites are quite
different (see Figure 5a):


    ·    The site close to Kosovo B is 1 km from the Ibër-Lepenc canal and an
         existing connection to the canal is already available;

    ·    The site close to Kosovo A is next to Ibër-Lepenc canal;

    ·    For the site close to Bivolac the Ibër-Lepenc canal should be extended
         about 3 km.


Land Acquisition and Resettlement of Communities

Local villages will need to be resettled elsewhere. As mentioned earlier, local
communities are quite willing to be resettled because of current conditions
but would prefer to be moved in one phase or at least in a short amount of
time. Moreover, since people are already moving out of the Mine
development area to look for jobs and a better environment, the significance
of impact of the three different site location is probably very small. Findings
from the consultations and the households survey would suggest that little
difference are noted for the different sites expect for the Kosovo B site option.
As the village of Plemetin is very close to the proposed site there would be an
impact on this village characterized by increased noise and increased
pollution during construction.


The affected area is rural with a few fairly large, nucleated or semi-nucleated
villages. The total population of the affected area is estimated at around 1500
families. The largest villages are Hade, Shiptulle, Lajthishte, Sibovc and
Plemetin.
The affected areas can be divided into three separate categories:


       ·     the areas that will be directly required for the mining and power
             complex, including the areas needed for any ancillary facilities. If

5.4.4.2    Discussion

           According to what presented in the above Table 5.4.4a, the "preferred option"
           (in terms of site location) would be to build the new power plants close to the
           existing Kosovo A plant, although the score for the alternative site near
           Kosovo B is very close. The site at Bivolak should be excluded since it has a
           very high score.


           In terms of limiting factors:

               ·    Kosovo A contains old structures to be dismantled and has several
                    uncertainties regarding environmental liabilities (extensive phenol
                    contamination) due to past operations;

               ·    Kosovo B has a huge ash dump to be removed from the potential
                    location and the site is inside the area of flooding risk from Sitnica
                    River.


           The utilisation of the old gasification and fertiliser plant areas for the
           development of Kosovo C power plants would allow the safe dismantling of
           old contaminated equipment and cleaning up the soil and the area during the
           construction of the power plants. Personnel from the Kosovo C power plant
           would perform monitoring of possible soil contamination and control
           potential remediation activities.


           Should phased development be chosen, the last units for Kosovo C could be
           constructed on the site of Kosovo A after proper decommissioning of existing
           facilities and soil reclamation. This would allow a reduction in overall land
           occupation as reclaimed land from the old gasification and fertilizer plant
           area could be used to install the last units of Kosovo C. At least a portion of
           the noisy equipment would be further away from Plemetin. On the other
           hand, this solution would increase the impacts on inhabitants of Obiliq.

6        MITIGATION MEASURES AND MONITORING PLAN




         The present section describes the proposed Strategic Environemntal and
         Social Management Plan (SESMP) and includes:


         ·   recommended mitigation measures based on recognised environmental
             impacts connected to the present situation;

         ·   proposed socio-economic mitigation measures;

         ·   recommendations with regard to the legislative and institutional
             framework;

         ·   proposed environmental monitoring plan.



6.1      MITIGATION MEASURES

         Proposed mitigation measures have been identified based on the analysis
         undertaken in the framework of the Environmental Assessment and fully
         validated based on the findings of the Environmental and Social Baseline,
         which is fully detailed under Section 3.



6.1.1    Environmental Mitigation Measures

         Identified environmental findings and non compliances with international
         (EU and World Bank) regulations and Former Yugoslavia regulations, when
         applicable, together with related proposed environmental mitigation
         measures are fully described in Table 6.1.1a, including:


         ·   ID ­ a progressive code;

         ·   Description of the issue ­ a concise description is given in the table,
             together with reference to the section of the study where full details are
             available;

         ·   Mitigation Measure ­ description of proposed mitigation measures to be
             addressed;

         ·   Timing ­ a rough timeline to undertake the mitigation measure is reported
             based on ERM experience and available technical data;

         ·   Estimated Cost - when estimated cost is below 25,000 Euro an indication
             of Minor costs is reported.


         The mitigation measures have been grouped by environmental issue (e.g. air
         emissions, wastewater effluents, etc.); in addition, under the section on
         human health, there are several urgent safety measures that are recommended
         to be implemented as soon as possible.


         With regard to timing, no detailed implementation schedule can be provided
         at this stage with regard to mitigation measures due to many uncertain issues
         to be defined in the course of the Project "Private sector participation in the

                       the Sibovc lignite field".


                       As far as the cost estimate is concerned, it should be highlighted that, in view
                       of the nature of this study, it has not been feasible to secure even budgetary
                       costings from major technology vendors. The Consultant has thus undertaken
                       the cost estimation almost wholly based on in-house data and experience
                       from similar plants and projects. Therefore, the presented costings have to be
                       considered as indicative estimates for budget allocation. To provide a more
                       detailed estimate, a more in-depth analysis of full applicability of proposed
                       design solutions and a validation of collected data (e.g. through direct
                       monitoring) should be undertaken.


                       Finally, it should be noted that the mitigation measures reported in this
                       section are related to the existing facilities and to historical and current
                       activities undertaken at the sites. Mitigation measures related to Project
                       development are included in the NMFDP.

                   Negative Side Effects Deriving from the Proposed Environmental Mitigation
                   Measures

                   The proposed environmental mitigation measures will obviously have a
                   number of positive environmental impacts in terms of reduction of the
                   pollution load and contamination status of the area.


                   However, in principle, it can not be excluded that implementation of the
                   mitigation measures may be accomplished by negative environmental side
                   effects deriving from the implementation of the mitigation measures.


                   The identification of negative side effects is at this stage not feasible since very
                   little detail is available with regard to technical details (e.g. number and
                   location of treatment facilities, necessary auxiliaries, generated wastes, etc.).
                   However, based on ERM experience, it can be anticipated that, since no high
                   impact treatment facilities are proposed (e.g. incinerators, abatement plants,
                   etc.), these negative side effects are not expected to be significant.

6.1.2    Socio-Economic Mitigations

         This section will describe both the project and strategic mitigation measures
         that will need to be adopted to reduce the negative impacts and to enhance
         the positive impacts of those described in the impacts section.


         Demographics

         There is currently insufficient information to determine the possible impacts
         on the entire demographics apart from the resettlement process. When the
         proposal for project development will be available, information on numbers
         of contract workers from outside the area will be known.


         Any influx of foreign contract workers will need to be managed carefully. A
         better option would be to ensure a high rate of local employment. This would
         provide stability to the demographics as well as have a positive impact on the
         economics of the area and could possibly contribute to stemming the flow of
         young people leaving the area and the country.


         According to the village consultations people are also leaving or want to leave
         the area because of the poor environmental conditions including air and noise
         pollution. The mine development needs to adequately address the existing
         pollution issues. Mitigating the current pollution would also have an indirect
         positive impact on the demographics of the area.


         Economic Environment and Employment

         As described in the baseline the economic and employment status of the mine
         development area is very low. Any opportunity for direct and indirect
         employment in the future mine development will have a positive effect on the
         economic situation of the area. Direct employment in the project such as
         technical, engineering and management roles would be the most directly
         advantageous. Preferential employment practices should be used by the
         developer, where possible. Contracting local people for jobs such as vehicle
         maintenance and catering services would also significantly improve the
         economic and employment profile of the affected communities. The increased
         income of local people would in turn benefit the local economy as whole as
         the multiplier effect would be instigated.


         On a wider strategic level there is quite a serious skills shortage in the area,
         according to some government officials (source: interviews with Kosovo
         Ministry of Labour officials). Specifically this means that there is currently a
         discrepancy between the education that young people receive and the skills
         that are needed for Kosovo's economy. The Ministry of Labour has a national
         network of local vocational training centres, including one in Obiliq, where
         young and unemployed people are trained in relevant skills. In order to
         optimize this resource the mine developer should liaise closely with these
         centres and draft a strategy that would identify skills shortages in the area
         and provide the relevant training.

This strategy would address skills shortages to meet both needs of the project
and those of Kosovo as a whole.


The receipt of tax revenues from the project was raised by some residents at
village meetings (please see Table 3.4.16e). Transparent and equitable
distribution of tax revenues to the local area and royalties should be enhanced
in order to ensure that the local communities derive the maximum benefit
from the mine development.


Land Use and Resettlement

In addressing and mitigating the effects of resettlement there are several
issues that need to be part of any planning of future resettlement:


·   Legal Land Title: It is estimated that a significant number of residents in
    the rural areas do not have legal title for land and property in Hade and
    other communities. Under current Kosovo legislation these people would
    not be entitled to compensation. Whereas under international standards
    such as the World Bank's Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement
    (OP 4.12), people without legal title are still entitled to compensation and
    assistance with moving;

·   Compensation Issues from 2003-2004: There are still people who have not
    been compensated for the emergency evacuation in 2003;

·   Availability of agricultural land: There is not enough replacement of
    agricultural land to resettle people who rely on farming for their
    livelihoods. Therefore:
              o revision of current land expropriation law should include
                clauses on household data collection, census and inventory;
              o the drafting of a Resettlement Action Plan should be a legal
                requirement when carrying out resettlement;
              o consultation should be an integral part of the resettlement
                process;
              o a government body responsible for resettlement should be
                established that includes representatives from different
                ministries in order to harmonise different government policies
                and approaches; and
              o to mitigate impacts on social networks, some level of
                mitigation could be achieved through a sensitive social support
                program that would take local people's concerns and
                expectations into account. This should be closely integrated
                into any consultation strategy with the communities. It would
                include measures to remove and restore local historical and
                cultural sites, such as mosques, cemeteries, churches and war
                memorials. It should also include assistance to help the most
                vulnerable people, especially the elderly, readjust to their new
                homes and new locations, for instance, by facilitating contact
                with social and health services.

A separate Resettlement Policy Framework which conforms to international
standards has been drafted for the LPTAP project (see Annex D), please refer
to this for more detailed mitigation measures for resettlement.


Infrastructure


Roads

Due to the poor quality of local roads
The development plans should aim to upgrade roads leading to the project
site or that will be used as a result of minig and power plant activities.
Improving the local road system would benefit to the local community and
assist in reducing the impacts caused by large vehicles and additional traffic
traveling on local roads.


In addition, road safety measures should be adopted including driver training
for staff, road safety awareness training for local communities, appropriate
road markings and signage and strict rules on vehicle handling for all staff.



Water Supply

As discussed in the baseline and impacts sections, the local water supply
varies in quality and accessibility between settlements. The planned activities
will require substantial amounts of water for operations, which will be
sourced from the local water supply infrastructure (Iber-Lepenc system)
through pipelines. As noted above in the section on environmental impacts, a
number of steps will need to be taken to ensure adequate supply. Water
consumption in the Kosovo C power plant has to be reduced as far as
possible; the utilisation of a water reuse treatment plant or of an air cooling
system could help in dealing with critical water issues.


In addition, improvements to the local water supply infrastructure should be
implemented, which will be a major benefit to the local community.



Sewage

As discussed in previous sections the Project is required to build a waste
water treatment plant. It is anticipated that some communities will be able
utilizes this for household waste water. At present villages and other small
settlements dispose of wastewater in open channels contaminating surface
and groundwater. The introduction of a waste water treatment plant in the
area will improve the environmental conditions of local water ways, therefore
this is viewed as being a positive impact for local communities.


Solid and Liquid Waste Management

Waste management is addressed in Sections 3.3.5 and 5.1.6. Waste
management will be addressed through improvements to ash management
and overburden. The current method of disposal of ash at Kosovo A will be

                                         342

stopped and a safe waste storage facility will be developed at the Mirash
Open Pit Mine. Improvements to waste management will have a positive
impact on local communities who cited air pollution from waste ash as an
issue (see Table 3.4.16a). All transportation of waste materials outside and
between sites will need to be addressed to ensure waste is properly secured,
safely transported and traffic movements are limited. Measures to address
these issues are also cited within this report.


Health

Health is a major community concern and one that needs to be addressed in
more detail. It is recommended that further study is carried out to
understand the current health situation in the communities surrounding the
project site and identify if and how the project impacts upon this. The impact
significance of the project on community health will not be fully understood
until this is carried out.


Social Networks

The impacts on social networks will come from a number of sources.
Resettlement, influx of contract workers are project- related and should be
mitigated by the measures identified. However, other prevailing conditions
such as the status of the economy, recovery from the war and the impact of
Kosovo's new statehood continue to provide challenges for local communities
which need integrated and transparent government polices to mitigate the
negative impacts of the existing and future conditions.


Community Aspirations, Attitudes and Concerns

To mitigate against negative impacts (see Section 5), it is important that the
Project manage community expectation, enhance employment opportunities
and work with the local Government to aid training and alternative income
initiatives. Combating negative attitudes by rehabilitating the current
operation and lowering the level of pollution will also assist in minimising
negative impacts in terms of community attitude towards the Project.


The majority of respondents to the household survey believe that meetings
with municipal authority representatives would be the most effective way to
inform the population of the area of interest about planned activities to
upgrade the operation of the mine (31%); 22% of respondents opted for
meetings with representatives of the mine; 16% for public meetings and
gatherings; and 13% for television, while 12% said they did not know or
refused to answer when asked about the most effective way to disseminate
relevant information. Brochures, leaflets, daily newspapers and radio were
the least frequently mentioned information sources. Moving forward effective
communication and consultation is a key aspect of impact mitigation for the
project. Current initiatives need to be maintained and reinforced.

6.1.3    Identification of Institutional Training and Strengthening to Implement
         Mitigations

         Section 2 of this Report provides a description of the existing legislative
         framework related to environmental management at national, regional and
         local levels and a gap analysis with reference to relevant international
         standards and regulations.


         The Section includes also most relevant recommendations on the following
         main issues of concern for the implementation of the Environmental
         Mitigation Measures:


         ·   Air Emission and Air Quality;

         ·   Wastewater and Water Supply;

         ·   Waste Management;

         ·   Hazardous Substances Management and Handling;

         ·   Soil and Groundwater Quality.


         A complete overview of the existing Institutional Framework for the
         protection of the environment is reported in Activity II First Draft SESA
         Report prepared by the Consultant and submitted on the 26th of October 2007.


         The main considerations on capability of institutions at national and
         municipal levels, with regards to environmental management and monitoring
         are the following:


         ·   The main institution empowered for the management of the protection of
             the environment in Kosovo is The Ministry of Environment and Spatial
             Planning (MESP). The MESP is responsible both for the general policies of
             environmental protection and spatial planning and the implementation of
             related regulations through its departments.

         ·   Municipal structures communicate with central level through regional
             coordinators of the Ministry (5 main regional focal points). Only one
             Municipality has a special Directorate for the Environment while in the
             other 25 municipalities environmental matters are part of other
             directorates. Only one Municipality has specific municipal regulations on
             the environment; in 15 municipalities environmental matters are
             addressed in general regulations, while in 11 municipalities
             environmental matters are not addressed at all at local level.

         ·   In Obiliq Municipality no environmental assessments of plans are made at
             the present time. Reportedly, planning has been made for an
             environmental inspector, but at the moment, the economic resources of
             the Municipality do not allow for it. It may be concluded that the
             Municipality has no capacity for either environmental assessment or
             monitoring of environmental management plans.

         ·   KEPA is identified as the governmental body which should coordinate
             and carry out all environmental monitoring, and collect, analyze, store
             and elaborate all environmental monitoring data at central and local level.



         ERM ­ ELC - CSA                              THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                               344

    It should also be the focal point for Kosovo environmental data in the
    international scenario.

·   Our understanding is that at the present moment KEPA has very limited
    capacity and is working in cooperation with a number of institutions
    which were responsible for environmental monitoring and analysis in the
    past. These include the following: (i) Hydro Meteorological Institute of
    Kosovo; (ii) Institute for Public Health Kosovo; (iii) The various
    departments of the MESP; (iv) Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural
    Development; (v) Ministry for Transport and Communications; (vi)
    Statistical Office of Kosovo; (vii) Energy Corporation of Kosovo.

·   The Environmental Protection inspectorate has been established by
    Administrative Instruction No 2/2004 which sets out the duties and
    responsibilities of the Inspectorate which reportedly presently has 14
    inspectors. The Inspectorate is part of the MESP and covers the following
    sectors: (i) Environmental Protection; (ii) Water protection; (iii) Spatial
    Panning, and (iv) Urbanization. Reportedly, in the past five years
    inspections have focused on the sand and gravel extraction sectors and
    recently started facilities. In the current year, inspections have focused on
    drinking water uses, metal landfills and old cars.

·   The main conclusion is that all environmental management functions are
    located at national level under Ministerial responsibility and that
    reportedly, at the moment, very limited, if no, environmental planning,
    management and monitoring capacity exists at decentralised level in the
    country.


Institutions at the central and local level cope with a lack of financial and
human resources.


The move towards creating greater financial independence such as through
the set up of local environmental funds is a key step forward. Even though the
funds expected to be collected are not nearly enough in comparison to the
environmental infrastructure investment needed, they do provide a first step
in the right direction.


Much remains to be done in terms of training staff at the local level, set up
stable coordination and cooperation mechanisms between different
authorities and different levels of government, awareness raising on
environment (outside as well as inside government), development of tools
and guidance for the implementation of environmental laws, strengthening of
the environmental inspectorate through training etc.


Specific relevant recommendations in term of actions to be undertaken at
institutions at national and local levels in order to strengthen or expand them
so that the Environmentla Mitigation Measures can be implemented are the
following:


    ·    Training on implementation of the environmental protection laws at
         all levels.




ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                 THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                         345

    ·    Strengthening of the local municipality environmental offices
         (additional experts, additional trainings and necessary equipment,
         better coordination between local and central level, etc.).

    ·    Established Local Environmental Fund and training of the experts.

    ·    Development of a strategic approach to inspection through the
         development of inspection plans at all levels;

    ·    Creation of coordination mechanism between the inspectorates at
         national and local level.

    ·    Training for environmental inspectors.

    ·    Further development of the monitoring system (clarify the role of
         certain elements in system and obligations of relevant subjects).

    ·    Strengthening institutions relevant for monitoring system (especially
         KEPA).

    ·    Solving the problem of further financing of the existing air and surface
         water monitoring systems.

    ·    Improvement of the self monitoring system in companies (mainly
         KEK) and coordination with national monitoring system.


The EMP has to be the instrument that provides, on one hand, a constant
updating of the state of the environment useful for keeping the mitigation
process under control and that, on the other hand, makes sure that the
predefined goals are punctually achieved.


Moreover, the establishment of an Environmental Advisory Committee (EAC)
is recommended with the main objective to monitor the implementation of the
agreed mitigation measures and monitoring activities.


A detailed description of the composition, the roles, responsibilities and
procedures of the EAC is described in the following.


The members of the EAC will be the following:

    ·    one representative of the Ministry for the Environment and Spatial
         Planning;

    ·    one representative of KEPA;

    ·    one representative of the Municipality of Obiliq, Fushe Kosove e
         Vushtrri;

    ·    one representative of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural
         Development;

    ·    one representative of Ministry of Energy and Mining;

    ·    one representative of KEK;

    ·    one representative of the investor;

    ·    one representative of NGOs;

    ·    representatives of local communities.


Local and national regulators together with results-oriented members of
environmental groups will be invited to participate in the development and
implementation of the monitoring plan.

                                       346

The environmental program goals and objectives will be clearly outlined: at
the beginning of the process the proposed program will be described in
details.


The EAC members will:

    ·    analyse monitoring data, evaluating the trend and comparing new
         data with previous ones;

    ·    discuss and interpret monitoring results;

    ·    suggest eventually corrective actions;

    ·    check the implementation of foreseen mitigation measures and suggest
         further measures eventually required;

    ·    report on monitoring results and mitigation work in progress; the
         periodic reports will be available for the population on Web site
         (KEPA or Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning).


In particular, routinely meetings (every month) are foreseen to discuss
progress and results and suggest measures to address findings, so that action
plans can be developed in time to prevent problems. The EAC will invite the
necessary cross-section of experienced stakeholders to participate in these
types of discussions. A cooperative process for resolution of any potential
regulatory disputes will be developed.


After each meeting, a member of the EAC will issue a report on the results
and interpretation of the results, in which specifics on water, air, soil and
miscellaneous environmental concerns will be noted.


The reports will help decision-makers and public institutions at the various
stages of the process, with the introduction of any necessary mitigation and
compensation measures and the definition of new environmental activities or
corrective actions that can be taken to address the observations or findings.


The reports will be distributed to the managers responsible to ensure the
implementation and effectiveness of the mitigation measures and to public
authorities involved; they will also be available on the Web site (KEPA or
Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning).


The reports will contain:

    ·    the intermediate monitoring results foreseen by the EMP;
    ·    the state of progress of the environmental programmes;
    ·    the identification of any corrective actions.


Every six months the EAC will meet with the managers responsible to ensure
the implementation and effectiveness of the mitigation measures to discuss
any problems and ensure that problems are addressed.


One of the tasks of the EAC will be also to review the authority and capability
of institutions at local, provincial/regional and national levels and
recommend steps to strengthen or expand them so that the monitoring plan
can be implemented. The recommendations may extend to new laws and

regulations, new agencies or agency functions, intersectional arrangements,
management procedures and training, staffing, operation and maintenance
training, budgeting, and financial support.


Upon being formed, the EAC will begin an environmental monitoring
training program for institutions, population and stakeholders on how to
convey the importance of the monitoring plan, its goals and how their
contribution and commitment could improve the success of the plan itself.


Once a year, the EAC will arrange a public conference and present results and
progress.

6.2    DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN

       The proposed Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP) is aimed at monitoring
       the performance of mitigation measures to be included in the NMFDP for
       implementation of new investments and rehabilitation of existing facilities.
       This section provides an outline of monitoring program objectives, identifying
       the variables of concern and establishing baselines against which the nature,
       magnitude and significance of future changes can be evaluated.


       The environmental situation of Obiliq Municipality and a number of other
       nearby settlements (Bardh and Fushe Kosova and villages of Dardhishte,
       Plementin, Hade and Grabovc) are affected by environmental pollution due to
       mining and power generation of existing and future activities.


       Furthermore, current environmental contamination of the area derives also by
       previous activities (especially from gasification and fertilise plants) with
       particular regards to contaminated soil and infiltration of trace metals and
       salts in the soils resulting in contamination of groundwater and rivers.


       A number of environmental studies have been carried out in the past years or
       are still under going by a number of national and international funds.
       However, these studies have been based on existing data and no
       comprehensive environmental monitoring has been carried out in recent
       years. In order to describe the environmental baseline and fully identify the
       environmental impacts the proposed environmental program is considered
       crucial to complete the set of available environmental data with additional
       information including, amongst others, air quality and air emissions
       characterisation, wastewater effluents quality definition, adequate geological
       and hydrogeological sections, complete soil and ground water
       characterization with particular reference to the ash dumps areas and
       gasification and fertilizer site etc..


       The proposed EMP, as detailed in the following paragraphs, is therefore
       aimed to:


           ·    acquire new elements to complete the environmental data collection;

           ·    provide an outline of a tool which will help to monitor the
                environmental data and assess the implementation and the efficiency
                of the planned environmental mitigation measures.


       Specifically, the scope of the EMP is to define methods, parameters, frequency
       and reporting of monitoring activities that will be carried out. The key
       objectives are to:


           ·    identify potential sources of negative environmental impact on air,
                water and soil;

           ·    demonstrate compliance with applicable treaties, laws and standards;

           ·    assess the efficiency of the implemented mitigation measures;

                                               349

             ·    monitor the achievement of environmental objectives and targets and
                  provide potential corrective measures;

             ·    provide information to environmental authorities and stakeholders.


         Monitoring activities performed at present, mainly carried out on KEK's
         responsibility, as described in Paragraph 2.4 of Annex A Environmental
         Assessment of Existing KEK Operations, will continue.



6.2.1    Approach and Methodology

         The EMP has to be the instrument that provides, on one hand, a constant
         updating of the state of the environment useful for keeping the mitigation
         process under control, and that, on the other hand, makes sure that the
         predefined goals are punctually achieved.


         For such purpose it is proposed to appoint an Environmental Advisory
         Committee (EAC), gathering a group of highly qualified experts, which will
         have the duty to monitor the implementation of the agreed mitigation
         measures and monitoring activities as above specified.


         A detailed description of the composition, the roles, responsibilities and
         procedures of the EAC is described in Paragraph 6.1.3.



6.2.2    Technical Description of EMP

         In order to gain statistically significant environmental monitoring data, at
         least a 5 year monitoring program is developed and implemented, starting
         from the signature of the contract aimed at the realization of the Sibovc
         Lignite Field development. This will allow for the establishment of
         background data and comparison of impacts before and after mitigation
         measures implementation. This is particularly important for air, water and
         soil quality monitoring programs.


         Environmental monitoring information will be gathered for air quality, water
         supply, wastewater, soil and groundwater contamination and noise. The
         EMP, as detailed in the following paragraphs, provides also information on
         environmental monitoring protocols in terms of how and where the
         monitoring has to be performed.


         The parameters taken into account in the comprehensive environmental
         monitoring program have been identified based on the review of existing
         environmental studies and on the proposed mitigation measures. The
         sampling locations (when feasible) and frequencies have been chosen in order
         to have the appropriate spatial and temporal coverage, in relation to specific
         parameters or effects.

6.2.2.1    Air Quality

           Monitoring activities foreseen for air quality and emissions to air
           characterisation are described in the following paragraphs.


           Installation of Continuous Monitoring Devices at Kosovo A and Kosovo B Stacks

           No monitoring is currently undertaken at air emissions from both TPP A and
           TPP B due principally to limited budget availability.


           In both the power plants, most air emissions are calculated based on fuel
           characteristics and combustion process parameters (Stein methodology for
           SOx and particulate). TPP B power plant is provided with equipment for
           online monitoring of particulate; nevertheless, measuring equipment is
           neither calibrated nor properly maintained


           The installation of continuous monitoring devices at the stacks (main sources
           of pollution) of both TPP A and TPP B is foreseen. The continuous monitoring
           system includes the measurement of flow rate, temperature and pollutants
           concentration of flue gases in the stacks.


           Complete continuous flue gas analysis of CO, O2, SO2, CO2, NO, NO2 and
           Total NOx and particulate is essential for both efficient and environmentally
           acceptable performance. Data acquisition and analysis software systems
           would also be installed. The devices would be connected to a computer
           network which would receive all the data and ascertain their compliance with
           applicable standards.


           In case values above permitted limits are detected, an early warning system
           would inform site management to adopt required measures (reduction of
           work-load, check of efficiency of abatement system and work stoppage if
           need be).
           The data would also be reported on monthly to maintain statistics and
           provide information to Kosovo Environmental Protection Agency (KEPA) and
           the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP).


           Estimated cost for the proposed continuous monitoring devices is about
           210,000 Euro.

Spot Sampling of Air Emissions

In order to complete the description of the air emission scenario, quarterly
monitoring is proposed at the main stacks of Kosovo A and Kosovo B to
investigate the chemical composition of particulate for trace elements: heavy
metal contents (vanadium, Nickel, Cadmium, Lead, Copper, Zinc and Arsenic
and) and PAH.


Sampling would be undertaken by means of a sampling pump according to
national and international guidelines. All the stacks would have to be
provided with an adequate sampling point to be positioned according to
national and international guidelines. Chemical analysis for parameters
screening would need to be undertaken by a certified laboratory.


A minor cost is annually foreseen for equipment (provision of adequate
sampling points at the stacks and sampling unit) and analysis.


Air Quality Monitoring in Obiliq Municipality and Surrounding Areas

TPP A, TPP B and the mines are today the largest concentrated source of air
pollution in Kosovo, but the current poor air quality is also caused by other
industrial activities (i.e. Feronikeli), civil construction and traffic.


Two air quality monitoring stations are currently installed and have been
operating since 2006: the first in Obiliq city (Kastriot) and the second in
INKOS Institute. SO2, soot and deposition rate are monitored at such two
stations. Sediment samples are used for the determination of total particulate
and soluble and insoluble matters. Sediments are analysed in terms of:


·      total particulate;
·      general inorganic matter;
·      general soluble matter;
·      pH;
·      soluble chloride content;
·      soluble sulphate content.


An integral ambient air quality monitoring system would need to be
established since existing monitoring system is incomplete.


The air quality monitoring program includes two further monitoring stations
for the detection on a continuous basis of the following substances: CO, NOx
(NO + NO2), SOx, O3 and particulate (PM10 and PM2.5). The monitoring
program also includes a meteorological station and hardware /software
equipment for registration/transmission of data.


The new monitoring stations should be equipped with radiometers and/or
solar devices to measure solar radiation and temperature gradient, in order to
be able to reconstruct stability classes.

                 In order to evaluate the impacts of the mines activities on air quality, other
                 priority pollutants may be included in ambient air monitoring as Total HC,
                 Non Methane HC and CH4 and BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Xilene) for own
                 monitoring stations.


                 All the monitoring stations would be fitted with a data acquisition and data
                 transmission system capable of transferring data to KEPA for continuous
                 control. Intervention protocols would need to be established in case limits are
                 exceeded. Key personnel within the site management would be trained to
                 adopt required measures to bring pollution under limits (reduction of work-
                 load, check of efficiency of abatement system and work stoppage if need be).
                 The data would also be reported on monthly to maintain statistics and
                 provide information to the public.


                 Periodic reports would be issued (comparing the results with legislative
                 limits) and sent to the KEPA, the Ministry of Environment and Spatial
                 Planning and other authorities; such reports will be available on the WEB site.


                 Locations of monitoring stations are determined on the basis of the results of
                 pollution dispersion model and the location of the receptors.


                 An estimated cost of 360,000 Euro is foreseen for the equipment and minor
                 costs for the analysis.

6.2.2.2    Wastewater

           All the wastewater generated in TPP A and TPP B plants, including industrial
           effluents, sanitary effluents and rainfall are discharged in Sitnica River
           without any treatment, apart from the quantity of evaporated water from the
           cooling tower process.


           The discharging system includes 22 discharging points into the main sewage
           system and 3 main discharging points into Sitnica River.


           Wastewater discharges from the power plants are monitored by INKOS
           through 17 surface water and 5 underground water monitoring points (5
           piezometers, installed around the ash dump at TPP B to monitor groundwater
           quality). Results of wastewater monitoring are included in KEK monthly
           environmental report.


           The drained waters of Bardh and Mirash mines deriving from lignite
           exploitation are collected in natural ponds and then discharged into the
           Drenica and Sitnica rivers. Water quality is monitored by INKOS and data is
           made available on a monthly basis.


           Monitoring activities foreseen for wastewater flow rates and quality are
           described in the following paragraphs.


           Flow Rates Monitoring

           Flow rates of processing wastewater discharged from the power plants would
           be monitored on a periodical/continuous basis in order to have reliable data
           for preliminary design of WWTP; these effluents include: process waters from
           the power plants (boilers blow down and other streams); blow down from the
           cooling towers; and sanitary waters.


           Storm waters flow rates would be evaluated based on precipitation rates,
           drainage surfaces and soil characteristics. The survey would require close
           cooperation of water specialists with site personnel, who should give specific
           input with regard to reliability of data to be collected.


           Estimated cost for this survey is about 30,000 Euro.


           Wastewater Quality

           Generated wastewater would be analysed before and after treatment to
           ascertain quality of effluents discharged and to monitor efficiency of waste
           water treatment plant (WWTP) to be installed.


           Wastewater monitoring would be undertaken every three months, to ensure
           that all recorded parameters are in compliance with the legislative limits in
           force and shall include the following parameters ­ at a minimum: pH;
           temperature; dissolved oxygen; chemical oxygen demand; total suspended

           matter; metals including - at a minimum ­ Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb; toxic organics
           such as phenols and chlorophenols; polynuclear aromatics such as
           benzo(a)pyrene, carbon tetrachloride, PCBs; and oil and grease.


           Standard water sampling equipment and laboratories are required.


           Assuming a WWTP is installed, a minor cost is expected for monitoring every
           year.



6.2.2.3    Soil and Groundwater

           Most relevant criticalities for the soil and groundwater contamination in
           mines and power plant sites are the following:


           ·   Gasification and fertilizer plant area (including phenol deposits, dumping
               PAH (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and Phenols dumps; tar-like
               substance hardened on the surface, etc)

           ·   Kosovo A ash dump;

           ·   Kosovo B ash dump.


           For soil and groundwater, the following monitoring activities are foreseen:


           Soil and Groundwater Investigation at Gasification and Fertilizer Plant Area

           A site investigation in the gasification plant area is included in a sub-project
           funded by the World Bank in the framework of the CLRP. This is scheduled to
           start shortly, and would include a geological/(hydro)geological survey and
           environmental site investigation of soil and (ground)water at and around the
           gasification plant site as well as in the Kosovo A ash dump where tars and
           phenols, etc., have been dumped.


           The monitoring of groundwater quality would include drilling of 5
           piezometers and water sampling to monitor the actual and potential for
           contamination of the groundwater.


           The parameters to be analysed include BTEX, PAH, phenols and
           hydrocarbons.


           Groundwater monitoring shall be carried out quarterly until two years after
           the complete remediation of the gasification and fertilizer plant site.


           Groundwater Investigation at Kosovo A and Kosovo B Ash Dumps

           The CLRP includes investigation on soil, surface and groundwater for Kosovo
           A ash dump and overburden dumps located to the southwest of the Kosovo A
           site and existing Mirash/Bardh mines.
           No soil and groundwater investigation for TPP B ash dump is reported.

                                                    355

A monitoring program on groundwater quality is proposed also, taking into
consideration the results of the CLRP soil and groundwater investigation, and
includes the following:


  ·   groundwater sampling in around 5 upgradient and 10 downgradient
      piezometers (existing and new one to be drilled) for each Kosovo A and
      Kosovo B ash dump;

  ·   the final number and position of the piezometers would be defined: (i)
      on the basis of an in-depth study on the local hydrogeology and
      identification of exact groundwater flow direction; and also (ii)
      considering the results of the first monitoring program for Kosovo A ash
      dump;

  ·   groundwater samples would be collected at two different depths
      corresponding to the surface yellow/grey clay layer and the lignite layer;
      an analysis of the aquifers' interconnection through tracing substances
      would be performed;

  ·   the groundwater monitoring campaign would be repeated twice a year;
      and

  ·   the groundwater analysis would include, at a minimum: (i) BTEX; (ii)
      PHAs; (iii) phenols; and (iv) metals with particular reference to heavy
      metals (Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, As, Hg). The final parameters to be
      detected would be defined on the basis of the results of the first year
      groundwater analysis program.


The estimated cost for the first year ground water monitoring is 100,000 Euro
(including piezometers installation and chemical analysis); the cost for
monitoring in the following years is about 20,000 Euro.


Topsoil Investigation

A topsoil investigation is recommended as follows:


    ·    sampling and analysis of topsoil in the areas downwind of the Kosovo
         A and Kosovo B ash dumps is planned, aimed at detecting the
         presence of heavy metals and PAHs from ash dispersion, in the
         surface soil, particularly in agricultural lands. The topsoil sampling
         shall be conducted starting from the boundaries of the ash dumps to 1
         km distant, on the basis of a regular grid (a representative sample for a
         500 x 500 meter grid). The monitoring program would be carried out
         twice a year until two years after the ash dump remediation; and


    ·    a superficial soil sampling is proposed in an area of 10 km radius from
         the power plants to ascertain potential risks for human health deriving
         from direct exposure and/or food chain pathways.


A minor cost is estimated for the topsoil investigation.

River Sediments Characterisation

With regards to the Sitnica River, sediment sampling along river banks should
be undertaken and analysed for detection of pH, heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Zn,
Cu, Cr, Ni, As, Hg) and phenols.


Sediment samples should be collected every 250 m on the two banks of the
river. The distance of sampling locations could be modified depending on the
findings of an on site assessment.


Monitoring should be repeated once a year to ascertain the self-treatment of
the river and to monitor eventual further impacts deriving from the mines
and power generation operations.


An estimated cost of 25,000 Euro is foreseen.

1      INTRODUCTION




1.1    BACKGROUND

       The Consortium (the Consultant) led by Environmental Resources
       Management (ERM) Italy and supported by ELC Electroconsult and CSA
       Group Ltd was commissioned by the Kosovo Lignite Power Technical
       Assistance Project (LPTAP) of the Ministry of Energy and Mining of Kosovo
       (MEM). to undertake the assignment "Environmental and Social Safeguards
       Services for Private Sector Participation in the Development of new generation
       capacity, related transmission and the development of the Sibovc Lignite
       Field" between July 2007 and March 2008.


       This document represents the environmental assessment of Existing KEK
       Operations to be included in the description of the environmental/socio-
       economic baseline as per Task 3/AI.


       This document is a separate Annex of the First Draft SESA Report.

1.2    SCOPE OF WORK

       Scope of the work is to undertake an environmental assessment of KEK's
       existing generation and mining installations and facilities, including
       identification of potential environmental impacts and environmental audits to
       analyze existing conditions.


       For each of KEK's functions (mining and generation) the Consultant has
       determined the extent of non-compliance with environmental legislation and
       regulations(1) and actions to bring operations under compliance.


       Furthermore the Consultant suggested the necessary actions to be undertaken
       to repair or clean up the high priority environmental issues.

1.3    CONSULTANT'S APPROACH

       The Consultant's mission in Kosovo took place between September 17th and
       September 21st 2007. Meeting and interviews with the management and staff
       were held and the following visits to KEK existing facilities were performed:

             · one day site visit of the existing mines Bardh and Mirash;
             · two days site visit of Kosovo A power plant (TPP A) and Kosovo B
                  power plant (TPP B).




       (1) Standards according local, regional (Former Yugoslavia) and international (EU and World Bank) regulations and
       guidelines were taken in consideration.


       ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                                     THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                                   2

           The investigation on the existing mines was conducted by ERM in cooperation
           with CSA International.


           During the kick-off mission undertaken in July-August 2007 a preliminary
           visit of KEK mines and power plants was performed by ERM in order to have
           an overview of status of existing facilities and most relevant environmental
           issues.


           The persons met from KEK during the site visits are presented in Table 1.3a.
           The persons met from KEK were very helpful, engaged and dedicated to their
           work.

2      OVERVIEW




2.1    KEK

       The Kosovo Energy Corporation (Korporata Energjetike e Kosovës - KEK) is a
       vertically integrated system composed of two lignite mines at Bardh and
       Mirash, two lignite fired power plants Kosovo A and B, with an overall
       effective capacity of around 830 MW (from an installed capacity of 1478 MW),
       and the Ujmani Hydro-Power Plant (HPP), with an installed capacity of
       35 MW, transmission and dispatching system, distribution network and
       supply. In recent times an unbundling process has taken place, with the
       creation of two joint stock companies, namely KEK J.S.C. and KOSTT J.S.C.


       The power plants were built within the period of 1960-1984, while the HPP
       Ujmani/Gazivode begun operation in 1983.
       Gasification Plant located close to TPP A site has not been working since 1988
       while the Drying Facility as an independent joint stock company works in a
       rather limited capacity. A Fertilizer Plant and industrial heating are present in
       the area but out of operation since 1988.

2.2    THE MINES

       Mining operations are carried out in two surface mines, Bardh and Mirash
       mines, which cover an area of approximatively 9 km2. The Bardh Open-Cast
       Mine has an exploitation area at the length of 2.5 km and width of 1.8 km
       (approx. 4.5 km2).


       The open-cast mine has installed equipment with a lignite exploitation
       capacity of 8.2 x 106 t/year and 14 x 106 m3/year overburden. For the
       realization of design capacities two lignite systems and three overburden
       systems have been installed with the engagement of 9 rotor excavators with
       automotive belts and three spreaders. This equipment has been in use for the
       last 15 to 36 years. The Mirash Open-Cut Mine is operated since 1956. It covers
       a surface area of approx 10.2 km2. The mine has in use 11 rotor excavators, but
       also other excavators, many bulldozers and other accessory vehicles, for the
       operation of excavating and transport of overburden and coal. The design
       capacity of the mine is 8.6 x 106 (t/year) of lignite and 14x106 (m3/year) of
       overburden (KEK 2006).
       Both the coal mines Bardh and Mirash, will be exhausted by 2011. Based on
       KEK data, coal production in February 2008 was 20,000 t/month (overburden
       was 35,800 m3/month); coal capacity is very closed to coal production.


       Lignite is excavated by electrically driven bucket wheel excavators and
       transported by two open, electrically driven belt conveyors to the TPPs coal
       yard. The conveyor belts (type OPB 02/03) have a transport capacity of
       1,400 t/h (33,000 t /d). The conveyor belts for the transport of coal from mine

            to TPP B separation unit is 1.4 m wide, while the conveyor belt for transport to
            TPP A is 1.2 m wide.
            Both separation plants are equipped with crashers; crasher performance is up
            to 30 mm at TPP A and up to 40 m at TPP B. Deposition of coal is going to be
            done with help of combined machinery.


            Excavations are performed using diesel driven truck and shovel technologies
            as well as electrically driven bucket wheel and belt conveyors.


            Both mines work in the same area with opposite advance directions. In 2005
            restructuring measures became necessary because the two opencast mines of
            Bardh and Mirash interconnected in increasing scale. Since then both opencast
            mines have been developed as one mine. Nevertheless the mines are called
            further on by their original names.


            The existing coal mines will be exhausted within the next 3 years. The first
            excavator was already set free and was moved into the future field of Sibovc-
            SW (North of Bardh). Presently five overburden lines are in operation in the
            mine complex, one of them in the future mine.


            Besides the overburden, the ash of both TPPs' was dumped on outside dumps
            for a long time. Only for TPP B the ash dumping has been changed to inside
            spoiling in the residual hole of the former Mirash-East mine.

2.3         THE POWER PLANTS

2.3.1       Location

            The integrated Kosovar electricity system is composed of two above described
            lignite mines and of two lignite fired power plants Kosovo A (TPPA) and B
            (TPPB) with an overall effective capacity of around 830 MW (960 MW from
            April 2008), from an installed capacity of 1,478 MW.


            The plants and the disposal sites are located in the municipality of Obiliq and
            Fushe Kosove, about 3 km from the city limit of Pristina (see Figure 2.3.1a). The
            average altitude is around 550 m above sea level.

2.3.2         Thermal Power Plant Kosovo A

              TPP A has 5 units which were built in two phases (from 1962 to 1964 and from
              1970 to 1975) and which have thermal capacities variable in the range 180 -550
              MWth.


              TTP A has a total installed generating capacity of 800 MW, of which only
              275 MW are presently available. The following Table 2.3.2a shows the present
              status of TPP A, together with used fuel and operation year.

              Currently units of TPP A do not work continuously due principally coal
              supply. A1 unit is rarely put into operation, while A2 unit is out of service
              since 1998. During 2006-2007 the emergency reparation of boilers of A3 and
              A4 units was carried out. Unit A5 will be ready to operate from the beginning
              of April 2008;

The power generation efficiency as estimated in Carl Bro assessment is 16-25%
at Kosovo A and 30% at Kosovo B, even if official data give higher efficiencies
as follows:
    · 27% for each unit of Kosovo A;
    · 30 and 32% for the two units of Kosovo B.1


The site plant of TPP A is reported in the following Figure 2.3.2a.

The Kosovo A power plant is constituted by the following main units:


1) Lignite coal storage area. The transportation of lignite from the mines to the
    coal yard is performed by open belt conveyors. The capacity of TPP A is
    700.000 m3.
2) Fuel Oil above ground storage tank: light fuel and heavy fuel oil are used for
    start-ups and some times heavy fuel oil for support firing of the boilers
    during low loads (KEK Environmental Report, 2006).
3) Belt conveyor for lignite transport to boilers at each unit for crunching;
    crushed coal is then injected into boilers mixed with air.
4) Boilers, building machineries (turbines, generators, condenser, control room). The
    boilers are designed for about 14 % of ash content. In certain periods,
    depending on coal quality in the actual mining area, volume of ash in coal
    might be higher and this can causes reduced efficiency.
5) Electrical precipitators (ESP's) for collection of fly ash at each unit and
    temporary storage facilities (two fly ash silos). The electrostatic
    precipitators of units A3 and A4 were delivered during 1966 and 1967
    respectively, by ELEX Switzerland and put into operation in 1970 and
    1971.All electrostatic precipitators have identical design and size. No
    major revisions have been made since the delivery, except some
    maintenance activities during last emergency repairs of the units A3 and
    A4 in 2005 and 2006 respectively. Maintenance operations for A5 unit are
    foreseen in 2008. Maintenance and spare parts are a problem due to the
    age of the electrostatic precipitators. Electrostatic precipitators were
    designed to reach the concentration of about 540 mg/Nm3. Nevertheless
    installed precipitators are functioning with far lower efficiencies than
    designed due to bad boiler design. Sometimes they are not in operation.
6) Five separate 100 meters high stack for the five units.
7) Ash transportation and disposal site for ashes: bottom ash and fly ash from
    TPP A (unit 1 and 2) were transported to the disposal sites as slurry
    without re-circulation of the water. Ashes from the functioning units A3
    A4 and A5 are transported dry by air to a temporary storage at the plants
    where is mixed with water and then transported by belt conveyers to the
    disposal site close to power plant. Bottom ash (slag) and fly ash are

                  produced in the combustion process in the ratio of about 1:9. The
                  transportation system for A1 and A2 has more than 40 years of operation
                  (from 33 to 38 years for A3, A4 and A5) and lacking maintenance
                  expenditure. Dust pollution occurs at all operation points, at the bunkers,
                  along the belt conveyors, at coal discharge point, during the dumping
                  process with the spreaders and during the levelling.

             8) Plant for preparation of process water (filtration. flocculation. and
                 demineralization) manually operated. The solid residuals from water
                 treatment are disposed together with ashes. The water necessary to the
                 plant is taken from a pumping station installed in Llap River located at
                 around 11 km distance from TPP A. When the river flow rate is too low (in
                 summer season) water is taken from Iber Lepenc channel.
             9) Induced draft cooling towers (based on aerations-ventilations systems)
                 located in the vicinity of the plant. To provide cooling water to condenser.
                 Make up water to cooling tower is taken from Llap River. At the moment
                 cooling tower blow down is discharged to the Sitnica river without any
                 treatment.
             10) Waste water treatment plant TPP A is provided with waste water treatment
                 plant to treat waste water before discharging into Sitnica River. The waste
                 water treatment plant carries out a partly treatment of waste water
                 through sedimentation and neutralisation processes. The installations are
                 old and badly maintained.
             11) Electric Substation and electric transformers


             In TPP A site is also located a Drying Plant in which a minor part of lignite (1-
             2% from annual coal production) is transported and treated to be sold to
             industrial costumers.

2.3.3        Thermal Power Plant Kosovo B

             Kosovo B consists of two units, B1 and B2, with thermal capacity of about 850
             MWth each. TPP B units have been erected from 1983 to 1984.

             For units of TPP B there are no restrictions with the coal supply what is case
             with units of TPP A.


             The power generation efficiency at TPP B as estimated in Carl Bro assessment

as reported in KEK Environmental Report (2006 and First Six- monthly
Environmental Monitoring Report, 2007 from KEK).


The site plant of TPP B is reported in Figure 2.3.3a.


The Kosovo B power plant has the following main installations:


    1) Lignite coal storage area with a capacity of approximately 620.000 m3.
         The transportation of lignite from the mines to the coal yard is
         performed by open belt conveyors.
    2) Fuel Oil above ground storage tank: light fuel and heavy fuel oil are used
         for start-ups and some times heavy fuel oil is used to support firing of
         the boilers if the quality of lignite is low.
    3) Belt conveyor for lignite transport to boilers.
    4) Boilers, building machineries (turbines, generators, condenser, control room).
    5) Two electrical precipitators (ESP's) for collection of fly ash at each unit
         and temporary storage facilities (two fly ash silos) with the nominal
         performance designed capacity of 260 mg/Nm3 . Although the recent
         rehabilitation of electrostatic precipitators of B2 unit (Elvo, 2003), they
         are functioning with lower efficiencies than designed.
    6) Plant for preparation of process water (filtration, flocculation, and
         demineralization). The different phases of the treatment are currently
         operated manually, although the system is originally designed for
         automatic operation.
    7) One common 182 meters high stack for both units, originally designed for
         220 meters (KEK Environmental Report 2006).
    8) Collection, slurry transport systems for ash and final disposal: Fly ash is
         hydraulically transported as a suspension of water and ash to the
         former Mirash-East mine where mechanical deposition of ash happens
         on "plateaus" equipped with only very narrow embankments. Bottom
         ash is transported to the landfill with trucks and conveyors.
    9) Natural draft cooling tower located in the vicinity of the plant. To
         provide cooling water to condenser. Make up water to cooling tower is
         taken from the Iber Lepenc system. At the moment cooling tower blow
         down is discharged to a pond and used to prepare slurry for ashes
         transportation and then discharged to Sitnica River.
    10) Waste water treatment plant. TPP B is provided with waste water
         treatment plant to treat waste water before discharging into the river
         Sitnica. The waste water treatment plant carries out a partly treatment
         of waste water through sedimentation and neutralisation processes.
         The installations are badly maintained.

         All installations are relatively old and have been not completely maintained
         until recently. The situation has been improved in recent years due to the
         replacement of many equipments with new ones including control system and
         electrical equipments.


         The daily lignite supply to TPP B is normally between 5,000 ­ 20,000 t/d.
         while daily consumption is max 20.000 t/d with full capacity of both boilers
         (Electrowatt-Ekono Oy, 2007). Average daily consumption as reported in KEK
         Environmental Report 2006 is around 11,000 t/d.


         Transportation of oils, chemicals and equipment is done by trucks.


         TPP B is not provided with any desulphurisation or denitrification process.

2.4      ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.4.1    Site Setting

         The mines, power plants and disposal sites are located in the municipality of
         Obiliq, about 3 km from the city limit of Pristina, Fushe Kosova and Vushtrri.


         The average altitude is around 550 m above sea level. The power plants are
         located in a flat area.


         A number of main and secondary settlements (cities of Obiliq, Bardh and
         Fushe Kosova and villages of Dardhishte, Plementin, Hade and Grabovc) are
         located close enough to the existing mines and power plants sites to be
         affected by environmental pollution due to mining and power generation
         activities.


         Part of Hade village located on northern slope between Mirash and Bardh
         mining areas has been resettled in 2003/2004 due to potential land slide risk.
         The land in the mine surroundings is mainly used for agriculture, with only
         few small forests in the southern part of the basin.


         Mining of lignite coal and power generation are the most important activities
         in this area from an environmental point of view are. Exploitation of the
         lignite is carried out since almost 100 years and large-scale operation as it is
         seen today with open cast mining and power generation has been going on for
         about 40 years without much concern for the impacts on the environment.


         Adjacent to the TTP A is located an old and abandoned industrial area where
         a gasification and a fertiliser plants were operating until more than 10 years
         ago (see for more details Section 2.4.5).



         ERM ­ ELC - CSA                               THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                  15

         The impact of the previous activities (gasification and fertilise plants included)
         is today seen as contaminated soil and infiltration of trace metals and salts in
         the soils resulting in contamination of groundwater and rivers.


         Hence, the current contamination of rivers and groundwater is not only
         related to the current activities.


         There is no other heavy polluting industry in the area and traffic is the only
         other source of pollution (the nearest industrial area is in Mitrovica about 30
         km north-northwest of the site).

2.4.2    Hydrography

         There are two main rivers in the mining area, Sitnica and Drenica.
         Sitnica River crosses the Kosovo Basin from south to north and drains about
         80 % of the accumulating surface water into northern direction. Sitnica River
         flows to the Iber River near Mitrovica.


         An artificial canal (Iber Lepenc) was constructed connecting Ujman/Gazivode
         Lake (located at north-east Mitrovica) to the industrial area of north-eastern
         Kosovo. Canal was designed to transport about 20 m3/s but, due to the bad
         existing conditions is presently able to transport about 6.5 m3/s. A feasibility
         study for rehabilitation of this canal has been completed recently and works
         are expected to start in 2008.


         Major tributary rivers in the vicinity of the site are the river Drenica in the
         west and the river Llap in the east. The Sitnica run-off varies between a
         minimum of 0.5 ­ 1.5 m³/s and a maximum of 50 ­ 120 m³/s with an average
         of 5 ­ 10 m³/s. In flooding periods, the course of the river reaches a width of
         up to 1.000 m in the flooding areas and may interact with the ash landfill of
         Kosovo B power plant. On 3 May 1958 a maximum run-off for the Sitnica
         River near to the mines was measured at 90.3 m³/s.

2.4.3    Geology

         The basement of the Kosovo Basin and the exposed surrounding areas are
         built up by Palaeozoic to Mesozoic crystalline rocks. The basin fill consists of
         Upper Cretaceous strata which are uncomfortably overlain by Tertiary clays
         of Pliocene age in which lignite is interbedded. Towards the West the lignite
         deposition is tectonically bound by a series of predominantly NNW-SSE
         striking faults.


         The central area, the "Coal Kosovo Basin", spreads over a surface of
         approximately 300 km². Simplified, the succession can be subdivided as
         follows:
             · Bottom Series (green Clay)
             · Coal Series (Lignite Formation)
             · Top Series (grey Clay)

2.4.4    Hydrogeology

         A brief description of the hydrogeological situation of the area is given based
         on the report from STEAG 2006. Three main hydrogeological layers are
         present. The basis is given by an aquiclude formed by the "green clay"
         consisting of clay and silt with a general thickness of more than 100 m. The
         overlaying lignite with a thickness up to 70 m has a low permeability. Due to
         fissures and cracks within the coal, groundwater can circulate and the coal
         layer has to be recognized as an aquifer.


         Above the coal follows the overburden mainly consisting of silt and clay with
         partially appearance of sand and gravel layers. Embedded layers with masses
         of snail shells are characteristic. Near to the surface the "grey clay" can change
         its appearance to "yellow clay" due to weathering and oxidation of iron. The
         clay material generally presents an impermeable layer but because of fissures
         and cracks reaching depths of 10 m to 15 m from the surface water can
         penetrate the rock. Hence groundwater appears either when the fissures are
         dug up by excavation or where those fissures are connected to better
         permeable layers within the clay such as the snail shell layers or gravel layers.


         The "yellow clay" horizon is frequently used to supply houses and smaller
         villages with water. e.g. in the village of Hade and in the valley west of
         Lajthishte.

2.4.5    Soil, Surface Water and Groundwater Contamination

         Both ground water and soil are most likely contaminated around mines and
         power plants.


         Underground mining of the lignite was performed in a period from
         approximately 1922 to 1966 (STEAG 2006). Remains of old underground
         mining are situated in the south-eastern part of the Sibovc field connected
         with the old mining structures which are currently exposed along the coal cuts
         in Mirash West and on the Mirash northern slope and underneath the ash
         dump of TPP A (STEAG 2006).


         A special problem is the gasification and fertilizers plant that were in
         operation at the site of Kosovo A until about 20 years ago.

Figure 2.4.5a Facilities of Gasification Plant Site




              The occurrence of phenol deposits derived from the gasification plant have
              been described in several studies. Reportedly condensates as PAH (Polycyclic
              aromatic hydrocarbons) and Phenols of the gasification plant were dumped in
              the old underground mining galleries. The tar-like substance is hardened on
              the surface only, underneath the substance is viscous and degasses. The
              spatial distribution of this material is not sure up to now (as reported in
              VEM/DMT 2007).


              Since the auditing visit of September 2007 was focused on existing KEK
              facilities, detailed information on facilities, environmental condition and level
              of contamination of the gasification and fertilizer sites are not available at
              present.


              Presently no monitoring results are available, but the groundwater in the area
              is most likely contaminated with phenols from this plant and oil and other
              contaminants from fertilizer plant. The contamination of soil is visible all over
              the area and actions have to been taken for characterization and monitoring of
              the area


              At least two heavy oil waste ponds were identified in the ash dump site of
              TPP A and other ponds containing diluted phenols are located in the north
              eastern part of the Kosovo A ash dump.


              Reportedly the heavy oil waste (tar) originating from the old oil gasification
              plant (about 1-2 m3/d) were daily discharged in the ash dump of Kosovo A.
              Recently a "Site Investigation, Technical Organisation, Planning and
              Determination of Environmental Impact" was initiated (July 2007) as part of
              the Clean up and Land Reclamation Project (CLRP) devoted to identify extent
              of contamination and improve the environmental situation in the
              surroundings of the KEK mines and power stations by a reduction of dust
              emission from the existing TPP A ash dump.

         First drillings were performed but, up to now, the lab analyses are not yet
         available.


         Final goal of the project is to reclaim the ash landfill area of Kosovo A power
         plant. Three alternatives have been examined: the first foresees the Ash
         relocation to exhausted existing mine, the second the relocation to an
         identified Sitnica field area and the third a redistribution of ash at the ash
         dump area. The third alternative seems at the moment the most probable.


         Other sources of possible soil and water contaminations are the ash landfills of
         TPP B. In particular the disposal areas do not have any structural protection
         against pollution of surface or ground water producing, obviously, infiltration
         of harmful substances to groundwater and/or flow to Sitnica River.


         INKOS has newly established monitoring points around the disposal sites.
         Some monitoring results are shown in the following paragraphs. According
         the monitoring results presented in "EAR Contract nr 04KOS01/03/009 Lot 2
         Prefeasibility Study of pollution mitigation measures at Kosovo B Power Plant "
         Report (upstream and downstream sampling performed in October 2002)
         indicate heavy contamination of pH values rising from 7.4 to 9.2 and the
         content of suspended materials and sulphate rising from 1.435 mg/l to 2.590
         mg/l and from 335 mg/l to 1.533 mg/l. respectively.

2.4.6    Air Quality

         TPP A, TPP B and the mines are today the largest concentrated source of air
         pollution in Kosovo, but the current poor air quality is also caused by other
         industrial activities (i.e Feronikeli), civil construction and traffic.


         Two air quality monitoring stations have been operating since 2006: the first in
         Obiliq city (Kastriot) and the second in INKOS Institute.


         Results of the air monitoring of 2006 as reported in KEK Environmental
         Report 2006 are presented in the following Table 2.4.6a.

             Air quality monitoring activity carried out in June 2007 in the sole Kastriot
             monitoring station, reported the following average concentrations:

                  · SO2: 24.36 µg/m3;
                  · Soot: 6.7 µg/m3.


             KEK environmental report shows also the deposition rate taken in two
             locations: the first close to separation facility and the second at the Bardh
             mine.


             Deposit are analysed pursuant to the German Standard VDI direction 2119
             Blatt 2 (1972): samples are collected during a month, while results are
             presented in mg/(m2d). Sediment samples are used for determination of total
             dust and soluble and insoluble matters. Sediments are analysed in:
                  · total dust;
                  · general inorganic matter;
                  · general soluble matter;
                  · pH;
                  · soluble chloride content;
                  · soluble sulphate content.


             At the first location (separation facility) deposition rate is exceeding always
             the limit set by Former Yugoslavian and WHO legislation (see below) of 300
             mg/m2d, at Bardh the situation is little better but always critical. Also pH
             limits are exceeded.

              Lignite production and power generation are two separate divisions each with
              engineering departments and environmental units responsible for
              development and implementation of KEK's environmental policy.
              The environmental monitoring activities are carried out by INKOS a KEK
              participated institute.
              The Environmental Department of KEK provides KEK and the Ministry of the
              Environment and Spatial Planning with report on environmental monitoring
              on monthly basis.

3.1.2         KEK Environmental Polices

              This Department has already proposed the Environmental Policy
              Frameworks, adopted by the Board of Directors. The Policies define actions to
              be undertaken by KEK in attaining environmental obligations and in
              improving environmental management.
              KEK shall develop general Environmental Policies aimed at attaining the
              following objectives:
                   · Environmental Protection
                   · Environmental management

             · Rational utilization of natural resources
             · Sensitive work in utilization of natural resources
             · Rational energy utilization
             · Efforts towards optimum energy efficiency
             · Environmental risks
             · Identification of a solution for waste issue
             · Minimization of waste production and proper waste management
             · Environmental procurement (encouraging subcontractors to adopt
                  good environmental practices)
             · Raising environmental conscience
             · Promotion of environmental conscience in all KEK premises
             · Establishment of mechanisms for regular monitoring of all process
                  activities
             · Regular review of environmental policies and practices


         In developing these policies KEK shall work in several directions
         simultaneously:

             · Improvement of the environmental situation and monitoring
             · Coordination of activities with competent environmental bodies
             · Allocation of resources for establishment of operations and
                  development of environmental management systems.


3.1.3    Fire Fighting in the Mines

         Larger amounts of lignite can be affected by spontaneous combustion which
         occurs in the mine slopes and coal yards where coal is exposed to air. Self-
         ignition is the consequence of the oxidation of coal. In the Bardh-Mirash mine
         the areas affected by these fires are especially the structures of the old
         underground mines, slide areas, the central pillar in front of the face between
         the actual excavation areas, the north and south lateral slopes of the mine as
         well as parts of the mine which remain exposed to air for a longer period
         (slopes and dumps), fault and joints (VEM/DMT (2005). The surface area
         affected by fires is estimated to be in the range of 1 km2 (KEK Environmental
         Report 2006).


         Reportedly an operational plan exists including the designation of responsible
         person for each mine. Tools have been secured and training provided. A team
         was established to use the equipment and fight fires. A training program was
         carried out from management levels down and from the trainees a team was
         chosen for specialist training. A register exists of existing and treated fires and
         is kept within the engineering department. ERM was informed that the fires
         that were seen during the site visit had been treated.
         There is no written emergency plan.

3.1.4         Air Emissions

              Mines

              The main air emissions generated by the mine are particulate matter from the
              mining operation (cf. Figure 3.1.4a). Especially coal dust from the active
              mining area contributes to air pollution. Furthermore the unpaved roads in
              the mines are sources of air pollution. Other sources are emissions of
              excavators, trucks and the lignite smouldering fires. Measurements of air
              quality (total deposited dust) inside the Bardh mine are presented in the
              Environmental Report from KEK. The data show some exceedance of limit
              values for Total Dust (KEK 2006).

Figure 3.1.4a Ambient Air Pollution Caused by Mining Activities




              Based on the field inspection it can be assumed that dust/particulate matter
              and exhaust gases from the fires are the major sources of air pollution inside
              the mines.


              One complaint was reported which has been filed by the population of
              Grabovc, West of the Mines relating to noise and dust emissions by the
              operation of the mine.


              Ambient Air Quality measurements including measurements of power plant
              emissions are conducted on a monthly basis by INKOS the results have been
              presented in the previous Section 2.4.6.



              Kosovo A an d Kosovo B Power Plant

              The main air pollutants from combustion of lignite in TPP A and TPP B power
              plants are:
                  · Solid particles (particulate);
                  · Acid gasses SO2 and NOx;
                  · Products from incomplete combustion of the fuel (soot, CO and
                       hydrocarbons);

                  · Greenhouse gas CO2, CH2 and CH4.


              Other air pollutants could be derived from combustion of oil and heavy oil
              that used during start up of operation and occasionally during operation in
              short periods.

              Emissions Monitoring
              A monitoring plan for air emissions (including NOx, SOx and particulate) from
              both TPP A and TPP B is available but is not carried out due principally to
              limited budget availability.


              In both the power plants most air emissions are calculated based on fuel
              characteristics and combustion process parameters (Stein methodology for
              SOx and particulate).


              TPP B power plant is provided with equipment for online monitoring of
              particulate; nevertheless measuring equipment is neither calibrated nor
              properly maintained. Monitored values are compared with calculated values.


              No emergency plan to be adopted in case of threshold limits exceeding is
              available.


              The following Table 3.1.4a summarizes the historical available data on main air
              pollutants emissions as reported in Carl Bro EA Report.
              Particulate, SO2 and NOx emissions were measured by INKOS in 1994.

             The reported values are likely a little underestimated and in any case not
             reliable because calculated without any serious cross check with reliable
             measurements.


             The report of the " EAR Contract nr 04KOS01/03/009 Lot 2 Prefeasibility
             Study of pollution mitigation measures at Kosovo B Power Plant reported
             the following remarks about dust emissions:
             During the site visit the continuous measurements showed values of about 510 - 520
             mg/m3 in the control room but the newly installed measuring equipment at Kosovo B
              unit B2 was said not to be calibrated and to be wrongly installed (vibrations).
              The results of the dust emission measurements of unit B1 in October 2005 were 526 -
              577 mg/Nm3 (dry gasses, standard conditions, 6 %O2). The dust emissions from unit
             B2 could not be measured as the unit was being repaired during the measuring period.

             As the electrostatic precipitators of unit B2 has been reconstructed recently it is likely
             that the dust emissions from this unit are at least somewhat lower.

             With the calculated consumption of lignite and air the emissions of dust from Kosovo
             B in the year 2002 Carl Bro Group (2003) calculated the dust emissions as follows:


                                                      Kosovo B
                                           Unit B1      Unit B2      Total
                                             2 218 t     2 109 t     4 327 t
                                         250 mg/m3 250 mg/m3          n/a


             Much lower values were reported by KEK. As the dust emissions of unit B1 were
             measured to be more than double that of the estimated emissions in the table above it
             can be concluded that the total dust emissions of Kosovo B are currently most likely
             significantly higher than the amounts calculated by Carl Bro Group in 2003.
             The annual quantity particulate matter emissions from Kosovo B are significant and
             dust also forms a significant health problem for the workers at the plant.


             Also sulphur dioxide emissions could be higher than those declared (see Carl
             Bro Group and in 2003 EAR Contract nr 04KOS01/03/009) but the presence of
             calcium oxide in the lignite may justify low SO2 values.

3.1.5         Water Supply and Waste Water

              Mines

              Water uses in the mines include the following:
                  · Washing of trucks etc;
                  · Sanitary uses in repair stations.


              Water is supplied by public mains as detailed in the following statements and
              is transported by tank lorries to the repair stations. No water wells are
              reportedly operated by the mines.


              Carl Bro reported an average water consumption amount for the year 2002 of
              about 350,000 m3/y.
              Sanitary waters and water from washing are mixed with mines water and
              through an (mostly) open channel discharged into the Sitnica River without
              any treatment.


              The repair stations are not equipped with oil separators.


              Kosovo A and Kosovo B Power Plants

              Water Supply
              Main water uses in power plants include:
                  · Cooling water make up;
                  · Boiler make up;
                  · Sanitary use;
                  · Washing water;
                  · Water to added to ashes to prevent dust emission;


              ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                      THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                             33

                 · Slurry preparation for ash transportation in TTP B (the ratio between
                      ash and water is 1:1).


             In TPP A water is supplied by Llapi River; in emergency condition (especially
             in dry season) water from TPP A is supplied by Iber Lepenc canal. In TPP B
             water is taken only from Iber Lepenc canal.


             The water for boilers is subjected to the usual treatment procedures (filtration,
             flocculation, decarbonisation and demineralization). The different phases of
             the treatment are currently operated manually, although the system in TTP B
             was originally designed for automatic operation.


             As stated in KEK Environmental Report 2006 water consumption is high;
             while TPP B uses around 2.7 m3/MWh, TPP A water demand may reach up to
             5.3 m3/MWh.


             Since the power plant does not have flow rate measurement system total
             water consumption is not determined and uncertainties remain in the
             determination of real water consumption.


             Assuming valid the above stated data from KEK the average water
             consumptions for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 years , determined on the basis also
             of the electric domestic production (Table 3.1.5a) would have been as shown in
             the following table.

             Based on data concerning average water consumption for same typology of
             plant and also the declared consumption for 2,000 MW of Kosovo C (5,600
             m3/h), it's the Consultant opinion that water consumption is higher than that
             reported in KEK Environmental Report.


             Total water of Kosovo A and Kosovo B as declared by Iber Lepenc
             management is 0.7 m3/s in dry season.


             The Final Report of the study Water supply from the Iber Lepenc hydro system for
             the proposed Kosovo C power plant - (February 2008 ) funded by EAR and
             developed by COWI consortium reports the same figure for the existing TPPs
             water consumptions, and in particular:
                 · 0.20 m3/s for TPPA in dry season (0.08 m3/s the average yearly
                      consumption);
                 · 0.50 m3/s for TPPB (average monthly and yearly value).

              The average annual water consumptions reported in the EAR Water Supply
              study calculated on the basis of these figures are the following:
                  · 2,630,000 m3;
                  · 15,770,000 m3.


              The total water consumption for the existing TPPs as reported in the EAR
              Water Supply study is 18,400,000 m3 that is more than 40% the estimated
              water consumptions at the determined based on KEK data.


              The specific water consumptions based on the data presented in Table 3.1.5a
              are shown in the following Table 3.1.5b .

              For modern plants with evaporative cooling towers water consumption is
              typically below 2.0 m3/MWh and for older rehabilitated plants around 2.5
              m3/MWh.


              The estimation included in EAR Water Supply study will be considered
              reference values for water consumption in the existing power plants.


              A project for the recirculation of water (89%) for TPP B power plant is under
              preparation to try to reduce water consumption. Waste water from blow
              down and water preparation process is sometimes used for the transportation
              of ash and slurry in TPP B.


              Waste Water Discharge
              The main sources of waste water discharge are:

              · Rainwater collected in the drainage systems;
              · Collected waste water from mines, coal yards and power plants;
              · Cooling towers water and boilers blow down (drainage system);
              · Discharge from the demineralisation plants;
              · Sanitary water.


              There are no settlement ponds for waste water from the mines but the water is
              pumped out and discharged into the nearest river.


              In the Bardh mine, there are mine drainage channels to the river Drenica,
              which will need to be prolonged as mining advances. Frequently mine waters
              are used to extinguish fires in the mines.

In the power plants all the waste waters are gathered in a unique sewer
system collecting all the rain and process waste water.


Water from demineralisation plants are sent to open sedimentation and
neutralisation basins, but they are out of date, seem badly maintained and a
part of the waste water, especially at Kosovo A, is conducted to Sinica River
without treatment.


Apart from the quantity of evaporated water from the cooling tower process,
all the wastewater generated in TPP A and TPP B plants, including industrial
effluents, sanitary effluents and rainfall is discharged in Sitnica River without
any treatment.


The discharging system includes 22 discharging points into the main sewage
system and 3 main discharging points into Sitnica River.


The main pollutants in the wastewater are:
    · fuel residuals;
    · ash residuals;
    · oil and chemical residuals;
    · sanitary water.


These residuals contain salts and trace metals which can be harmful for
humans and ecosystem.


Wastewater discharges from the power plants are monitored by INKOS
through 17 surface water and 5 underground water monitoring points (5
piezometers, installed around the ash dump at TPP B to monitor groundwater
quality). Results of wastewater monitoring are included in KEK monthly
environmental report.


Permanent monitoring of upstream and downstream flows of Sitnica River is
not routinely implemented. Furthermore monitoring program appears
insufficient in terms of monitoring points, frequencies and investigated
parameters (heavy and rare metals are not included).

              period January-June 2007, as reported in KEK report.


              Beside surface water (discharge and rivers) Table 3.5.1b reports also chemical
              analysis of underground water (Pa,Pb,Pc and Pd points). The results show a
              particularly polluted ground water (concentration of some parameters is
              higher than Former Yugoslavian limits set for discharge water).


              Table 3.5.1c contains also discharge limits established by Former Yugoslavia
              for the different classes of rivers1. Based on the analysis results Sitnica River is
              probably classified in IV Class. Some parameters of the river water quality
              exceed also the discharge limits (suspended solids, KMnO4 etc).               ,


              With reference to presence of heavy metals in Sitnica River, Poyry study

limits of World Bank up to 8-fold, and the EU limits up to 40-fold. The value for Cd
exceeds the proposed EU limit at least 6-fold, supposing a high hardness of water (>
200 mg CaCO3/l) even 18-fold.


According to KEK report : From the analysis it results that the key parameters
which exceed maximum allowed values1 are the pH values, suspended matters and use
of KMnO4. The main sources of exceeding of these values are in effluents of the ash
deposit, waters from the gasification area, and the technological waters of TPP A and
B. Still, even in recipients there are often very high values, especially near the
discharge of waste waters, such as Fushe-Kosova, Kastrioti, etc.


It seems that only limited measures to reduce the infiltration are taken and
overall the problem seems of minor importance for the management of KEK.




1 As standards, the INKOS has used the maximum value parameters, allowed by water category, namely four
categories. Exceeded values have been recorded when these values have exceeded the values for III category of waters.

3.1.6         Mine and Ash Dump Water

              The Bardh and Mirash mine waters have ground and surface water origin
              dominated by groundwater since lignite exploitation is made below the level
              of Drenica and Sitnica rivers. The drained waters of this mine are discharged
              into the Drenica River, while this water is often used for fighting local fires in
              mines.


              Natural ponds are being used for collection of mine water and the water is
              pumped via channels to the water recipient (Drenica and Sitnica River). The
              mine water outfall into the Drenica River is presented in Figure 3.1.6a.

              Water quality is monitored by INKOS and data is made available on a
              monthly basis. A few piezometers have been installed around the ash dump at
              TPP B to monitor groundwater quality (see Figure 3.1.5a and Table 3.1.5b). It
              was stated that data is available for the Sibovc area. During the site visit it was
              noted that surface water does not seem to be a significant issue in terms of
              runoff, although this might change in the winter months.

              The following data is taken from KEK 2006. The surface water quality in mines
              is characterized by high mineralization of sulphates due to gypsum
              dissolution and sulphate mineralization by pyrite oxidation. Due to the high
              concentration of carbonates, pH values remain at neutral levels. The following
              Table 3.1.6a shows parameters of mine waters and rivers, which receive mine
              draining waters.

             The Drenica River shows a lower sulphate concentration after going through
             the Bardh mine. This might have been true in the cases of sample-taking,
             when there are no water discharges from the mine into the river. The high pH
             values of river waters show that there is pollution by organic waste waters.


             The sulphate content in mine waters is around 2,000 mg/l. Sulphates may not
             be reduced by simple or cheap technical methods. Hence it is important for
             the mine water discharge extent to not exceed 10% of the individual water
             flow volume of the river itself. Suspended substances in the mine waters show
             high values of around 400 mg/l (according to EU guideline on fish water the
             allowed amount is up to 25 mg/l).


             Data on mine drainage water from the Mirash mine is presented in STEAG
             2006 (see also Figure 3.1.6b following). It has to be taken into consideration that
             the sampling point does not always represent the quality of pumped mine
             water since dilution by rainwater might have influenced the sample.


             The concentrations indicate a potential need for mine water treatment
             depending on the quantity of mine water discharge and the quality and
             quantity of the receiving stream. Minimum standard would be to install
             settling ponds to reduce the load of suspended solids and coal particulate
             (STEAG 2006). Natural ponds are being used for this and a drainage system
             exists.


             So far no limit values have been stipulated by the agencies for discharge of
             mine water into the rivers1.




             (1) World Bank Environment, Health and Safety Guidelines for Mining and Milling ­ Open Pit, contain threshold for
                1

             mine water to be discharged into rivers, however the parameters are different (e.g heavy metals)

3.1.7         Waste Management

              Mines

              No inventory of waste generated exists.


              Reported waste includes:
                  · Ash from power plants;
                  · Solid waste from offices and repair stations;
                  · Spent oil;
                  · Spent batteries;
                  · Urban waste.


              Waste Streams
                  · Solid waste is collected by the Company cleaning staff and disposed off
                       in waste containers which are being emptied by the municipal waste
                       collection and disposal services.
                  · Hazardous Waste
                            o Spent oil (motor, hydraulic, trafo) is stored mainly in barrels.
                               Annual amounts are in the range of 22,000 l.
                            o Spent batteries. Reportedly there are no spent batteries.



              Kosovo A and Kosovo B Power Plants

              Waste from both the power plants is managed by a special division within
              Central Maintenance Department.




              ERM ­ ELC - CSA                                 THE WORLD BANK ­ LPTAP ESSAS ­ DRAFT FINAL SESA
                                                       43

             The main sources of solid waste are:
                 · Combustion residuals (ashes);
                 · Worn out equipment and materials;
                 · Residuals from water treatment;
                 · Spent machineries oil.


             Waste inventory included 32 waste typologies; ashes are far the biggest
             problem in terms of quantities.


             Bottom Ash and Fly Ash
             Residuals from combustion are bottom ash and fly ash from electrostatic
             precipitators.


             As reported in KEK Environmental Report 2006 the current rate of non-
             combustive materials in lignite is around 30% of the combusted lignite.


             TTP B fly ash is now hydraulically transported as a suspension of water and
             ash to the ash landfill where it is discharged in the residual hole of the former
             Mirash-East mine. Bottom ash is transported to the landfill with trucks and
             conveyors.


             As described in the previous Section 2.3.2 TTP A ashes are transported to the
             existing ash landfill by means of belt conveyors after humidification.


             Amounts of ash production from TPP A and TPP B in the period 2005-2006 are
             presented on the following Table 3.1.7a (from KEK report).

             Methods used to determine these quantities are not reported and exact
             quantity of ash is not really known.


             A typical complete Chemical analysis of ash (slug and fly ashes) is reported in
             Table 39 of KEK Report.
             Leaching ability (amount leaching from the ash when in contact with water) of
             some trace elements and salts is reported in Poyry study. Salts are reaction
             products from metals with acids. The data are reported in Table 3.1.7b.

             In summary bottom and fly ash have until now been disposed off in the
             easiest and cheapest way without attention to environmental concerns. Only
             recently ashes from Kosovo B have been hydraulically transported to
             exhausted mine of Mirash-East.


             As previously outlined two disposal sites for bottom and fly ash were used
             located just outside TTP B and TTP A sites where heaps formed by ash creates
             a visually very dominant element in the landscape.


             The ash landfills exceeded the originally intended volume determining also
             problems of stability in both the landfills.


             The originally designed maximum height of the landfill for TPP B was
             15 meters, but today the height of the landfill is at least about 30 - 40 meters.


             The areas occupied by ash landfill are approximately 240 ha for TTP A
             (including overburden) and 55 - 60 ha for TPP B.


             Both the landfills were used to dispose of other solid and liquid waste. As
             outlined in the previous Section 2.4.5 in the TTP A landfill also exhausted oil
             pond and phenol ponds were identified.


             In case the landfills will remain in the current location, intervention should be
             realised in the future to secure their physical stability.


             Waste Metals
             Waste metals are the only waste separately collected and sold to METALKOS;
             the total amount of scraps removed by the firm in 2006 was around 975,198 t.


             Hazardous Waste or Potentially Hazardous Waste
             Transformers oil, batteries, cables, insulation, chemicals and chemicals packaging are
             stored in special areas and disposed off without any formal procedure. The
             status of transformers at the Kosova A&B TPP's are not yet being defined.
             Specific procedures for waste transportation and disposal are still under
             preparation.

         Waste oil and chemical residuals are reported to be recycled according to the
         producer's instructions. Waste oils are stored outdoors in barrels in several
         places without formal procedures. Some of the barrels have no lid or cover
         thus enabling overflowing due to filling with rainwater. The barrels are
         mostly stored on bare soil with no water or oil containment structures.


         Waste oils are sold but final addressee and purposes are not clear.


         Solid waste (non metals similar to urban waste) is collected in containers and
         disposed off by the municipal waste services company.

         Sludge from water treatment plant is highly contaminated with salts and trace
         elements. Currently the residuals are temporary stored in an underground
         tank and disposed in the ash disposal.


         No detailed information is provided on waste management in the past, also
         because the environmental department has been recently established.

3.1.8    Oil, Fuel and Chemicals Management

         Mines

         Lubricants and Oils
         Available data indicates a total volume of about 22,000 l of oil (motor,
         hydraulic, trafo) consumed annually.


         Oil storage was seen at the main workshop facilities in approximately 10
         drums (200 l).


         Fuel
         Diesel fuel is stored in three Underground Storage Tanks USTs which
         reportedly have a capacity of 2 x 50 tons each and 30 tons.


         No integrity test was performed at the tanks in the past.


         In direct vicinity to the Petrol station there is an abandoned installation with
         two USTs (approx 20 and 12 tons).

         Oil storage area in TPP B site is reported but details are not provided.


         Fuel
         The main fuel for both Kosova A and B power plants is lignite. Lignite is
         processed in two different locations of TPP A and TPP B sites.

             Light oil (TPP A) and heavy fuel oil (TPP B) are used for start-up only.
             These fuels are stored in above soil tanks fitted with a containment basins
             whose condition s seemed very bad during the site visit.


             Chemicals
             Reportedly power plants use small amounts of chemicals potentially
             hazardous. They are mainly used for chemical treatment of water and its
             clean-up.
             Ammonia hydroxide and hydrazine are used in water-steam systems. to
             eliminate oxygen and regulate pH.
             The yearly use of chemicals is presented in the following table.

             As reported during the site visit chemicals are stored in dedicated areas.

3.1.9        PCBs

             Mines

             PCB is in principle not contained in equipment. In Mine (separation plant of
             Kosova B) there is just one transformer containing PCB (oil capacity 1.040 t).

          Kosovo A and Kosovo B power plants

          KEK Environmental Report mentions 5 PCBs containing transformers out of
          operation, and 14 PCBs containing transformers still function in TPP B site.
          These PCBs containing transformers should be removed and properly
          disposed off in near future.


          Larger quantities of PCBs containing transformers were used in the past have
          been dismantled and were probably disposed in a not specified area of TPP B
          site.


          Since there is no special care of waste oils discarded into drums without
          specific labels there is no labelling of oil, which may or may not contain PCB.
          Procedures or instructions for waste oil control do not exists or are not
          implemented.

3.1.10    Asbestos

          Mines

          Reportedly no asbestos is present in the mining area and none was identified
          during the site visit.

          Kosovo A and Kosovo B power plants

          Asbestos or asbestos containing materials are not used at TPP B.
          As reported in Carl Bro EA study at the time TPP A was erected it was
          common to use asbestos but a lot of this was replaced prior to the conflict.


          Removed asbestos was reportedly disposed in ash disposal site under ash and
          slag level.

3.1.11    Noise

          Mines

          Noise sources in the mines are mainly vehicles and various working
          equipment.


          One complaint was reported, which has been filed by the population of
          Grabovc for noise (most likely caused by conveyor belts) and dust emissions
          by the operation of the mine.


          Reportedly measurements performed revealed exceedance of noise limit
          values by approx 10 dBA for night time. An earth dam is planned as
          mitigation measure to reduce noise levels.

4      CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS




       Environmental situation in the area is very complex for a number of different
       reasons. First of all the environmental setting has been deeply influenced by
       historical mining activities with particular regard to geology, hydrogeology
       and hydrology modifications occurred. This aspect makes very complicated
       any identification of environmental impact with specific regard to soil and
       groundwater aspects. As a consequence further monitoring activity is
       necessary in this field.

4.1    HIGH PRIORITY ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

       The existing environmental issues that in the Consultant's opinion should be
       addressed with the highest priority are the ones related to the following:


           · Ashes landfill remediation. A comprehensive monitoring campaign has
                to be set up and feasibility studies have to be completed in order to
                find solution to danger to underground and surface water posed by
                the existing ash landfills. The ashes contain salts and trace metals of
                which some quantities, when in contact with water, sooner or later will
                be released. Ash spreading from ash landfills due to winds is a
                significant environmental problem since sprinkler system is not
                installed at the ash landfill to prevent wind erosion. In situations with
                dry air and windy weather episodic air pollution with ash particles
                occurs. Stabilisation, covering with soil and vegetation are the
                alternatives to ashes relocation.
           · Contaminated sites with Phenol and other organic contaminants have to
                be reclaimed after the conclusion of the ongoing monitoring activity
                through the implementation of a project for removal of phenols and
                water phenols from the gasification plant
           · Air emission reduction. Both the existing power plants are emitting dust,
                nitrogen oxide well above standard limits posing serious threat to
                population health. It is Consultant's opinion that TPP A is too old and
                in bad conditions to be put in compliance with western standards at
                reasonable time and costs. Maybe an attempt could be performed to
                install new electrostatic precipitators. TPP B could be fitted with
                proper electrostatic separator and NOx abatement systems such as low
                nox burner or ammonia injection. A feasibility study has to be set up to
                identify cost and time to allow TPP B to be complaint with western air
                emissions standards. Of course both the power plants must be fitted
                with emission monitoring devices as soon as possible
           · Water management. Recycle of waste water is recommended. Sewage
                system has to be improved to separate process water from rain water.
                Rain water has to be collected and used to reduce consumption as
                process water (make up of cooling towers). A waste water treatment

                      plant has to be build to reduce environmental pressure over the Sitnica
                      River.
                · Waste management: A waste management plan must be prepared and
                      implemented. Utilisation of fly ash and bottom ash (ex in Cementeryor
                      to construct roads) should be explored.
                · Measurement of workplace concentrations at mine with respect to particulate
                      matter (coal dust) and emissions from lignite fires
                          o Provide adequate protective equipment for the mine workers
                              based on the above mentioned measurements.
                          o Provide septic tanks for the sanitary waters


           In the following table an attempt is given to summarise the high priority
           environmental issues and to provide a rough cost estimation of actions to be
           undertaken to remediate or clean-up the damages or to prevent them.

4.2    ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

       As described above an environmental management has been appointed and
       the structure has been recently set-up. It is now essential that this unit gets the
       support and resources needed to work efficiently.

4.3    UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS

       The underground storage tanks used to store diesel should be surveyed as to
       their real age and properly tested for integrity. A replacement program with
       double layer tanks should be evaluated.


4.4    AIR EMISSIONS

       An air emission monitoring and air quality program should be established to
       control ambient air quality in the mines and especially at the mine working
       places

4.5    LANDFILL

       It is recommended to compile information about the Municipal Landfill of
       Pristina located in the north-eastern corner of Mirash East Mine. Following
       topics should be clarified
            · How and with which obligations was the landfill permitted;
            · What kind of base sealing is existent;
            · Which monitoring is conducted;
            · Which kind of contract and obligations with the KEK are existing.

4.6    HEALTH AND SAFETY AND FIRE PROTECTION ISSUES

       A budget should be set aside to allow for proper provision of personnel
       protective equipment to the workers engaged


       A thorough survey of all issues related to H&S should be made by the H&S
       Manager and a list of budgeted priorities should be made and presented to the
       Company's Management so that implementation of criticalities may be
       included in the budget of the overhauling project.

INTRODUCTION

Introductory note: This Draft SDP document was prepared by a consortium
led by ERM (Italy) and supported by ELC Electroconsult and CSA Group Ltd
under the World Bank funded project "Environmental and Social Safeguards
Services for Private Sector Participation in the Development of new generation
capacity, related transmission and the development of the Sibovc Lignite
Field" which was commissioned by the Kosovo Lignite Power Technical
Assistance Project (LPTAP) under the Ministry of Energy and Mining of
Kosovo (MEM). The Draft SDP is interlinked with the Strategic Environmental
& Social Assessment (SESA) for the power generation and mining
development which was prepared in parallel by the above ERM consortium
under the same World Bank funded project for LPTAP

Sibovc Development Plan Context

Kosovo's electricity production today depends on the aging Kosova A and the
Kosovo B thermal power plants (TPP) which are fuelled by lignite from the
Bardh and Mirash mines west of Pristina. These lignite mines will be
exhausted by 2011.

The Kosovo Energy Strategy, set up by the Ministry of Energy and Mining
(MEM) in 2005, is recognizing that in the long term, lignite will remain the
principal fuel for electricity generation for Kosovo. The strategy demands that
this indigenous resource should be utilized in an environmentally and
economically responsible manner and further that land previously disturbed
by mining and lignite based power generation should be reclaimed.

The key element of Kosovo's future energy production is the further -
development of the present open cast lignite mining and energy production in
the western periphery of Pristina through the construction of the new high
efficiency Kosovo C lignite-fired TPP with up to 2100 MW installed capacity.
The Kosovo B TPP is envisaged to be operated until 2030 and operation of
Kosovo A TPP will be until 2017.

To feed the future power generation, an associated new 16 square kilometer
sized lignite mine will be opened in the Sibovc mining field located adjacent to
the north of the existing Bardh and Mirash mines. The new Sibovc mine will
be developed over the next 4 ­ 5 decades.

The implementation of this power sector development will be undertaken
with the participation of the private sector; i.e. the construction and operation
of the new Kosovo C power plant and the development of the new Sibovc
mining field will be undertaken by an international Investor (Project
Company) based on long term concession agreements for mining and energy
production which will be granted by the Government of Kosovo. These
contracts are anticipated to be concluded by 2009. Before however, a number
of decisions will need to be made by the Government of Kosovo though the

negotiations with the Investor. A key spatial planning relevant decision is the
siting of the new Kosovo C TPP. The Strategic Environmental & Social
Assessment (SESA), which was undertaken in parallel to the drafting of this
SDP, investigated the environmental and social consequences of different
scenarios for the development of Kosovo C TPP.

Further, the interfacing arrangements of the responsibilities of the private
Project Company with the future operations of the Kosovo A and Kosovo B
power plants and closure including closure and recultivation of the associated
Bardh and Mirash lignite mines, which are presently all under the
responsibility of the Kosovo Energy Corporation (KEK), are subject to further
decision by the Government of Kosovo.


Purpose of the Draft SDP

The power generation and mining developments as outlined above will
result in substantial changes and transformations of the spatial structure
and land use in the affected area and communities.

While the new Kosovo C power plants will be built within few years
time, the Sibovc mine development will be a long-term process which
will gradually take place over the next 4 ­ 5 decades. Various activities
changing the present land use and the landscape will happen in
parallel. Besides the future activities in power generation and mining,
also reclamation of lands disturbed from the previous activities will be
carried out over the next decade which offers new opportunities for the
use of land.

In this context the Draft SDP is a proposal developed under the LPTAP for a
planning document which sets out the future spatial development under the
above setting. The overall purpose of this Draft SDP is to:

· To describe the spatial implications of the development of Kosovo C and
    the new Sibovc mine;

· To set the spatial planning cornerstones and framework for the activities of
    the private sector Investor who will develop Kosovo C TPP and the Sibovc
    mine through a Project Company

· To propose the spatial planning measures to handle the consequences in
    an environmentally and socially acceptable manner; and finally

· To provide guidance to the affected municipalities for their local spatial
    planning.

Limitations and Level of Planning Detail

This Draft SDP provides an overview of the ongoing and future activities
which are likely to happen in the SDP area of interest based on the present
stage of power and mining project preparations under the LPTAP.

It must be noted that at this stage, the description of the spatial development
dimensions and delineation of future land use zones is limited to conceptual
outline level, since important spatial determinants such as final location of the
Kosovo C TPP, its technology, sizing installed capacity phasing concept (i.e.
fast or staged), - which will determine lignite demand and thus the pace of
mining advance in the Sibovc field and the resulting land claim, are not yet
decided and subject to negotiations between the Government of Kosovo and
the future private Investor. Further, there are ongoing studies under LPTAP
about the feasible future land use of the outside overburden dumps and the
ash dumps which all are under the ownership of KEK and decisions will need
to be made how KEK proceeds with this land.

In general, the level of detail and spatial planning perspectives provided in
this Draft SDP is more detailed for the near and mid-term future while limited
to a conceptual outlook level for the long term where potential developments
can only be sketched. With respect to the Sibovc mine development, a main
mining plan was developed in 2005 by VEM/DMT (further referred to as
MMP 2005). Even though the underlying assumptions about the Kosovo C
TPP have changed and time scales of the claim of land for the mining have
changed, this plan still provides a good picture of the mine development and
is used as the presently best available source for this Draft SDP.

Moreover, large portions of land outside the present mines in the ownership
of KEK are covered by overburden dumps and the Kosovo A and B ash
dumps. Studies on future use of these areas are presently ongoing under the
LPTAP activities.

Legal Framework and Status of the SDP

According to the Kosovo legal spatial planning framework, spatial
transformations caused by lignite mining and energy generation projects shall
be regulated in Spatial Plans for Special Areas.

As per Law on Spatial Planning of Kosovo (Law No. 2003/14), Article 12, Spatial
Plans for Special Areas shall be set-up for zones identified in the Spatial Plan of
Kosovo that require a particular regime for organisation, development, use and
protection. The Spatial Plan of Kosovo defines area categories where a special
development regime should be in place as Zones of Special Interest for Kosova -
such as for lignite open mining and energy generation.

Article 12 of the Law on Spatial Planning further prescribes the process for
such a plan to become binding. Spatial plans for special areas are formally set-
up by the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP). Prior to

finalization of the plan, the MESP shall make the draft plan available to the
public the other governmental institutions and the affected municipalities for
review and comment at least for 60 days. Principles for public review and
participation are set out in Article 19 of the Law on Spatial Planning. This is
further specified in the Administrative Instruction 54/2005 (Protocol 15/05)
Administrative Instruction for Implementing the Spatial Planning Law on the
Procedure of Public Discussions for Spatial and Urban Plans. After the Draft is
finalized, - which includes the results of the consultations, Spatial Plans for
Special Areas are submitted by the MESP to the Government for preliminary
approval and become legally binding by approval through the Assembly of
Kosovo. Approved spatial plans for special areas are published in the Official
Gazette of Kosovo.

Once approved, the spatial plan for a special area must be taken into account
by spatial planning on municipal and local level and restrictions set-out in the
in the superior plan apply to the local development.      1

Note: The present document does not constitute a formal spatial plan for a special
area, but is the input and proposal of the MEM/Lignite Power Technical Assistance
Project (LPTAP) for setting up such a plan as a formalized SDP through the MESP.
This Draft SDP will be presented and coordinated with the MESP for further
processing along the prescribed legal path of spatial planning given in the Law on
Spatial Planning as described above.


Also under LPTAP's Environmental and Social Safeguards Services assignment,
this Draft SDP will be presented together with the Final SESA to the public in
the villages affected by the future power and mining development.


Interest Area of the Draft SDP

Determining Elements and Factors for the study and interest zone of the SDP
are the primary environmental impact of planned and existing activities:

· Footprint (land claim outline) of the new Sibovc mine (approximately
    16 km²);

· Sites of the existing Kosovo A and B TPPs and the new Kosovo C power
    plant;

· Corridors for conveyor belts and infrastructure;

· Present mines;

Contents and Structure of the Draft SDP

The "Administrative Instruction for Implementing the Spatial Planning Law on
Essential Element Contents For Special Areas of Spatial Planning" No.43 issued by
the MESP (Protocol 04/05) sets out the structure of a special area development
plan. The document at hand follows this structure.
       2


The SDP consists of a text and maps and graphics which show the present
situation, the spatial consequences and changes and caused by the Kosovo C
energy production and mining development and the envisaged status of lands
after recultivation of the mines.

The remainder of this Draft SDP Report is structured as follows:

     · Section 1 presents a spatial profile of SDP interest zone and
          describes the existing situation;
     · Section 2 presents the suggested vision, principals and targets of
          the SDP;
     · Section 3 presents the proposed plan for spatial development of
          the planning area;
     · Section 4 presents the suggested strategy and activities for
          implementation of the SDP, and
     · Section 5 proposes instruction for implementing the SDP.




2Further, as per Article 8 of the of the Environmental Protection Law (Law No. 2002/8,
which entered info force through Regulation No. 2003/9), Kosovo spatial plans,
regional spatial plans, municipal spatial plans, plans for the management of natural
resources, development plans and programs and other spatial planning and adjustment
acts, as defined by law, which affect the environment, must include an assessment of
planned activities and their impact on the environment and a detailed assessment of the
potential positive economic impact of such planned activities. The assessment of
planned activities shall include an analysis of the present state of potential impacts that
the proposed activities and proposed mitigation activities have on the environment and
economic development. Before they are adopted, Kosovo spatial plans, regional spatial
plans, municipal spatial plans, plans for the management of natural resources,
development plans and programs and other spatial planning and adjustment acts shall
be presented for assessment to the Kosovo Environment Protection Agency (KEPA ).

1.1.1       Geographic Situation


            General orientation

            The SDP area of interest is located in the western periphery of Pristina,
            starting about 3 km from the Pristina city limit. Kastriot (Obilic) town is the
            present geographical centre of power generation with Kosovo A TPP to the
            south and Kosovo B TPP to the north of the town. The area of interest is
            bordered by the wooded Çiçavica mountain range and the Drenica River in the
           West and the Sitnica River and its floodplain in the East. The southern edge is
           marked by the disturbed lands of the Mirash and Bardh open mine pits and
           overburden dumps, whereas to the North agricultural lands extend.

           Topography

           The Kosovo A and B TPPs are located in a flat area of the Sitnica plain. Each
           TPP has a large ash dump, which are significant landscape features. While the
           Kosovo B ash dump is consolidated, the tip of the still feed Kosovo A ash
           dump is growing towards south and is source of visible dust blow off.

           The future Sibovc mining field is predominantly used for agriculture. The
           present topography consists of a hilly terrain with elevation from typically 570
           to 670 masl. Characteristic landmarks are the N-S stretched hill with the
           village of Hade in the south (elevation up to 656 masl.) and a series of hills
           extending between Lajthishtë and Shipitullë (elevation up to 666 masl.).
           Between the hills valleys are following N-S directions (in the east reaching
           down to 570 masl. and in the west down to 550 masl.) to the village of Hade.
           Sibovc stream in the north is flowing in SW-NE directions and the valley is at
           elevations of about +560 masl. The present mines pits are up to xxx metres
           deep.


           Administrative setting

           The present mine pits and outside overburden dumps to the south are partly located
           on the territory of Obiliq and partly on Fushe Kosova municipalities; the south-west
           most outside overburden dump Vasilev is located on the territory of Drenas
           municipality Both, present Kosovo A and B TPPs, are located in Obiliq Municipality.

           The development of the new Kosovo C power plant and the new Sibovc lignite mine
           will affect mainly Obiliq municipality; the new Sibovc Mine will cover
           approximately 13% of the territory of the Obiliq Municipality. The start area for the
           Sibovc mining field in the south-west is on Fushe Kosova municipality land near
           Grabovc. In the long term (i.e. after about 30 ­ 40 years), the Sibovc mine in its
           northern extend will also reach the territory of Vushrii municipality east of Zilivoda.

           The new mine will completely transform the present topography. Sibovc village,

All other settlements in the area are mainly rural villages in character.

The settlements located in the new Sibovc mining field will be directly
affected, since they have to be relocated; these are:

· Hade,

· Lajthishtë,

· Sibovc, a dispersed settlements composed of different Mahalas (mah.)3 and

· Shipitullë East mah. [name unclear, acc. old map it could be Laze ?]



Depending on the location of the new Kosovo C TPP, Kastriot and different
villages will be located in the direct vicinity of the new power plant:

· Kosovo C next to Kosovo A TPP would be located xx metres north of
     Dardhishte and yyy metres south of Kastriot. The present Kosovo A
     ashdump is located east of Dardhiste in close vicinity to houses.

· Kosovo C next to Kosovo A TPP would be located xxx metres to the north-
     west of Kastriot and xxx metres to the southeast of Plementin. The
     Kosovo B ashdump is located in the Sitniza plain between Plementin and
     Kastriot.



The above villages can be briefly characterized as follows:

Hade (pop. approx. 2,500) is located on top of the steep slope of the northern
edge of the Bardh/ Mirash mine. The present day Hade is the remaining part
after the part south of the Palaj ­ Grabovc road was subject to emergency
evacuation in 2004 due to slope failure risks caused by the mining activities. A
total of 158 families (664 individuals) from the village were resettled between
2004 and 2005. There are 495 families remaining to be resettled before the
planned mining extension into the Sibovc field can start.

Shipitullë (East) mahala [name unclear? Laze mah. ? pop ?] is small outside part
Shipitulle village and located within the future mining field. The main village
of Shipitulle is located outside the western mining boundary at the foot of the
Çiçavica Mountains.

           Lajthishtë(pop. approx. 600) is located in the eastern corner of the future
           mining area where the mining boundary turns towards north-east (as
           bounded by the Iber water channel). The village consists of approximately 85
           houses.

           Sibovc (pop. xxx) is a dispersed settlement which comprises 9 mahalas:
           Bregovinska, Barbatoska, Muhicku, Spasina, Midanska, Nicak, Kelmendi,
           Megjuani and Curilo.4 Bregovinska and Barbatoska form the village centre;
          Muhicku, Spasina and Michanska to the south are situated in the centre of the
          Sibovc mining field. The Nicak mah. is located outside the western mining
          boundary, at the foot of the Ciqavica Mountains.

          Dardhistë

           Dardhiste Village (pop. xx) is located downwind of the Kosovo A TPP and is
           exposed to heavy pollution (air, groundwater, noise) resulting from the power
           plant emissions and in particular dust flow of from the active tip of the
           Kosovo A ash dump. Further is close to the active mining area and the
           conveyor belt system.

          Plementin village (pop.) is located north-west of Kastriot on the Mitrovica
          road. [...]


1.1.2.2   Use of land for agricultural production

          Agriculture is the dominating land use in the future Sibovc mining area
          (primarily wheat, corn). The area is largely made of fertile land; the soil
          properties of the prevailing clay rich vertisols however sometimes become
          unfavourable since they tend to dry out and develop vertical cracking in
          summer. The present use of fertilizer and agrochemicals is low due to cost and
          many fields are left fallow.

          Forests and woods are rare, covering only a few hectares in the northwest and
          the east of the future mining area.


1.1.2.3   Commercial and Industrial land/zones

          The sites of Kosovo A and Kosovo B TPPs are the only significant industrial
          sites in the area.




           4Before the war, there was a mahala with Serbian population which does not exist any more.

           The gasification and fertilizer plants next to Kosovo A TPP were abandoned
           more than a decade ago and today present an environmental legacy issue due
           to contamination with mainly phenols and other substances.

           KEK has workshops and presently is building a new maintenance facility for
           large mining equipment at the edge of the Mirash mine near Dardhiste.

           In the northwest of the Sibovc mining field (around Sibovc and Zhilivode)
           some artisanal lignite mining takes place.


1.1.2.4    Natural and environmental assets

           In the future mining field only a few natural heritage objects of note are
           reported5:

         · A spring in the centre of Palaj village;

           · A single linden tree (Tilia spec.), about 200 years old, in Nicak mah.
               (Sibovc), and

           · A group of oak trees (3x Quercus spec., 1x Quercus cerris), up to 300 years
               old, in Megjuaneve mah. (Sibovc).


1.1.2.5    Cultural and historical assets

           Except for the Mosque in Hade and the Monument of KLA Martyrs, there is no
           cultural heritage of note directly affected by the mining and power
           development.

1.1.3.2    Water

           The Sibovc mining field is bounded by the Iber water canal. The mining field
           itself covers six catchment areas of smaller watercourses; four of them flowing
           towards the Sitnica River in the east and two towards the Drenica River in the
           west.

           Along the Sitnica river a floodplain extends in which the site of Kosovo B TPP

1.1.4      Socio-economic aspect


1.1.4.1    Economic activities

           The SDP area is characterized by rural agricultural and forestry activities
           around the villages on one side and activities in the mining and power sector
           on the other side. Kastriot as the administrative centre of the Obiliq
           municipality is also the local centre for trade and services.

           In the SDP area, agriculture was traditionally run by extended families and
           used to be the main economic activity outside of the mining and power sector.
           Approximately 60 % of the population living in the region are farmers
           growing wheat and corn. Wheat harvesting and milling for Kosovo Albanian
           farmers is arranged on a co-operative basis, while Kosovo Serb farmers make
           individual arrangements. There are no significant lifestock holdings, other
           than a small-to-medium scale sheep and pig farm in the Janjina Voda
           village.[according to OECD Obiliq municipality report]

           Land ownership varies between settlements, but the majority of residents own
           the land they inhabit and a yard area used for subsistence farming. However,
           the economic importance of agriculture is decreasing. Today many
           agricultural fields are left fallow and food self supply is in the foreground.

           Mining and power generation are the key industries in the area. Gasification
           and fertilizer plant next to Kosovo A were closed down more than a decade
           ago. At Kosovo A TPP also a coal drying facility is operated for selling lignite
           to third parties. The activities of KEK (about 3,000 employees) provide

           [will be added in from approved Draft Final SESA]


1.1.5      Socio-demography


1.1.5.1    Population,

           The largest population concentration in the study area is in Kastriot (Obilic)
           town; the population is about 5700 [check]. Accurate figures on gender, ethnic
           structure and age of the the population is not available since no population
           census has been made since 1981. . The population in the area is generally very
           young with the average age being approximately 24. Information gathered
           from the ten settlements surveyed for the SESA shows that 32% of the
           population are aged between 26-45 and 14% are between 19-25 and 46-60
           respectively. There is an even split between men and women and just under
           half the population (42.5%) is married.

           Although the majority of the population in the area is Kosovo Albanian,
           villages such as Babin Most/Babimoc, Milosevo/Milloshevë,
           Plemetin/Plemetina and Caravodicë/Crkvena Vodica are mostly inhabited by
           Kosovo Serbs and other non-Albanian ethnic minorities. Obiliq town was also
           a multi-ethnic area , however after the March 2005 incidents, all remaining
           Kosovo Serbs and some Roma fled the town and sought refuge in
           Plemetin/Plemetina and other villages inhabited mostly by Kosovo Serbs.

           Like in many parts of Kosovo, also in the area of interest the phenomenon of
           rural depopulation is prevalent. Economic and social circumstances have
           resulted in a population movement towards urban areas, transforming daily
           and weekly commuters into permanent migrants. The migration from the
           rural areas has impacted rural areas as the young and educated labour force
           move into towns abandoning agricultural land and causing a decline in the
           number of marriages and births. Urban areas have also been affected as
           immigration has increased property prices, raised the cost of living and lead to
           unplanned and uncontrolled expansion of towns and cities. . In the area of
           interest, the phenomena that village population moves to town for better work
           opportunities is specifically accentuated in settlements at greater distances
           from Obiliq town.

1.1.6      Infrastructure and transport


1.1.6.1    Road network

           Road transport to/from Kastriot is developed through the main road M2
           Prishtina-Mitrovica, and along regional roads (asphalted) and local roads
           (mainly not asphalted).

           The main regional road in relation to the future mining area is the Obiliq ­
           Palaj ­ Sibovc road (length of 4.7 km) where asphalting was completed in 2004
           The regional road from Obiliq via Palaj and Hade to Graboc is cut due to the
           mining activities on the northern rim of the Bardh mine.



           The roads from Kastriot to Dardhiste, and from Kastriot to Palaj to hade and
           Grabovc, and Graboc to Bardh i Madh are frequently used by KEK with
           trucks.


1.1.6.2    Railways.

           Two railway lines are passing through the SDP Interest area. One is the Skopje
           - Fushe-Kosova ­ Mitrovica line with stops in Dardhishta, Obiliq and
           Plemetin, and the second is the Fushe-Kosova ­ Peja line, with a railway stop
           in Graboc.

           The Kosova A and Kosovo B power plants are connected to the rail network.


1.1.6.3    Public Transport

           Public transport in Obiliq municipality is based on bus and mini-vans.
           However not all villages are serviced. The settlements with access to public
           transport are: Obiliq (New and Old Obiliq), Palaj, Hade, Lajthishtë, Sibovc,
           Hamidi, Muzakaj, Raskovë, Bakshi, Llazarevë, Breznicë, Kozaricë, Shkabaj.
           Settlements without access to public transport are: Mazgit I, Mazgit II,
           Dradhishtë, Shipitullë, Grabovc, Plemetin, Bajmoc. [SpA-Obilic]

           However, in the western part of the area if interest, in several settlements
           water supply is from local ground water sources (wells). "Prishtina" Water
           Supply and municipal water supply systems provide water supply to 13
           settlements, or 65% of settlements. Still, despite coverage of water supply
           network in 13 settlements, the population of these settlements is not fully
           supplied water by these systems. According to information from the
           municipality, 60% of the population is provided with water from these
           systems. The water quality is good in these settlements. The municipal water
           supply system has a capacity of 42 l/sec. the supply amount, despite
           restrictions, is at a satisfactory level. The most frequent reductions occur
           during the summer season. One of the concerns is the water supply network
           in the city, due to its age, and there is a permanent potential of potable water
           contamination.

           Following settlements in the area of interest are supplied from the Prishtina
           regional public water supply system : Obiliq, Mazgit 1, Mazgit 2, Dardhishtë,
           Palaj, Hade, Lajthishtë, Plemetin, Muzakaj, Raskovë, Bashki, Llazarevë, and
           Shkabaj.

           The water supply by groundwater wells is used in 7 settlements, or 35% of
           municipal settlements. The ground water sources generally are of a good
           quality and minimal standards for drinking water, with the exception of the
           settlements close to KEK facilities, such as Hade, Lajthishtë and Hamidi.

           Settlements using supply from ground water wells are: Shipitullë, Grabovc,
           Sibovc, Hamidi, Kozaricë, Bajmoc dhe Breznicë.

           Electricity supply is provided by KEK distribution. Despite the fact that the
           location of electricity generation capacities is the Obiliq territory itself, there
           are shortages and deficiencies in electricity supply in the area due to outworn
           distribution infrastructure. [SpA-Obilic]

           The settlements in the SDP area are connected to the grid by local supply lines.
           No power transmission lines of regional importance cross the designated
           Sibovc mining area.

1.1.9      Spatial Planning Context of the SDP area


1.1.9.1    Kosovo Spatial Plan

           In relation to the Kosovo Spatial Plan (2006) , the SDP area of interest is located
                                                             6

           with its largest part in the Blue Area, the so-called Harbour of Kosova which
           includes Pristina in the centre and a belt of 1 ­ 2 municipalities around it,
           including Obiliq and Fushe Kosovo. The blue Area is characterized by a range
           of spatial functions and development targets focused on administrative,
           education, health care, service and trade, light industry, tourism, but also
           agriculture outside of the economic centres.

           Within the Blue Area, the SDP area is located North of the Triangle of Economic
           Development of Kosova (TED) is the Development Triangle which is in the
           centre of the Blue Area. The Triangle is bounded focused on the city of
           Prishtina, the International Airport the Prishtina-Peja­Montenegro and
           Prishtina-Ferizaj-Macedonia international roads. Besides motorway and air
           traffic connection there is also a major rail node at Fushe Kosova. Thus the
           TED is envisaged to be the so-called spine of economic development of a
           national interest, a source of income for Kosovar economy, and a potential
           location for multi-national company investors. There is no spatial interference
           of the SDP area with the TED.

           The northern end of the new Sibovc mine is located on a part of Vushtii
           municipality and thus belongs to the Green Area, the so-called Treasury of
           Kosova which represents the northern part of Kosova, with Mitrovica at the
           centre with a focus on industrial, service and trade resources. In Vushtrri
           municipality large areas of quality agricultural land represent a good basis for
           agricultural development.

           Overall, the SDP area of interest is located in an area with agricultural
           development potential. There are no conflicting interests with targets set out
           in the Kosovo Spatial Plan or other spatially relevant planning.

           Per definition of the spatial planning system of Kosovo, the SDP area will
           itself become a special area which will pose certain restrictions to the
           municipal planning.

1.1.9.2     Municipal and local plans

            The foreseen power and mining development will mainly affect the
            Municipality of Obiliq. It will strengthen the role of Obiliq municipality as
            being the electricity generation centre for Kosovo with respective economic
            and employment effects. However, at the same time the lands are further
            affected by mining over long time. This will have a significantly restricting
            impact on the land use and the municipal spatial options. Future development
            of a significant part of the Obiliq municipality will largely depend on the SDP
            settings.

            Fushe Kosova municipality on the contrary will mainly have positive impacts
            on the spatial planning side in the mid-term, since land presently devastated
            mainly by Bardh mine will be recultivated and the large areas covered by
            overburden dumps located to the south of the present mining area have a
            potential to become agricultural or forest land.

            Within the framework of spatial planning of Kosovo, as a target, every
            municipality should have a municipal spatial development plan. As part of
            the tasks designated to the Institute of Spatial Planning (ISP), which is an
            agency under the MESP, is supporting the municipalities in preparing Spatial

       Analysis reports7 which analyses the baseline conditions and points out spatial
       planning needs as basis for setting up municipal spatial development plans.

       The Spatial Analysis of Obiliq points out the need of preparing a special area
       spatial plan to cover the Sibovc mining development in order to reduce
       impacts on the affected settlements and provide guidance to future spatial
       development as it would designate the land use and conditions for utilization
       of area.

       For the affected communities only for Fushe Kosova a municipal spatial plan
       exists (no Spatial Analysis report was produced for Fushe Kosova) which
       however does not specifically refer to future developments in the mining and
       energy sector on the northern border of the municipality.


1.2    ANALYSIS OF SDP INTEREST ZONE




       Based on the above baseline, following analyses of the SDP area can be made                     Comment [ERM-ab1]: [SWO
       from spatial planning perspective:                                                               T Analysis in Obiliq municipality

       Strengths of the SDP area

       The SDP area is the power generation centre of Kosovo where in the future the
       domestic lignite resource will be used in an efficient way.


       Weaknesses of the SDP area

       · The area is heavily impacted from past and present power generation and
            mining activities. Villages close to the emission sources are exposed to air
            pollution and noise beyond acceptable limits and are a threat to public
            health and the environment.

       · Large areas of land are devastated by previous and ongoing mining
            activities (mines, overburden dumps, ash dumps) and presently out of
            land use.

         Opportunities for the SDP area

         · Recultivation of the exhausted Bardh and Mirash mines and associated
             overburden and ash dumps, and recultivation of the new mining area to
             international best practice standards.

         · Remediation and clean-up of the legacies of the past critical environmental
             pollution (air, water, noise) around mines and power plants including ash
             dumps and environmental burdens from associated industry (gasification
             and fertilizer plant).

         Threats for the SDP area

         · The new Sibovc mine is a massive intervention into the spatial structure of
             the area. Land transformation and re-establishment of spatial structures is
             a long process which will take several decades. The mining will remove all
             villages in the mining field, which will leave a completely different spatial
             structure and settlement relation in the future. There is a risk that the area
             in the mining field is further loosing economic vigor and social fabric. It
             will be of essence to provide to the population in the area a clear on the
             timing of things to come and a perspective for their lives elsewhere.




1.3      RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND THEIR POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT


1.3.1    Agriculture

         Agriculture is the most obvious land resource in the SDP area. However,
         agricultural activities are declining and people move to larger places. The
         agriculture sector will suffer most from the mining development. In the mid-
         and long term agriculture can be redeveloped since large portions of land will
         not only be lost by surface mining but will also be returned for use.

1.4      MAIN DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES CONSIDERING GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES AND
         INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLES



1.4.1    Resettlement, Infrastructure and Public Services

         As a consequence of the development of the new Sibovc mining field in total
         4 villages with at present about 750 households (XXxx people) will need to be
         resettled over the next 30 ­ 40 years. In the near term, the remaining part of
         Hade village with approximately 600 households (= xxx people) constitutes                      Comment [ERM-ab2]: Check
         the main resettlement challenge which has to be solved in near term.                            figures: RPF say 1500 HHs total


         The present legislation for expropriation and resettlement is not up to
         international standards. Therefore a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and a
         Draft Law on Expropriation for the Public Interest was developed under the
         LPTAP (by Hunton & Williams with IPA,2008) which both reflects best
         international practice and standards8 safeguarding the compensation and
         resettlement conditions of the project affected people and shall be
         implemented by the private Project Company and involved public agencies of
         Kosovo. (cf. below).

         With respect to spatial planning the relevant RPF recommendation is to
         resettle village communities as a whole. This applies also in case of scattered
         settlements; even when individual village parts may be affected at different
         stages of mining advance. The RPF recommends that implementation
         resettlement activities should be started at least 5 years in advance to the
         actual physical land impact by mining activities.

         The development of the Sibovc mining field will make a stepwise relocation
         and interim solutions of public services and infrastructure necessary. This has
         to be aligned with the pace resettlement and of mining impact on these
         infrastructures.

1.4.2    Employment

         Employment with KEK at present constitutes a substantial regional factor with
         a workforce of about 3000 people working in the mines and the power plants.
         It is a source of household income for some of the villages in the SDP area.

         The present KEK employment situation will change since the Bardhh and
         Mirash mines will be exploited in the near future and Kosovo A power plant
         will be closed down mid term by 2017 while Kosovo B continues to operate
         until 2023. It is intended that Kosovo C goes into operation by 2013. This will
         lead to various changes in the workforce presently employed in the sector,
         such as change of the employer since a private Project Company will be
         operating Kosovo C and the new Sibovc mine. While positions will be lost,
         others employment opportunities will be created. Staff for the new mine will
         likely be redundant staff from the old mine. However, overall there may be a
         retrenchment of the workforce of power plants and mines due to
         rationalization effects. KEK (or a successor company) and the private Project
         Company will need to address the issue of retrenchment and setup social
         plans to feather the effects of job loss (e.g. early retirement, training of
         employees who loose their jobs, job finding assistance).

         The MMP 2005 estimates that up to 2500 people (peak) would be employed in

2      VISION, PRINCIPALS AND TARGETS



2.1    VISION OF SDP

       The SDP is dealing with a large scale transformation of land for power
       generation from the non-renewable lignite resource. The exploitation of the
       new Sibovc mine will be a long term process where large scale transformation
       will gradually take place with the pace of mining progress and the new
       Kosovo C power station will be a fixed industrial installation with long term
       presence in the region of at least 40 years. In parallel with this development
       the environmental burdens from past mining and power generation activities
       will need to be taken care of. These developments should be undertaken in an
       environmentally and socially acceptable manner and result in an area where
       past pollutions are cleaned up or safely contained and no new unacceptable
       pollution occurs.


2.2    GENERAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

       In line with the Kosovo Energy Strategy, it shall be the aim to utilize the lignite,
       being the key domestic fuel resource of Kosovo,

       Principles for the development of the SDP area can be defined as follows9:

      · Unnecessary spoiling of land shall be avoided;

       · Impacts on lands and population shall be limited to the extend and period
           necessary and be remediated as soon as feasible;

       · Relocation of population shall be undertaken in a socially responsible
           manner;

       · Already disturbed lands shall be returned to a usable status with favorable
           safe environmental conditions as soon as possible;

       · Limitations and restrictions shall be in place to protect the environment
           and public health;

       · Financial resources shall be secured in advance for implementation of
           mitigation measures;

       · Best international practice, including stakeholder participation, shall be
           applied in all aspects.       10

2.3    LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT TARGETS

       Long term development targets for the SDP area are:

       · Reclaiming of the lands devastated by past the mining and power
           generation activities, in particular backfill and recultivation of the present
           mine pits and recultivation, also reshaping and recultivation of the
           associated outside overburden and ash dumps;

       · Reshaping and recultivation of mined lands:

             -  By recultivation of mined areas, provide arable land which provides
                better productivity compared to today and at the same time habitats
                for flora and fauna;

             -  Eventually, convert the remaining pit in the north of the mining area to
                a lake with future recreation function within near reach of Pristina;

       · Risk containment and clean up and of the pollution burdens from present
           and past operations (pollution from ash dumps and hydrocarbons/phenol
           pollution stemming from the gasification and fertilizer plant located next
           to Kosovo A TPP), and

       · Re-use brown field sites which become available from closing of Kosovo A
           and Kosovo B for other industrial purposes to create employment
           opportunities outside of the energy and mining sector.


2.4    STRATEGIC SDP PRIORITIES


       Resettlement

       The previous emergency resettlement of the southern part of Hade village in
       2004 has shown the main challenge connected with the open cast lignite
       mining in the area. Therefore, the timely and well prepared implementation of
       resettlement under informed participation of the affected population is a
       strategic priority for the SDP.

       A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) in line with international best
       practice standards has been prepared as one of the project development tasks
       of the LPTAP (see Section 3.2.5 below).




       10Envisaged developments shall be in accordance with EU policies and directives, best practice
       standards, and guidelines and safeguards for environmentally and socially sustainable
       development of the World Bank Group (IFC Performance Standards).

Improvement of Environmental Situation

Past and present mining and energy generation have lead to severe
environmental pollution which is affecting the population and environment in
the vicinity. Reduction of environmental pollution (dust, noise, traffic risks) is
a short term priority.

One of the most exposed settlements in this respect s Dardhistë village which
is located next to the active tip of Kosovo A ash dump, between the Mirash
mine and Kosovo A power plant. This village requires priority attention for
mitigation of public health and safety threatening situation and if such is not
reasonably feasible, as a last resort resettlement should be considered11.


Participatory approach

A key priority of the SDP is the adequate information disclosure and
consultation of the population affected by the planned power and mining
developments. The LPTAP in 2007 started public information activities and
established as a preparatory measure community development forums (CDF)
which are continuing in 2008. It will be important that the participatory
approach is carried through all further development and implementation
stages of the project, in particular for resettlement.

       Draft Sibovc Development Plan                                            May 2008



3      FRAMEWORK FOR SPATIALDEVELOPMENT



3.1    MAIN CONCEPTS OF SPATIAL DEVELOPMENT FOR THE INTEREST ZONE

       As a general concept, the existing and future mines will be backfilled with
       overburden and the ash from power plant operations. There will be no
       additional outside overburden and ash dumps which would cause
       unnecessarily consumption of land.

       The main land use category foreseen as follow up use of the lignite mining is
       basically the same as today, which is agriculture. This is in line with
       development concepts set out in the Kosovo Spatial Plan for this area (cf.
       Section 1.1.9.1 above).

       The plan as developed by the 2005 MPP for the future topography and
       landscape in the Sibovc field and the existing mine pits is a large agricultural
       plain with a slight inclination from south towards north. This plain will be
       segmented by vegetation stripes which provide for wind erosion protection
       and habitats for flora and fauna. As a general spatial layout it is foreseen that
       the future agricultural plain is subdivided by a road network of several east -
       west roads, supplemented by north ­ south road interconnectors. The roads
       will connect to the existing outside road network. There will be no settlements
       re-established within the area of the mining since there is a potential for land
       subsidence in the backfilled area.

       Due to the mass deficit which occurs from taking out the lignite, a large
       residual pit of about 5 km² will remain in the northern part of the Sibovc
       mining field. In the long term view (after 4 to 5 decades from now), this pit
       would be developed as a recreational lake, surrounded by a greenbelt along
       the slopes to the adjacent topography, which could be very attractive for
       Pristina inhabitants since it will be located within near reach.

       In the existing mining pits some sections will be reserved and designated for
       Special Use, such as the present municipal waste dump in the northeastern
       edge of the Mirash mine. Possibly also a state of the art hazardous waste
       treatment and disposal facility will be needed to enable the safe treatment and

           facilities next to the Kosovo A TPP         12and similar wastes from elsewhere.

          The possible future land use of the outside overburden dumps is presently
          investigated under the Clean-Up and Land Reclamation Project (CLRP) which
          is a LPTAP activity with World Bank funding. The general concept is to
          provide agricultural use where possible (if terrain, soil properties, suitability
          for foodstuff production permits) and to maintain and increase the flora and
          fauna habitat functions these areas already have developed. Also for the ash
          dumps concepts are presently developed.


3.2        SPATIAL STRUCTURE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND FUTURE LAND USE


3.2.1     Mine development


3.2.1.1   Land Requirements of the new Sibovc mine

          The total future mining concession for the new Sibovc mine covers an area of
          16 km². It extends about 5 km to the North from the rim of the present Bardh
          and Mirash mines. The widest East-West extension is about 3.8 km on a line
          between Shipitulë and Lajthishtë. The Sibovc South-West field, which will be
          developed first, covers an area of approximately 4.8 km² with a maximum
          mineable width (east-west extension) of 2.3 km and a length of about 2.5 km.

          Based on indicative correlation of the future lignite demand as used in the
          SESA and the claim of land shown in the 2005 MMP, it is tentatively estimated
          that about half of the Sibovc field would be developed by the mid-2030s. By
          that time the centrally located mahalas of Sibovc and the southern part of
          Lajthishtë would be reached. As described in the introduction section, the
          pace of mining advance and the footprint of the claim of land will depend on
          various parameters including the development option chosen for Kosovo C
          and exact timelines for the mining advance will only be known after a new
          mining plan has been developed by the future Project Company.

          As a requirement of the ICMM regulation No 2005/3, a 200 metres wide safety
          zone around the excavation line of the mine has to be maintained as buffer for




           12The requirement for a hazardous waste disposal facility will be independent from the site
           selection decision for Kosovo C TPP, since the contaminations from the past constitute
           environmental risks for the future which must be contained and remediated.

3.2.1.2    Mining Development Concept and Plans


           Short term development

           The present Bardh and Mirash mines which feed the Kosovo A and B TPPs
           will be exhausted by 2011. As a short term interim measure KEK will open the
           small Signitza mine for the supply of Kosovo A TPP between Palaj and the
           TPP A. To open this new mine, the Signitza River will be relocated to flow
           around the eastern side of the mining pit. River relocation works are in
           progress. As a conceptual plan it is foreseen that the pit, which will remain
           after exploitation with a depth of approximately 40 metres, would be used as
           cooling water buffer basin for the new Kosovo C power plant (also if the
           TTP C is located next to Kosovo B TPP).


           Short to mid-term development

           In the preparatory planning process for the future energy generation
           including Kosovo C TPP, a Main Mining Plan (MMP) for the new Sibovc
           lignite mine was prepared under the LPTAP in 2005 (by VEM and DMT). This
           mining plan foresees mining of the new Sibovc field as a direct extension from
           the northern rim of the Bardh and Mirash mines in northern direction.

           Since however the timescales for decisions and the underlying assumption of
           the 2005 MMP changed (inter alia with regard to start of operation of Kosovo C
           TPP and its installed capacity size13 and thus lignite consumption rate, and the
          time in which the resettlement of Hade could be accomplished), a
          complementary mining plan for the Sibovc South-West (SW) mining field
          (CMP-SW) was prepared in 2006 (by STEAG Consortium) to secure the timely
           lignite supply of Kosovo A and B TPPs. The Sibovc SW field is basically a
           northern extension of the Bardh mine and is sparing Hade settlement. This
           western bypassing of Hade provides for a time window of about 5 years in
           which Hade village should be resettled.

           Based on this CMP-SW, KEK was granted a mining concession for the SW-
           Field by the Independent Commission for Minerals and Mines (ICMM) until




           13The Main Mining Plan (2005) had assumed a mining progress based on a coal demand of a 2x
           500 MW Kosovo C developed and at the same time a continuation of the demand of Kosovo A
           and B plus 4x300 MW Kosovo B extension.

Draft Sibovc Development Plan                                                   May 2008



201714. Activities to clear the SW mining field and to remove overburden
which was earlier dumped from the Bardh mine at the south-western part of
SW field north-east of Graboc have started and the local road towards Sibovc
was already relocated in the course of the preparatory activities.


Mid-term development

Depending on the interfacing and responsibility handover arrangements for
the activities of KEK (or a successor company) and the Project Company
(which will need to be agreed between the Government of Kosovo and the
private Investor), by 2017 or before (e.g. starting 2013/14 when the new
Kosovo C TPP is planned to go into operation), but only after Hade is
completely resettled, the SW-Field would be expanded eastward to exploit the
lignite which is located under the present Hade settlement. For the time when
the Project Company takes responsibility of the mining operations, a new
mining plan will need to be set-up to plan the details of the northward
advance in Sibovc mining field.


Long term development

After this eastern part is exploited, it is foreseen that the mining activities will
advance northward in the complete width of the Sibovc field as given by the
future concession outline.

A new main mining plan which reflects the foreseen staging and advance
directions of the Sibovc mining field will need to be set-up by the Project
Company. Only after this new mining plan is developed, reliable timelines for
the claim of land will be available.

The claim of land is also determined by the pace of mining progress. This will
depend on the development concept for the Kosova C power plant (to be
decided by the agreement between Kosovo and the private Investor).
Basically, a fast installed capacity built up implies higher lignite demand and
thus faster mining progress which results in more rapid land take compared
to a staged power plant development which results in a lower demand and
thus slower mining pace. Based on the phasing scenarios and respective
lignite consumption figures which are provided in the SESA and an indicative
correlation with the land claim of the 2005 MMP, a staged concept could result
in a delay of mining advance of about 3 years compared to a fast concept.

            On the same basis it can be estimated that the centre of the mining field will be
            reached in about 25 years and the northern end in about 40-50 years, .e. at the
           end of Kosovo C TPP lifetime (Figure 3-1).

3.2.1.3    Mining Activities

           The mining activities are described in the 2005 MMP and the 2006 CMP-SW:

           The mining activity and the technology employed for the new Sibovc mine
           will be basically the same as for the existing mines. The main mining
           equipment will consist of several bucket wheel excavators, connected belt
           conveyors, spreaders and auxiliary equipment like draglines, dozers and
           maintenance vehicles, Also shovel and truck technologies are foreseen for part
           of the excavation.

           With the heavy open cast mining equipment, soil and overburden will be
           removed to reach the coal seam with a thickness of up to 80 metres which then
           is extracted and transported off to the power plants by a conveyor belt system.
           (The base of the lignite is up to 120 metres below surface level).


3.2.1.4    Mine closure, land reclamation and recultivation


           General Concept

           Recultivation of areas disturbed by lignite mining is aiming to create a follow-
           up landscape with various land use designations, typically with the main
           following categories:

           · Agriculture

           · Forestry

           · Habitats for Flora and Fauna, and

           · Recreation

           After the Bardh and Mirash mines are exhausted, two large pits remain (due
           to the mass deficits resulting from the low overburden to coal ratio, the past
           outside dumping of overburden and only limited backfilling of ash). As a
           general concept, these pits will be backfilled with overburden from the new
           Sibovc mine (initially South-West field) and the ashes from Kosovo B TPP
           operation (transferring also ashes from Kosovo A TPP is under discussion
           between KEK and World Bank). By transferring masses from the Sibovc field
           into the pits, the mass deficits in the Bardh and Mirash mines can be balanced
           off and there is no need for outside dumping of overburden in the
           development of the Sibovc field.

           After closure of the pits and contouring with overburden from the Sibovc
           mine operations, the area of the existing mine pits will be recultivated for
           agricultural land use.

            Part of the residual pit of Mirash-Brand remains as reserved area for the
            disposal of municipal waste and potential hazardous waste in the future. .

            Taking the 2005 MMP as an indication, it can be estimated that the backfilling
            of the existing pits, landscaping and recultivation would take about 20 years.

3.2.2       Power plants

           (Note: The existing power plants and the planned new power plant are described in detail in
          the SESA report and Annex A of SESA. The following provides a summary of key aspects for
          the purpose of SDP context).

3.2.2.1    Existing power plants (Kosovo A&B)

           The two existing thermal power plants Kosovo A and Kosovo B are under
           ownership and operation of KEK. Both plants are significantly different in age
           and technology. Both are non-compliant with present day environmental
           performance thresholds set by the EU Large Combustion Plant Directive
           (LCDP 2001/80/EC)15. In particular Kosovo A is a significant polluter of
          particulate matter which exceeding the limit values of the LCDP by 7 to 10
          times.

          TPP A has 5 unites which were built in two phases (from 1962 to 1964 and
          from 1970 to 1975) totalling an installed capacity of 800 MW of which only
          145 MW are presently available. TPP A has no emission controls in place;
          stacks are 100 metres high.

          TPP B has 2 units of 339 MW each which were built from 1983 to 1984. Both
          units do not work continuously due to maintenance activities. Major
          overhauls were carried out in 2007 on both units. TPP B has electrostatic
          precipitators (ESPs) in place for reducing particulate emissions, but no flue gas
          desulfurization (FGD) or denitrification. The stacks are 182 metres high.


          Operation of Kosovo A&B (water supply, fuel supply)

          Both power plants receive their lignite via belt conveyor from Bardh and
          Mirash Mines. The ashes of Kosovo B are disposed back to the Mirash East
          mine by wet transport (dumping to the Kosovo B ash dump was stopped in
          [year)]. The ashes of Kosovo A are still disposed off at its open ash dump. This
          causes significant environmental pollution and public health concerns in
          particular for nearby Dardhistë village.

          Kosovo B has one common large hyperboloid shaped concrete natural draft
          cooling tower for both units, whereas Kosovo A uses several [name]-type
           cooling towers. Cooling water for Kosovo A Kosovo supplied from a pumping
           station installed on Llap River located at around 11 km distance from TPP A.

During periods of water shortage in summer, water is abstracted from the
Ibër-Lepenc canal. Cooling water for Kosovo B is supplied from the Iber
Lepenc system.

Kosovo A TPP and B both have basic wastewater treatment system
(sedimentation and neutralisation) which are in poor maintenance status.
Water is discharged into Sitnica River from both power plants.


Remaining lifetime of existing power plants

Present anticipation is that though implementation of rehabilitation measures
Kosovo A could continue to operate with a capacity of 280 MW. Since due to
its age and state it will not be possible to achieve compliance with the LCPD, it
will be running until 2017.

Mayor refurbishments of Kosovo B are anticipated for the 2010s which enables
a total capacity of 610 MW and inter alia include the installation of FGDs to
make the plant compliant with the LCPD. The gypsum from the FGD will
likely be sent back to the mine (for options cf. Section 5.1.3). Present
anticipation is that Kosovo B would reach the end of its lifetime by 2030.

While it is anticipated that Kosovo B will remain under KEK (or a successor
company), depending on the arrangements with the Investor for Kosovo C, in
particular siting decision, Kosovo A might be transferred to the private Project
Company.


Decommissioning of existing power plants

After reaching the end of their designated operational lifetime, both power
plants will be decommissioned and dismantled. Responsibilities for this will
be in with the future owner; depending on the arrangement between the
Government of Kosovo and the Investor for Kosovo C, this may be either KEK
(or successor), or the private Project Company.


Future use of sites

Potential follow-up use after decommissioning and dismantling of the power
stations and site cleanup will be up to the decision of the owner. Sites could be
re-used as brownfield sites for future industrial development. Remediation of
the soil and groundwater pollution would need to undertaken to the pertinent
EU or best practice standard at the respective decommissioning time.16




16at present e.g. the Dutch List would be an appropriate remediation standard.

3.2.2.2    New power plant (Kosovo C)

           The new Kosovo C lignite power plant will be built and operated by a private
           Project Company. It will have an installed capacity of 1800 up to 2100 MW. A
           number of key parameters for implementation are still to be decided during
           the negotiations between the Government of Kosovo and the private Investor,
           including final installed capacity, unit (block) size and number, staging of
           units, technology (inter alia combustion: pulverized coal/fluidized bed), and
           most important from spatial planning perspective, the location of the new
           power plant. Independent from the location, the new power plant will have an
           environmental performance to the best available standards and will be
           compliant with the pertinent EU requirements.


           Location of Kosovo C

           At present stage of project development, the site for the new Kosovo C power
           plant is not yet decided.

           The SESA compared the environmental and social aspects for 3 sites which
           were previously identified under LPTAP to provide input to a decision; these
           potential sites are:

           · Kosovo A Site, at the location of the abandoned former gasification and
               fertilizer plant (KEK ownership);

           · Kosovo B Site, at the location of the Kosovo B ash dump (KEK ownership),
               and

           · Bivolac Site, which is on (private) agricultural land.

           From a regional planning perspective, the siting of the new Kosovo C TPP
           results in significant differences for the 3 sites when looked at in the context of
           the remaining lifetimes of Kosovo A and Kosovo B TPPs:

           · Kosovo C site next to Kosovo A would mean recycling a contaminated
               brownfield site (gasification and fertilizer plant) which needs to be cleaned
               up before construction of the new power plant. It would be a
               concentration of 2 power plants at one location, however with Kosovo A in
               full operation for a relatively short period (until 2017). This option for
               Kosovo C is the one located nearest to Pristina. In the long run the present
               setup in the region would be carried on which is power generation at
               2 locations.

           · Kosovo C site next to Kosovo B TPP would mean using a brownfield site
               (parts or all of the Kosovo B ash dump has to be removed). It would be a
               concentration of the future power production at just one location

    (Kosovo B) over the longest period (2017 ­ 2050s); moreover it is closest to
    the centre of the new Sibovc mine.

· Kosovo C at Bivolac site would mean that power plants were running at 3
    different locations from 2014 ­ 2017, and 2 locations (including one
    greenfield site) after closure of Kosovo A.

The comparison and site ranking undertaken in SESA under consideration of
a large set of various criteria resulted in the recommendation that the new
Kosovo C power plant should be located either next to Kosovo A or next to
Kosovo B. In case of the Kosovo A site, the cleanup of the pollution from the
old industrial facilities constitutes the main challenge, whereas for the
Kosovo B site, the removal of the ash dump and its location of the site in the
flooding zone of the Sitznica River will be important points for consideration
in decision making.


Construction phase

Depending on the phasing and unit size decisions which will be made for the
Kosovo C TPP, construction activities may be ongoing at site over a relatively
short (few years) or an extended period of time (up to 10 ­ 15 years).

The construction of the new power plant will require that heavy and bulky
pieces of equipments are transported to site. It will be up to the contractors of
the operating company to determine the best ways and modes of construction
transports. Preferably this would be done by the existing rail connections.
Potential impacts on public infrastructure will need to be identified in the
ESIA for the detailed planning. The ESIA will also need to cover all other
construction related aspects and potential impacts, such as construction noise
and vibration, traffic safety etc.

Typically, construction of a large requires a large temporary workforce
(several hundred). The private Investor will need to show in his ESIA how
potential social impacts are handled and how local employment effects can be
secured for the region.


Operation of Kosovo C

The operation of Kosovo C will involve lignite to be transported to the plant
by belt conveyor from the new Sibovc mine, and ash and residuals to be
transported back to the mines for disposal. The gypsum from the FGD will
also likely be sent back to the mine (for options cf. Section 5.1.3)

Cooling water will be supplied by the Iber-Lepenc water canal. The mining pit
which will remain after exploitation of the Signitza mine located east of the
Mirash mine (cf. Section 3.2.1.2) will be used as a reserve buffer pond for

         storage of 2 weeks of cooling water demand. According to the available
         studies evaluated for conducting the SESA, the water demand of the new
         Kosovo C power plant would not be conflicting with the future water
         demands of other sectors such as households and agriculture. However, a
         detailed confirmation would need to be provided by the future Investor e.g. as
         part of the ESIA for the power plant. The SESA recommends looking into
         water saving design.

         The new power plant will need to have a state of the art waste water treatment
         system.

         Electricity will be feed into the existing high voltage grid. If Kosovo A or B site
         is chosen only short transmission lines [corridors?] (less than 1 km/2km) to
         the existing high voltage switchyards are necessary. In both cases there would
         be no interference with residential land use [check!].


         Decommissioning of Kosovo C

         The lifetime of a new thermal power plant is typically given as at least
         40 years. The Project Company will be required to decommission, dismantle
         the power plant and clean-up the site after end of lifetime.


3.2.3    Clean-up and Land Reclamation

         From previous mining operations at least 7 overburden dumps of various size
         exists which are at different stages of natural vegetation succession and
         partially are informal used by villagers.

         About 165 hectrares of previously arable land is occupied by ash dumps
         which according to present estimates constitute main sources of pollutantion
         of air, soil and ground and surface waters at the regional level (MESP):

         · Significant air pollution due to wind spreading the ash several kilometres
             in all directions and likely public health risk to nearby settlements17

         have yet been undertaken, evidence suggest the problems are extremely widespread including

         · Pollution of ground water, which is the main source of drinking water in
             the area

         For the near term future the implementation of the Clean-up and Remediation
         Project (CLPR) is planned by KEK with the support of the World Bank. The
         feasibility of following project components is presently under study:

         · Preparation of Mirash mine pit for ash and waste reception;

         · Relocation of Kosovo A ash dump into Mirash mine pit (ca. 35 - 40
             million m³);

         · Mitigation of geotechnical instabilities of the associated overburden dump

         · Adaption of ash disposal system of Kosovo A TPP for direct discharge into
             Mirash mine;

         · Reshaping and grading of South and West Overburden dumps (circa
             6.5 km²) and recultivation of reclaimed surface (circa 9 km² including both
             west and south dumps)

         · Removal of hazardous materials from the former chemical separation
             facility (gasification and fertilizer plant) located next to Kosovo A power
             plant; in total approximately 17,500 tonnes, mainly toxic phenols and
             hydrocarbons.


3.2.4    Infrastructure

         The mining activities will cut public infrastructure, most notably the roads,
         electricity supply lines and water mains and impact other public
         infrastructure and services. For the time being, this is under the responsibility
         of KEK in the course of initial development of the Sibovc-SW field. Further
         relocation of infrastructure and provision of temporary infrastructure will be
         developed as part of the mining plan to be set-up by the Project Company (i.e.
         private Investor).

         The east ­ west connections from the Obiliq municipalty centre (Kastriot) to
         the areas in the future mining field are of importance for regional
         transportation. Therefore temporary or permanent replacements need to be
         provided. The road to Grabov is already relocated in the course of present
         activities. It is tentatively estimated that the east west connection road via
         Palaj- Lajthistte- Sibovc- Shipitulle- Graboc would be cut by the mid-2020s and
         temporary connection to the villages in the north would need to be
         established. By that time the road from Caravodice to Graboc (along today's
         northern mine rim) would be re-established as an important regional east ­
         west connector.

         While the new mine advances at the excavation front in the north, backfilling
         and land surface reclamation will follow from the south. As a general spatial
         layout it is foreseen that the future agricultural plain is subdivided by a road
         network of several east -west roads, supplemented by north ­ south road
         interconnectors. The roads will connect to the existing outside road network.

         Since there will be no settlements re-established in the area of the mining field
         after reclamation of the land there is no requirement for re-establishing lost
         social infrastructure; this will need to be provided in the new resettlement
         locations instead (see below Section 3.2.5). However, care must be taken that
         settlement remaining on the outsides of the mining field (in particular the
         ones left on the western edge which are at largest distance to the municipality
         centre) will be connected and have access to the required facilities and
         services.


3.2.5    Population and Resettlement

         The development of the Sibovc field will require resettlement of Hade
         Lajthishtë and Sibovc villages and the settlement part of Shipitulë village
         which is inside the mining area. Eventually as many as 1500 families [RPF] will
         need to be relocated.

         As explained under Section 3.2.1, without an updated mining plan based on
         the final power plant scenario, it cannot be reliably determined when the
         mining advance would reach certain villages.

         At present, only a tentative estimate can be given18 by when the settlements
         inside the mining area would likely need to be relocated as per schedule in

4.2      LEGAL, INSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO IMPLEMENT SDP


4.2.1    Legal Implementation Requirements

         The Regulation No. 2005/3 on Mines and Minerals in Kosovo provides essential
         requirements for the mining. In section 30 the it prescribes that the application
         for the mining program (i.e. mining plan) shall inter alia include following
         studies

         · Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)

         · Closure plan and rehabilitation program (i.e. backfilling, land reclamation,
             recultivation), and

         · Study of Social consequences (in other words: SIA and RAP).

         Further the applicant (i.e. the Project Company) will need to provide a
         performance bond to secure that funds are allocated for activities under the
         closure plan and rehabilitation program.

         To implement the foreseen mining in a socially acceptable manner and to
         present international good practice standards, following draft and legislation
         proposed under the LPTAP would need to be amended to the present
         legislation related to expropriation:

         · Draft Law Expropriation for the Public Interest (Hunton&Williams / IPA
             2008)

         Further, the entities responsible for resettlement would need to adopt
         following policy for resettlement

         · The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) (Hunton&Williams / IPA 2008)




4.2.2    Institutional Implementation Requirements

         The Independent Commission on Mines and Minerals (ICMM), as per present
         legal mandate, acts as the regulatory body for application of the mining law
         and regulating exploration and exploitation of minerals in Kosovo. As per
         requirements of Regulation No.2005/3 the ICMM will oversee the mining
         operators (initially KEK and later the Investor).


4.3      TIME LINE, FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS, INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

             · Time Line
                   

         The timelines for the completion and implementation of the SDP are
         determined by the ongoing and scheduled activities. Major decisions on the
         scope of activities of the private Investor and the interface with are anticipated
         within 2008/2009 including site location and concept for Kosovo C power
         plant.

         At present following outlook can be given:

       · The general schedule for the new Sibovc mine will be determined by the
             mining advance. This will depend on the power plant scenario to be
             realized. An updated main mining plan which reflects the foreseen staging
             and advance directions of the Sibovc mining field will need to be set-up by
             the Project Company.

             Project will possibly start in 2008. It is at present not known by when lands
             would be made available by KEK for follow-up use such as agriculture on
             former overburden areas.


4.3.2    Financial Implications

         At this stage of project preparation, following assumptions on the allocation of
         financial responsibilities can be made, subject to further decision by the
         government and outcome of the negotiations with interested Investors:

         · The Project Company who will build and operate the Kosovo C and
             develop the new mine will be required to take up all costs related to:

             -     relocation of infrastructure, compensation of affected people for losses
                  and resettlement;

             -     reclamation of the Sibovc mine and recultivation, and

             -     environmental self monitoring of power plant and mining operations.

         · Depending on interfacing arrangement incl. possibly asset transfers, the
             State of Kosovo, KEK (or a successor company) may also be responsible to
             taking up costs related to implementation.

         · Municipalities would only be responsible for first time setting up their
             own municipal and local development plans under the guidance set out in
             the SDP. Since such plans do not yet exist, setting up such plans would fall
             under the regular budget activities of the municipalities.


4.3.3    Institutional Framework

         Not clear, this seems redundant with 4.2.2 above

         Maybe here aspect of Institutional strengthening of KEPA as being the
         environmental supervisory authority (already started under the LPTAP).

5        IMPLEMENTING INSTRUCTIONS



5.1      CONDITIONS AND MEASURES




5.1.1    Proposed Implementing Instructions for Power Plant Development

         The new power plant will likely be built land resource saving on a brownfield
         site, either next to Kosovo A or next to Kosovo B TPPs. In both cases
         environmental burdens of the past would be remediated at the same time.

         On both potential sites, the new power plant will be situated in the vicinity of
         settlements. However, the environmental performance of the new TPP cannot
         be compared with the existing TPPs, in particular not with the aged Kosovo A
         TPP. The new TPP will have state of the art air emission reduction (such as
         desulfurization and electrostatic dust filters) and noise controls at source and
         will be compliant with EU standards.

         Green belt and off-site greenery for visual screening shall be designed mitigate
         visual impacts. The private Investor, who will build and operate the power,
         will have to prepare an environmental impact assessment to Kosovar and
         interational standards where such mitigation and respective monitoring will
         be designed in detail.

         It is recommended that the SDP should impose the restriction that local
         development plans will be required not to designate new residential land use
         areas within 500 metres of the TPP boundary and not to permit building of
         new residential houses within this zone.


5.1.2    Proposed Implementing Instructions for Mining operations

         The determination of the excavation boundary of the Sibovc mine in the 2005
         MMP was done in such way that unnecessary settlement losses would be
         avoided, even at the cost of some lignite losses (was applied to Shipitulle on
         the western mining boundary and Palaj on the eastern mining boundary). The
         MMP 2005 had considered a 100 metres zone. The ICMM regulation No
         2005/3 requires that a 200 metres wide safety zone around the excavation line
         of the mine has to be maintained as buffer for the protection of villages
         outside of the mine. Villages within the safety line will be resettled (see Error!
         Reference source not found. below). The updated mining plan of the private
         project company will need to comply with the 200 metres zone.

A new main mining plan and the more detailed mid-term operational mining
plans (10 ­ 15 years planning horizon) will need to be set-up the Project
Company as part of the application to ICMM for his mining program (as per
Regulation 2005/3 on Mines and Minerals in Kosovo) will need to specify the
mining and recultivation activities location specific. General best practice as
established in EU countries shall be followed with regard to the protection of
the environment and the settlements in the vicinity of the mining area.

As per Regulation 2005/3, Part V, Section 30.1(j) the mining program proposed
by the project proponent (i.e. the future Project Company) as part of the
mining license application, are subject to an EIA. In the EIA detailed and
location specific measures are to be designed, which need require approval of
environmental protection measures by KEPA.

The following is an exemplary compilation of essential instructions and
environmental protection measures inter alia as applicable e.g. in Germany and
as recommended by World Bank Group standards which should be
considered in the mining program.           19


A key issue for settlements in the vicinity of mining operations is the
protection from dust and noise through the limitation of particulate matter
and noise and vibrations emissions by operational planning and technical
measures.

Ambient Air quality / Dust

As a best practice, at the settlements in the vicinity of the mines, following
dust concentrations should not be exceeded:

· Suspended dust/ particulate matter (PM10) of 40 µg/m³ annual average
     and 50µg/m³ daily average (EU Directive 1999/30)

· Dust deposition of 0.35 g/m²/day (in annual average) to avoid significant
     nuisance from dust deposition (German TA Luft limit value in absence of
     respective EU value)

To achieve this following dust reduction measures should be implemented as
applicable by local conditions:

· To reduce overall dust blow potential from the mining field, the
    operational mining plan should aim to reduce the active mining area to the
    extent possible needed from operational perspective;
· Backfilling and recultivation should follow the mining advance at a similar
    rate to limit the period that areas are bare and exposed and prone to wind
    erosion;
· Interim surface greening with suitable vegetation (e.g. by spraying of grass
    seeds-mud mix) should be foreseen in the mining plan if areas are left
    open over extended time;
· On the outer edge of the 200 safety zone which is buffering the excavation
    line, a vegetation screen shall be planted on the eastern and western mine
    rim (in order to have an effect, this should start years in advance of the
    mining. This can be done in conjunction with noise protection walls/earth
    berms/ (see below);

· dust emitting facilities (e.g. crushers/loading) should be sited offside from
    settlements;

· Technical dust suppression in the mining area, such as by water spraying
    of wind exposed slopes should be in place and be implemented when
    climatic conditions (dry weather, prevailing wind) indicate the
    requirement.

· Temporary surface sealing of main access roads should be considered

· Technical dust emission prevention measures such as installation of water
    spray units or housing at mining equipment where lignite or overburden
    is handled (e.g. transfer stations to/from /within conveyor belt system)

· Finally, unnecessary dust emissions can also be avoided by respective
    operational instructions (e.g. avoid unnecessary falling heights of moved
    materials) and respective awareness training for operational staff. At worst
    conditions (e.g. strong wind and dust blow to a downwind settlement) ,
    operations should be halted.

To monitor the effectiveness of the measures, monitoring shall be undertaken
by the operator. For dust deposition a grid of stationary sampling devices (e.g.
German-type "Bergerhoff" passive samplers) should be installed (KEK operates
2 sample stations in present operations). Duplicate samples shall be achieved
as conservation of evidence.

For suspended dust /particulate matter in ambient air active sampling (motor
driven suction device) should be undertaken by the operator with a mobile
sampling station (e.g. sampling van/truck). The mobile station should change
locations on regular basis and on weather (wind) conditions. The sampling
plan has to be agreed with KEPA.

Noise Reduction

Good practice in the prevention and control of noise sources from mining
activities should be established based on the prevailing land use and the
proximity of sensitive noise receptors such as settlements and community
used areas (cf. IFC Guidance). On EU levels at present no consistent noise limit
values exist.

In general, noise impact on settlements shall be reduced in two ways:

· Noise reduction at source
    Noise emissions from operations shall be reduced at the source through
    the use of sonically optimised machinery and equipment drive assemblies,
    and conveyor belts (which at present account for substantial noise
    pollution), sound insulation / enclosure of driving units (preferred use of
    electric motors) and shielding/housing of conveyor belts in the vicinity of
    settlements. Since likely much of the equipment presently in use will also
    be used in the in the future mining activities including land reclamation
    /recultivation, respective retrofitting of equipments should be undertaken.
    The EU Directive 2000/14 on noise from equipment and machinery [check
    title] should be taken into consideration as applicable.

· Noise protection barriers for settlements
    In advance of mining, a vegetated protective earth dam shall be
    established within the 200 metres safety buffer zone on those sections of
    the eastern and western mine boundary where settlements are located.
    Alternatively, in case of space limitations a protective sound wall shall be
    installed between settlement and excavation boundary (also temporary
    earth dams when mining front advances to villages, until villages are
    resettled). In such situations also the uppermost excavation terrace could
    be lowered to gain additional shielding from the higher mining slope. The
    location and height of the noise screens/dams shall be determined by a
    noise study within the EIA for the mining plan to be established. The
    measures taken should ensure that limit values (day/night) are kept.

         Vibrations Reduction and Low frequency noise

         In present operations crushers and conveyor belts are the main sources of
         vibrations.

         Low frequency noise can cause a significant nuisance to settlements in
         particular at night. Inter alia Conveyor belts are potential source for this. The
         German DIN 45680 (March 1997) provides a possible approach to analyse this
         effect. The nuisance can normally be reduced or eliminated by changes in the
         rotation speed of the equipment

         Mine Dewatering

         Due to hydro-geological conditions of the area, there is no need for
         groundwater pumping. Dewatering needs are limited to surface water runoff.
         Under present operations, dewatering of the mines is done without water
         treatment before discharge to the receiving surface water bodies which are the
         Sitnica River in the East and Drenica River in the West. The MMP 2005
         foresees that this practice will be changed and at as minimum settling ponds
         for soil and coal dust are installed and laboratory analysis and monitoring is
         undertaken to design counter measures in case of water quality problems
         (flocculation, ph-buffering) or pollution is present. A special case in the latter
         respect will be the mining of the areas in the Eat of the Sibovs field located
         between Hade-Lajthishte ­Palaj where phenol dumping on old underground
         mining shafts was done earlier. Adequate measures for isolating polluted soil
         and water and respective treatment and disposal to best practice will be
         necessary to prevent environmental risks.

         Road safety

         The operator shall develop a traffic management plan which aims to avoid or
         at least reduce the use of public roads. Unavoidable interference of operation
         traffic and transportation with public roads and in particular traffic sensitive
         locations (e.g. schools) shall be analysed and action plans for road safety shall
         be established.


5.1.3    Backfilling of Mines

         Mines shall be backfilled with overburden from mining and the residuals of
         the power plant operation. The latter are typically:

       · Ash (bottom ash from the burner and fly ash from the filters)

         · Sludge from water processing and waste water treatment

         · Gypsum which is generated in large quantities by the flue gas
             desulfurization

         While overburden is not classified as waste, ash and sludge have a pollution
         potential and need to be treated as wastes (see ash disposal in Mirash East)a
         according to the pertinent directives20 in particular Council Directive 99/31/EC
         on the Landfill of Waste (applicability of Council Directive 1991/689/EEC on
         Hazardous Waste and Directive 2006/21/EC on the Management of Waste
         from the Extractive Industries          21need to be evaluated (the later one seems to
         be less relevant for lignite mining).

         However, fly ash can also be mixed with FDG gypsum to a stabilisate before
         backfilling back to the mine. Further, there are also possibilities for re-use as
         secondary raw material. Fine milled fly ash also can be re-used as additive in
         the cement industry or

         The FGD gypsum in principle is a secondary resource. During the last decade
         processing technology has evolved which also makes it possible to utilize FGD
         gypsum from lignite power stations22. The processed material can be can be
         used for manufacturing of wall-boards for building construction. Practical
         examples of this are found e.g. in the eastern Germany lignite region. In some
         cases FGD gypsum is stored aside in the mine pits as a secondary deposit for
         later use.

         It will depend on the intentions of the future Operating Company and
         potential building industry partners if such reuse concept would be
         economically sustainable (costs for establishment of facilities, market demand
         etc.). The starting of a power generation by-product industry would certainly
         be a strong incentive for local economic development and diversification and
         could potentially be established on brownfield sites.


5.1.4    Instructions for Recultivation

         As per requirement of Regulation 2005/3 on Mines and Minerals in Kosovo,
         Part V, Section 30.1(m) also a mine closure plan and rehabilitation program is
         to be prepared by the Project Company. An essential element of the closure
         plan will be the progressive rehabilitation of the mine area and successive
         recultivation.

Following instructions from the Main Mining Plan 2005 and further good
mining practice in Europe should apply23:

As part of the recultivation planning, the Operating Company shall undertake
soil and agricultural / forestry studies to determine necessary measures to
prepare fertile and workable agricultural land.

During clearing of the new mining surface, organic top soil and root bearing
substrate layer shall be stripped and stored separately for future use in
recultivation. Storage shall be undertaken in way to preserve soil fertility and
soil organisms, i.e. max 2.5 metres high deposits which are kept vegetated
with nitrogen accumulating species to prevent erosion and siltation and to
preserve soil fertility. The top soil stripped off in the new mining operations
shall be applied as a final surface layer for recultivation

Conditioning requirements of re-applied soils and substrate shall, e.g. mixing
with sand and/or clay substrate to provide for balanced drainage and water
retention capacity. The texture of aggregates should to prevent
siltation/crusting of soils, and erosion stability.

For agricultural use, the applied topsoil substance must be suitable for the
production of foodstuff. In this respect no common standards On EU level
presently exist24. As a possible reference for soil standards for recultivation
activities, the German standards may be used for guidance. In Germany, re-
application of soil on land surfaces is regulated by the Federal Soil Protection
Act and the specifications made of the respective Federal Ordinance on Soil and
Contaminated Land (BBodSchV 1997, last amended 2004 ). Art. 12 of this
                                                                     25

ordinance inter alia sets requirements for re-application of soils for agricultural
use or follow-up use including recultivation (Para. 4 to 6): For the preparation
of a plant root bearing soil layer for agricultural use, the applied soil substrate
shall be suitable for the purpose by it substrate properties, applied layer
thickness and pollution concentration.

In view of future pollution which will inevitably be accumulated through
agriculture or atmospheric deposition, pollution levels of the soils applied
shall not exceed 70 % of the precautionary thresholds set in Appendix 2, No.4 of
the BBodSchV. Para. 9 BBodSchV formulates requirements regarding the

         technical aspects of soil application with reference to DIN 19731 Soil quality -
         Utilization of soil material.

         Comprehensive instructions are given in the Guidance for Implementing § 12
         BBodSchV . Re-application of soil requires laboratory testing and for
                      26

         agricultural purposes an agricultural and soil study. In areas designated for
         agricultural follow-up use, after landscape contouring a top soil layer of 1,5 to
         2 metres thickness will usually be required, whereas forest or bushland for the
         future vegetation strips may be stocked on raw substrate (depending on
         outcome of soil study). Further soil melioration measures, such as green
         seeding with Lucerne in the first years, should be determined as part of the
         sail and agricultural study. This also applies to the question if irrigation
         should be provided.

         The vegetation stripes which are foreseen to segment the landscape and to
         provide erosion protection shall be composed from region typical species. The
         stripes will typically have a cross section of several metres where rows of large
         trees are in the centre undergrown by smaller tree species and bushes on the
         sides. More specific details are given in Chapter 11.3 of the Main Mining Plan
         2005.


5.1.5    Land use and Building restrictions

         The SDP will set restrictions for further construction of buildings and
         structures in the new mining are. This will likely include a stop for building of
         new private houses, and a regulation that a municipalities will be allowed to
         construct buildings and structures in the public interest with special
         permission from MESP.

         Use and building restrictions and a safety zone will also be determined for the
         areas with old underground mining works (such a near Kosovo A TPP ash
         dump) which pose a potential public safety risk

5.1.6      Environmental Monitoring

           Typically, emissions monitoring from the power and mining projects will be
           part of the Operator's obligation. Monitoring results will be transferred to
           KEPA as being the competent authority.

           For the new power project the Project Company should provide also ambient
           monitoring since the future monitoring network of KEPA is at conceptual
           stage only at present.


5.1.6.1    Ambient air Monitoring

           An ambient air quality monitoring system shall be installed which covers the
           airshed of the power plants and the area around the mining activities.
           Parameters shall include at a minimum SO2, NOx, particulate matter and and
           heavy metals as per Council Directive 1999/30/EC of 22 April 1999 relating to
           limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate
           matter and lead in ambient air (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality.htm ) and
           Directive 2004/107/EC of the European Parliament And Of The Council of 15
           December 2004 relating to arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic
           hydrocarbons in ambient air (http://eur-
           lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:023:0003:0016:en:PDF )

           The monitoring shall cover an area which is determined by 50 times the stack
           height of the new Kosovo C power plant (see recommendation Pyöry 2007, Vol.1
           p35). The ambient air monitoring system shall be designed, installed and
           operated by the Project Company to best international practice (automated
           fixed and mobile stations and shall be compliant with the requirements given
           in the Annexes of 1999/30/EC) and specifications shall be set-up in
           coordination with MEM and MESP and the Kosovo Environment Protection
           Agency (KEPA). Monitoring results shall be transferred to KEPA and be made
           publicly available on are regular basis (webpage, monthly and annual
           reports).

5.2        INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING CONSULTATION, COOPERATION AND PARTICIPATION


5.2.1      Stakeholder Consultations for SDP

           The MESP, prior to finalization of the SDP, will make the official draft plan available
           to the other governmental institutions, the affected municipalities and the general
           public for review and comment at least for 2 months and public consultations on the
           plan will be held.

           The MESP then finalizes the SDP considering the inputs received during the
           consultations with the public and the other involved stakeholders. The SDP is then
           submitted to the Government for preliminary approval in line with the procedure
           prescribed by the Spatial Planning Law. The SDP will become legally binding by
           approval through the Assembly of Kosovo, and it will then be published in the
           Official Gazette of Kosovo.

           Once approved, the SDP and its instructions and restrictions must be taken
           into account by the spatial planning on municipal and local level. and
           restrictions set-out in the in the SDP being a superior plan apply to the local
           development.


5.2.2      Stakeholder consultation for Implementation of Projects

           Under the LPTAP, as part of the SESA activities in 2007 and 2008, initial public
           consultation meetings were held and community forums were established in
           the villages directly or likely affected by the mining and power plant
           developments.

       LPTAP will develop a schedule for continuation of these activities, aligned
       with the activities of the private Investor.

       Both the Kosovo C power plant and the mining development will require
       ESIAs to be undertaken by the private Project Company. For these activities a
       public consultation and disclosure plan (PCDP) which sets out the means and
       schedule for stakeholder consultation on the details of project development
       should be set up by the future Project Company. The consultation program
       shall be in line with both the mandatory requirements of Kosovo and the IFC
       Performance Standards and the respective guidance notes and good practice
       documents27. This includes provision of adequate public review periods and
       consultation meetings. The same applies to the resettlement action plans
       (RAPs) which will need to be set-up and implemented by the Project
       Company.

       With regard to the activities under the Clean-up and Land Reclamation
       project, KEK will need to set a PCDP as well to communicate and present their
       plans to the public and coordinate with other statutory stakeholders once
       results of the ongoing studies and investigations permit to make more
       detailed plans for land reclamation and post use.


5.3    IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE

       LPTAP will submit this Draft SDP, which reflects the present state of planning
       and decision making on the future developments in the area, as a concept to
       MESP for discussion and coordination. As explained above, important
       decisions about the new developments are pending, such as on the location of
       Kosovo C TPP will be made through the negotiations of the Government with
       the potential Investors. These will likely have been made by early 2009. The
       private Investor will need to set up a detailed mining plan in line with the
       power plant concept to be agreed with the MEM. The new mining plan (likely
       an update of the previous main mining plan) would show the exact land
       requirements and timing of land claim outlines. Decision is necessary if the
       present level of detail in planning is sufficient to bring the SDP on the formal
       approval track, or if the SDP should be finalized when more details of the ne
       power and mining development and of the cleanup and remediation project is
       available.

       Based on present timelines, it is estimated that the SDP could be formally
       binding in place by the end in 2009.

       After about 10 years, the SDP would need to be revised by the MESP and
       adapted to account for developments in the meantime.


5.4    ELEMENTS AND GUIDANCE FOR FURTHER RESEARCH

       While for the new Sibovc mine, the general proceeding has already been set
       out in the 2005 main mining plan, at this stage decisions for various issues
       with relevance for the SDP are pending:

           · Location, size and phasing of the new Kosovo C TPP;

           · Related to this: the pace of mining advance

           · Future of Kosovo A (and B) ash dump;

           · Responsibility for the resettlement of Hade;

           · Concept for reshaping and use of the outside overburden dumps and
                 decisions by KEK management on way forward;

           · Model for future use/users of lands which will be in the ownership of
                 KEK or the Project Company: e.g. land lease to agricultural
                 cooperatives for farming (as suggested in RPF);

           · Need for additional waste /hazardous waste treatment and disposal in
                 Mirash mine and respective special land use designation

           · Reordering of municipal boundaries after reclamation and
                 recultivation of present mining area

       Obviously, above issues have an influence of the land use specific settings
       which need to be made in SDP, such as land use target designation, special
       zones, restriction and condition setting.

Consultation and Social
Assessment workplan

                       Coordination and Consultation Plan (CCP)

A key element of the project will be the ongoing consultation with project stakeholders.
The Consultation plan below outlines the methods and process for the stakeholder
engagement. In accordance with the terms of reference we will conduct two formal public
consultation meetings. However, the nature and history of the project merits an ongoing
consultation process which will involve different types of consultation with different
stakeholders as described in the following plan. According to The World Bank's
Operational Policy on Environmental Assessment (OP.4.01 updated March 2007):

           "For all Category A and B projects proposed for IBRD or IDA financing, during the
           EA process, the borrower consults project-affected groups and local nongovernmental
           organizations (NGOs) about the project's environmental aspects and takes their
           views into account. The borrower initiates such consultations as early as possible.
           For Category A projects, the borrower consults these groups at least twice... In
           addition, the borrower consults with such groups throughout project implementation
           as necessary to address EA-related issues that affect them. For meaningful
           consultations between the borrower and project-affected groups and local NGOs on
           all Category A and B projects proposed for IBRD or IDA financing, the borrower
           provides relevant material in a timely manner prior to consultation and in a form and
           language that are understandable and accessible to the groups being consulted. For a
           Category A project, the borrower provides for the initial consultation a summary of
           the proposed project's objectives, description, and potential impacts; for consultation
           after the draft EA report is prepared, the borrower provides a summary of the EA's
           conclusions. In addition, for a Category A project, the borrower makes the draft EA
           report available at a public place accessible to project-affected groups and local
           NGOs".


           Objectives and Process:

           The objective of the public consultation process is to ensure good and clear
           communication between the project and all affected stakeholders as
           mentioned above. Additionally, regular consultation with certain groups
           should ensure that problems are identified early and solutions can be agreed
           with those affected and this in turn can develop trust between the project and
           local communities and be used as a type of 'social capital'if problems arise.

Stakeholder Identification

The definition of stakeholder that we used for identification purposes was taken from the
Reinvest report ­ Community Consultation Guidelines for Mining in Kosovo. It states that:
"Stakeholders refers to people who have an interest I mining activities. This includes people who
can influences activities , as well as those affected by them. Local communities are themselves
stakeholders. but stakeholders also include others from outside the local area, such as non-
governmental organisations, businesses, national government , municipalities and employees from
outside the community. These broader stakeholders need to be involved in the consultation because
they may...be responsible for delivering commitments made through consultation to ensure that
the community has sufficient capacity to get involved, or verifying information to ensure that it's
credible."

The first step in the consultation process is to identify who will be directly and indirectly
affected both positively and negatively by the project. This process will also include an
institutional mapping to help identify institutional capacity. An initial preliminary
stakeholder identification was undertaken in July 2007 during the `kick-off mission' to
Pristina. Further stakeholder identification and consultation was carried out by the social
assessment team 25-28 September 2007. Additional identification will be carried out from
22nd October to 1st November 2007, during the next mission visit of ERM. To date the
following groups and individuals have been identified as key stakeholders:

Stakeholders:' Key Issues and Levels of Interest and Influence

The stakeholders in this project are quite diverse and have a range of issues
that concern them. In order to deliver a more effective consultation
programme it is important to disaggregate the stakeholders by the key issues
and areas of influence. By doing this the appropriate methodology for each
stakeholder can be applied it also ensures that key issues are addressed from
the perspective of those who have raised them and are affected by them
Equally important is the inclusion of people from less powerful groups or
those who have little influence. These definitions are not an exact science and
are quite subjective. the represent perceptions of stakeholders'' importance by
others and may change and fluctuate during the evolution of the process. The
key principle, however, is that those who are regarded or regard themselves
as of low influence but high importance ,for example, should be consulted
more fully. For this reason the stakeholder analysis has been refined to map
the level of interest and influence that stakeholders have in relation to the
project . These are defined as:

·   Influence- the power a stakeholder has to help, stop or hinder the project

·   Importance ­ the priority given to the stakeholder's interests and needs by
    the project

·   Interest ­ the level of interest the stakeholder has in the project

The following two matrices summarise the key issues of concern for each
stakeholder and their levels of influence and interest in relation to the project
respectively.

           Previous Public Consultation and Stakeholder Engagement Activities1

During the preparation of the LPATAP there was considerable public consultation of key
stakeholders in order to introduce the Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework,
(see Annex 1). The project has also undertaken some informal public consultation in the
form of meetings with various stakeholders of the project including affected communities
in Hade village, employees of the mine and the relevant municipal authorities and some
non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). Some of the issues that have emerged from
these meetings have focused on employment after the decommissioning of the old mine
and opportunities in the new mine, resettlement, compensation and noise and air and
water pollution have also been raised. The following table details those who have been
consulted to date both for consultation and data gathering purposes:

Consultation Methods: Affected village meetings

Background and introduction



There are nine villages in the project area that have been and will continue to be affected
by the mine development. As these communities are key stakeholders of the project and
may incur some negative impacts consultation of individual villages is a crucial part of
the project's consultation process. The village community meetings will be the first stage
in the consultation process with affected communities. These meetings will provide an
opportunity for the LPTAP team and the affected communities to exchange information
and identify priorities. It is anticipated that these meetings will inform the methodology
of subsequent consultations with village communities in the project area and will
identify key issues to be further explored for the social assessment baseline.

Objectives:
Specifically the objectives of these initial meetings are to:


·   To establish a two -way dialogue

·   To identify key issues of concern of affected communities

·   To identify the most appropriate methods for future consultations with these
    communities

·   To identify the specific issues of different sectors of the community , especially those
    who may have be exclude from traditional consultation methods on the basis of
    ethnicity, age or gender

·   To discuss the following key issues:
           o Employment
           o Skills needs
           o Environmental Impacts on communities
           o Resettlement concerns
           o Project timetable
           o Consultation process

            Village meeting timetable and method

The village consultations will take place between 22-28 October 2007. In order to
maximise inclusion of a good cross section of communities, individual invitations will be
sent to key individuals in the villages ,such as Imams and head teachers. However, the
meetings will be open to all and public notices displayed in strategic areas within the
communities will be issued. Approximately 25-30 people per meeting are expected to
attend. In some of the more traditional villages, we have been advised by the
Municipality to hold separate meetings with women.

Additionally, depending on the turnout it may be necessary to hold separate meetings
with some non-Albanian ethnic minorities, such as Serbian and Roma communities. The
meetings will be held in the villages in schools or other suitable public buildings. Two
weeks prior to the meetings information about the project will be made available in the
Municipality office in Obliq and in schools in each village to be consulted. The social
assessment team worked closely with the Obliq          municipality to plan the method,

Stage Two village consultations in November/December

           Following the meetings of 22 October there will be a one day review and
           evaluation of the process . Identification of key issues such as impacts raised
           by communities or lack of participation of certain sectors of the community
           will be discussed. Once this information has been analysed a second stage of
           discrete and more intense consultation will take place in November or early
           December. This second stage of consultation will probably consist of
           individual interviews and household interviews focusing on the direct and
           specific impacts of the project on difference sectors of the community. The
           main objective of this subsequent consultation will be to gather more
           qualitative baseline information that will provide more detailed information
           for the aspirations chapter of the SESA.
           It us anticipated that these interviews and smaller meetings will take
           between 10-12 days.




Information disclosed:

The type of information disclosed should be relevant and written in a non technical
language. It is envisaged that the methods of disseminating information will vary
according to the needs of the public. Different stakeholder groups will have different
requirements or preferences of language and format. These methods will include non-
technical summary documents and reports including maps, oral and visual presentations.




                  Grievance Mechanism:

                  In addition to these planned consultations LPATAP needs to devise a
           mechanism whereby affected people can bring their grievances to the project
           for consideration and redress. A specific person or team for people needs to be
           named for this purpose.

Social Assessment Methodology

Objectives
    ·   To assess the social and economic impacts of the project
    ·   Identify positive and adverse impacts
    ·   To provide mitigation measures for adverse impacts
    ·   To establish a social management plan
    ·   To establish a monitoring programme
    ·   To identify additional specialist studies that maybe required

This is quite a complex project ,with many components, in a post conflict
country. Initial reviews of legislation and statistics have found that key
statistics, such as census, are sometimes more than 10 years old or incomplete.
Bearing this in mind a variety of methods will be used to provide as complete
a picture as possible of the social baseline in the project area and the potential
social and economic impacts.

Data Gathering:

·   Secondary Data gathering will include collecting data from Kosovo
    government sources such as The Institute of Statistics, Ministry of Social
    Welfare and Labour , Ministry of Mines and Energy, Obliq Municipality,
    Country studies from the United Nations, The World Bank and other
    donor organisations will also be utilised to provide a social and economic
    baseline of the project area and Kosovo as a whole.

·   Primary Data: Anticipated gaps in secondary data will necessitate
    supplementary information that will be drawn from primary data. The
    social assessment team will try to align data gathering methods with local
    information dissemination processes and decision-making approaches.
    The following methods have been used successfully in similar contexts to
    Kosvo:
             o   With affected village communities focus group discussions,
                workshops and individual interviews can be used.
                Depending on the social mores of the communities it maybe
                necessary to hold groups separately with men, women, and
                young people. Particular attention will be given to ensure that
                there ethnic minorities including the Roma, Serbian and other
                non-Albanian communities in the project area, are part of the
                data gathering process. It is hoped that local municipalities can
                assist in providing suitable venues for the larger focus groups.
                Although the aim of above the methods is to gather baseline
                information for the social assessment they will also provide
                further opportunities to inform communities on the process of
                the project and to gain a better understanding of people's
                concerns and attitudes about the project.




                                        19

Potential Social and Economic Impacts:

·  Based on initial discussions in July in Pristina the following potential
   impacts have been identified:


   ·   Jobs and employment
   ·   Retrenchment
   ·   Community water supplies
   ·   Resettlement and compensation
   ·   Social cohesion
   ·   Community services and infrastructure



Timeframe:
Edda Ivan-Smith and Carla Corlatti will be in Kosovo for the above activities
from 22 October -30 October. Secondary data gathering has commenced and is
ongoing. Primary data gathering such as interviews and focus groups should
be carried out during November and December.

    I.      METHODOLOGY

For the purpose of the research, the following methodological approaches were used:
        Quantitative Survey Research
        Qualitative Survey Research

Presented below is a description of the main research components, and the order in which the
various components were carried out:

    Quantitative research ­ Household survey

Prior to initiation of the field work in each settlement icluded in the sample, Prism's staff were
present at meetings organized with the general community in the respective settlements where
the field work took place. Primary aim of these meetings was to inform them about the
activities that were planned to commence in their settlement (implementation of a survey and
establishing of Community Development Forums). The information pertaining to the survey
included background on the methodology that was going to be used, description of the
information research project is interested to obtain from local inhabitants and agree with them
on the date when the field work can commence. These meetings were facilitated by other
stakeholders in the project (primarily Community Development Foundation), and all meetings
were generally well attended by local inhabitants.

On each such meeting opportunity was given to the participants to pose questions or provide
comments they consider relevant for all stakeholders.

Data gathering method              Personal interviews within the head of the household1


Instruments                        Questionnaire had been developed by Prism Research with
                                   input from the LPTAP


Surveyed population                Inhabitants of target settlements in the municipality of

Sample size                        1580 household


Representation                     All households/random walk technique2



Method of interviewing

The opinion poll was based on face-to-face interviews. The questionnaire contained both
open-end and closed questions. Interviewers read aloud the closed questions and possible
(coded) answers from the questionnaire or had given "show cards" to the respondents. In case
of the open end questions, the interviewers only read the question. Throughout the interview,
the interviewers held to a copy of questionnaire on which they recorded the answers.


Questionnaire structure and design

The questionnaire had been developed by Prism Research in close consultation with LPTAP.




1Whenever the head of the household was not present, the survey was carried out with a person who was
appointed by the head of the household (partner, oldest son, etc.). This information (for the substitution of the
information-provider) was explained to the general population in the General Community Meetings, where they
were informed that they need to appoint a family member ­ in case they are absent ­ on the given period when
interviewers visited each settlement to provide information about the household.
2Methodolody utilized in four locations that are planned to be dislocated (Hade, Dardhishte, Lajthishte and
Sibovc) consisted of surveying all households in these locations, whereas for others the approach of random
selection was used.

Sampling methodology and procedure

Households in the settlements of immediate and high impact from the mining activities were
surveyed all inclusively (disregarding the cases when the households were not inhabited or
encountered refusals from members of the households), whereas for other settlements a
random selection of the households was utilized.

Interviewers, interviewing procedure and quality control

The field team for this research included two team leaders, 15 interviewers, two field
controllers and one telephone controller. They had been selected based on skill, previous
experience, age, gender and regional origin. Coordinator and interviewers participated in a
few-hours-long training session that covered the detailed sampling procedures, interviewing,
question-by-question analyses and a role play exercise.

As mentioned, each interviewer had to conduct at least one interview with or without the
attendance of a coordinator. The work of interviewers had been controlled in two ways: once
the survey had been completed, controller started with field work to check on the basis of
information provided in the contact and control sheets if the interviewer followed the rules of
sampling, as well as his/her approach and behavior during the interview. Also, during the
conducting of the field work team leaders checked each completed questionnaire upon
submission to minimize the likelihood of incorrectly completed questionnaires or systematic
interviewer errors going unchecked. Besides, the chief data gathering coordinator conducted
some controls by phone from the Prism Research central office.

During the conduct of the opinion poll, interviewers did not encounter any major problems in
terms of the willingness of the population to participate, especially after the participants had
been previously briefed and received extensive explanation and information pertaining to the
purpose of the poll. Thus, the response rate (the percentage of respondents who completed the
survey in the total number of contacted potential or available respondents) stands at 80.24%
making the sample highly representative.

Table 2 contains information from the contact sheets related to the outcome of contact
achieved by the interviewers with the respondents.

Data processing and analyses

The entire data entry and processing procedure has been conducted in Sarajevo. A special
mask from the Survey System software program had been used for data entry.

After entry, the data had been transferred and analyzed with the SPSS program (Software
Program for Social Sciences) ­ a professional software package for public opinion surveys.
SPSS had also been used for data clearing and logical control, as well as for cross tabular
presentation of results.

Cross tabular results were used to analyze data from the household survey. With consideration
to the sample the results were produced by:
        ·  Total
        ·  Area
        ·  Urban/rural variable
        ·  Education
        ·  Employment status
        ·  Ethnic origin

    Qualitative research ­ focus groups discussions

As has been planned, the research included eight group discussions, the details of which are
provided in Table 3.

Group discussions were moderated by a well trained and experienced Prism Research
moderator who used Guidelines for Focus Discussions developed by Prism Research, and
LPTAP. The groups have on average lasted for about 60 minutes.

All the groups had good dynamics and were highly productive. Participation in discussions
was voluntary.

Discussions were audio recorded. The recordings were transcribed by professional typists.
The transcripts and moderator's observations and comments served as the basis for writing
some parts of this report.

    II.     MAIN FINDINGS

An overview of socio-demographic profile of households in the Municipality of Obilic project
area shows that most household members are married and are living under the same roof with
their spouses. Little over a half of the population of Obilic municipality are men, most
residents are in the age between 26 and 45 years and with completed four-year secondary
education. Most residents are literate, in that, the ethnic Albanian residents are literate in
Albanian and ethnic Serb residents in Serb language. As for their employment status, 21% of
the population are employed of whom only 13% in KEK.

Residents of the Municipality of Obilic usually engage in agricultural activity in order to
improve their financial situation in which way they secure an average 12.3% of the household
budget. Most household members in this area receive regular salary for their work and it
represents the most common source of income.

All residents of Obilic project area own land around their houses, that is, their yards whose
average size is 1,256 m2. Besides, some of them report owning arable land ­ fields, grassland,
forests, pastures etc. Results show that rural household have more land registered to their
name than what they really own. This is due to tradition of informal sales or giving of land by
the   means    of   oral/written  agreements    which    are  not    registered  with   official
institutions/cadastre. Households use their land for various purposes. Forests are most likely
to be used for business, yards for housing etc. They do not rent the land they own. Outside the
project area, they mostly own yards and significantly less forests and arable land.

Households in the project area mostly grow cereals and that mostly for own consumption and
significantly less for commercial purposes.

Talking about financial situation in the municipality of Obilic, most households report having
sufficient money for food, but facing difficulties to buy clothes. With consideration to their
total household income and assets, most respondents place their household in "below
average" category, while 16% believe they live on the existential edge. Most households
report monthly income of between 101 and 250 euros.

As for development plans, most households in the project area do not intend to increase the
total number of livestock nor commercial agricultural production. In line with that, a
relatively low percentage of respondents intend to start their own business (11%) and they
mostly live in urban areas. Most households have no plans for increasing their income.

Nearly all residents of the project area report being aware of the activities between local
authorities and international community representatives aimed at upgrading the operation of
the mine. Majority of these respondents learned about it from television while further one fifth
of them were informed by informal sources ­ friends, relatives and neighbors. Respondents
generally believe that they are well informed about these activities/plans with majority of
them saying that they are somewhat well informed about it. Most residents believe that

meetings with municipal authority representatives would be the most effective way to inform
population about planed activities to upgrade the operation of the mine.

Residents of the Obilic municipalities generally have a positive opinion about activities/plans
for building of Kosova C, that is, they voice their support for these plans. However, rural
population is more likely than urban to express support for these plans.

Over a half of residents of the project area express interest to participate in planning and
making of important decisions related to the project. Regarding their expectations, most
residents expect the building of Kosova C to have positive effects while only 9% of them
believe that it will have no effect on their neighborhood/village. Talking about economic
effects of the projects, over a half of respondents expect them to be positive and that the
building of Kosova C will increase employment opportunities. On the other hand, most
respondents expect the project to have a negative impact on the environment, but 21% of
them expect projects' environmental effects to be positive. Considering the chances that
building of Kosova C would require them to move away, most respondents, including a
greater number of those from rural areas, said it would represent a problem. Also, this would
be more of a problem for permanently employed respondents and farmers. Probability that the
building of Kosova C will lead to introduction of significant limitations on construction of
new buildings or significant reconstruction of existing buildings was also seen as a problem.

Regarding infrastructure, most households in the project area have running water with rural
households being more likely not to have a connection to the public water supply network. A
half of all households also own another source of drinking water. Regarding other utility
connections, most households have electricity connection, a somewhat lower percentage of
them are connected to the public sewage system while only about 16% have telephone
connection. Road network in the project area is relatively well developed, in that, little under
a half of households are connected to other parts of their village/city by asphalt roads and
another quarter of them by cement roads. Residents of the project area mostly use private
vehicles and public transport; while only rare of them use private bus and minibus lines. Most
households have access to public transport, but those which face difficulties in access are
more likely to reside in rural parts of the project area. Latter households say that the greatest
problems for them include absence of public transport or irregular lines.

A quarter of respondents (26%) report that they or other members of their households have
had some "serious" health problem over the past five years. In the case of illness, most have
visited a doctor in the nearest medical center while 39% of them were treated in a hospital.
Residents generally mistrust local medical centers and describe the quality of their service as
poor and related transportation costs as too high. Over the past 5 years, more than a tenth of
respondents from the project area have had cases of death in their household. Also, little over
a third of respondents are smokers.

Residents of the project area are closely connected and believe that the differences between
the people who live in their neighborhood/village are generally small, very small or inexistent.
This belief is supported by the finding that the respondents have shared meal with friends 9

times during the past month. Residents also share a high level of trust and majority of them
support the statement that most people in their neighborhood/village would be willing to help
them in the case of need.

With regards to important decisions about their neighborhood/village, most respondents trust
Kosovo Government, followed by those who trust municipal government.

Socio-economic indicators for the project

A number of indicators can be used to measure success, quality and impact of the project.
Project interventions are expected to result in a number of changes in different aspects of life
of the project area's current residents. Project impact can be measured by following
indicators:


   ·   Number of persons employed in the project area
   ·   Place of employment
   ·   Situation with household income
   ·   Income structure
   ·   Project area residents' education
   ·   Age structure of the population of the project area
   ·   Number of residents in the project area
   ·   Number of residents who moved away
   ·   Structure of residents of the project area
   ·   Structure of people who moved away from the project area
   ·   Infrastructure development
   ·   Health situation

    III.    RESULT ANALYSIS


    POPULATION/DEMOGRAPHICS


One of the research objectives was to gain an insight into demographic characteristics of the
households and inhabitants of the settlements in the municipality of Obiliq located within the
area where the potential investments on developing lignite exploitation and expansion of
electrical energy generation is planned to commence.

Survey results indicate that most inhabitants in the project area are married and live in the
same household with their spouses (42.5%), while less than a quarter of them are single
(24.1%).

As for the gender of surveyed household members, little over a half of them were men
(51.5%) and 48.5% were women. Most household members belong to the age group from 26
to 45 years (31.9%), 14.2% of them are in the age from 19 to 25 years and another 14.3% in
the age from 46 to 60 years.

Most surveyed household members in the project area completed four-year secondary school
(38.9%) or some grades of primary education ­ 20.8% of them have completed between 5 and
8 grades of primary education while 12.5% have at most completed four grades of primary
education. Only very rare surveyed household members belong to other education-based
groups (without formal education or highly educated) (see Graph 1)

Most people in the project area report that they can read and write (98.0%), in that, the Serb
inhabitants are literate in Serbian and Albanian inhabitants in Albanian language.

As for the employment status of the residents of the project area over the past year, most were
permanently employed (20.9%), followed in frequency by housewives (19.4%) and
unemployed (16.5%). Only 13.6% of the inhabitants were employed with KEK (see Graph 2).

Asked about private coal digging, all respondents said that no member of their household was
involved in it (99.3%).

Focus group data show that there are variety of ways how these families financially support
themselves. Whereas the main resource of the income is through regular payment the head of
the households (or any other member) receives while being employed in KEK, they also have
other supporting incomes that are not regular and seldom come as remittance or casual work
of other household members.

    "Usually families here have any member of the household working part-time. We also
    have family abroad, and they help occasionally." Grabovc, Youth

    "In our village there is huge unemployment. Families here are supported by other
    families that live in foreign countries. A remarkable percentage of people work in KEK as
    well, but all these that are employed are of older generations." Hade, Youth

    "Families here have any member working privately, on part-time basis. Very few work for
    public enterprises of institutions, predominantly in KEK." Dardhishte, Women



    ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

    HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN PROJECT AREA

Talking about different economic activities which contribute to their overall household
budget, most respondents mentioned agricultural production, followed by milk and dairy
production and production of meat. Rural households were more likely to engage in the above
activities. Respondents who engage in the above activities mostly generate income from the
sale of agricultural products. It is important to mention that only 0.6% of respondents
mentioned mining coal for heating in order to contribute to their household budget, while on
the other hand one third of households gain financially from this activity. This can be
explained by the fact that most respondents are mining coal for own consumption which is
why only a small percentage of them mention that it contributes to their household budget. On
the other hand, they sell surplus coal which is why a third of them report achieving financial
gains from this activity despite not doing it for commercial purposes. On average, 10% of
household income is achieved in this way. Almost the same number of households achieves
income from the sale of milk and diary products and from cutting wood for heating.

Although only 4.5% of households reported generating income from the sale of smoked meat,
they achieve 50% of their total income from that, which is directly related to the high
commercial price of this product. Situation with fresh meat was similar as relevant households
achieve nearly a third of their total income from its sale, which was again related to its market
price (see Graphs 3, 4 and 5).

   Result analysis by settlements in the municipality of Obiliq show that most residents of
   Grabovc and Hamidi (around 40.0%) increase their total household income through
   production of milk and diary products, while a somewhat smaller percentage of them involve
   in agricultural and meat production (20.0%). In other settlements in the project area most
   households engage in agricultural production and production of milk, while a smaller number
   of them produce diary product. The only exception to this was the settlement of Shipitulle,
   where production of milk was the residents' only way for increasing household income.
   Most residents in settlements of the municipality of Obiliq gain financially from the sale of
   agricultural products, milk and diary product. Exceptions to this are the settlements of Palaj
   and Shipitulle where residents do not involve in either of these activities with the goal of
   achieving profit. Also specific were the settlements of Lajthishte, where most residents sell
   dairy products, and Grabovc where the sales of agricultural products, milk, diary and meet
   products were equally represented. In the settlement of Hamidi, residents achieve earnings
   exclusively from the sale of milk and diary products, while most residents of Sibovc achieve
   the greatest share of their household income from the sale of smoked (50%) and fresh (40%)
   meet. Residents of Hade achieve the equal share of their income from the sale of meet, but
   another 30% of their income is earned through the sale of dairy products and a somewhat
   smaller percentage from the sale of milk and agricultural products. Residents of other
   settlements achieve most of their income from the sale of agricultural product and milk and a
   somewhat smaller share from the sale of dairy products. In the settlement of Grabovc,
   residents also achieve about 10% of their earnings from the sale of fresh meet.

Talking about ways of income generation, most residents of the municipality of Obiliq report
salary granted for their work as their main source of income, 17.4% of households survive on
pensions while 6.3% receive social assistance and 4.4% earn from occasional work (see
Graph 6). Results show that urban respondents, those with higher level of education (faculty
education or higher) and who are employed are more likely to mention salaries as their main
source of income. As could have been expected, unemployed respondents and housewives
were more likely than others to receive social assistance while respondents without permanent
employment were earning from part-time jobs.

Result analysis by different settlements in the project area show that salaries are the principal
source of income in all settlements, while a smaller number of residents generate income in
some other ways. Residents of the settlements of Obiliq, Sibovc and Shipitulle were more
likely than other respondents to receive social assistance and child endowment.

   NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND LAND USE

   LAND OWNERSHIP

Talking about land they own in the municipality of Obiliq project area, all respondents said
they owned land around their houses, that is, their yards (99.3%). Besides, some reported
owning arable land and fields (38.7%), grassland (8.3%), forest (6.5%) and pastures (2.0%).
Rural households were more likely to own and use the latter types of land (see Graph 7). All
households in all settlements in the project area own land around their houses (yard) while
some households in every settlement also own arable land or fields. A somewhat larger
percentage of households that own arable land or fields were found in the settlements of
Shipitulle (92.0%), Hamidi (71.4%), Lajthishte (65.9%), Sibovc (63.3%) and Palaj (53.8%).
More residents of Shipitulle and Hamidi than of other settlements also own grassland and
pastures. The percentage of residents who own forest was significantly higher in Shipitulle
(84.0%) than in other settlements.

m2 of yard, 8,401 m2 of arable land, 5.547 m2 of grassland and 10.265 m2 of forest (see Graph
8). Compared to households in other settlements, households in Palaj own largest pastures (on
average 22,500 m2), grasslands (on average 16,583 m2) and arable land or fields (on average
16,061 m2). In the settlements of Dardhishte and Sibovc, most land owned by households is
occupied by grassland and arable land, in the settlement of Hamidi by arable land, while
forests, arable land and grasslands were almost equally represented in the settlement of
Obiliq. In the settlements of Hade, Lajthishte and Shipitulle, most land owned by households
was occupied by forests.

Results show that the households have more registered land than they really own. This is due
to tradition of informal sales or giving of land by the means of oral/written agreements which
are not registered with official institutions/cadastre. Because of that, an average household
owns 3,285 m2 of pastures, while they have registered ownership of 4,505 m2 of this type of
land (see Graph 9). The most frequently cited reason for not registering ownership of land
with the cadastre is that it is still owned by previous owner who in most cases is respondents'
father or grandfather.

As for the use of land for different purposes, households in this area mostly use forests for
business purposes, which is in line with the information that a quarter of households in the
project area generate income by cutting wood for heating. Expectedly, yard area is mostly
used for housing, while one third of households use the forest area they own for the same
purpose. Grassland is used for livestock grazing, but also for commercial agricultural
production. Pastures are also used for livestock grazing. Arable land ­ fields, but also pastures
are used the most for subsistence farming (see Graph 10). Unemployed or self-employed
household heads were more likely to utilize their arable land­fields for subsistence farming.

Result analysis by different settlements in the project area show that most households in all
settlements use yard as part of their house (for residence), while in the settlements of Hade,
Dardhishte and Lajthishte residents also use this land for subsistence agriculture. Forests in
the settlements of Hade, Sibovc and Lajthishte were mostly used for subsistence agriculture,
while in the settlement of Shipitulle they were most likely to be used for business. Households
in the settlements of Obiliq and Dardhishte were more likely than others not to use the forests
they own. Households in all settlements mostly used their agricultural land for subsistence
farming, while the households from the settlements of Lajthishte and Shipitulle were also
using it for residential purposes. Grassland in the settlements of Hade, Dardhishte, Lajthishte
and Shipitulle was mostly used for subsistence farming, while in the settlement of Obiliq it
was equally likely to be used for farming and livestock grazing. Households in the settlements
of Palaj and Sibovc mostly use this land for livestock grazing.

Regarding the rental of land, results show that the households in the project area generally do
not rent their land. Only 0.7% of households rent their yards and 0.3% their arable land ­
fields. Further analyses of such a small number of households were not statistically justified.

Talking about the land they own outside the project area, most residents of the municipality of
Obiliq said that they own yards (3.0%) and forests (0.9%) as well as arable land ­ fields
(0.8%) (see Graph 11). On average, households own 629 m2 of yards, 14,214 m2 of forest and
13,210 m2 of arable land outside of the municipality of Obiliq.

    AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION

Households in the project area mostly grow cereals (20.3%) and fodder (5.8%), in that these
households were expectedly more likely to be rural. The above cultures are mostly used for
own consumption while a significantly lower percentage of households engage in commercial
farming (see Graph 12).

With regards to agricultural production, most households in all settlements in the project area
grow fruits while a somewhat smaller number of them also grow vegetables. The exceptions
to this were the settlements of Shipitulle and Hamidi where fruit farming and vegetable
farming were equally represented. In addition to fruit and vegetable production, households in
the settlements of Sibovc, Lajthishte and Hamidi were somewhat more likely than others to
also grow cereals, particularly in Sibovc where residents were also more likely than other
respondents to produce fodder/animal feed. Most residents in all settlements grow fruits,
vegetables and cereals for own consumption. The same was true in the case of industrial
agricultural products except in the village of Hade where they are produced exclusively for
commercial purposes. Most households in all settlements other than Obiliq produce

fodder/animal feed for own consumption. Households in Obiliq mostly produce it for
commercial sales.

Data from the focus group discussions show a similar picture. Most of the focus group
participants replied that the agricultural activities are very low in this region. In addition, they
mainly grow agricultural products for their home use and only a very few for any commercial
profit. Among the major reasons why the agricultural activities are of low intensity in
households whose members participated in the focus group discussion, is due to the lack of
agricultural land (their land which was previously used for agricultural activities has been
purchased by KEK in the last couple of years) and very low productivity of the land due to the
environmental reasons (mainly due to pollution from the current power plants and poor
productivity of the land they posses).

   "Land here is very rarely cultivated, and mainly it's for home consumption." Grabovc,
   Youth

   "In our village, almost nobody works the land. We don't have any land left, as KEK has
   taken our land with a condition: that condition was that they will also purchase the land
   where our houses are built. This happened six months ago, but this condition was still not
   fulfilled." Hade, Youth

   "We have tried to cultivate our land, but we gave up as we were not successful. The land
   is too dry and all our attempts failed to show any success." Hade, General Public

    "Many families were very active in the agricultural activities in our village. This was
    possible until the year 2002. We even had two farms in our village, but both stopped
    working, and also the population stopped working the land and later all our land was
    purchased." Hade, General Public

    "We cultivate our land, and we barely have harvest that can satisfy our family needs. The
    land here belongs to the third category, and it is not at all convenient to use it for
    agricultural activities." Grabovc, Youth

    "Almost all families in our village have a cow, for family needs. We have come to a
    situation that we can not feed the cow, as we don't have any land left. We will have to sell
    these cows very soon, as we don't have where to let the cow graze as we have no more
    land." Grabovc, Women

    "Even if you get engaged to provide best conditions for the harvest, it's worthless. The
    harvest are always way too dusty to eat them... they taste differently, as if the ash has
    entered into the harvest." Hade, Women

    "We used to be active in agriculture until 1999. The situation changed since then, and we
    do not work our land any more...A neighbor of mine used to have 360 plum trees, and all
    that area was destroyed as at some time it was decided the [coal] transportation tape to
    pass through his land." Crkvena Vodica, General Public

    "We have almost no agricultural activities. The best land that we had, all this land was
    bought from us... Some of the land that we still have, this land is not convenient for
    agricultural activities due to flooding that occur quite frequently. All land gets covered
    with water and it's impossible to remove the water from the land." Crkvena Vodica,
    General Public

    ECONOMIC POSITION OF HOUSEHOLDS

Talking about their financial situation, most respondents report that their household can afford
food but are finding it difficult to buy clothes (40.6%), 31.5% of households in the project
area have sufficient money for food and clothes and can even make some savings, but cannot
afford expensive things such as a refrigerator, while 22.7% of households do not even have
sufficient money for food (see Graph 13). In conformity with expectations, households where
the head of household is unemployed and has little education (uncompleted primary school or
without primary school) were more likely to lack money even for food, while on the other
hand, households where the head of household is permanently employed and has higher
education were more likely to have sufficient money for food and clothes and can even make
some savings, but are not in position to buy more expensive items.

Most households in the settlements of Hade, Lajthishte and Hamidi can afford food, but find
it difficult to buy clothes. Most households in Palaj live on the verge of poverty (cannot even
afford food) or have sufficient money for food, but are facing difficulties to buy clothes. The

number of residents who can afford food but not clothes and those who can afford both food
and clothes and even save some money, but are not in position to buy some more expensive
items was almost equal in the settlements of Obiliq and Dardhishte. Most residents of Sibovc,
Shipitulle and Grabovc belong to the latter category.

Judging by their household income and assets, most respondents describe their economic
situation as somewhat below average (37%), followed in frequency by those who believe it is
significantly below average (23%) or about average (19%). Further 16% of the respondents
believe that they live on the existential edge. Respondents from urban areas (42%) were more
likely than respondents from rural areas (36%) to report living somewhere below the average,
while rural respondents were more likely to report living on the existential edge (or 17.6% of
rural compared to 12.1% of urban respondents) (see Graph 14).

Differences had also been found between respondents with different levels of education ­
respondents who are living on the existential edge were more likely to be without any formal
education (37%) or with completed four grades of primary school (35%). Respondents who
placed their household in "significantly below average" (46%) or "somewhat below average"
(54%) categories were more likely to have three-year (vocational) secondary school, while
respondents with higher level of education, that is, with completed four-year secondary school
(18%), uncompleted higher or faculty education (24%) and completed higher (19%) or faculty
(42%) education were more likely to place their households in "about average" category.

Further analysis of the employment status variable have shown that the respondents who are
living on the existential edge were significantly more likely to select "something else" answer
(75%) compared to housewives (19%), pensioners (22%), unemployed ­ looking for a job
(34%), permanently employed (2%), occasionally employed (25%) and self employed
respondents (7%). Respondents who believe that they live somewhere about average were
more likely to be permanently employed (28%) than students (4%), pensioners (13%),
unemployed ­ looking for a job (9%) or occasionally employed (3%).

Analysis by settlements in the project area shows that each settlement has an almost equal
number of residents who believe that their households has "somewhat above average" income
and assets. Besides, the settlement of Palaj/Crkvena Vodica had the largest                 number of
residents who believe that their household lives on the existential edge (33%), while residents
of Shipitulle and Grabovc were more likely than others to believe that they have about
average income and assets (Shipitulle 32% and Grabovc 27%). Hade and Lajthishte had a
higher percentage of residents who believe to have "significantly bellow average" income and
assets (26% and 28% respectively).

Most households in the project area report monthly income of between 101 and 250 euros
(33%), little over a quarter achieve total monthly income of between 251 and 500 euros
(22%), 16% have monthly income of between 51 and 100 euros and little over a tent of
households report income of under 30 euros. A smaller number of households have total
monthly income of between 30 and 50 euros (8%), over 750 euros (6%) and between 501 and
750 euros (5%).

Besides, more households from rural than from urban areas report total monthly income of
under 30 euros (12% and 5% respectively), while urban households were more likely than
rural to achieve monthly income of between 101 and 250 euros (37% and 31% respectively).
Respondents with monthly income of over 750 euros were more likely to live in rural parts of
the project area (6% rural and 4% urban respondents) (see Graph 15).

Further on, respondents who report total monthly income of less than 30 euros were more
likely to be without completed secondary education (39%) than with eight-year primary
education (9%), four-year secondary education (11%), higher (3%) or faculty (6%) education
or incomplete primary or faculty education (12%). Respondents from the project area who
report monthly income of between 30 and 50 euros were most likely to be without primary
education (42%), while respondents with monthly income of over 750 euros were most likely
not to have completed secondary school or faculty (12%) or to have completed higher two-
year school (9%).

   As for the correlation between respondents' employment status and their total household
   monthly income, most respondents with incomes of less than 30 euros were students (47%) or
   have chosen "something else" answer (63%). Unemployed respondents and pensioners were
   more likely than others to achieve monthly income of between 30 and 50 euros (16% of
   unemployed and 18% of pensioners). Besides, respondents with monthly income of between
   51 and 100 euros were more likely to be incapable for work or with limited working capacity
   (57%) than students (9%), permanently employed (5%) or self-employed (7%). Respondents
   who report total monthly income of between 101 and 250 euros were more likely to be self-
   employed (57%), to work occasionally (45%) or have full-time job (39%) than to be
   unemployed (16%), pensioners or inactive workers (21%) or students (19%). Further on,
   respondents who report monthly income of over 750 euros were more likely to be
   permanently employed or pensioners (8% of respondents in each group) than unemployed and
   actively searching for a job (2%).

   With regards to monthly income, analysis by settlements show that the number of residents
   with monthly income of between 101 and 250 euros is the greatest in Obiliq (38%) and
   Dardhishte (37%) and lowest in Shipitulle (12%). Respondents who report total monthly
   income of less than 30 euros were the most numerous in Hade (21%).

   Most residents of the project area (88%) do not intend to increase the total number of
   livestock in the near future. Respondents who do intend to do so were more likely to be from
   rural than from urban areas (12% and 2% respectively) (see Graph 16).

   Respondents who do intend to increase the total number of livestock were more likely to have
   completed secondary education (15%) than to have completed four grades of primary
   education (2%), be without completed secondary or faculty education (5%) or with two-year
   higher education (4%). No differences had been established between respondents who intend
   to increase total number of livestock with regards to their employment status.

Respondents who intend to increase their agricultural production in near future were the most
numerous in the villages of Grabovc (33%), Sibovc (14%) and Hade (11%), while fewer than
8% of respondents from other settlements intend to increase the number of their livestock.

Also, most residents of the project area do not intend to increase commercial agricultural
production (90%). Respondents who do intend to increase their commercial agricultural
production were more likely to live in rural (9%) than in urban (2%) parts of the project area
(see Graph 17).

Further analysis have shown that the respondents who intend to increase their commercial
agricultural production were more likely not to have completed secondary school or faculty
(16%) than to have completed higher school (4%), eight grades of primary education (5%),
four grades of primary education (4%) or to be without primary education (4%). Besides, they
were more likely to be students than occasional workers. There were no other statistically
significant differences between respondents of different employment status.

Residents of the project area were asked if they intended to start their own business in the near
future and little over a tenth of them (11%) confirmed their intention to do so. These
respondents were more likely to be living in urban parts of the project area (see Graph 18).

Analyses have also shown that the respondents who intend to start their own business were
more likely to be without completed secondary school and faculty than to be without formal
education (4.2%) or with completed primary school. Also, respondents who intend to start
their own business were more likely to be self-employed (43%) than to be occasional workers
(14%), full-time employees (12%), unemployed and looking for a job (9%), pensioners (12%)
or students (11%) (see Graph 19).

Also, the analysis by settlements revealed that the number of respondents who plan to start
their own business was the greatest in Grabovc (33%), while 15% of respondents in each
Sibovc and Obiliq had the same intentions.

    A smaller number of respondents intend to increase their household income in some other
    way (4%) and they were all living in rural parts of the project area. It is also important to say
    that these respondents were more likely to be pensioners (18%) than unemployed (1%),
    students (2%) or housewives (2%). There were no differences between these respondents in
    terms of their education.

    As for the respondents who intend to increase their household income in some other way, they
    were the most numerous in Hamidi (29%) and less common in other settlements.



        COMMUNITY ATTITUDES AND CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROJECT

        KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PROJECT

    Nearly all residents of the project area (96%) report being aware of the activities between
    local authorities and international community representatives aimed at upgrading the
    operation of the mine as one of Kosovo's most important natural resources.

    The percentage of respondents who are aware of the activities by local government and
    international community to upgrade the operation of the mine was equal in different

settlements across the project area (over 90%), with the exception of Hamidi where the
percentage of such respondents was somewhat lower (86%).

Majority of these respondents learned about this from television (53%) while one fifth of
them were informed by informal sources ­ friends, relatives and neighbors (20%). Following
in frequency are the respondents who were informed by non-governmental organizations
(CDF or others) (10%). Other sources of information about the plan for the mines were
mentioned less frequently with radio being the least mentioned information sources (see
Graph 20).

With regards to the sources of information on the activities related to upgrading the work of
the mines in Kosovo, respondents whose primary information source was television were the
most and the least numerous in Obiliq (79%) and Shipitulle (4%) respectively, while this
information source was more or less equally used by residents of other settlements. On the
other hand, respondents from Shipitulle were more likely than others to have heard about
these plans from friends, relatives or neighbors (38%) while more respondents from Grabovc
(43%) than from other settlements received relevant information from NGOs (CDF and other
NGOs).

Residents of the urban parts of the project area were most likely to have heard of mine-related
activities from television (79%), while most rural respondents received relevant information
from friends, relatives and neighbors (25%). Besides, rural respondents were more likely than
urban to have received relevant information from non-governmental organizations (13% and
3% respectively).

Also, respondents without completed primary education (52%) were more likely to have
received related information from friends, relatives or neighbors than were the respondents
with primary education (26%), secondary education (18%), incomplete secondary school or
faculty (21%) or with two-year higher school (14%).

Most respondents believe that they are somewhat informed about these activities/plans (68%),
followed in frequency by those who believe that they are well informed (25%). Only a small
percentage of respondents believe that they are somewhat uninformed (6%) or not informed at
all (0.4%) (see Graph 21).

Further analysis have shown that the respondents who believe that they are well informed
were significantly more likely to have completed faculty (31%) or higher school (35%)
compared to respondents with completed four (9%) or eight grades (16%) of primary school.
Besides, a significantly higher percentage of respondents with four grades of primary
education (80%) than those with incomplete secondary education (59%) or completed higher
school (60%) said they were somewhat well informed. On the other hand, more respondents
with completed eight-year primary education (74%) than those without completed primary
education (57%) said that they were somewhat informed, while somewhat uninformed
respondents were more likely to be without primary education (26%) than with completed
secondary school (5%), higher school (5%) or faculty (2%).

Analysis by the employment status variable have shown that the respondents who said they
were well informed about activities related to the mine were much more likely to have chosen
"something else" answer when asked about their employment status (50%) than to be
housewives (8%) or self-employed (7%). On the other hand, housewives were more likely to

     say that they are somewhat informed than were part-time workers (65%), unemployed who
     are looking for a job (71%), pensioners (66%) and respondents who chose "something else"
     answer when asked about their employment status (see Graph 22).

     The analysis by settlements also found the greatest number of respondents who believe that
     they are well informed about the plans to upgrade the work of Kosovo mines in Shipitulle
     (50%), while respondents who believe they are somewhat informed about these plans mostly
     live in other settlements in the project area (from 60% to 92%).

     Majority of respondents believe that meetings with municipal authority representatives would
     be the most effective way to inform population of the project area about planed activities to
     upgrade the operation of the mine (31%), 22% of respondents opted for meetings with
     representatives of the mine, 16% for public meetings and gatherings and 13% for television
     while 12% said they did not know or have refused to answer when asked about the most
     effective way to disseminate relevant information. Brochures, leaflets, daily newspapers and
     radio were the least frequently mentioned information sources (see Graph 23).

Besides, respondents with completed higher school were more likely to have opted for public
meetings and gatherings (23%) than were the respondents without formal education (8%).
There were no other differences between respondents with different levels of education or
different employment status (see Graph 24).

More residents of Lajthishte than of other settlements (46%) believed that meetings with
municipal authority representatives were the best way to receive additional information about
these plans. The number of respondents who believed that meetings with mine representatives
were the best way to get information was the greatest in Grabovc (40%) while the number of
those who preferred public meetings and gatherings was the greatest in Palaj/Crkvena Vodica
(28%). Also, respondents from Palaj/Crkvena Vodica were more likely than respondents from
other areas to identify television as the most effective source of information on these plans
(27%), while respondents who preferred other sources of information were evenly distributed
across different settlements in the project area.

Focus group discussions show that the participants are somewhat well informed about the
Plan, although only few of them reported to have detailed informed about this project. In
general, participants reported that they know quite superficially the whole concept of the Plan
and it was a universal request to keep them informed about more details of the Plan.
Furthermore, whereas during focus groups with general public (which were mostly attended
by head of the households ­ which are predominantly males) participants declared to have
more information about the Plan, other focus groups (consequently, other social groups) were
somewhat less informed about the details pertaining to the Plan. As a result, more activities
were required to keep them informed about the status of the project. As expected, more eager
to find out more information about this Plan were the participants coming from the
settlements that are being planned to be dislocated. They were very insecure about their future
concerning their dislocation and what solution will be achieved to compensate their property.

    "We have been present in some of the meetings here...This project has been presented to
    us, details were shown." Lajthishte, General Public

    "We would like to know about this project as much as it is possible. We are informed only
    briefly, through different sources ­ mainly what we talk with our friends. We need
    intensive information and we need this as soon as possible." Grabovc, Youth

    "Information about the new power plant, about Kosova C... I have heard about this plan
    through media, television. If they would fulfill all the conditions, if they would implement

    this project using western standards, we would very much be in favor of seeing this power
    plant being built." Grabovc, Youth

    "We have heard about the Kosova C project very little. Our husbands have informed us
    briefly. It is necessary for us to have more information, as we are not being informed
    properly." Grabovc, Women

    "We would like to have more discussions and possibility to give our input about this
    project. All we see or hear about this project is through television." Grabovc, Women

    "Information about Kosova C we received mainly from people, family members and
    others, with whom we have discussed this issue. However, we need other forms of
    information, we need written documents. We need to see exactly what is the schedule, how
    will everything occur. We don't want to listen to any more things we are told, we want
    everything to be in written... We need to be informed what is going to happen to us."
    Hade, Women

As for the name of the new mine is concerned, there was no consensus how should the new
mine be named. Participants from each village had different opinions about the name of the
new mine, mainly favoring the idea that the new mine should take the name of the village
they come from, and only a few presented the idea for a more neutral name: Kosovo C Power
Plant/Mine.

    "For us it is unacceptable this mine to be called `New Mine'. It would have to be
    `Grabovc's Mine', as the mines started from here." Grabovc, General Public

    "The name of the project... it was reached on political basis. It should be changed. The
    place where are we now it is called Hade, and that is how the new mine should be called.
    The territory of Hade used to be even bigger, but it was taken from us by KEK." Hade,
    Youth

    "As for the name of this project, I would most support the name: Thermo central Kosova
    C." Dardhishte, Youth


    OPINION ABOUT PROJECT

Most residents of the project area have a generally positive opinion about the above
mentioned plan/activities, that is, voice their support for it (37% strongly and 35% generally
support the plan). Rural respondents were more likely to support (41% strongly and 35%
generally support) and urban respondents were more likely to oppose (13% strongly and 16%
generally oppose) the plan.

Grabovc (53%), Hade (48%) and Lajthishte (46%) had the greatest number of strong
supporters of these activities, while Dardhishte had the greatest number of respondents who
strongly oppose them (23%).

Further analysis have shown that the respondents with completed higher or incomplete
secondary education were more likely to strongly support the plan/activities (46% from each
group), than were the respondents with university degree (30%). Respondents without
completed secondary education were significantly more likely to support the plan than were
the respondents without completed secondary or higher education (24%).

Regarding the differences between respondents of different employment status, unemployed
respondents were more likely to somewhat support the plan (43%) than were respondents who
are incapable of work or with limited working capacity (14%), students (26%), housewives
(32%), pensioners (28%), occasional workers (35%) and respondents who chose "something
else" answer when asked about their employment status (13%). Besides, students are
significantly more likely to generally oppose the above plan (19%) than are pensioners (6%),
unemployed (5%) and occasional workers (7%). Main reasons why residents of the project
area support activities on upgrading the operation of the mine include opportunities for greater
production of electric power for export (63.0%), increased employment opportunities (46.8%)
and contribution to the overall economic development (30.3%). Residents of most settlements
in the project area support the Kosova C project because they believe it will contribute to
increased production of electric power for export, while those residing in the village of
Hamidi believe that the main positive outcome of the project will be increased number of
employment of opportunities. On the other hand, main reasons for opposing these activities
include fear of pollution (61.4%) and related health problems and unbearable noise (10.6%).

Main reason for opposing the activities of Kosova C project cited by respondents in nearly all
surveyed settlements are expected environmental problems, specifically pollution, while
residents of Shipitulle were more likely than others to identify as a problem the possibility
that they will have to move away.

Focus group discussions also reveal that most participants support the Kosova C project. For
some of them this is a possibility for them to pursue dislocation (especially of the residents of
Hade), whereas in other cases the new power plant was seen as a possibility to increase
electrical energy production as well as economic impact of this area and the whole country.
Few participants have presented their opinions that they support this project, as no matter
what their attitude and stand will be, the project will be implemented. Of those who oppose
the project, majority see the building of the new power plant as a further mitigation of the
possibilities to continue living in their settlements, primarily due to pollution the new power
plant will cause.

        «We support this project, we would like to see it happening. We hope we will all see
        the benefit of this project... it a national interests, it does not influence only the
        communities living here.» Lajthishte, General Public

        «I see this as a possibility to have more electrical energy, perhaps we will have a
        chance tohave more electrical energy for all the households that live here.» Gragovc,
        Youth

        «We live in very difficult conditions, as you can see. I don't know how will we be able
        to continue living here with a new power plant... The current power plants are
        creating such problems that it is making our lives here unbearable. With the new
        power plant, the pollution will become higher and it will not be possible to continue
        living here.» Crvkena Vodica, General Public

        «We know that Kosovo must be reconstructed, the industry must be renewed and
        factories must start working. However, the reconstruction of Kosovo must not damage
        and couse harm to the population.» Grabovc, Women

        «We support the project Kosova C, with all consequences that this project might have.
        Whether we support it or not, it will happen.» Hade, Youth

        «Kosova C will occur whether we like it or not, decisions have been made.» Hade,
        Women

Further down the line, there were few misconceptions mentioned about the current status of
the Plan, as well as some of its main attributes. Whereas for few participants the whole
implementation of the Plan was a completed mission (investor has been identified and all
other issues were resolved ­ it is a matter of time when the `work' will start), some were
highly suspicious if the new power plant will meet the required conditions for environmental
protection so they could pursue living in this area.

    "Whether we like it or not, Kosova C will be built. I know everything is planed and all
    things were decided. This is just going to be another chance for further misuse of funds
    and investment." Lajthishte, General Public

    "I received some information about this... I have heard the new power plant will be very
    advanced, it is going to be build using international standards. We have had cases here
    that many other activities were started and technology used and level of quality of these
    activities was promised to be very rigorous. We ended up with having same quality of
    work, no matter who was the donor or who did implement it." Hade, General Public

Further analysis revealed that the participants with incomplete secondary or faculty education
(82%) were much more likely than other respondents to be somewhat or very interested to
take part in planning and making of important decisions related to the project implementation.
Some differences were also identified between respondents of different employment status
with self-employed respondents being significantly more interested to involve in the project
(86%) than respondents who are incapable or work or have limited working capacity (29%),
who are unemployed (65%), occasionally work (67%) or those who chose "something else"
answer when asked about their working status (38%).

Analysis by settlements show that Hamidi and Grabovc have the greatest number of
respondents who are interested to participate in planning and making of important decisions
related to implementation of the project (50% and 53% respectively), while the greatest
number of totally disinterested respondents were living in Palaj/Crkvena Vodica (49%).

    EXPECTATIONS FROM PROJECT

Most respondents expect the building of Kosova C to have positive effects (32% somewhat
and 36% very positive), little over a tenth of them (12%) expect it to have negative effects and
9% expect it not to have any economic effects on their household. Urban respondents are
more likely not to expect building of Kosova C to have any economic effects on their
households, while rural participants are more likely to expect negative effects from it (see
Graph 27). Main reasons why respondents expect positive economic effects of the project
include increased employment opportunities and increased quantities of electric power for
export.

Respondents with completed higher school (19%) were more likely than respondents with
completed four (4%) or eight (10%) grades of primary education to believe that the building
of Kosova C will have a negative impact on their household. On the other hand, more
respondents with vocational education (85%) than with completed higher school (60%) or
faculty (48%) expected positive effects from building of Kosova C. Among respondents who
do not expect building of Kosova C to have any impact on their household there was the
greatest frequency of persons with university diploma (20%), followed by those who have not
attended secondary school (5%) and those who completed four (4%) or eight (10%) grades of
primary education.

More respondents who selected "something else" answer when asked about their employment
status (75%) than self-employed respondents have negative expectations from building of
Kosova C. Respondents who are looking for work (77%) were more likely than housewives

(44%), pensioners (66%) and currently employed respondents (64%) to have positive
expectations from Kosova C.

The greatest number of respondents who expect Kosova C project to have very positive
economic effect on their household was found in Hamidi (50%), Hade (46%) and Lajthishte
(44%), while respondents who expect the project to have negative economic effects on them
were evenly distributed across different settlements. Also, Hade and Lajthishte had the
greatest number of respondents who expected the building of Kosova C to have very positive
economic effects on their settlement/village (52% and 45% respectively), followed by
Shipitulle where above opinion was shared by 44% of the respondents. Lajthishte (68%),
Palaj/Crkvena Vodica (67%) and Sibovc (64%) had the greatest number of respondents who
expected the project to have very positive impact on their municipality. On the other hand,
Grabovc had the greatest number of respondents (27%) who expected the project to have very
negative impact on their municipality.

Surveyed residents of the project area had also been asked about effects they expect from
building of Kosova C on their neighborhood/village. Majority of them (72%) said that they
expected it to have positive effects, in that, urban respondents were more likely to have
positive expectations while rural respondents were more likely to expect building of Kosova
C not to have any economic effects.

Further analysis revealed that the respondents with incomplete secondary or faculty education
(28%) were more likely than respondents with completed secondary education (16%),
vocational school (8%) and those without formal education (4%) to expect negative effects on

their area from building of Kosova C. There were no statistically significant differences
between respondents of different employment status.

Regarding the economic effects of Kosova C on their municipality, little over a half of
respondents (53.0%) expected them to be highly positive while 27.8% said they expected
somewhat positive effects. Only 10.7% of respondents expected negative effects on their
municipality from building of Kosova C (see Graph 29).Respondents who live in urban areas
were more likely than respondents from rural areas to expect highly positive effects on their
municipality from building of Kosova C. Employed respondents were more likely to expect
negative and unemployed respondents to expect positive economic effects from Kosova C.

Majority of respondents (83.4%) believe that the building of Kosova C will create more
employment opportunities for the residents of Obiliq municipality, while a significantly
smaller number of them (4.3%) believe that it will have no impact on the employment
situation (see Graph 30). Results show that this opinion is shared by majority of respondents
regardless of their socio-demographic profile.

Majority of residents (between 70% and 90%) in all settlements in the project area believe
that the building of Kosova C will create new employment opportunities, in that the
percentage of such respondents was the lowest in Shipitulle (60%) which had the highest
number of respondents (24%) who expected the project not to have any impact on the job
market.

Participants in the focus groups also show that their expectations are that the job opportunities
will increase. However, they are skeptical how the recruiting procedure will be organized, as
they have mentioned many cases that workers in the power plant are being recruited without
any criteria. Their hopes are that the foreign investor will have the possibility to organize
recruitment procedures, as they see this to be as a condition that the employment will be
provided to those who deserve it the most. In this regard, they all agree that they (in each
group, all participants presented their village having the most negative impact from the mine
activities) should be given priority on employment opportunities, as they are the ones who are
suffering the most from the air pollution, or they were previously excluded from employment
opportunities or municipal authorities did fail to provide conditions for normal living (poor
infrastructure).

        "There should be more job opportunities, if Kosova C starts to be constructed.
        However, I don't know how will things be organized, who will take the responsibility
        to hire people and how will things go. We are all witnessing that people from other
        municipalities, even the most distant ones, are being recruited in the current power
        plant, whereas we are omitted. We live very close to the power plant, we breathe in the
        polluted air, live in extreme difficult conditions, and we don't even get the same
        treatment as the others [coming from other municipalities] do." Hade, General Public

        "I truly hope that the foreign investors will organize recruitment, in that case only I
        would be sure that they value people who are had working and they would conduct the
        recruitment properly... Government should also be present in the process; they should
        seek for fair treatment of applicants is applied to all." Dardhishte, Women

       "For us it is important the issue of residence, what will happen to our houses and
       employment. Not just for our husbands, but for ourselves as well. We are all able to
       work, but we were never considered when people were recruited in the power plant."
       Hade, Women

       "There isn't any village that is more polluted than our village. Roads, air pollution,
       sewage... everything is very bad." Dardhishte, Women


Talking about effect of Kosova C on the environment, majority of respondents expected it to
be negative (58.3%), primarily because of the pollution which they fear will destroy the
environment, while another 20.8% expected it to be positive. Only 5.8% of the respondents
expect building of Kosova C not to have any impact on the environment (see Graph 31).
Results show that rural respondents are more likely to expect building of Kosova C to have
very positive impact on the environment, while urban respondents are more likely to expect it
to have somewhat positive or somewhat negative effect on the environment. There were no
differences by other socio-demographic variables.

In terms of the impact of Kosova C on the natural environment in their settlements, Hade had
the greatest number of respondents (24%) who expected it to be very positive, while Hamidi
had the greatest number of respondents who expected it to be very negative (77%).

Considering the chances that building of Kosova C would require them to move away, most
respondents, including a greater number of those from rural areas, said it would represent a
problem (66%) while 30% of respondents, including a greater number of those living in urban

areas, said they would not have a problem with moving (see Graph 32). Permanently
employed and self-employed respondents ­ farmers were more likely to object to resettling
due to the building of Kosova C, while unemployed respondents were more likely not to have
problem with moving.

Focus group discussions support the data obtained from the household survey, where most of
respondents claim that they are skeptical about environmental impact the new power plant
will have. Since all participants complained about current conditions pertaining to the
environmental issues in their settlements, the construction of a new power plant is expected to
have further impact on the environment. Since it is a coal-based power plant, the belief of
these participants is that it is not possible for the power plant to be environmental friendly.

        «Pollution with the old power plants is enormous... Since the new power plant will
        also use coal to produce electricity, then it will not have any positive impact in the
        environment, and on the health of the people living here, that is for sure.» Crkvena

With regards to another aspect of building of Kosova C which would have an impact on the
lives of the people in the project area - the likely introduction of significant limitations on
construction of new buildings or significant reconstruction of existing buildings - little over a
half of respondents (54%) said that it would represent a problem for them. Urban respondents,
as well as respondents who are self-employed in farming or cattle breading or who have
occasional jobs were more likely than others to see this as a problem. A somewhat lower
percentage of respondents (41%), including a greater number of rural residents, said they did
not expect this to be a problem (see Graph 33).

Respondents who saw possible need to move away due to the project as a problem were the
most numerous in Hamidi (43%) and Obiliq (39%) and least numerous in Dardhishte (16%).
Also, Palaj/Crkvena Vodica and Hade had the greatest number of respondents who said that
introduction of significant limitations on construction of new or reconstruction of old
buildings related to the building of Kosova C would be a problem (54% and 49%). Shipitulle
had the least number of respondents supporting the latter opinion (12%).

Most participants in the focus groups support the idea of dislocation, as all the villages
included in the focus groups witness negative impact the current power plant has on their
lives. In this regard, the explicit request coming from majority of focus group respondents in
two settlements, village Hade and Serb community living in Crkvena Vodica, was the
immediate dislocation of all households living in these two villages. Their desire comes as a
result of current pollution, extensive noise coming from current activities of the power plant
(including frequent movement of the KEK's transportation vehicles, which also represent a
danger to children who have to walk down the same road as it is used by these transportation
vehicles) and insecurity about the future progress of the new mine. Respondents from the
village Grabovc also reveal great need for immediate intervention, as the KEK's excavator is
operating very near their houses and the noise coming from operation of this enormous
vehicle is continuous and causes frustration.

        «The situation is serious, it needs immediate attention. We need to get dislocated from
        here. We can not live in suspense all our lives.» Hade, General public

        «We do not have sufficient place to live, all our family are situated in a single
        bedroom. We could not invest any money on our house, as we have been told that we

        are going to be dislocated. We have been waiting for such a long time, and we still do
        not know what is going to happen to us.» Hade, Women

        «The pollution here is very high, it makes living her impossible. The situation is
        becoming worse... There is a transportation tape used by the power plant that goes as
        close as 10 meters from our houses. Dislocation needs to be addressed as soon as
        possible.» Crkvena Vodica, General Public

        «We did not use to have these problems before the war. Our situation used to be very
        good; we had a far better life before. We did not have any noise coming from nearby
        vehicles, the pollution wasn't so bad. All these circumstances that were created with
        the expansion of the mine area represent our biggest problems we face now, we were
        find just about a year ago... We can not sleep at night, and neither can we dry our
        clothes outside... everything gets dirty as soon as we put our clothes to dry in the open
        air. Even if we clean the windows, in just a few minutes you can write your name in
        the windows as a layer of dust creates very quickly. Our home chores become so
        difficult to complete.» Grabovc, Women

On the other hand, some requests from participants were very clear as far as the dislocation is
concerned: they want to start immediately the discussions about the dislocation, they want to
receive cash for all their property that is situated in the territory where the mine will be
situated and they do not want to have no limitations where to dislocate.

    ,,We are interested to sell our land, there are no conditions here to continue living ­ it has
    become unbearable. We want to receive cash money, I don't want my land to be
    compensated with another land. I don't want to move within municipality of Obiliq, as
    everywhere you go in all this municipality, pollution is above normal." Crkvena Vodica,
    Youth

    ,,If the municipality (authority) would compensate all our land with an equal value of the
    one that compensates our land that we use for housing, than this project would be
    acceptable for us." Dardhishte, Women

    COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES

    PROJECT AREA INFRASTRUCTURE

Most households in the project area (86.9%) have running water. Households without
connection to the public water supply network are more common in rural than in urban parts
of the project area (16% and 4.1% respectively) (see Graph 34). A half of all households
(48.5%) also have another source of drinking water and these are equally the households with
and without running water, but are more likely to be found in rural parts of the project area.

Result analysis by settlements show that the greatest problems with running water existed in
Sibovc, where 36.7% of households reported not having running water, Shipitulle where

16.0% of households were without running water, as well as in Hade and Dardhishte where
respective 14.4% and 11.0% of households were without running water. Water supply was the
best in Palaj and Grabovc where all households had running water.

Regarding other utility connections, most households or 97% have electricity connection,
46.5% are connected to the public sewage system while only 15.6% have a telephone
connection. Rural households are more likely not to have utility connections (see Graph 35).

Majority of households in all surveyed settlements have electricity connection, but minor
problems with electricity supply were reported in Hade, Sibovc and Lajthishte were respective
9%, 3.5% and 3.8% of households were without electricity connection. Telephone connection
represents a significantly greater problem, especially in Hade, Dardhishte, Sibovc, Lajthishte,
Shipitulle and Hamidi where over 90% of households were without a telephone line. Little
over a half of households in the project area (52.9%) were not connected to public
sewage/wastewater drainage system. The situation with sewage/wastewater drainage in all
settlements was poor, with the exception of Obilic where 98.3% of households did not
experience this problem. Worst situation was registered in Shipitulle, Grabovc and Hamidi
where not a single surveyed household was connected to public sewage system.

Road network in the project area is relatively well developed. Little over a half of households
(47%) are connected to other parts of their village/city by asphalt roads and another quarter of
them (26%) by cement roads. Other households are still connected by macadam roads (25%).
As could have been expected, asphalt roads exist in almost all urban parts of the project area;
while asphalt, cement and macadam roads are equally represented in rural parts of the project
area (see Graph 36).

Most households from Obilic, Palaj, Sibovc and Grabovc report being connected to other
parts of their village/city by asphalt roads, while most households from Hade and Lajthishte
report being connected by macadam roads. Dardhishte had an almost even number of
households connected to other areas by asphalt roads and those connected by clay roads
(about 40% each), while Shipitulle had an almost even number of households connected by
macadam and those connected by clay roads. Most households in Hamidi were connected to
other areas by clay roads.

Residents of the project area mostly use private vehicles and public transport. Private bus and
minibus lines are less common and, in contrast to public transport, they are less used by rural
population (see Graph 37). Employed respondents are more likely to use private vehicles
while unemployed respondents and students are more likely to use public transport.

Private vehicles were used the most in Shipitulle and Grabovc were public transport was used
the least. Private vehicles were least used in Hamidi, where public transport and
buses/minibuses were used the most.

Most households (81.5%) report having access to public transport. Households which face
difficulties in accessing public transport are more likely to live in rural parts of the project
area (18.9% percent of rural compared to 6.7% of urban households). Absence or irregular
lines are the most frequently reported problems with public transport. A quarter of all (rural
and urban) households (23.5%) report having problem with distance of public transport stops.

Residents of Hamidi, Hade, Palaj and Dardhishte were the most likely to report experiencing
problems with public transport. Talking about specific problems, residents of Hamidi and
Dardhishte were the most likely to mention distance of public transport stops, while residents
of Hade and Palaj were the most likely to mention absence of necessary public lines.

On average, public transport stops are located at 23 minutes walking distance from these
respondents' home compared to average 15 minutes walking distance for general population
and 14 minutes walking distance for respondents who do not report problems with distance
of public transport stops.

Residents of Shipitulle need most time to arrive at the nearest point stop of the public
transportation. On average, they need 37 minutes of walk, whereas the residents of Lajthishte
need least time, on average 4 minutes.

Focus group participants replied to have very poor community infrastructure. Most of them
complain about poor roads, poor supply with electricity (either for long-lasting power cuts, or
for week intensity ­ it is not possible to turn on household appliances due to low power
intensity), as well as lack of running water.

Beside the poor condition of the roads, participants complained that the same roads are used
for purposes of KEK's transportation vehicles and these roads are not safe to travel through.

From other public utilities, taping water is mostly present during winter months, whereas the
water from the wells, as a water resource that was quite present among all focus group
participants, wasn't for consumption, and in some cases participants even reported such
water should not be used for any purpose for the household use whatsoever.

    "The road to our village is very bad. It has always been like this. Power supply is
    changeable, there is no time table based on what we could know when the power cuts are
    due... As far as the water is concerned, when it rains, the rain gets mixed with the
    running water, and we can not drink it at that time." Hade, Youth

    "Our roads are in a terrible condition... Beside, when children go out in the street, they
    get scared from all the big trucks that move here all day. They frequently move around
    until late at night, some times even seven o'clock in the evening." Grabovc, Youth

    "For us, as a young group, in this village we lack a playing field, taping water, road that
    is safe to use... we almost need everything." Grabovc, Youth

    "Water in our village is of very poor quality, we shouldn't drink it. However, we have no
    other options and are must use that water for all household purposes. My wife had to
    have a surgery, to remove stones from adrenal, which were caused by the water she
    drank." Lajthishte, General Public

    "Water is not drinkable, and we sometimes need to go to another source to fill in the
    canisters with water that we can use for drinking." Dardhishte, Women

    "We have the water-supply system, but there is not water in the tubs. We can not use the
    water from the wells as they are contaminated (with phenol). As for the electricity supply,
    we have similar problems just like all Kosovo has." Dardhishte, Women

Public transportation was considered as a real problem in few settlements, although majority
of them reported that they have good transportation for the city.

    "Bus transportation is reliable; we have busses coming every half an hour." Women,
    Grabovc

    "There is only one private bus that goes to Obiliq. He doesn't have a time table, and he
    sometimes does not work for couple of days. We must rely only on our own private
    vehicles to travel to other places." Hade, General public

    "We have the bus that goes to Gracanica twice a week, leaves at 8 o'clock in the
    morning. We use the school bus, which takes secondary school children to school every
    day... The train used to operate before, but it stopped couple of months ago. The train
    would take us all the way to north of Kosovo." Crkvena Vodica, Youth

    HEALTH

    HEALTH STATUS OF THE POPULATION

A quarter of respondents (26%) report that they or other members of their households have
had some "serious" health problems over the past five years with the most common illness
being respiratory, heart and lung diseases, cancer, mental problems, diabetes etc. Another
60% of respondents report only "usual" illnesses in the same period (such as flue, cold,
toothache etc.) while 14% says they had no health-related problems.

Over the past five years, the most common health problem in Hade, Palaj and Grabovc were
respiratory diseases and in Dardhishte and Sibovc it was cancer.

Households in Shipitulle, Grabovc, Palaj, Dardhishte and Hamidi were the most and those in
Hade the least likely to report health problems experienced by their members.

A half of respondents who had (any kind) of health problems over the past five years have
visited doctors in the nearest medical office, 39.4% were treated in a public hospital while
21.2% of them received assistance from a private doctor, that is, a private clinic. Also, 44% of
respondents visited pharmacies. These respondents were the most likely to have also visited
the nearest medical office or hospital.

When experiencing health problems, most respondents visit the nearest medical office, which
was particularly the case in Dardhishte, Shipitulle and Hamidi. Residents of Palaj were the
most likely to visit hospitals while residents of Grabovc usually go directly to pharmacies.

Respondents who did not seek medical attention despite being ill mention various reasons for
that. However, their responses clearly show that local medical offices, unlike other health
institutions, enjoy very little trust. Most respondents report not having visited local medical
office because they would have received poor service there, but also because related
transportation costs were too high. Services of other health institutions were not used because
there was no need for that (hospitals and pharmacies) or because they are too expensive
(private doctors/private clinics) (see Graph 38).

Over the past 5 years, over a tenth of respondents from the project area (15%) have had cases
of death in their household. In most cases it was the death of one person (range from 1 to 4)
usually due to natural causes and cancer. In line with the information about the nature of
health problems in Dardhishte and Sibovc, cancer was the most common cause of death in
these settlements over the past five years.

Little over a third of respondents (35.7%) as well as a quarter of their household members are
smokers. Households in which all (1.6%) or majority (2.7%) of members are smokers are rare
and households in which some of the members smoke are the most common.

Data from the focus group show that the quite a large group of the participants coming from
the villages included in the sample for focus groups have serious health problems. Almost in
every focus group people could name either someone from their immediate family or
extended family who has had serious problem in the recent years. Main reasons of complaint
are problems with the aspiratory system and cancer.

    "Cancer is quite common nowadays. Especially among the younger generations... lungs
    cancer, as well as cancer in the blood." Hade, Women

    "We mostly suffer from adrenals. Among children, bronchitis is quite common ­ it's all
    due to the air [that is polluted]." Hade, Women

    "Whenever we go to my brothers' house, the air there is clean and my children always get
    sick. They can not cope with the clean air, as they are used to polluted air." Grabovc,
    Women

    "Children get sick very frequently, they get a cough which lasts for weeks." Dardhishte,
    Women

    "Mean age of the people living in this region was 75 years of age. However, the situation
    changed drastically, we have people retiring at the age of 40 or 50, due to poor health
    conditions." Crkvena Vodica, General Public

    "There is prevalence of asthma among the younger generations." Crkvena Vodica, Youth

    "My brother's son when he was born, he got bronchitis... all because of dust." Hade,
    Youth




    COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION/SOCIAL CAPITAL

Differences between people in neighborhoods/villages

Neighborhoods/villages in the project area are homogenous and their residents are closely
connected. Asked about differences between people (of any kind: in terms of their wealth,
income, social status, ethnicity, language, religious or political beliefs, age, gender) in their
neighborhood/village, respondents generally said that they were very small or inexistent (see
Graph 39). A very small percentage of respondents (1.3%) reported that social and economic
differences (including differences in land ownership and education) were causing problems.

Majority of respondents in all settlements agree that there are no differences between the
people who live in the same village, while a significantly smaller number of them believe that
there are some smaller differences. Residents of Palaj were somewhat more likely than other
respondents to report presence of differences (in wealth, income, social status, ethnicity or
language), but they did not believe that these differences created any problems.

A smaller number of them (23.8%, N=5) said that such problems have resulted in post-war
cases of violence.4




4These five people live in different neighborhoods/villages: two live in Hade, and one each in Dardhishte, Obiliq
and Crkvena Vodica.

Focus group participants also show that the community members get along quite well. They
have not replied to have had any misunderstanding or conflict with their cohabitants, and they
present their fellow villagers in a positive light. In general, participants were mostly relying
on the relations they have with the other households of the same neighborhoods, which in
most cases come from the same family (tribe, all bearing the same surname).

       "Relations between families in our neighborhood are very good." Grabovc, Youth

       "We have not had any conflict in our village, people respect one another and we can
       not complaint that we have faced any situation where families had bad relations."
       Dardhishte, Women

       "Relations between people in our village are very good; we don't have any
       problems... Our relations with the Albanians are also quite good. Until the war we
       used to have better relations, our parents used to have more Albanian friends.
       Nowadays, we only greet one another when we meet on the street and we didn't have
       any problems with one another for a long time." Crkvena Vodica, Youth

       "Even though our houses were burned during the war, when we came back we
       managed to rebuild them. We are all of one tribe in this village and we have very good
       relations." Grabovc, Women

Socializing

Above results are supported by the finding that respondents have shared meal with friends 9
times during the past month (results range 0-80), either in their own or their friend's home or
in a public place (café, restaurant). Although there are no statistically significant differences
between residents of rural and urban parts of the project area, urban respondents were more
likely to have (also) socialized with members of other ethnic or religious groups, while rural
respondent mainly socialized (only) with persons of different social or economic background
(see Graph 40).

Result analyses by settlements also show that the residents of Palaj were the most and
residents of Hamidi the least likely to have shared meal with a friend over the past 30 days.
Residents of Obilic and Palaj were more likely than other respondents to have shared meal
with friends of different ethnicity or religion over the past month.

A high degree of trust and mutual helpfulness in neighborhoods/villages in the project area
was confirmed by the fact that most respondents fully (42.2%) or somewhat (36.6%) agreed
with the statement that most people in their neighborhood/village were willing to help them in
the case of need. Also, a small number of respondents fully (4.1%) or somewhat (15%) agreed
with the statement that they had to be alert in their neighborhood/village to avoid being taken
advantage of. Trust in neighbors was somewhat lower in rural areas (see Graph 41)5



5 For the purpose of graphic presentation of results, levels of agreement with the above statements had been
numerically coded: "fully agree" was assigned value 5, "somewhat agree" value 4, "neither agree nor disagree"
value 3, "somewhat agree" value 2, "disagree" value 1. After coding, arithmetic mean value was calculated and
presented on the graph.

Results show that the above opinion is shared by respondents from all settlements in the
project area, as well as that there are no significant variations between respondents from
different settlements.

When it comes to making important decisions about their neighborhood/village, most
respondents trust Kosovo Government (59.6%), followed by those who trust municipal
government (23.2%) (see Graph 42). Some of the respondents, who chose "something else"
answer, stated that they do not trust anyone in this.

In relation to making important decisions about their village/town, residents of all settlements
in the project are have the most trust in Kosovo Government, but the residents of Sibovc and
Lajthishte are a bit more likely than others to also trust local administration, that is, municipal
authorities.

Participants in the focus group discussions show that they trust Kosovo government more to
reach decisions about the settlement they live as well. However, the focus group participants
also show that they have stronger trust for the local village officials who are elected or would
be elected to defend their interest in the future, pertaining to any discussions or need to make
important decisions about their settlement.

       "We have good relations with the municipal authorities, but we would trust the
       Kosovo government more." Grabovc, Youth

       "Our relations with the municipal authorities are not so good. We would not trust
       municipal authorities to bring any important decision that pertains to our village. We
       were tricked many times in the past, and municipal authorities were not defending our
       interests. We would trust more someone who is elected from our community." Hade,
       Youth

       "Relations between the people of our village are very good, but we don't have good
       relations with the municipal authorities. We have not received any help from them,
       they never came to meet ask about our needs and to address them." Dardhishte,
       Women

       "We have received support from municipal authorities; they tried couple of times to
       assist us when we were complaining about the problems we are facing. However, we

                are having the problem with KEK, and municipal authorities can not do much about
                these problems that KEK is causing." Grabovc, Women

                "We mostly have trust on our local representatives. However, the old establishment
                [that is still acting as representatives of the village] does not enjoy much trust among
                us. They are nostalgic; they would like to stay here forever, no matter what we think...
                Apart from local representatives, we trust also non-governmental organizations ­ we
                believe they can do a good job in our community." Crkvena Vodica, Youth


       Over the past year, rural respondents have taken some action to improve the situation of
       residents of their neighborhood/village. In that period, one tenth of them petitioned
       government officials or political leaders five times and another 29.7% did so less than five
       times. Besides, 12.1% of rural respondents reported that during the past year residents of their
       neighborhood/village have organized over five protests (demonstrations, blocking of roads
       etc.) and further 34.1% reported that being done less than five times. Both above kinds of
       public action were rare in urban parts of the project area (see Graph 43). Any other kind of
       action to improve position of residents of a neighborhood/village was very rarely taken.

       Residents of most surveyed settlements report not having taken any action (protests, petitions
       etc) over the past year in order to improve the situation of the people in their
       neighborhood/village. The only exception to this were the residents of Hade who mostly
       claimed to have taken a few such actions over the past year (less than 5 times) and the
       residents of Grabovc who mostly claimed to have taken one such action.

       Graph 43. In the past year, how often have people in this neighborhood/village got together
       to jointly petition government officials or political leaders or have attended a protest or taken
       some other action for something benefiting the community?

                Issued 27th January, 2007

1. The purpose of this assignment is to         provide environmental and social safeguards
advisory services to the Project Steering Committee of the Kosovo Lignite Power Technical
Assistance Project (the Project Steering Committee or PSC), established jointly by the United
Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Ministry of Energy and
Mines (MEM) of the Kosovo Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG). The work
to be undertaken by the advisors (the Consultant) will focus on providing environmental and
social safeguard support to facilitate the successful development and investments within the
Sibovc Lignite Field near Pristina, Kosovo including the development of a new lignite mine
and power station, in a manner consistent with international best practices in regard to the
management of the social, economic, and environmental impacts of such developments.

2. The work of the Consultant will be divided into two related activities, namely the conduct
of a `Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment' (SESA) and the provision of
`Environmental Assessment Procedures and Training.' As part of the process to prepare the
Sibovc Development Plan, a regional energy sector development plan, the Consultant will
provide assistance in the conduct of SESA for this plan. Under the Environmental Assessment
Procedures and Training activity, the Consultant will provide support to the development of
environmental assessment procedures for Kosovo in general and specifically for the lignite
mining and power generation sector.



    I. BACKGROUND

3. Kosovo is presently administrated by UNMIK pursuant to a resolution of the Security
Council of the United Nations. At its current stage of transition, Kosovo has an elected
Assembly and Provisional Institutions of Self-Government responsible for certain policy
areas, including energy and mining sectors which are under the responsibility of the MEM.
Other powers are reserved by UNMIK and managed through institutions such the Kosovo
Trust Authority (KTA), whose responsibilities in the energy sector include the oversight of
the publicly owned electric utility enterprise, Korporata Energjetike e Kosovës Sh.a. (KEK).

4. With the assistance of the International Development Association of the World Bank Group
( hereinafter "Bank" or " World Bank") and other international donors, UNMIK and PISG are
working on the completion of the legal and regulatory frameworks in all sectors of the
economy. One of the guiding principles for this work is the policy of PISG to seek the
harmonization of Kosovo's laws with those elsewhere in the European Union (EU), with a
view to eventual membership in the EU.

5. In the area of energy and mining, the MEM has recently published the Energy Strategy and
Policy of Kosovo (White Paper). The White Paper sets expectations for the energy sector and
identifies important development directions. In addition to the White Paper, UNMIK and
PISG have signed a Letter of Energy Sector Development Policy (LSDP), setting out a
program of commitments for the development of the sector. Kosovo has one of the most
favorable and large lignite deposits in Europe, and PISG has a strong desire to exploit this
major natural resource for economic development. However, such development should

conform to high standards of environmental and social sustainability in order to obtain and
sustain community support.

6. With respect to the social and environmental aspects related to investments in the lignite
mining and power sectors, progress has been made, but certain issues remain to be addressed.
Recent efforts to develop an effective institutional structure for environmental regulation have
defined the most important actors, their roles and supporting legislation, but the structure is
still very weak. Environmental legislation and standards are partially in place, but need
further development to deal with the challenges of new initiatives.          The environmental
framework law is inadequate to address proper development of mining and power generation
projects, and regulation of existing polluting sources and new projects is not effective. With
respect to social issues, further development of lignite reserves will require resettlement.
There is presently no existing adequate legal and institutional framework (policies,
institutions, and legislation and regulation) to handle resettlement, either in the proposed
lignite extraction area or more generally. The applicable laws on expropriation date to the
Yugoslav era (1987) and have not been updated; UN executive decisions have provided the
legal basis for the process of resettlement in the proposed lignite extraction area.


As part of the Lignite Power Technical Assistance Project's (LP-TAP) proposed work on
developing legal and institutional frameworks to address environmental and social issues in
lignite development, the project will provide various types of technical assistance to the
Kosovo government. Key areas of technical assistance include:

(a) assistance in the preparation of a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA)
that will identify key strategic issues associated with lignite development in accordance with
the proposed Sibovc Development Plan (SDP) that would be developed as a part of the TA
project;

(b) identification of gaps, if any, in the existing legislation and institutional framework to
address environmental and social issues in the energy and mining sector, and propose
necessary policy and institutional changes to address these gaps. This will also include
development of a Resettlement Framework to guide land expropriation and resettlement
required for Independent Power Producer [IPP] investments in the lignite sector in the short
run, since the new land expropriation legislation currently under preparation may not be ready
by the time these investments are anticipated;

(c) development of terms of reference for environmental impact assessment, social assessment
and resettlement action plan that would need to be carried out/prepared for specific
investments; and
capacity building among relevant government agencies to manage environmental and social
aspects of lignite development and associated power generation.

The above mentioned technical assistance and associated assessments are necessary to help
develop an adequate policy and institutional framework to identify and address environmental
and social issues in lignite development and power generation. Close involvement of relevant

Kosovo government agencies in the technical assistance process will be an important element
of building their capacity to manage the development of the lignite sector in an
environmentally and socially sustainable manner.

The following paragraphs briefly describe the work that will be carried out under the various
types of technical assistance mentioned above.

   (a) A Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) will be carried out in
       response to and parallel with, the Sibovc Development Plan, a regional energy sector
       development plan, and in accordance with a new regulation for the conduct of SESA
       which will be promulgated by the Kosovar Government. The SESA will identify and
       discuss the broad range of environmental and social issues associated with the
       development of lignite mining and power generation in the Sibovc-Obiliq area. The
       SESA report and the SDP will be presented jointly to stakeholders to provide them an
       early opportunity to express their views and provide comments prior to the adoption of
       the SDP. The SESA would be the first-stage overarching environmental and social
       assessment of lignite sector development, prior to further, more detailed analyses such
       as the Environmental Assessments and Social Assessments that will be prepared by
       investors for individual investments (discussed in (c) below). The EU SEA Directive
       (2001/42/EC) will serve as the point of reference for scoping and conducting the
       SESA. The SESA will also outline the need for policy, institutional and capacity
       building requirements to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor environmental and
       social impacts of mining development and power generation.

   (b) Based on key environmental and social issues identified in the early stages of the
       SESA, a diagnostic survey of the legal, policy and institutional issues relating to the
       management of environmental and social issues associated with the proposed
       transaction will be conducted. The diagnostic survey, to be conducted concurrently
       with the SESA, will assess gaps in existing legislation, policies and institutional
       arrangements. Since the current law on land expropriation dates back to 1978, and is
       widely acknowledged as inadequate, a Resettlement Framework that would apply to
       land acquisition and resettlement required for investments in the lignite and power
       sectors will be prepared, consistent with the World Bank's Operational Policy ( OP
       4.12) on Involuntary Resettlement. A new draft legislation dealing with expropriation
       and resettlement issues will also be prepared to assure that future resettlement
       programs meet international standards.      Similarly, an analysis of possible gaps
       between international good practice and existing legislation and institutional
       framework related to environmental assessment and compliance will be carried out,
       complementing the ongoing technical assistance being provided by the European
       Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) to the Ministry of Environment and Spatial
       Planning (MESP). The LP-TAP will help prepare draft legislation for sector specific
       regulations such as the implementation of the EU Directive for Large Combustion
       Plants.

   (c) Based on the findings and the recommendations of the SESA, the gap analysis that
       will be conducted under (b) above, and the Resettlement Framework, the mine-site
       assessment and power plant study carried out under the LP-TAP, terms of reference
       (ToR) for investment-specific Environmental Assessment, Social Assessment and
       Resettlement Action Plan will be prepared. The ToR will also be informed by the
       feasibility studies financed by EAR on mine development and power generation.

   (d) To build the capacity of MESP and other national agencies to design and implement
       activities related to environmental management and social development/mitigation,
       capacity building and institutional strengthening activities in the field of
       environmental assessment and involuntary resettlement will be undertaken as part of
       the LP-TAP. The project will assist MESP and subordinate institutes such as Kosovo
       Environmental Protection Agency and the Environmental Protection Inspectorate in
       the development and implementation of EA procedures and the preparation of a sector
       specific EIA handbook. The LP-TAP will support collection of baseline
       environmental data related to lignite mining and power generation and implementation
       of an environmental monitoring data registration and reporting system. The capacity
       building component will also support inter-ministerial co-ordination between the
       Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, the Ministry of Energy and Mining and
       other relevant agencies. Since a new agency/function for land expropriation and
       resettlement is likely to be established as part of the formulation of the new
       expropriation law, this component will also provide support to the institutional unit
       responsible for coordinating land expropriation and resettlement, in addition to
       supporting existing units that play a role in resettlement planning, implementation and
       monitoring.

Consultations with directly affected communities and other stakeholders are built into the
various assessments and reports that will be prepared to identify and address environmental
and social issues. Consultations are scheduled to be conducted in accordance with the EU
Directive and the World Bank's Operational Policy (OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment)
during the scoping of the SESA and for the presentation and discussion of the SESA results
and the draft Sibovc Development Plan. Another World Bank funded program ESTAP III
(Energy Sector Technical Assistance Project), currently under implementation, is also
providing technical assistance to the government to develop a framework for consultation and
participation with local communities and other stakeholders in the energy and mining sector.
Requirements related to consultations will also be included in the terms of reference for EA,
SA and RAP of specific investments subsequent to the LP-TAP.


   II. OBJECTIVES OF THE ASSIGNMENT

7. A key objective of the assignment is to provide the Project Steering Committee with
environmental and social safeguard advisory services necessary to develop the sector in an
environmentally and socially sustainable manner. As an additional objective, the assignment
is also designed to facilitate similar infrastructure transactions in the future, primarily by

strengthening the Kosovo safeguard regulatory capabilities and, secondarily, by improving the
capacity of both the relevant Kosovo authorities and the local members of the Consultant's
team in carrying out Strategic Environmental and Social Assessments and Environmental
Assessments. As indicated above, the work will be divided into two related activities, with the
following respective objectives.



Activity I: Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment

8.  The objectives of the Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment aspect of the
assignment are to:

    (a)    Provide the means to identify and consider the social and environmental impacts
           of projected development of lignite mining and power generation and development
           alternatives in the Sibovc field;

    (b)    Facilitate the process through which public consultation can occur on these
           impacts; and

    (c)    Design measures for the regional energy sector development plan that will
           minimize these impacts.



Activity II: Environmental Assessment Procedures and Training

9. The objectives of the Environmental Assessment Procedures and Training activity are to:

    (a)    Prepare procedures for environmental assessment and an EIA handbook for
           projects and new developments in the lignite power sector in Kosovo;

    (b)    Design and conduct a training program for staff from regulatory institutions in
           Kosovo to familiarize them with the developed environmental assessment
           procedures and the EIA instrument in general.



  III. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SCOPE OF WORK

10. The Consultant will be expected to undertake certain key tasks, described below, in order
to meet the objectives outlined above in Part III of these Terms of Reference. The Consultant
will be expected to draw on all relevant primary and secondary documentation (reports, policy
documents, laws, regulations, licenses, etc.), and to conduct discussions with relevant
stakeholders. The Consultant will be expected to propose, in their Technical Proposal, a
methodology for providing the advisory services and, specifically, for undertaking the tasks
described below.

Activity I. Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment

11. Study area and Area of Influence. The SESA will focus on all current and projected
activities related to lignite mining and lignite power generation in the Sibovc Field near the
municipality of Obiliq / Obilic and areas affected by these activities. The emphasis of the
SESA will be on the development of new mining and power generation activities in this area
but for baseline assessment purposes and to consider developments in the existing operations
and production facilities of KEK, current activities need consideration as well. KEK operates
two lignite mines, Bardh and Mirash, and two lignite power stations, Kosovo A and B.

Task 3/AI.      Description of the Baseline Social and Environmental Conditions and
Environmental            Assessment         of       Existing         KEK          Operations.


(iii) Socio-cultural environment (include both present and projected where appropriate):

population; land use; planned development activities; community structure; employment;

distribution of income, goods and services; recreation; public health; cultural properties;

ethnicity and customs; aspirations and attitudes.


Task 5/AI. Determination of the Potential Environmental Impacts of the Projected
Sector Developments. The evaluations of impacts of lignite power sector developments
made in previous studies should be reviewed by the Consultant, and additional analysis
undertaken, as necessary. The impact risks should be described quantitatively in technical
terms, and the risks should also be described by assigning economic values. The extent and
quality of available data, any significant information deficiencies and any uncertainties
associated with predictions of impacts should be well explained.

The Consultant will make a clear distinction between (i) impacts to be expected with the
implementation of the new mine/plant program, (ii) impacts of past, current and future
activities of KEK's facilities including the power stations Kosovo A and B and (iii) other
long-term developments in the lignite power sector. The analysis will be made in view of
sector development alternatives and regional land use projections identified in Task 2.
Although the program components have been indicated, the analysis of environmental
impacts in the lignite power sector will at the same time further define and detail components
such as the incorporation of environmental control and mitigating measures and may set
certain conditions to other (land-use) developments in the area.

Task 6/AI Regional Social Assessment. Undertake and prepare a regional social assessment
on settlements in Sibovc field. The regional social assessment will address the following
points:
               ·   Review existing social data, update and expand as necessary

               ·   Assess and outline the expected resettlement and socioeconomic impacts
                   for displaced communities and those communities who will be socially
                   impacted by proposed developments.

               ·   Undertake a preliminary social screening to identify issues to be addressed
                   under the Terms of Reference for the follow-on Social Assessment and
                   Resettlement Action Plan.

In undertaking the regional social assessment and the development of the TORS for
Resettlement Action Plan, the Consultant shall work closely with the consultant working on
LP-TAP component in regard to the legal and policy framework for land acquisition and
resettlement, including sharing draft documents and working materials. The Consultant shall
also review the reports of the Hade Resettlement Working Group.

Special attention is required for the informal (illegal) mining activities in the area.

Task 7/AI. Sustainability Appraisal and Options for Resettlement and Environmental
Management. For the development scenarios identified in Task 2/AI and with the
environmental and social impact identified under Tasks 5/AI and 6/AI The Consultant will
execute a Sustainability Appraisal in view of the topics presented in the EU SEA Directive
Annex 1 (Biodiversity Population, Human Health, Fauna, Flora, Soil, Water, Air, Climate,
Material Assets, Cultural Heritage and Landscape). In line with these topics, in this appraisal
key sustainability objectives are to (i) protect health, (ii) support communities; (iii) develop
the economy to meet people's needs, (iv) provide access to meet people's needs with least
damage to communities, (v) maintain/improve environmental quality and assets and (vi)
minimize (optimize) use of natural resources of contents for an EIA report of a typical power
project and a typical mining project.

             and Environmental Assessment (SESA)




1.  BACKGROUND

             The Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) will be an
             important component of the tender documents that will be sent to potential
             foreign investors to develop the Sibovc mine development area and construct
             Kosovo C. The baseline information on mine development area communities
             and the evaluation of potential social and environmental impacts on these
             communities are crucial elements of the SESA. The SESA and the baseline
             will be important tools for decisions made about the future of not only the
             Sibovc mine development but also for the development of Kosovo's energy
             sector.


2.  ASSIGNMENT PURPOSE:


             The purpose of this assignment is to provide accurate and up to date primary
             social and economic information about communities in the Sibovc mine
             development area in order to evaluate the present and future impacts. Some
             baseline information and data have already been collected from government,
             donor and NGO reports. However, much of it is general to Kosovo or out of
             date and predominantly quantative. Information from the household will be
             used to supplement the secondary data and to provide qualitative information
             on people's attitudes, perceptions and concerns about current and future mine
             and plant development.


Objectives:



             ·   To provide accurate quantitative and qualitative data on the social and
                 economic baseline of communities in the Sibovc mine development area.
             ·   To provide information that will be used for the evaluation of the impacts


3.  SPECIFIC TASKS: SURVEY

             ·   To carry out a baseline socio-economic household survey on
                 approximately 15001 households in the Obliq and Fushe ­Kosovo
                 municipalities.
             ·   To design a questionnaire and other appropriate survey methods for
                 collecting both quantative and qualitative

4.     METHODOLOGY


It is envisaged that data will be gathered by using a questionnaire and guided question
sheets for focus group discussions to capture qualitative information. Activities would
include:


·   The design of a questionnaire in consultation with project management
·   Field test questionnaire and make revisions as necessary
·   The questionnaire must be designed to capture the issues mentioned in table 1 and to
inform the evaluation of the impacts of existing mine and power plant facilities and
potential impacts of future developments such as the siting of Kosovo C.
·   The questionnaire will be in Serbian and Albanian for the field work
·   All reports and analysis will be in English
·   Design guided questions for small focus group interviews to gather qualitative
information from `hard to reach groups' such as women, young people and Roma
communities.
·   The design of the database should include tabular responses that can be disaggregated
by age, gender and ethnicity and village.
·   There should be a breakdown of all questions with both number and percentage
·   Working closely with project management during data analysis


5.     SPECIFIC REPORTING AND ANALYSIS TASKS:



·   Raw data from the household survey should be entered into an appropriate data base,
such as Access analysed using software such as SPSS.
·   There should be a rolling data entry process whereby data cleaning and entry is done
after collection of data from each village or community.
·   Summary reports should be written on the specific social and economic issues and
findings(se details under deliverables).
·   A final report using the SESA template provided should be drafted , in English,
describing the findings.


6.     DELIVERABLES:

All deliverables should be in English


·   A week after the signing of the contract an inception report describing proposed
methodology; work plan, including timing of tasks and deliverables; draft questionnaire;
survey team composition; and survey coordination.

·   One week after field activities have commenced weekly 1 page progress reports on
field activities should be drafted and emailed to project management.
·   By 10th December draft a brief interim report on key findings
·   11th January draft baseline report to be submitted
·   18th January final baseline report to be submitted
·   All databases, photographs, completed questionnaires, summary tables and reports
should be given to LPTAP and remain the property of LPTAP.


7.     PROJECT CO-ORDINATION

The survey team will work closely with the consultation team project management team
and the Obliq municipality. Joint planning with the consultation team on focus group
discussions and timing of village visits should be done it in order to avoid information
duplication and `consultation fatigue'.
After signing of the contract an inception meeting will be held with the project team,
consultation team and Obliq municipality representatives to facilitate this process.

The team should have a team leader who will report directly to the project management.
The team leader will provide weekly progress reports and will assist LPTAP in the public
consultation meetings for the disclosure of the SESA report in December and February.

8.     DURATION OF ASSIGNMENT


It is expected that the assignment will last for the duration of 4 months

1   Introduction

    This report contains the Resettlement Policy Framework, which is a deliverable under the
    Contract for Consulting Services between Hunton & Williams LLP and the Lignite
    Power Technical Assistance Project Office ("LPTAP Project Office") acting by and
    through the Ministry of Energy and Mines ("MEM") of the Provisional Institutions of
    Self-Government ("PISG").

    This report is one of the outputs of Task (c) of the Framework Development Activity
    defined in the Consultant's Terms of Reference.

1.1 Work carried out to date

    A Draft Resettlement Policy Framework was submitted in October 2007. Since then the
    Consultant has received important additional documentation and was able to meet with
    the Transaction Advisors from PWC and the Social Sector Specialist from ERM who is
    working on the Strategic Social and Environmental Assessment (SESA). From 2-7 March
    2008 the Consultant visited Kosovo. During the mission the Consultant visited the project
    area and met with the Project Manager and Environmental Specialist from LPTAP, the
    Legal Council for Hunton & Williams in Pristina, the Land Acquisition and
    Environmental Managers from KEK, the Executive Director and Deputy Director of the
    Kosovo Property Agency (KPA), the Information Officer, the Director of the Land
    Cadastre and the Director of the Health Department of the Municipality of Obiliq, the
    Manager of Project Hade in the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP),
    Legal Advisors from Bearing Point, working under contract to USAID/PISG and the
    Chief Executive Officer of the Kosovo Cadastral Agency (KCA). The Consultant would
    like to thank everyone involved in the mission, especially the Project Manager and
    Environmental Specialist from LPTAP, who arranged the site visit and the meetings.

    During the mission the Consultant acquired the latest version of the Law on
    Expropriation, O2/L-97, which was approved by the Assembly on 8 February 2007, but
    which was not promulgated since at the time the Special Representative responded (29
    January 2008) it fell outside the competence of the Assembly and the PISG. The
    Consultant has reviewed the law and has recommended modifications to bring it into line
    with international standards such as the World Bank's OP 4.12 and the International
    Finance Corporation's Performance Standard PS-5. The Consultant is awaiting comments
    on the draft of the review before finalizing the deliverable.

       The Lignite Power Project is intended to make Kosovo self-sufficient in electricity and
       could provide additional capacity that would allow electricity to be exported. Kosovo has
       large, relatively shallow deposits of lignite that can be easily mined using open cast
       mining techniques. At present power is generated by two lignite burning thermal power
       plants, known as Kosovo A and Kosovo B, located about 10 kilometers to the west of
       Pristina, which burn lignite mined in the adjacent Bardh and Mirash mines. The power
       plants and mines are operated by the State owned Kosovo Electricity Company (KEK).
       KEK was incorporated as a publicly owned enterprise in December 2005. From 2004 to
       2006 the company was managed by ESBI, the International arm of the Irish Electricity
       Supply Board (ESB), and in October 2006 responsibility was handed to local
       management. KEK is supervised by a Board of Directors that includes international and
       local members and is chaired by an independent international expert.
       According to UNMIK, the Kosovo A plant presently has an installed capacity of
       420MW; the plant started production started in 1962 and additional capacity was added
       in the early 1970s. The same source states that the Kosovo B plant has a total installed
       capacity of 580MW: the first unit started production in 1983 and the second in 1984. At
       present these plants are operating below capacity and cannot meet the demand for
       electricity in Kosovo. The Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) is proposing to build a
       new plant, Kosovo C. The details of the project are being developed by the Lignite Power
       Technical Assistance Project (LPTAP) with support from a transaction adviser and other
       consultants. The initial proposals described on the UNMIK website refer to the
       construction of a new plant, Kosovo C, which would be built in two phases eventually
       reaching an installed capacity of between 1800 and 2100MW. It is envisaged that the first
       phase, with a capacity of 900-1000MW, could become operational between 2012 and
       2014, with the second phase becoming operational between 2018 and 2020. The same
       source also notes that MEM is proposing to rehabilitate the Kosovo A plant, bringing its
       capacity up to 800MW.1
       The Bardh and Mirash mines that supply Kosovo A and B presently have reserves of less
       than 30M tons and are extracting lignite from the pillar that divides the two pits. This
       reserve will last until 2009. After this date lignite will have to be mined from the
       Sibovc D field, which is effectively a northern extension of the existing Bardh mine.
       KEK has acquired the first areas that will be needed for the D field; a bucket wheel and
       belt conveyor system is removing overburden in this area and an additional bucket wheel
       system from Bardh has to be rehabilitated to extract the lignite coal from the field. A
       much larger area would have to be opened up to supply the needs of Kosovo C. This
       field, known as the Sibovc field, covers about 16km² and has a maximum east-west width
       of 3.8km and a length of 6km. It is essentially a northerly extension of the Bardh and
       Mirash mines. Until 2038 about 11.6 km² would be needed to supply about 553M tons of
       lignite coal from a seam with a thickness of up to 80m (Vattenfall 2005).
       The opening of the Sibovc field will require significant land acquisition and resettlement
       that may eventually affect as many as 1500 families. Since most of the population in the

area lives in nucleated or semi-nucleated villages, this means the resettlement will not be
gradually phased but will involve the acquisition and relocation of some quite densely
populated areas, followed by periods where expansion of the mine will essentially require
the acquisition of farmland.
The immediate priority, which has to be completed before the Sibovc field can be
opened, is to complete the relocation of the village of Hade. This is already a priority for
Government, since part of the village was collapsing into the Mirash mine as a result of
earlier mismanagement of the mining operation. In order to increase the short-term output
from the mine, the benches had been shortened until lignite coal was being extracted
from almost underneath the edge of the mine. In 2004 ­ when houses in Hade started to
slip into the Mirash mine, an emergency was declared and a project unit (Project Hade)
set up in the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP) to manage the
resettlement under emergency procedures (i.e. without applying the existing 1978 Law on
Expropriation or the standard procedures used by KEK). In June 2005 Project Hade had
to call on the police and KFOR to forcibly relocate 22 families that were living in part of
the village that was at the point of collapsing into the mine. So far, 158 families (664
people) of the 653 families (1448 persons) that were enumerated in Hade in 2004 have
been resettled; 85 families (436 people) are living in temporary accommodation in two
apartment blocks in the town of Obiliq; the others, mainly non-resident landowners, have
been paid cash compensation.
The construction of the Kosovo C power plant and ancillary facilities may require further
resettlement. At present there are three possible sites for the plant. Two are brown field
sites, within the boundaries of the existing Kosovo A and B plants, and the third is a
green field site, which, if it were chosen would require further land acquisition and
involuntary resettlement, but less environmental remediation.
The construction of Kosovo C and the rehabilitation of Kosovo A will require the
participation of outside investors since KEK does not have sufficient resources to
complete the project. According to the UNMIK website, the cost of rehabilitating Kosovo
A is estimated at EUR 154M and the cost of constructing Kosovo C at between EUR
2300M and EUR 2700M. A transaction adviser has been contracted by the World
Bank/IDA financed Lignite Power Technical Assistance Program (LPTAP) to identify
the options for attracting outside investment, but a final decision has not yet been taken
on the form that the investment will take. The options include concessions for mining and
for the construction and operation of Kosovo C, along with variants that include the
concession of Kosovo A and/or Kosovo B, or the wholesale privatization of KEK's
generating capacity. At present LPTAP/MEM is negotiating with four consortia of power
companies that are potentially interested in investing in the mining and power sector.
Whichever option is chosen, it is likely that the outside investor will be responsible for
the mining operation and the construction and operation of the Kosovo C power plant.

3  Scope of the Policy Framework

   The policy framework has been developed according to internationally accepted
   standards including the World Bank's Operational Policy OP 4.12 and the International
   Finance Corporation and Equator Banks' Performance Standard PS-5. Since many key
   issues are still undecided, the policy framework is intended to provide a basis for further
   discussion. The present document seeks to identify the issues that need to be resolved and
   to make recommendations that can be followed up by LPTAP. It is important to
   emphasize that the development of the resettlement framework should be a participatory
   process, led by LPTAP, which would involve key institutions in Government: especially
   MEM and MESP, KEK, local government ­ i.e. the Municipality of Obiliq, potential
   investors and above all the families that will be affected by the project. As in any
   resettlement program, it is also important to insist on the need for clear criteria and
   definitions of responsibility.

   Key issues that need to be addressed before the framework can be finalized include:

       ·   The definition of who will be responsible for developing the definitive
           Resettlement Action Plan or Plans (RAP) for the project and who will be
           responsible for approving them. The first RAP will incorporate all the definitions,
           eligibility criteria, benefits and procedures to be applied in the project. It may be
           best to prepare a separate RAP for each phase of the mine's expansion ­ since
           land acquisition will have to take place over a period of 30 years ­ and another for
           the Kosovo C plant if a green field site is chosen. However, the criteria, benefits
           and procedures should be the same in each RAP.

       ·   The    definition    of  the    institutional responsibilities  for  financing   and
           implementation of the RAP

       ·   The scope of the RAP. In particular whether or not it should cover existing social
           liabilities, including the resettlement of the families from Hade that are presently
           living in temporary accommodation in Obiliq and the resettlement of the
           remaining households in Dardhiste Village that should be moved on health and
           safety grounds but do not have to be moved to open the Sibovc field

       ·   The selection of the site for Kosovo C and its ancillary facilities

   The draft resettlement policy framework is intended to apply to all aspects of the lignite
   mining and power project. This would include land acquisition for mining operations and
   ancillary facilities, including any land that would be required for offices, workshops and
   fuel depots, overburden dumps and access roads. It would also apply to land acquisition
   for the Kosovo C power plant if the green field site is selected.

4  Principles and Objectives

   A primary objective of international standards such as the World Bank's Operational
   Policy OP 4.12 and the IFC's Performance Standard PS-5 is to minimize land acquisition
   and above all physical and economic displacement. Where displacement or the loss of
   economic assets and means of livelihood are unavoidable, the objective of the policies is
   to ensure that affected people can improve or at the very least recover their standard of
   living and livelihoods in the shortest possible time.

   It is important to emphasize that the objective of avoiding or minimizing land acquisition
   and displacement should never be allowed to compromise public health and safety. In
   practice, this means ensuring that housing and work places are always located at an
   acceptable distance from facilities such as mines, power plants, roads and transmission
   lines. At a minimum this requires full compliance with the existing industry standards: in
   the case of opencast mines the standards applied by KEK require a minimum distance of
   200m between the mine excavations and any buildings or workplaces, including farm
   land. In areas with steep slopes and/or unstable geology the distance has to be increased.
   In practice the zone of impact may be greater, since mining takes place 24 hours a day,
   and causes vibrations, noise, dust and light pollution. Mining operations can also affect
   water quality. Similarly, the existing Kosovo A and B thermal power stations have lead to
   serious environmental impacts on the villages situated in the immediate vicinity of the
   plants: this includes high levels of air pollution due to emissions from the power stations
   and dust from the fly ash dumps, and the contamination of groundwater and soils. In
   some cases these impacts could be alleviated through remedial action; however, in the
   case of Dardhiste Village the impacts are so severe that it may be better on grounds of
   health and safety to resettle the remaining inhabitants of the village.

   The objective of minimizing displacement requires coordination between the social and
   environmental sector specialists and the engineering design teams. In the mining sector
   the design issues typically include the location of overburden dumps and the selection of
   the means and routes to transport lignite from the mine face to the power plant. The aim
   should be to avoid the construction of unnecessary additional access roads around the
   mining area and to site the mine offices, workshops and stores away from existing centers
   of population. In fact, in case of the proposed Sibovc and Sibovc D fields the mining
   operations are essentially an extension of the existing operations: this means the
   overburden can be used to backfill exhausted areas of the Mirash and Bardh mines. The
   overburden will be transported by a conveyor belt from the mine face to the worked out
   sections of the existing pits. At present the mine offices and workshops are located within
   worked out areas of the Mirash and Bardh mines.

   One of the most difficult issues with opencast mining is to determine how far in advance
   of actual mining land should be acquired. Long term plans to develop areas for open-cast
   mining tend to blight the affected areas since no-one is willing to make any investments
   as the land that will eventually have to be cleared. However there is no need to acquire all
   the land that may be used over the 30 or 40 year life of a mine at one time. In fact the
   ownership of large tracts of unused land can represent a liability for the owners of a mine
   since it may be at risk from occupation by squatters and would have to be fenced and


                                              8

regularly patrolled. KEK has been applying the principle of trying to acquire the land
needed for mining three years in advance of actual mining operations. According to the
Manager of the Property Office of KEK, which is responsible for land acquisition, this
has not presented any obstacles to mining operations; however, it is clear that the short
term plan for the development of the Sibovc D field has been designed precisely to avoid
the complex and costly acquisition of the village of Hade.

Another factor that ought to be taken into account in the case of the Sibovc field is the
settlement pattern in the area, which is characterized by fairly large nucleated or semi-
nucleated villages. This means that displacement will not be a gradual process as the
mine face advances, but will actually involve the acquisition of whole villages, followed
by long periods with little need for the physical displacement of population. Given this
reality, the most sensible strategy would be to adapt the land acquisition program to the
settlement pattern rather than applying a rigid procedure based on the expected advance
of the mine face. In practical terms this would mean acquiring the land village by village,
according to a timetable that would have to allow sufficient time for the acquisition and
relocation of whole villages. Since the recommended entitlements include options for
collective resettlement in new villages, land-for-land and letters of credit (described
below), it would probably be advisable to start the land acquisition process at least five or
six years before the land is actually needed for mining.

In the Consultant's opinion, there is little benefit in acquiring land much more than five
or six years before it is needed. It is sometimes argued that this would prevent people
putting up additional buildings and would reduce the cost of compensation; however, the
opportunity cost is high since it ties up capital that could be put to better use elsewhere. It
is also argued that the affected families want to be resettled as soon as possible because
of the high levels of pollution and the blight on investment in their villages. However, it
is envisaged that levels of pollution will be reduced once the Kosovo A plant has been
rehabilitated. The new Kosovo C plant will be required to comply with standards
equivalent to the present EU standards for emissions. The economic blight can be
reduced somewhat by ensuring that government and local government agencies are fully
compensated for any public infrastructure that is affected by mining; this will reduce the
disincentive effect on public investment in villages in the mining area (see below).

In the case of the power sector the key land acquisition and resettlement issue is the
location of the Kosovo C plant. As already noted, there are three options, two of which
are brown field sites within the existing boundaries of the Kosovo A and B sites. The
third is a green field site, the acquisition of which would require further displacement of
population. Again, as in the case of mining operations, the area required should satisfy
Kosovo, European and international standards for safety, air quality and noise control. In
Kosovo A and B, large areas were acquired for ash dumps. The land take ­ especially for
Kosovo A appears to have been excessive and the disposal of fly ash has been badly
managed and is a major cause of air pollution in the villages located nearest to the plants.
In the case of Kosovo C ­ and perhaps in the case of the other plants, this issue would be
better resolved by disposing of fly ash in abandoned areas of the mines. The location of
any new sub-stations and the routing of transmission lines can be planned to avoid any
physical displacement of population.

The impacts on surface and ground water also need to be considered. The water for
cooling the Kosovo B plant is brought by canal and apparently this source should be
sufficient for cooling the proposed Kosovo C plant. The impacts of the mining operations
have been more significant and have led to serious contamination of surface water and
groundwater in the immediate area of the mines. The Sitnica River is heavily
contaminated, as is groundwater in the vicinity of the Mirash and Bardh mines. This is
one of the main reasons that would justify the resettlement of Dardhiste Village.

The principle of ensuring that affected people can improve or at least recover their
previous standard of living in the shortest possible time is discussed in more detail in the
next section, which considers the relationship between existing legal standards and
procedures and internationally accepted standards such as OP 4.12 and IFC PS-5.

5  Local Legislation and International Standards

   The legal framework for expropriation in Kosovo is presently under review. In February
   2007 the National Assembly approved a new law on expropriation (No. 02/L-97);
   however in a letter addressed to the President of the Assembly on 29 January 2008 the
   UN Special Representative stated that the law could not be promulgated in view of the
   constitutional constraints that applied in Kosovo at the time. Since Kosovo declared
   independence on 17 February 2008 the situation has changed and it is understood that a
   revised version of the law will be presented to the Assembly in the coming months. One
   of the Consultant's tasks is to review the draft law and propose amendments to bring it
   into line with international standards for expropriation and resettlement such as the World
   Bank's OP 4.12 and the IFC/Equator Banks PS-5.
   Up to now KEK has based its land acquisition procedures on the 1978 law on
   expropriation (21/78) and amendment 46 of 1986 (46/86), which was promulgated by the
   Assembly of the then Autonomous Province of Kosova. MESP/Project Hade has been
   applying similar procedures, although the legal basis is quite different because the
   relocation of Hade is carried out under emergency powers rather than as expropriation,
   since the primary objective is to prevent people being killed or injured by the collapse of
   their houses rather that to acquire the area for mining as strictly speaking, the area is not
   required for opening the Sibovc D field.
   In practical terms, there are two main differences between the procedures applied by
   KEK and Project Hade and international standards.

       ·   The existing procedures only envisage payment of compensation to property
           owners with full legal title to their land and do not incorporate measures to
           compensate or restore the livelihoods of non-owners. WB OP 4.12 and IFC PS-5
           explicitly require measures to restore the housing and livelihoods of all affected
           people regardless of whether or not they have recognizable legal rights to the land
           they are occupying, the only exceptions being opportunistic squatters that
           encroach on the affected area after the cut-off date for eligibility has been
           declared. It must be recognized that OP 4.12 and IFC PS-5 were developed on the
           basis of experiences in Asia, Latin America and Africa, where rights to land in
           rural areas are often not clearly defined and where large numbers of people live in
           informal urban squatter settlements. In the area potentially affected by the
           proposed mine and power complex it is not clear what kinds of non-owners would
           be eligible for resettlement benefits if the international standards were applied.
           This should be clarified by the surveys that are presently being carried out for
           LPTAP by Prism and CDF (Community Development Fund). Apparently there
           are no longer any state or collectively-owned farming units in the area; however
           there are some cases where land has exchanged hands without being formally
           registered in the land cadastre. This issue is discussed in more detail in the section
           on eligibility criteria and entitlements.

       ·   The 1978 law states that "compensation for expropriated agrarian land will be
           determined in compliance with the market prices for agrarian land" (Article 28).
           In practice, the value of agricultural land is determined by the municipal cadastre
           office in accordance with the category of the land, but without taking the real


                                              11

       value of market transactions into account. OP 4.12 and PS-5 both require
       compensation levels to be at replacement value. In fact, the evidence suggests that
       the compensation paid by KEK and MESP/Project Hade is usually insufficient to
       fully replace lost assets and cover all transitional costs ­ although some sources
       dispute this. The issue is discussed in more detail in the section on eligibility
       criteria and entitlements.
Another issue that is pertinent to the project but which is not envisaged in WB OP 4.12 or
IFC PS-5 is compensation for land and other assets that were abandoned during the
conflict of 1999 and subsequent periods of unrest. The issue is covered by Administrative
Directive No. 2007/5 "Implementing UNMIK regulation No.2006/50 on the resolution of
claims relative to private immovable property, including agricultural and commercial
property", which requires land and other assets to be returned to the original owners
providing they can establish a legitimate claim to the property. The Kosovo Property
Agency (KPA) is responsible for reviewing claims and adjudicating disputes over private
property affected by the conflict, but is not responsible for paying compensation.
Between 2006, when the agency was established, and March 2008 the KPA has
adjudicated about 5,700 of an estimated total of 40,000 cases. 90% of the cases refer to
agricultural land, less than 4% to shops and factories, and the remaining 6% to residential
properties. This issue is considered in the section on eligibility criteria and entitlements.

6        Institutional Responsibilities

         The definition of the institutional responsibilities for land acquisition and resettlement is
         one of the most critical issues that have to be defined. It is important to emphasize that
         land acquisition and resettlement is an integral part of the mining operation. It represents
         a significant cost and is one of the more complex and challenging issues that have to be
         addressed. In the immediate future the opening of the Sibovc D field to the west of Hade
         is relatively simple and requires little or no additional land acquisition. However, the
         development of Kosovo C will be dependent on opening the wider Sibovc field, and this
         can only take place if all the village of Hade is relocated. The long term development of
         this lignite coalfield will require the relocation of around 1500 households. At a rough
         estimate this will require an investment in the order of EUR 180-200M, of which about
         EUR 80M would be needed just to complete the resettlement of Hade.
         Given the cost and complexity of the resettlement, the most sensible option would be for
         the Project Company (the Investor) to take over full technical and financial responsibility
         for the land acquisition and resettlement components of the project.2 The resettlement of
         Hade is critical to the development of the proposed mining and power generation
         complex and failure to acquire the land could jeopardize the success of the whole project.
         From the Investor's point of view, although it represents a significant cost, it would be
         advantageous since it reduces the level of risk associated with land acquisition. It is
         envisaged that under a concession or privatization agreement the Investor would take
         over the existing Property Office in KEK and would strengthen the capacity of the office,
         bringing in international experts as well as additional local expertise. Some of the
         activities could be subcontracted to an international or local consultancy company or
         consortium, but it would be essential for the Investor to have a manager for social issues,
         or perhaps for social and environmental issues, located at a high level in the management
         structure of the Project Company that would be set up to run the mining and power
         complex. The request for proposals (RFP) should explicitly require the consortia that are
         competing for the project to demonstrate their capacity in the field of land acquisition and
         resettlement and should ask for a specific proposal to address these issues. This aspect of
         the project should receive an appropriate weighting in the methodology to compare and
         evaluate the proposals.
         The recommended division of responsibilities between the Investor, Government, local
         Government and other agencies would be as follows:

              ·    Preparation and approval of the definitive Resettlement Action Plans (RAP). The
                   Project Company should be responsible for preparing the definitive RAP/s. It
                   would be based on the Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA),
                   the surveys carried out by Prism and CDF, the Resettlement Policy Framework
                   (RPF) and any other studies or proposals that have been carried out for LPTAP,
                   MEM or MESP. It is envisaged that the RAP/s would be prepared to IFC/Equator

                  Group PS-5 standards, given that the Investor may wish to apply for financing
                  from the IFC and/or one or more of the Equator Group banks.3 The RAP would
                  include a detailed budget and timetable and would be subject to public
                  consultation. It would probably be best for MESP to be responsible for the
                  approval of the RAP (as recommended in the review of the draft law on
                  expropriation) and should receive comments from MEM/LPTAP and the affected
                  municipalities. The key criteria, entitlements and agreements with the affected
                  families could be incorporated into secondary legislation for approval by the
                  National Assembly and/or could take the form of a civil contract or formal
                  agreement between the Investor and the representatives of the affected families.

             ·    Definition of eligibility, assessment of benefits and review of claims of eligibility
                  for resettlement benefits. The Investor ­ i.e. the Land Acquisition and
                  Resettlement Department of the Project Company would be responsible for
                  determining eligibility and the levels of compensation or other benefits that will
                  be offered to affected individuals and households. Where eligibility for benefits or
                  the type or level of benefits is challenged, it could be subject to an independent
                  review before resorting to the courts. The independent review could be carried out
                  by a committee that would include representatives from the affected
                  municipalities, from the affected people and from MESP.

             ·    Definition of entitlements for owners displaced by conflict. The Kosovo Property
                  Agency (KPA) would be responsible for identifying and contacting any property
                  owners that fled during the conflict of 1999 and subsequent periods of unrest. The
                  mandate of the KPA would be limited to its present function of determining
                  ownership of assets. The Investor will be responsible for negotiating with the
                  affected property owners. The options offered to affected property owners that
                  have been displaced as the result of the conflict will be exactly the same as those
                  offered to other affected owners.

             ·    Implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The Investor would be
                  responsible for the provision of land-for-land options, the development of new
                  resettlement sites, for providing letters of credit and/or for payment of
                  compensation to the affected families. The Investor would be responsible for the
                  day to day monitoring of implementation of the RAP. However, an independent
                  grievance mechanism should be established to cover all aspects of the power and
                  mining complex. This is considered in more detail below.
        One of the more difficult issues is to determine how far the Project Company should take
        over responsibility for the existing social liabilities of KEK. If KEK were privatized it
        would be appropriate for the Investor to take over the full responsibility for these
        liabilities; however, if the mining and power project were awarded as a concession, it
        might be more appropriate for the remedial resettlement plan to remain as the
        responsibility of Government. The most significant liabilities identified are first, the
        households from Hade that have been temporarily resettled by MESP/Project Hade, and
        second the households in Dardhiste Village that do not need to be resettled to open up the

presently under review in EBRD.

Sibovc field, but which ought to be resettled on grounds of health and safety. At present
the resettlement program for Hade is the responsibility of MESP/Project Hade. If the
Government retains responsibility for completing the resettlement of the villagers that
were moved from Hade into temporary accommodation in the town of Obiliq it would be
advisable for the Government to apply the same criteria and offer the same entitlements
as those that will be provided by the Project Company for the families that will be
affected by the mining and power complex. So far, no decision has been taken to move
the remaining families from Dardhiste.

7  Resettlement Action Plans

   This resettlement policy framework (RPF) outlines the general principles and procedures
   for land acquisition and resettlement for the overall power and mining complex. However
   a more detailed Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) will have to be prepared for each project
   that requires the physical displacement of population and/or leads to loss of livelihood or
   sources of income. In practice this will mean one or more Resettlement Plans for the
   Sibovc mining complex ­ perhaps one for each stage of the mining project ­ and another
   for the Kosovo C thermal power plant and associated facilities if the green field site is
   chosen for the power plant. Each Resettlement Plan should comply with internationally
   accepted standards such as the World Bank's OP 4.12 and the IFC/Equator Banks' PS-5.
   The plans have to be based on reliable, up-to-date information and should include basic
   information about the respective projects and an analysis of the alternative options for the
   proposed project as well as any legal issues relating to the resettlement or any gaps
   between the laws of Kosovo and international standards.

   The RAP for the Sibovc field should be prepared in stages; each stage would correspond
   to a particular phase of the development of the field, and ideally would cover one or more
   villages. The first stage RAP would include a detailed description of the key criteria and
   resettlement options and these same criteria and options would be applied in the
   subsequent phases. A generic outline for the RAP is presented in Annex A.

   Under OP 4.12 an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan may be acceptable for the Kosovo C
   thermal power plant, since even the green field site is unlikely to affect more than 200
   people (OP 4.12: 25). However, this must at the very least include the following:

       (a) A comprehensive census or survey of the affected persons and their assets;

       (b) A description of the resettlement benefits, compensation and/or other assistance
       that will be provided;

       (c) A definition of the criteria that will be applied (cut-off dates, viability of
       remaining areas, the household, etc.);

       (d) A description of the institutional responsibilities for implementation;

       (e) A description of the consultations that have been carried out in relation to the
       proposed options and a consultation plan for developing and executing the
       resettlement plan;

       (f) The procedures for registration and redress of grievances;

       (g) The procedures for monitoring and evaluation; and

       (h) The timetable and budget for the resettlement plan.

8  Social and Economic Impacts of the Mining and Power Project

   A detailed survey of the area of the proposed Sibovc field is presently being carried out
   by the NGOs Prism and CDF (Community Development Fund) as part of the preparatory
   work for the Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA). The main work on
   the SESA has been carried out by a consortium led by ERM Italia. The draft SESA
   incorporates the results of a series of public consultations that have been held in most of
   the villages in the mining area. Through the consultations a number of issues have been
   identified, some of which are particularly pertinent to the RPF. One of the main concerns
   expressed by people in the affected area is the impact of air and water pollution from the
   power plants and mines, which they claim has affected their health and reduced the
   agricultural productivity of the area. Another concern is that people do not want to repeat
   the experience of Hade, where people were moved when their houses started to slip into
   the Mirash mine and many families have still not been permanently resettled.

   As described above, the lignite mining and power project may include the rehabilitation
   of the existing Kosovo A thermal power plant and construction of a new Kosovo C power
   plant, which is likely to be developed in two stages. The Kosovo A and B plants are
   presently supplied with lignite coal from the Mirash and Bardh mines, but these mines
   will be exhausted by 2009. In the short term Kosovo A and B will be supplied from the
   Sibovc D field; however, when the refurbished Kosovo A and the new Kosovo C power
   stations come on line the production of lignite coal will have to be increased by opening
   up the whole of the Sibovc field to the north of the existing Bardh and Mirash mines. The
   area that will eventually be affected is about 16km².

   The affected area is rural with a few fairly large, nucleated or semi-nucleated villages.
   The total population of the affected area is estimated at around 1500 families. The largest
   villages are Hade, Shiptulle, Lajthishte, Sibovc and Plemetin. The present population of
   the villages is mainly ethnic Albanian, although Plemetin is a largely Serbian village. The
   economy of the villages appears to be based on agriculture, although some people work
   outside the area; some villagers are employed by KEK in the mines and power plants.
   The survey should provide the following information:

       ·   Detailed description of the population in the directly affected project area and in
           the surrounding area (description of the population in the affected villages;
           ethnicity and the impacts of the conflict; economic activities: agriculture and off-
           farm employment; levels of unemployment; migration to urban areas, emigration)

       ·   A detailed estimate of the requirements for land and involuntary resettlement and
           the likely timing of land acquisition

       ·   A summary of the consultations carried out to date and the consultation schedule
           required for completion of the SESA

   The affected areas can be divided into three separate categories:




                                             17

    ·   The areas that will be directly required for the mining and power complex,
        including the areas needed for any ancillary facilities. If Kosovo C is built within
        the boundaries of the Kosovo A or B plant, there will be no need for additional
        land acquisition for the power plant.

    ·   The areas required for the safety zone of the mine (i.e. in the 200m or more from
        the side of the excavations) and the safety zones for any new roads, sub-stations
        and transmission lines

    ·   The areas that are not required for the mining and power complex or for the
        formal safety zones but which suffer or will suffer significant social and
        environmental impacts: such as dust, noise, light, air pollution and contamination
        of ground and surface water, etc.

The first two categories have to be acquired. This means people will lose their land,
houses and other assets. The third category is more problematic. It includes populations
that have been affected by existing mining operations and power generation ­ this
includes the village of Dardhiste and perhaps the village of Grabovc. To a lesser extent it
also includes the town of Obiliq and the surrounding areas that are affected by dust from
fly ash dumps and by the contamination of groundwater. The social and economic
impacts on these villages may include impacts to human health and the loss of
productivity of farmland. The first strategy to resolve these problems should be to
mitigate the environmental impacts wherever this is possible. However, there may be
cases where the level of contamination and the risks to human health are so severe that it
would be advisable to relocate the population. The final decision will have to be based on
solid scientific evidence and should be clarified once the baseline environmental studies
have been completed. The key questions that would guide the decision are:

    ·   Do the levels of dust, air and/or water pollution represent a significant risk to
        human health?

    ·   Have the levels of dust, air and/or water pollution had a significant effect on
        agricultural production or on the health of people that consume the produce from
        the area?

If the answer to either of these questions is yes, and levels of dust, air and/or water
pollution cannot be reduced to acceptable levels within a space of say five years, then the
land should be acquired and the families moved, applying exactly the same criteria that
will be applied to people whose land is required for the mining and power complex.

It is important to emphasize that the impacts of land acquisition involve much more than
the loss of housing. In the first place, given that the affected areas are largely rural, it
could result in a significant loss of livelihoods. The results of the consultations suggest
that there are high levels of unemployment and under-employment in the area; this means
that people depend on their farmland for a significant part of their subsistence and cash
income. This makes resettlement particularly difficult, since international standards
rightly require affected families to be compensated for the loss of their livelihoods and/or


                                         18

subsistence. In addition the land take for the mines and power plant may affect some
small businesses and result in people losing employment.

Another significant impact of land acquisition is the disruption of social networks if
people have to move away from their relatives, friends and neighbors. There will be a
loss of cultural heritage and local memories. It is impossible to replace memories, history
and social networks. However, some level of mitigation could be achieved through a
sensitive social support program that would take local people's concerns and expectations
into account. This would include measures to remove and restore local historical and
cultural sites, such as mosques, cemeteries, churches and war memorials. It could also
include assistance to help the most vulnerable people, especially the elderly, readjust to
their new homes and new locations, for instance, facilitating contact with social and
health services at their new site. A critical issue here, which needs to be discussed in
more detail, is the proposal to offer people the option of relocating together in a new
resettlement village, thus allowing them to maintain a certain level of social cohesion.
This should be an option, but should not be obligatory, since there are situations where
people will want to use the opportunity provided by resettlement to move away, to seek
employment, education or ­ as often happens with elderly people ­ to retire from farming
and move closer to their children, who may be living and working in the city.

The principal social and economic impacts of land acquisition include:

    ·   Loss of land. Where all or a significant part of a person's farmland is lost, they
        will lose their income and often a significant part of their food supply (for
        instance, vegetables, milk and poultry). In the process of moving to a new site
        they are likely to lose at least one harvest.

   ·    Loss of housing. As well as losing the physical structure of the house, people will
        lose the associated services and facilities: water supply, drainage, road access and
        electricity. In the process of moving they will also incur significant transitional
        costs, including transport for themselves and their personal effects, legal fees,
        taxes, and so on.

    ·   Loss of businesses. As well as loss of physical premises, small businesses may be
        affected by the loss of business locations and loss of clientele, especially their
        regular customers. In the process of moving they will lose business and may incur
        significant transitional costs, including the transport of equipment, stock, etc.

    ·   Loss of employment. If an affected business closes the employees will lose their
        jobs. Other people may lose employment if they are obliged to move a long
        distance from their existing workplaces.

   ·    Loss of services and cultural heritage. This includes loss of access to facilities
        such as schools, clinics, mosques, cemeteries, war memorials, and others.

        that could be offered to the different categories of persons affected by the projects.

     9.1    People affected by loss of land (farmland, grazing, forest land)

       Landowners. People whose land is affected by the mining or power projects will be
       offered the following alternatives: i) an alternative plot on an area of land rehabilitated
       from the large area of overburden dumps that presently belong to KEK ("land for land"),
       ii) a letter of credit to acquire another plot of land of equivalent area and quality to the
       affected plot, or iii) cash compensation. All their transitional costs will also be covered or
       compensated. This will include the costs of transporting their equipment, machinery,
       livestock and all other moveable assets, all the legal fees and taxes needed for the transfer
       of their land and acquisition of replacement plots, and compensation for any loss of crops
       or other loss of income and/or subsistence. Since many affected households depend on
       their land for all or part of their livelihoods ­ including subsistence farming and raising
       livestock ­ the aim is to ensure that the options allow them to improve or at least recover
       their previous standard of living.

       The three options will be offered to all landowners whose plots are fully affected, who
       depend on the affected property for a significant part of their livelihood or subsistence,
       and who do not own or occupy other viable holdings. Landowners that do not depend on
       their land: i.e. whose land is partially affected, who rent their land out under formal
       tenancy or sharecropping arrangements or who have other viable holdings, would only be
       eligible for compensation. The criteria for defining which properties are classified as
       fully affected and which are classified as partially affected are set out below in Section 9.
       These options will be offered regardless of whether or not the landowners reside on the
       affected plot (entitlements for people whose houses are affected are set out separately
       below). The options will be offered to all those people that have legal title to the land or
       who are recognized as having full, unchallenged rights of ownership. In relation to
       irregular rights the following points should be noted:

           ·   Land that was originally acquired through an irregular transfer (such as an
               unregistered civil contract) will have to have the arrangement regularized by the


                                                  23

        courts and then registered at the appropriate municipal cadastre office, which in
        turn will inform the Kosovo Cadastral Agency (KCA). The cost of regularizing
        the title will be covered by the Project Company.

    ·   Other persons that claim ownership but lack full legal titles will have to show they
        have been living and working the land for the last 10 years or have inherited or
        legally acquired usufruct rights to the land. The claim will be reviewed by the
        project resettlement office and must be backed with evidence from the
        municipality (for instance, tax records), government institutions (for instance,
        school records) or affidavits from neighbors.

    ·   If there are outstanding claims on the property, including disputes over
        ownership, boundaries or inheritance the Project will deposit the estimated value
        of the land and property in a special account and will only pay the compensation
        or provide other resettlement benefits once the dispute has been adjudicated in the
        courts. If there is a mortgage on the property the Project will negotiate with the
        mortgager with the aim of transferring the mortgage to the new property acquired
        by the affected landowner.

    ·   The Kosovo Property Agency will be responsible for determining the ownership
        of land that was abandoned and/or occupied by others during the 1999 conflict
        and subsequent periods of unrest. Once the KPA has established ownership of the
        land, the owner will be eligible for exactly the same resettlement benefits as any
        other affected landowner. Non-owners that are occupying property belonging to
        people that fled during the conflict will be entitled to cash compensation for
        improvements and payment for loss of standing crops, but will not be entitled to
        any other resettlement benefits.

The surveys conducted by Prism and CDF for the SESA have not identified any people
working on village or community lands.

Rehabilitated land. There is an acute shortage of good agricultural land in the area around
the proposed mining and power complex. The option of providing a plot of rehabilitated
land is intended to encourage the Project Company to rehabilitate and make use of a large
area of overburden dumps that is presently owned by KEK. To make this option more
attractive, it is recommended that the Project offer affected landowners a larger area of
land than the plot that is affected and/or a package of additional benefits, which might
include technical assistance and/or the use of shared equipment. For instance, it may be
feasible to set up small agricultural cooperatives for groups of say 5 to 10 farmers from
the same village who wish to work together. The details of the option ought to be
developed in close consultation with the affected families.

Letter of Credit. The option of a letter of credit is designed to encourage affected
households to acquire new plots of agricultural land. The amount of the letter of credit
would be determined on the basis of the replacement value of the affected land, housing
and other immovable assets plus a small percentage (say 10%) intended to make this
option attraction more attractive to affected landowners. Once the amount has been


                                          24

determined, the landowner would be free to try and find a suitable plot for more or less
the same value as the letter of credit. The project would review the proposed purchase, to
ensure the land and other assets have been correctly valued and that documents are in
order and there are no outstanding disputes over boundaries, and will pay for the land,
transferring the title directly to the affected landowner. Given the fact that many people
in the project area do not reside on their land, this option may actually involve two letters
of credit: one for a new plot of agricultural land, and another for a new house.

Compensation. Compensation is not the preferred option for landowners whose farmland
is fully affected. Experience shows that affected families often use their compensation for
other purposes, leaving them without the means to recover their livelihoods and their
previous standards of living. Moreover, land markets in the project area are not very well
developed and it is difficult to establish accurate market values for agricultural land.
However, compensation is the only realistic option for landowners whose properties are
partially affected. In addition there are situations when compensation can provide a
useful opportunity for affected households to change their situation, for instance, people
that would like to retire from farming and move to urban areas, or people that depend on
other sources of employment and who would like to use their compensation to acquire an
apartment in town or capitalize a small business. The Project should employ a small team
of social workers, who would explain the different options to the affected households and
would help them decide which option would be most appropriate. The social workers
should review the situation of all landowners whose land is affected and should discuss
the use of compensation with them before their compensation payments are authorized.

Tenant Farmers and others working the land (sharecroppers, people with use rights).
The survey will show whether there are any non-owners working the land in the project
area and under what kind of arrangements. It is envisaged that people with formal
tenancy or sharecropping agreements will not be eligible for the same benefits as owners
or people with recognized rights to the land, since in these cases it is the landowner that
will receive compensation. The same applies to people that are using land belonging to
others without making any payments, for instance, sons working on their father's land or
people working the land of absentee relatives (in these cases the landowner would be
entitled to the land for land option or a letter of credit).

The main concern is to ensure that any non-owners who depend on the land can recover
their livelihoods. This might involve some kind of formal agreements with the owner/s of
the land who will be given other plots or compensation. It may also be possible to find
alternative areas that can be rented. The proposed compensation ­ equivalent to two years
loss of net earnings plus all transport costs and legal fees, is intended to give tenants and
sharecroppers sufficient time to arrange a new tenancy or sharecropping agreement and
assumes they will lose at least one year's harvest and may need another year to find a
landowner willing to allow them rent or sharecrop an equivalent plot of farmland.
However, if the survey and public consultations show that this option is not feasible it
may be necessary to consider alternative options, such as providing tenants and
sharecroppers with plots of rehabilitated land.




                                           25

  There may be situations where people have occupied land that belongs to people that
  have fled from the area. The occupants would be entitled to compensation for any
  improvements they have constructed plus their transitional costs, including loss of
  harvest, but they will not be eligible for any other benefits. The legal owner of the land,
  as determined by the KPA, will be entitled to the compensation, land for land or a letter
  of credit.

9.2    People affected by loss of housing

  Owners. People whose houses are affected will be offered the options of an alternative
  house in a new village or cash compensation. These options will be offered to all farmers
  that reside on their farms and to all households that own or occupy homes in the area
  affected by the project, regardless of the legal status of their titles. However it will not
  apply to tenants that have formal tenancy agreements or to people that have occupied
  houses that were abandoned by people that fled during the conflict. The replacement
  housing will include the provision of basic social housing that satisfies national and
  municipal standards. The exact size of the replacement house and number of rooms will
  be determined by the size of the household and not by the value of the house that is
  affected. This option is intended to make resettlement attractive for poorer, more
  vulnerable families, especially people living in sub-standard housing conditions. It also
  intended as an option that would allow neighbors, friends and relatives to continue living
  in close proximity. If they wish, people with larger, more valuable houses will be allowed
  to opt for cash compensation for their houses and other structures and a building plot in
  the resettlement village of the same size as their original house plot.

  The new housing project will provide houses with access to all basic services, including
  road access, street drainage, water supply, sewerage or connection to septic tanks,
  electricity and street lighting. A site for resettlement of the households from the village of
  Hade has already been selected in Shkabaj. The proposed site will be sufficient to house
  all the families from Hade, but is not large enough to replace the agricultural land that
  will be affected. The proposal would therefore be to re-house any families that wish to
  move from Hade to Shkabaj and to provide alternative plots of farmland on reclaimed
  land belonging to KEK, plots acquired with letters of credit or to allow farmers to use the
  compensation for their land to acquire new plots elsewhere.

  Compensation will be offered as an option to all owners. However, if the value of the
  compensation is less than the value of a new house, the payment would have to be
  authorized by the social worker and the manager of the resettlement program. This is to
  prevent compensation leading to the impoverishment of affected families.

  People that are given new houses in the resettlement village will be given freehold titles,
  issued in the joint names of both spouses. Non-owners and people whose original houses
  were worth less than the nominal value of the new house will not be allowed to sell or
  transfer their houses to a third party for a period of five years without the approval of the
  manager of the resettlement program. This is to reduce the possibility of low income
  families selling their houses to raise cash.




                                             26

         Tenants. Tenants that rent their houses or apartments under formal tenancy arrangements
         will be paid the equivalent of six months rent plus all transitional costs such as transport
         for their personal effects and any legal fees or taxes, and will be given assistance to find
         suitable alternative accommodation.

      9.3      People affected by loss of businesses or commercial premises

         The aim is to encourage businessmen and businesswomen to continue operating
         elsewhere or to set up a new business. Where an affected business is conducted on
         premises belonging to the owner, the owner will be offered the options of an alternative
         site for the business in the resettlement village or compensation for his/her land and
         premises at replacement value. The owner and will also be paid the equivalent of six
         months loss of net earnings if he/she opts for compensation and twelve months loss of net
         earnings if he/she opts to set up the business or open a new business in the resettlement
         village or elsewhere in the municipality. The project will also pay all transitional costs,
         such as packing and transport of equipment and/or stock to the new site, legal fees, taxes,
         and so on, and/or will provide assistance and logistic support to set up a new business.

         If the business operates from borrowed or rented premises, the owner of the business will
         be paid six months loss of net earnings or twelve months loss of net earnings if he/she
         sets up the business or starts a new business at the resettlement site or at another site in
         the same municipality. The owner will also be paid all transitional costs, including
         packing and transport of equipment and stock, legal fees, taxes, and so on, and/or will be
         given assistance and logistic support to set up a new business.

      9.4      People affected by loss of employment

         People that lose their employment as a result of the acquisition or closure of their places
         of work will be given the equivalent of at least six months salary (based on average
         earnings over the year prior to closure of the employer's business) and will be given all
         possible support to find alternative employment or to take up training.5 This will apply to
         people in regular full time employment and in regular part time employment.

      9.5      Transitional costs

         "Transitional costs" are the costs associated with the move from the original site to
         another site as well as loss of earnings and/or subsistence benefits. It includes all the legal
         fees, surveys and registration fees needed to transfer ownership and acquire a new
         property, as well as the costs of packing and transporting the affected household's
         personal effects, equipment and livestock. It should also cover any damage to personal
         effects and goods and the time and expenses and logistic expenses of the affected
         household, including travel and associated expenses incurred when looking for
         alternative land, houses or business premises.




5The project will pay any other redundancy payments required by law, including payments determined by length of
service and/or other factors.

10  Eligibility Criteria

  10.1    Cut-off dates

    It is recommended that the date of the definitive census carried out for preparation of the
    RAP should be used as the cut-off date for eligibility for resettlement benefits. Once a
    definitive census of the affected households has been carried out for an area that will be
    acquired, no new entrants will be eligible for compensation. In the case of the areas
    needed for mining, it is envisaged that the land acquisition will take place in distinct
    stages ­ each stage affecting one village at a time, with the process starting typically
    about five years before mining is expected to take place. The aim should be to complete
    the acquisition of all the properties where ownership is not in dispute within a period of
    12 months. A review procedure will be set up to determine the situation of any people
    that claim to have been missed by the census. Persons entering the affected area after the
    census has been completed will not be eligible for any benefits and could be evicted once
    title to the area has been transferred to the mine or power company. The census
    information will be shared with Government and the local Municipal Authorities and they
    will be jointly responsible for ensuring the affected area is not invaded by squatters
    seeking resettlement benefits.

  10.2    The household

    It is important to agree on a definition of "the household" - i.e. the people that would be
    entitled to replacement housing. This could be all the persons living in the same house,
    but it may be more appropriate to regard married couples, widows/widowers, divorced or
    separated people and their children as potentially separate households, each of which
    would be eligible for a separate housing unit at the resettlement village. The definition
    must be agreed before the first Resettlement Plan is finalized.

  10.3    Viability of remaining areas

   At present KEK defines a property as partially affected if the remaining area covers more
   than 14 are ­ that is to say, 0.14 of a hectare (one are is 10m x 10m). However, in practice
   few properties are classified as partially affected. A more practical definition that could be
   adopted is to offer the affected parties the option of selling the whole of their property if:


        ·   Any part of the structure of the house, farm or business is affected


        ·   More than 25% of the total property needs to be acquired


        ·   The remaining area is less than 0.5 of a hectare


        ·   The property is left without viable road access or loses access to any other critical
            asset, such as water or electricity supply, or




                                               28

   ·   The owner can demonstrate that the remaining property is no longer viable for the
       use to which it was previously put. In this case the owner would have to
       demonstrate that the remaining area is no longer viable.

In any of these cases the original owner should have the right to keep the remaining area
if he/she so wishes.




                                       29

11  Valuation of Land and Assets

  11.1   Principles of valuation

    Land and all other affected assets should be compensated at replacement value. In
    practical terms this means all buildings, outbuildings, fences and other structures, trees,
    permanent crops and improvements including pasture and standing crops, would be
    valued at the cost that would be needed to replace them, regardless of their condition at
    the time of valuation. The valuation of fruit trees and permanent crops should take into
    account the value of the harvests that will be lost. The value of farmland should be
    assessed on the basis of the classification of land types presently applied by KEK but
    would be based on the prices paid in actual land transactions in the same municipality
    and neighboring municipalities rather than the administrative values that are presently
    used. The existing classification of land types takes land use capacity into account, but
    does not consider factors such distance from roads, rivers or towns. However it has the
    advantage of being transparent and relatively simple to operate. The most important
    concern is to ensure that the valuation is based on real land transactions, which are not
    always the same as the transactions registered in the local cadastral offices.

    In addition landowners, homeowners and business owners should be compensated for all
    transitional costs. Some transitional costs, such as legal fees, surveys, registration and
    transport, can be paid directly by the project. The transitional costs associated with farms
    and businesses would also have to account for loss of earnings since many farmers will
    lose the opportunity to plant or harvest a crop because of displacement.

  11.2   Outline of the procedure

    The Project Company would be responsible for implementation of the procedures, which
    should be defined in more detail in the RAP. The Project would start by making contact
    with the affected parties. In the initial stages this would involve following up on contacts
    already established by MESP/Project Hade and KEK but could require a new, definitive
    census of the people that would be affected by the first phase of the mining project in
    order to prepare the RAP. All subsequent phases would require a new census to be
    carried out as part of the preparation of each RAP. If the affected parties agree, the
    project would then carry out a full survey the affected person or household's property and
    assets and would assess: i) whether the property should be classified as fully or partially
    affected, and ii) the value of the land and assets in the affected area or property,
    depending on whether it were classified as partially or totally affected.

    The initial valuation would be itemized, following existing KEK procedures,
    distinguishing the value of the land and the value of each affected asset: houses, barns,
    fences, trees and permanent crops, standing crops, and so on. This detailed estimate
    should be shared with the affected party, MESP (if it is agreed that MESP would be the
    Government agency responsible for overseeing resettlement) and the relevant
    Municipality. If the affected household accepts the valuation, the project would request
   approval from MESP. Once MESP has approved the valuation, the project would finalize
   the arrangements for the transfer of the property.


                                               30

If the affected party does not accept the initial valuation or believes assets have been
missed or undervalued, the project could carry out a second valuation. Alternatively ­ or
if the parties fail to reach agreement after a second valuation ­ MESP could engage an
expert or panel of experts to carry out an independent valuation. The experts would have
the right to enter the property to carry out the survey and valuation. MESP would then
call both parties to a meeting to discuss and agree on the level of compensation and/or
eligibility for resettlement benefits (land for land, housing solutions, etc.). If the parties
failed to reach an agreement after more than two attempts or if either of the parties failed
to attend more than two consecutive meetings without presenting an adequate
justification, MESP would take an independent decision on the level of compensation and
would communicate the decision to both parties in writing.

The Project Company should be responsible for all the costs associated with
implementation of the Resettlement Plan, including the costs of surveying, valuation,
searches of the land registry and so on. However, to ensure independence, MESP should
be responsible for all expenses associated with the independent valuation, including the
hire of experts or a panel of experts.

12 Public Consultation and Grievance Procedures

   A series of public consultations have already been carried out as part of the preparation of
   the Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA). The consultations have
   informed local people about the project and have identified their main concerns and
   expectations. However, once the Investor has been selected, the Project Company set up,
   and the key decisions taken in regard to the institutional responsibilities ­ especially the
   definition of the responsibility for implementing and paying for the resettlement of the
   villages of Hade and Dardhiste, it will be necessary to carry out a further round of public
   consultations in the affected area and in the town of Obiliq. The objectives would be to
   explain the principles of the RPF and develop the RAP.

   One of the aims of the consultations should be to establish effective channels of
   communication between the affected families, the local and national authorities and the
   project. This might include:

       ·   One or more negotiating committees comprising representatives from the villages
           affected by each stage of the mining and power project, which would help to
           develop the details of the resettlement plan, monitor its implementation, resolve
           disputes over eligibility for benefits and compensation, and perhaps negotiate the
           compensation measures for local infrastructure (for instance mosques, churches or
           cemeteries). The members of the committee would be elected by all the adults
           living in the affected villages.

       ·   A joint committee, comprising representatives from the affected families or
           negotiating committee, representatives of Obiliq Municipality (officials from the
           land cadastre and other key departments and elected representatives) and officials
           from MESP and perhaps other ministries (MEM, Ministry of Economy and
           Finance). This committee would review and approve the RAP/s and review and
           provide initial approval for any proposed secondary legislation or formal
           agreements that may be needed to formalize the key criteria and benefits
           described in the RAP/s. The committee could also review outstanding disputes
           over eligibility for benefits or entitlements, and review the proposed
           compensation measures for publicly owned infrastructure, including schools,
           clinics, roads, and so on.

   The details of the criteria, options and procedures from the resettlement plan should be
   widely publicized. This would involve printing booklets, radio shows and perhaps
   television.

   In addition the Lignite Power Project should incorporate an independent complaints
   procedure or mechanism for the resolution of grievances. It is recommended that this
   should cover all aspects of the power and mining project, rather than simply the
   resettlement program. For instance, it should be able to address the wider environmental
   concerns related to the mining and power projects including social and environmental
   impacts caused by the construction projects (i.e. the rehabilitation of Kosovo A and the



                                            32

construction of Kosovo C) and perhaps other more general issues, for instance relating to
opportunities for employment.

The independent mechanism would comprise an independent expert and a technical
assistant who would have direct access to the highest levels of management of the Project
Company/Investors, local government and national government. The mechanism should
be financed by the Project Company, but should report directly to Cabinet or the Minister
of Environment and Spatial Planning and to the International Financial Agencies
involved in financing the project. The independent expert would have an office in Obiliq
and would have transport so that he/she could visit and investigate anywhere in the
project area. The telephone, e-mail and location of the of the expert's office would be
widely publicized. All complaints or concerns would be registered in a confidential
database. The independent expert would be required to investigate and respond to any
complaints or concerns within a period of no more than 30 days. The independent expert
would also prepare quarterly reports, showing the number of complaints, identifying the
issues raised and the measures that were taken to resolve the problems that were
presented. The names and contact information of the complainants (addresses, phone
numbers, e-mail, etc.) should remain confidential; they should be registered in the
database, but should not be disclosed in the quarterly reports.

13 Timetable and Budget

   The detailed timetable for implementation of the resettlement program will be developed
   as part of the final resettlement plan. It should be developed in close cooperation with the
   mine planners, taking into account the proposed timing of the different phases of
   expansion of the Sibovc field. The most critical issue at this stage is preparation of the
   RAP for the first phase of the Sibovc mine.

   The indicative budget for the resettlement of all the families affected by mining
   operations is EUR 180-200M. This is based on an average cost of around EUR 120,000
   per household for a total of 1500 households.




                                              34

14 Conclusions and Recommendations

   It is envisaged that the Request for Proposals (RFP) will be finalized by June 30, 2008.
   Before the RFP can be finalized LPTAP should have agreed on the proposed approach
   and on the main issues identified in the present Resettlement Policy Framework. The
   most critical issues are:

   i) To determine how the responsibilities for resettlement will be transferred from
   MESP/Project Hade and KEK to the Project Company.

   ii) To determine whether the resettlement plan will cover the remedial actions needed to
   complete the resettlement of the families from Hade that are presently living in temporary
   accommodation and/or if it will cover the village of Dardhiste and/or any other villages
   outside the immediate area of the mining project.

   iii) To decide whether a separate resettlement plan will have to be prepared for the
   Kosovo C plant (i.e. if the green field site is chosen for the new plant).

   These issues will have to be discussed with MESP/Project Hade and with KEK/MEM.
   Once agreement has been reached, the Scope of Work will have to be prepared for the
   Social and Resettlement Components of the Project. The present document could be
   attached as an annex to the Request for Proposals.

   Once the contract has been awarded, the Project Company will prepare the final RAP/s.
   The first priorities will be to agree on the general criteria and entitlements that will be
   offered and to develop a detailed plan for the first stage of land acquisition for the Sibovc
   Mine. If the recommendations of this report are followed, this would basically cover the
   resettlement of the village of Hade. Preparation of the final plan may take as much as six
   months, since it will require considerable negotiation with people that have been
   temporarily resettled and with people still living in the affected area. The land-for-land
   proposal ­ i.e. the use of rehabilitated land from the overburden dumps will require
   detailed studies to ensure that the proposal is technically feasible.

   The detailed plans for acquisition of the villages that will be affected by subsequent
   phases of the expansion of the Sibovc field do not have to be prepared at this stage. It
   would be sufficient to include an indicative timetable, showing which villages will be
   affected by each stage of the mining project. However, the criteria, entitlements,
   institutional responsibilities and general approach should apply to all phases of the
   project and also to Kosovo C if the green field site is selected. If this is necessary, the
   preparation of a resettlement plan for Kosovo C should start as soon as selection of the
   site is confirmed.
