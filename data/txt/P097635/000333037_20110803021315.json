of a new lignite mine and\n            power station, in a manner consistent with international\n            best practices in regard to the management of the social,\n            economic, and environmental impacts of such developments.\n            Negative measures include: loss of land, loss of housing,\n            loss of businesses, loss of employment, and loss of services\n            and cultural heritage. Mitigation measures include: a)\n            people that are given new houses in the resettlement village\n            shall be given freehold titles, issued in the joint names of\n            both spouses.
