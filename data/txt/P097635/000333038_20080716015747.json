Mitigation measures of the\n            project are: 1) immediate securing (including fencing) of\n            the open mine and waste dump sites to prevent unauthorized\n            access; 2) implement access restriction devices and maintain\n            them in operation through a periodic verification service;\n            3)  impacted soil mapping should be prepared and appropriate\n            fencing/labeling should be introduced; 4) monitoring\n            campaign on noise to measure 8 hours dose and air quality\n            especially at the mines; 5) installation of settling ponds\n            to reduce the load of suspended solids and coal dust in mine\n            water; and 6) a noise survey should be undertaken both at\n            the work place or at the main receptors to be identified. A\n            proper comparison with applicable standards should be\n            performed in order to ascertain potential non compliance and\n            necessary mitigation measures."}, "docdt": "2008-07-11T00:00:00Z"}
