The\n            project objectives are: (i) support the Government's\n            strategy to preserve rather than expand the country's\n            main network by reducing the backlog of high-priority\n            periodic road maintenance, rehabilitation, resealing and\n            reconstruction works; (ii) carry out highway safety\n            improvement works at selected road intersections; and (iii)\n            to improve Ministry of Public Works (MTW's) capacity\n            and overall performance in planning, programming, and the\n            execution of periodic road maintenance and reconstruction\n            works by developing and implementing appropriate maintenance\n            management systems. An important result of the project is of\n            this report, in which MTW expresses its satisfaction with\n            the establishment of the Maintenance Management System to\n            set priorities for road repairs on rational bases; the\n            training of MTW personnel in the use of the Benkelman beam\n            to determine the existing strength of the existing\n            pavements, and the use of a Mays meter to determine\n            pavements' roughness, both of which will permit MTW to\n            assess the condition of the pavements for the preparation of\n            reliable road inventories."}, "docdt": "1993-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
