The proposed project provides for:\n            (i) road maintenance and rehabilitation (civil works and\n            equipment) for high priority road improvement and\n            maintenance within the framework of the Five-Year Highway\n            Investment Plan; (ii) highway safety (civil works and\n            equipment) to improve hazardous locations and increase the\n            safety and capacity of the network. It also provides for;\n            (iii) institutional strengthening, including technical\n            assistance, training and equipment to improve the operations\n            of MTW in planning, accounting and cost control, traffic\n            analysis and control, road maintenance and equipment\n            management, and materials and soils testing."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
