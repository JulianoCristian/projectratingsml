outcome is\n            rated marginally satisfactory, although this rating masks\n            different levels of performance among the several\n            components, with land and forestry being fully satisfactory,\n            public administration marginally satisfactory, and rural\n            finance unsatisfactory. Key lessons learned include the\n            following: Coordination with international development\n            agencies can improve the chances of a project's success\n            especially a project having a strong policy content.\n            Although they provide significant balance of payments\n            support, adjustment operations do not earmark funds to cover\n            incremental costs associated with investment activities. In\n            countries with severe fiscal problems, IDA should ensure\n            that the implementing agencies do receive the necessary\n            funds to carry out the related investments in a timely\n            manner. The flexibility of action plans should be carefully\n            designed. Action plans and legal agreements should include\n            provisions permitting technical adjustments to targets that\n            could be made during implementation without excessive\n            bureaucratic requirements. It is more prudent to unbundle a\n            set of reforms into smaller operations that address each\n            subsector separately. It may also be apt to add a parallel\n            investment project that provides the funds for the\n            implementing agencies to carry out the investment activities\n            associated with the adjustment operation. Lastly, an\n            adjustment operation of this type can lay the policy\n            framework for follow-up investment operations."}, "docdt": "1999-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
