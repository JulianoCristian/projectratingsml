MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Government of Indonesia (GOI) for the equivalent of US$47 million to
help finance a project to support industrial technology development. The loan would be at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of twenty years, including five
years of grace.
2.    Country/Sector Background. The Government recognizes that improving the
ability of its manufacturing sector requires an integrated approach to respond to increasing
international competition due to trade liberalization in APEC, the global reduction of trade
barriers, and the emergence of a number of other low-wage competitor countries. Within the
context of policies to maintain macroeconomic stability, Indonesia continues to pursue
economic deregulation and trade reforms to put pressure on firms to improve productivity
and product quality, and reduce costs. Restrictions on foreign direct investment also have
been largely eliminated to improve firms' access to foreign technology.  However, for
firms, particularly small and medium industries (SMIs), to respond effectively to increasing
competition, effective technology support services are needed to help them adopt best-
practice technologies, improve existing production processes and management, and develop
new products. Today those services are poorly provided. Dissemination of international
standards, and metrology services are inadequate; and calibration, testing, quality
certification and technological extension services are very weak and do not meet the needs
of industry. Unlike other high-performing East Asian countries (HPEACs) which have
developed effective technology support services to help their industries improve
international competitiveness, Indonesia's public R&D institutions typically are supply-
driven and barely used by private industry. The Government now has taken an initiative to
reform the public technology support institutions (PTSIs) and to encourage the private
provision of technology support services.
3.    Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. A recent OED review of Bank
lending for industrial technology (Report No. 12138) emphasized the need for an integrated
approach to foster industrial technological development (ITD) by improving the demand for
technological upgrading through competition policies and by strengthening the supply side
of ITD, including the links between government technology support services and industry.
Bank management agreed with this assessment and underscored the importance of ITD in
light of its importance for improving productivity and competitiveness. Management also
noted that more emphasis should be given to improving technology support services for
industry such as standards setting, testing, calibration and technology extension services.

4.    Among pertinent previous projects in Indonesia, the Industrial Restructuring Project
(IRP) (LN 3040-IND) and the Export Development Project (LN 2979-IND) have
demonstrated that technology support services indeed can play an important role in
improving the competitiveness of firms, especially small and medium scale industries, as
they have in other HPEACs, and that there is substantial potential demand for such services
in Indonesia. Another important lesson is that improved service delivery should be based on
enhancing the use of existing PTSIs and the promotion of private sector service providers,
rather than on creating new public institutions. Also, clear performance standards and
performance-based incentives are needed to improve the quality of the services provided by
the public technology support institutions. Experience under the IRP demonstrated that
metrology services and industrial standards need to be anchored in a broader national
strategy aimed at helping firms achieve world class quality standards. The IRP, the Science
and Technology Training Project (LN 2599-IND) and the Professional Human Resources
Development Project (LN 3134-IND) helped create a core team within the Agency for
Industrial Research and Development (BPPI) under the Ministry of Industry, the Agency for
the Application and Assessment of Technology (BPPT) under the Ministry of Research and
Technology, and within the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), that has internalized
these lessons and has designed action programs to shift the orientation of technology policy
toward the private sector.
5.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Country Assistance Strategy, which was
discussed by the Board on March 21, 1995, emphasizes the importance of improving
Indonesia's competitiveness, and the need for a shift toward a productivity-based economy
and the complementary private provision of supporting infrastructure services. The proposed
project addresses each of these areas through its support for more effective provision of
technology services to help improve the productivity and competitiveness of Indonesian
industry. It also would allow the Bank to deepen its dialogue with GOI on science and
technology and support policies and programs to promote the technological development of
private industry, particularly SMIs. In the expectation of closer Bank cooperation, GOI also
has introduced, for the first time, performance measurement and measures to promote
accountability in public R&D management in Indonesia. Project preparation has been an
instrument for establishing consensus and coordination among Government agencies and a
dialogue between Government and private industry, which are essential to strengthening the
link between technology and industrial policies. Our involvement has helped Government to
take advantage of the lessons from Bank-supported technology projects throughout the
world and prompted it to take a more pro-active stance in focusing ITD policies and
programs and in aligning them more clearly with private sector development and industrial
competitiveness. The Bank has also played a key role in establishing a common policy and
institutional framework for industrial technology development that is being supported by
other financiers, including the Asian Development Bank.
6.    Project Objectives. The objective of the project is to enhance the competitiveness of
Indonesian industry, particularly of small and medium industries (SMIs), by: (a) providing
public and private technology support services; (b) facilitating the access to public and



- 3 -
private technology service providers; (c) strengthening public technology support
institutions; and (d) improving the formulation of industrial and technology policies.
Specifically, the project would: (a) strengthen Indonesia's system of industrial metrology,
standards, testing and quality (MSTQ) support services; (b) support the diffusion of good
technology practices through a cost-sharing matching grant fund to finance the competitive
provision of technology upgrading services to SMIs by both public and private technology
suppliers; (c) provide assistance for reorienting public R&D labs towards supporting more
effectively technology development in private industry, especially SMIs; and (d) strengthen
the capacity to formulate and coordinate technology and industrial strategies, policies and
programs.
7.    Project Description. The project would consist of four main components. The first
component (at the estimated cost of US$5.2 million) would support implementation of
Indonesia's national plan for improving the industrial MSTQ support system that was
initially designed with German and Japanese technical assistance. The project would help
improve the dissemination of standards to industry, especially SMIs, and would provide
support for improving testing and calibration services and the national certification of
product quality and quality management practices, including ISO 9000 certification for
industry.
8.    The second component (US$14.6 million) would finance a matching-grant scheme,
the DAPATI program, that would reduce the cost to SMIs of buying technology upgrading
services from public R&D institutions, universities and the private sector. The scheme is
patterned after the successful experiences of several other countries in the region, e.g., South
Korea, Singapore and the Philippines, as well as in Mauritius recently with Bank support
(LN 3736-MAS) where economic benefits of at least 2-to-I are expected. The matching
grant scheme in Indonesia that would be supported under the project has similar objectives.
It has been designed to address the growing demand by SMIs for technical advice for
improving productivity, and product quality, reliability, design and delivery times due to
increasing international competition. It also would provide some funding, also on a
matching-grant basis, to help the domestic consulting industry improve its capabilities to
deliver technology services to SMIs. The procedures outlined in the DAPATI
Implementation Manual agreed with the Bank would ensure adequate quality of service
delivery and would minimize the scope for possible misuse of funds. In addition, the impact
of the program on beneficiary SMIs would be regularly assessed during its implementation.
9.    The third component (US$35.6 million) would support the implementation of
Government's Action Plan to move Indonesia's public industrial R&D system closer to
industry and improve the productivity of public R&D. This would be done by: (a)
implementing a new incentive scheme for the public technology support institutions (PTSIs)
that is aimed at commercializing their operations and reducing their dependence on
Government funding; (b) establishing advisory boards of representatives of the private
sector and user industry associations to strengthen the links between some of the PTSIs and
private industry; (c) encouraging the private provision of technology support services and
competition between public and private suppliers of those services; and (d) the use of



- 4 -
technical assistance under the project to restructure three PTSIs as pilots that would
implement market-oriented business plans that have been appraised by the Bank and are
aimed at serving industry more effectively and at substantially increasing revenue generation
from the sale of technology and technical services to industry.
10.   The fourth component (US$5.5 million) would strengthen the capacity of BPPT's
Science and Technology Policy Unit and the Policy Unit of the Agency for Industrial R&D
(BPPI) under MOI, to strengthen the formulation of results-oriented industrial and
technology policies and programs, and to improve coordination between them.
11.   Project Financing: Total project costs are estimated at US$60.9 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$45.3 million equivalent. In addition to the
US$6.2 million contribution expected from the private sector under the matching-grant
scheme, the Bank would finance US$47.0 million equivalent and GOI would finance
US$7.7 million equivalent. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
12.   Project Implementation. The proposed project would be carried out by BPPI,
BPPT and LIPI. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in the Republic of Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 14900-IND dated November 15, 1995 is being distributed
separately.
13.   Project Sustainability.  Technology services under the matching-grant scheme
would be provided with charges for those services set to ensure commitment on the part of
beneficiary SMIs to use those services effectively and to achieve levels of cost recovery
comparable to other countries that have adopted similar schemes. Over time such schemes
have succeeded in getting firms accustomed to using consultants at full cost. While
temporary in nature, similar programs elsewhere have also led to a substantial permanent
increase in the number and quality of technology support services that are available. The
new incentive scheme for the PTSIs and their implementation of market-oriented business
plans would allow them to achieve self-financing ratios by the end of the project that would
be in the range of those for comparable institutions elsewhere in the region. The requirement
of greater accountability and self-financing of the public technology support institutions
under the project would make their activities more responsive to the needs of industry and
ultimately more self-sustaining. Setting clear performance benchmarks, tying researchers
incentives to performance and encouraging accountability for public technology support to
industry will change the way research budgets are managed. This would put support for
industrial technology development on a different path in Indonesia. The project would be an
important first step to shift the orientation of Indonesia's R&D infrastructure toward the
private sector. It is expected that the approach adopted under the project would
subsequently be applied by Government to other technology support institutions, and the
lessons learned during implementation of the project would feed into Indonesia's future
technology policies.

14.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, GOI agreed to: (a) implement its Action Plan
for the commercialization of the PTSIs, including key performance indicators and self-
financing targets for the PTSIs supported under the project; (b) carry out the DAPATI
matching grant program in accordance with an agreed implementation manual, including (i)
entering into a contract with a management consulting firm to undertake day-to-day
operations; (ii) maintaining a technical supervisory committee, with adequate private sector
representation, for overall management of the program; and (iii) annually reviewing with the
Bank the adequacy of the Implementation Manual; (c) maintain a Steering Committee,
chaired by BAPPENAS and including private sector representatives, with overall
responsibility for project implementation and policy guidance, as well as Project
Management and Implementation Units for day-to-day implementation responsibilities; (d)
monitor and evaluate overall Project implementation in accordance with agreed performance
indicators; and (e) comply with agreed reporting and auditing procedures. Procurement and
selection of consultants would be in accordance with Bank Guidelines. To safeguard the
timely implementation of the project, complete bid packages for all the major technical
assistance contracts have been finalized and agreed with the implementing agencies.
15.   The following conditions for Bank loan disbursement have been agreed to: (a) with
regard to equipment and twinning arrangements for the commercialization of the PTSIs,
GOI would have issued the necessary regulations, satisfactory to the Bank, for
implementation of the Action Plan; and (b) with regard to the DAPATI program, GOI would
have entered into a satisfactory contract with a management consulting firm, and DAPATI
grants are provided in accordance with the agreed implementation manual. While progress
on the necessary actions in these two project areas is well advanced, the conditions of
disbursement, rather than conditions of loan effectiveness, would allow implementation of
each independent project component to proceed without necessarily being delayed by or
delaying other project components.
16.   Environmental Aspects.  The environmental category for the project is C.
Although the project would not require the preparation of an environmental assessment, it
would provide some support to activities for improving the environment, e.g., the public
R&D institutions supported under the project include laboratories that provide technical
support services for improved environmental management.
17.   Program  Objective Categories. Implementation of the project would support
private sector development and improved public sector management.
18.   Project Benefits. The Country Assistance Strategy emphasizes the importance of
improving Indonesia's competitiveness and the need for complimentary private provision of
supporting infrastructure services. The proposed project addresses both these areas. The
package of policy reforms. institutional strengthening and capacity building is expected to
help enhance the competitiveness of Indonesia's small and medium industries, the target
group of the project. While the benefits of the actions supported under the project do not
lend themselves to precise quantitative analysis, there is ample evidence from the high



- 6 -
performing East Asian countries that effective technology support services yield high
economic and financial returns for manufacturing companies through reduced product
defects, faster manufacturing turnaround times, lower inventories, higher productivity,
increased domestic and export sales and new product designs. These benefits are multiples
of the cost of the corresponding services and substantially increase the returns on SMIs'
existing investments in plant, equipment and human capital. A least-cost approach to project
design was taken to increase the effectiveness and utilization of the existing technology
service infrastructure primarily through changes in incentives and management practices,
accountability and systems, rather than through investments in additional equipment. The
project will lead to increased private provision of technology services and increasing
commercialization and results orientation of public industrial technology services, with
greater accountability and transparency in public resource use, which are expected to sustain
the development of a technology service industry in Indonesia without straining the
Government's budget.
19.   Risks. The reorientation of the public technology infrastructure towards commercial
use and result-oriented management, the effective coordination of Government policies for
industry and science and technology, and the development of competent private service
providers may be slower than envisaged. Similarly, the SMI sector may be slow in
accessing the new services being offered. To help minimize these risks, project preparation
was extended to: (a) help build consensus within Government on the need for and ways to
reorient public support for industrial technology development, including drawing on best
practices from other countries' experiences; (b) develop a new policy framework for driving
the public technology support institutions (PTSIs) to commercialize their research and
development activities, and to require of them greater accountability for achieving
measurable results, and increased transparency and better management of their operations;
(c) provide the PTSIs under the project an opportunity .to develop sound business plans for
their commercialization based on assessments of market demands and to build a pipeline of
technology projects with private industry; and (d) obtain the participation of private industry
and professional consulting associations in project design and implementation.
20.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.
