Project experience offers the following\n            lessons: 1)  Industrial technology development projects\n            aimed at commercializing public research and development\n            (R&D) institutions should be undertaken only in\n            environments where the budgets of these institutions are not\n            restricted by Government regulations. 2) It is a mistake to\n            add support for small and medium enterprises to the mandate\n            of general R&D institutions whose principal clients are\n            larger, more sophisticated enterprises. 3) Matching grant\n            schemes should be designed to maximize returns to public\n            resources invested in them, under the same principle that\n            applies to any public investment. 4) Projects to develop\n            public R&D institutions should pay closer attention to\n            recurrent costs, as the benefits quickly diminish if the\n            Government cannot meet future maintenance and repair costs."}, "docdt": "2005-07-05T00:00:00Z"}
