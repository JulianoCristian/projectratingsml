Among the several lessons\n            learned, it is suggested the Government provide strong\n            incentives for external revenue generating activities, so\n            that research institutions can move from being wholly\n            government-funded, to developing its self-financing\n            capacity. Institutions should be allowed to retain, and\n            accumulate their earnings, as well as the ability to use\n            such earnings with greater flexibility, and freedom. The\n            project experience with institutions learning from each\n            other, proved useful, and with positive results; it would\n            thus be beneficial for future project design, to explore the\n            possibility of twining among institutions within the\n            country, rather than seeking foreign inputs. It is\n            reinforced, that procurement training at the early stages\n            should be provided, considering as well additional capacity\n            building for implementing agencies, particularly when Bank\n            procurement guidelines are seemingly new to borrowers, a\n            fact that could avoid unnecessary delays during\n            implementation. In addition, it is important to provide easy\n            access to capital financing, and technology for small and\n            medium scale industries (SMIs), to achieve business growth,\n            and fully utilize the technology, management, and marketing\n            skills acquired under the project. To this end the project\n            should have been integrated in a broader strategy of\n            assistance to SMIs."}, "docdt": "2002-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
