The project has also strengthened the\n            Artificial Insemination (AI) service in Punjab through the\n            provision of buildings and equipment which will be useful in\n            the future. Likewise, it has provided improved facilities\n            and laboratory equipment to the College of Veterinary\n            Sciences which can increase the training standard of stock\n            assistants in the province and assist provision of extension\n            advice to Village Livestock Association (VLA). Particular\n            attention should be paid during project formulation to\n            limiting the number of components to those strictly\n            necessary for attaining the project's main objectives,\n            and temptations to address all problems simultaneously.\n            Critical examination is recommended at appraisal of the\n            designated executing agencies existing and planned\n            commitments, organizational structure, modus operandi and\n            staff capabilities in order to assess their implementation capacity."}, "docdt": "1987-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
