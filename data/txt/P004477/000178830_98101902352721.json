          to strengthen the capacity of PPA to operate and maintain\n            national ports; (b) to increase the operating efficiency and\n            throughput capacity at the project ports through the\n            introduction of improved port management and maintenance and\n            the provision of additional berths and ancillary services;\n            and (c) to stimulate growth of these important secondary\n            ports to support the Governments's strategy of\n            dispersing industrial development away from Metropolitan\n            Manila. By improving port operations and increasing port\n            productivity through reduced congestion, cargo losses and\n            handling costs, the project would provide more economical\n            means of transporting major agricultural commodities\n            produced in the hinterland to the project ports for domestic\n            and foreign markets, and consumer goods shipped from Manila\n            for distribution in the influence areas of the project\n            ports. The resulting increase in commerce between the major\n            domestic markets near Metropolitan Manila and the project\n            ports is expected to stimulate the economy of port areas\n            which are potential centers for future growth."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
