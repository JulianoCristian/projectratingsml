The multi-sectoral and multi-facted\n            design of the project was overly complex for the Costa Rican\n            context. Given the poor performance of the project, options\n            for full or partial cancellation were considered during the\n            last three years of implementation. The monitoring and\n            evaluation design was considered dismal and inadequate.\n            While the project complied with the Bank's policy and\n            procedural requirements, the overall procurement\n            arrangements were moderately unsatisfactory. The next phase\n            of the project will involve authorities undertaking efforts\n            to consolidate arrangements for operational maintenance of\n            the assets created under the project. The overall outcome\n            rating given was 'Highly Unsatisfactory.' The\n            assessment of risk to development outcome was rated\n            'High'; the overall bank performance an\n            'Unsatisfactory'; and overall borrower performance\n            an 'Unsatisfactory.' The lessons learned from this\n            project confirm that the success of failure of a project\n            reaching its development objectives is determined by the\n            quality of the project's conceptual design, its\n            organizational arrangements, and the institutional\n            coordination adopted. Multi-sector projects require a strong\n            and effective interagency coordination backed by top level\n            Government endorsement and accountability."}, "docdt": "2014-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
