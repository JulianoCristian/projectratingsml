                         Implementation and disbursement rate of the Project entering its third year of execution, remains low (at approximately 5%), although significant progress has been made in
                         contracting of preparatory studies and consultancies for future works. With the approval and ratification of the Second Amendement to the Loan Agreement, new subcomponents will
                         become eligible to initiate implementation, further accelerating the implementation of Project activities.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         During the February 2012 meeting of the Interinstitutional Committee a decision was taken involving the different executing agencies to increase coordination among the different
                         planning processes contemplated under the Project (Patios, Port of Limon Master Plan and the Strategic Plan for the City of Limon). Additionally, a decision was taken to further
                         strengthen the PCU's technical capacity to ensure stronger coordination and quality control.
