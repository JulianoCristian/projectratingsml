                         During the last fiscal year progress towards achieving the established PDOs has been delayed by national elections (on February 2010) and the resulting transition period, with the
                         new administration taking office in May 2010. This has had an impact on the overall institutional set-up and organization of the Project, both within the various Project Executing Units

                         conditions so it is expected that tangible results in advancing PDOs will be attained during this fiscal year.
