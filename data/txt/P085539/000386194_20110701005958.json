The City-Port of Limon project was approved in\n            January 2008 and declared effective in October 2009. Given\n            the time lag between project approval and the initiation of\n            project implementation, specific provisions within the Loan\n            Agreement (LA) need to be corrected, updated or reviewed in\n            order to ensure an adequate project implementation. Project\n            implementation has seen initial shortfalls, with no major\n            disbursements to date. The delays in project execution can\n            be partially attributed to: (i) the overall institutional\n            complexity of the project, which involves different\n            institutional set-ups for each of the eleven project\n            activities, reflected in inter-institutional agreements, and\n            each of which constitutes a specific disbursement condition;\n            (ii) delays in the full establishment of the Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU), due to changes in leadership,\n            bottlenecks in the staffing process, shortfalls in\n            counterpart funding and weaknesses regarding operational\n            procedures and monitoring and evaluation tools in place; and\n            (iii) the political transition, with new authorities\n            entering office in May 2010, and the resulting repercussions\n            on many of the institutions directly and indirectly involved\n            in project execution, among others. However, since October\n            2010, considerable progress has been made in the signing of\n            inter-institutional agreements, complying with disbursement\n            conditions under priority project activities. The\n            restructuring has no implications in terms of environmental\n            and social safeguards."}, "docdt": "2011-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
