                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Objective of the project is to: (i) improve the protection and management of Limon's cultural and natural heritage; (ii) increase access to the sewage system and
                         reduce urban flooding in the area of Limoncito; (iii) foster a more efficient, accountable and credible local government; (iv) create new employment opportunities
                         through small and micro-enterprises; and (v) support the port modernization process and improve freight transport access to the port terminals.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation and disbursement rate of the Project, entering its fourth year of execution, remains low (at approximately 6%). After a Mid Term Review mission in October of 2012,
                         an agreement was reached to restructure the project in order to expedite implementation. However, this restructuring is still pending approval and it is unlikely that any structural
                         changes to the loan agreement (third amendment) will be possible. Since October of 2012 slow progress has been made and only an additional USD2.17mm have been disbursed,

                         totaling USD4.67mm. Some progress has been made in advancing the urban revitalization and local economic development components. Nevertheless, progress on priority
                         components has been very limited and programming indicates that these activities will not be completed prior to the closing date. Given low disbursements to date and the inability to
                         undertake a significant restructuring, project activities financed by the Bank loan will only be partially completed by the project closing date on June 30th of 2014.
