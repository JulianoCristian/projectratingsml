recovery and\n            design a coherent economic policy framework; and 2) provide\n            the private sector with the means to resume operations and\n            create jobs. The project's components support imports\n            by the government and the private sector of high priority\n            items on a broad positive list, and technical assistance to\n            help implement reconstruction and re-establish basic\n            government functions. Eligible imports will include spare\n            parts, inputs and capital equipment in priority sectors such\n            as: agriculture, industry, transportation, energy, water and\n            sanitation, education and health."}, "docdt": "1995-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
