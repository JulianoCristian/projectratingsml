Some lessons learned included: the grant\n            proved to be an effective mechanism for the Bank to\n            intervene in a situation where its normal tools will not\n            have responded in time, and emergency grant helped to lay\n            the basis for Bank direct intervention. It is important in\n            these situations to appraise the Government of the nature of\n            the type of operation and have it involved where practicable\n            to dispel possible dissatisfaction by the government in\n            being by-passed. It will be essential, in grant operations,\n            to stipulate the procedures for the disposal of all major\n            equipment and vehicles purchased through the proceeds of the\n            grant in the legal agreements to minimize misunderstandings."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
