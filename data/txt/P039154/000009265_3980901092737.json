Some lessons learned included: the\n            design of emergency operations should be kept simple, and\n            particularly avoid operational conditions for effectiveness.\n            Conditions that are essential for the operation of the\n            credit should be conditions for board presentation. It is\n            important to gauge the government's capacity and\n            commitment, in order to design an operation that responds\n            effectively the realities in the country. Deep understanding\n            of politically sensitive issues by the Bank, and\n            International Development Association (IDA) and donor\n            procedures by the Borrower, are important for the Bank and\n            the Borrower to understand each other and work well\n            together. The ECR served as a catalyst for providing funding\n            for the reconstruction of Rwanda and encouraged\n            burden-sharing among donors. As such, it represented an\n            important part of a broad-based international rescue effort;\n            however, there was a lack of coordinated effort to raise the\n            additional resources required for an effective recovery program."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
