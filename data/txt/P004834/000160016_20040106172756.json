   REHABILITATION PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated satisfactory,\n            with project sustainability likely. The overall performance\n            of both the World Bank and the Borrower are rated\n            satisfactory. A number of lessons have been identified based\n            on project implementation, these include: The authority,\n            responsibilities and accountability of the implementing\n            agencies should be sufficient and clearly defined at project\n            start-up. The ability of agencies outside the project - but\n            inside the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development -\n            to delay implementation should be reduced. The existence of\n            an institutional framework and capacity to coordinate\n            activities and decision-making among project implementing\n            agencies effectively is a prerequisite for efficient and\n            timely project management. Good coordination among agencies\n            at all levels requires common understanding of the project\n            concept and objective and shared information. To facilitate\n            this common understanding, primary project documents such as\n            the Staff Appraisal Report, Mid-term Review, and periodic\n            Aide-Memoires should be translated and widely distributed\n            throughout the project as they become available.\n            Institutional capacity building (e.g. for operation and\n            maintenance, and cost recovery) should include activities\n            enabling timely recruitment and participation of locally\n            engaged staff. Greater emphasis on community development and\n            participatory methods in project planning should be included\n            in future projects, early in implementation. Socioeconomic\n            considerations are important in water user association and\n            irrigation management company strengthening programs.\n            Projects should address special needs, such as instruction\n            in family and community financial management, to help ensure\n            local commitment and active farmer involvement. This can be\n            particularly critical when changes in water user fees are\n            part of project design. Social baseline surveys and\n            participatory needs assessments should be routinely included\n            when designing future programs for rural development and\n            poverty reduction. Extension service and farmer technical\n            support activities should commence at an earlier stage in\n            future Projects. The introduction of new activities (such as\n            financing tertiary system development through loan financing\n            and farmer training at the local level) should be well\n            designed, openly discussed and realistically scheduled.\n            Major investments in irrigation system rehabilitation in\n            areas adjacent to urban communities need to be assessed\n            carefully in light of likely land use changes."}, "docdt": "2003-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
