 IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent EvaluationGroup assesses the programsand activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrityof the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Banks work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessonsdrawn from experience.As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Banks lending operationsthrough field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directorsor Bank management have requestedassessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.        ,
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examines project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
       IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized).Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

This Project Performance Assessment reviewsthe experience o f four projects: the
Irrigation RehabilitationProject (IDA-27110); the Water Supply Project (IDA-N0260,
TF-29548, TF29270, TF-20966) the Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitation Project
(IDA-30000), and the Coastal Wetlands ProtectionProject (IDA-3292). As a building
block o f the forthcoming IEG study, The Effectiveness o f Bank Support for Water, it also
reviewsthe way inwhich the Borrower andthe Bank have approached water-related
issues generally, and how this approach has changed over time.

The PPAR was prepared by the IndependentEvaluationGroup (IEG).It is based onthe
Memoranda o f the President (MOP), sector and economic reports, special studies,
Country Assistance Strategies (CASs), Policy Framework Papers, credit documents,
reviewofproject files, and discussions with Bank staff. An IEGmissionvisitedVietnam
inDecember 2008 for three weeks and discussed the effectiveness o fthe Bank's
assistance with government officials, other development organizations, beneficiaries, and
stakeholders. Their kindcooperation and invaluable assistance inthe preparationo f this
report are gratefully acknowledged.

Four ImplementationCompletion Reports (Report No. ICR000004, ICR0000375,27427-
VN, 32365-VN) were preparedby the East Asia and Pacific Region. Based on field visits
and interviews with officials and beneficiaries, this PPAR supports ICR findings inall
important particulars and finds themto be an accurate portrayal o f implementation,
although it providesmore updatedinformation and explores topics not covered
previously. This report reviewsthe country's overall approach to the water sector,
especially with respect to the management o f water resources. Inparticular, this PPAR
identifies lessons learned for future in-country work with respect to the water and the
environment.

Copies of the draft PPAR have beensent to the relevant government officials and
agencies for their review and comments. N o comments were received from the borrower.

 Summary

This Project Performance Assessment reviewsthe experience o f four projects: the
Irrigation RehabilitationProject (IDA-27 1     lo),  the Water Supply Project (IDA-N0260,
TF-29548, TF-29270, TF-20966), the Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitation Project
(IDA-30000), and the Coastal Wetlands Protection Project (IDA-3292).

Vietnam is rich inwater resources andhoneycombedwith riversand canals. It is one of
the world's highestrainfall countries, having a distinct rainy season, and four to five
months accounting for about 75-85 percent o fthe total rainfall. This concentrated rainfall
causes water shortages inthe dry season and flooding at other times.

Since 1990 Vietnam's economy has recorded an annual average GDP growth rate o f
nearly 7.5 percent, but its remarkable economic achievements inthe period leading up to
the global downturn have placedheavy demands on the nation's fragile natural resource
base. Vast highland forests have beenunsustainably exploited and have evenbecome
barreninplaces, and farmers have cultivated steep andunprotected terrain, leadingto
runoff and erosion. Deforestation contributes to flooding and siltation o f waterway
transport corridors and coastal irrigation systems. As demands for water grow withinthe
expanding industrial economy and from the households o f the increasingly affluent and
growing urbanpopulations, the protection o fthe quality o f water resources and the
sustainable management o f water generally have not been given adequate attention. .

There is general agreement that the challenges facing Vietnam's water sector include:

    0   Increasing competition for unpolluted freshwater resources including
        groundwater;
    0   Increasingquantities o f effluent from industrial, municipal, and
        agricultural/aquacultural sources (water pollution);
    0   Increasingly severe and frequent storms and floods affecting a growing population
        living inlow-lying and coastal zones;
    0   Rising costs o f supplyingwater and sanitation. (So that tariffs do not exceed the
        ability o f users to pay for it, several city systems operate at a deficit.)

Over the last ten years, there have been32 water-related interventions approved or
completed inVietnam and financed by the World Bank. These programs, projects, and
grants represent a total o fUS$2.74 billion.

This report focuses on the experience o ffour very different water projects. The
Irrigation Rehabilitation Project was the first Bank-assisted irrigation project in
modern Vietnam. Irrigation water inVietnam i s mostly surface water provided by the
Mekong.

The Water SupplyProject was designed to deal with the poor conditiono fthe hydraulic
infrastructure found inmost cities. Dating from around the beginningo f the 20th century,
aging water and sewerage infrastructure had not been adequately maintained. Creating

                                               xiv


conditions that would attract foreign direct investmentwas a GoV priority, but water
infrastructure constraints inurban areas was a negative inthe otherwise positive
investment climate. Lack o f safe water and upgraded sanitation facilities were the major
causes o f Vietnam's highincidence o f water-borne and hygiene-related diseases.

The Mekong Delta is the breadbasket ofthe country, and InlandWaterways and Port
ImprovementProjectwas intendedto facilitate low-cost water transport of goods and
agricultural products towards the north and overseas export markets.

Increasing the productivity o f the Mekong Delta, and, more specifically, creating
thousands o f ponds to foster seafood production devastated the seashore environment to a
degree that endangered the very activities that produced steadily rising incomes. The
CoastalWetlandsProtectionProjectwas aimed at restoring andprotectingcritical
coastal ecology, devastated originally by tropical storms and the pursuit o f quick gains
from the unsustainable farming o f shrimp.

The experience and achievements o fthese projects are as follows. The Irrigation
RehabilitationProjecttook place at a time when the economy was fully engaged ina
process o f liberalization, and it rehabilitatedirrigation infrastructurejust as the market
economy and the private sector were coming into their own. The freeing-up o f
agricultural commodity prices inthe 1990s made rice a profitable crop indeed for farmers
inthe Central Coastal Plain. Increasesinriceproductiondue to a reliable supply of
agricultural water contributed to improved farm incomes and reduced Vietnam'srural
poverty. Vietnam went from a food deficit country to the world's second largest rice
exporter. The office incharge o f coordinating implementation had to oversee a number o f
subprojects scattered over a wide and difficult'to access area, which proved to be
challenging. Floods and typhoons in 1998 and 1999 inCentral Vietnam and in2000 in
the Mekong Regionalso slowedthe speedo fimplementation by damaging some works
that had already beenrehabilitated to the point where they requireda second restoration.
Due to cascading delays, the project closed 18 months later than expected. But the
various holdups also made time which some systems usedto expandthe coverage
provided by the canals. By credit closing, 12provinces had beenserved, compared to the
seven originally envisaged. Achievements interms o f the rehabilitation o f irrigation
schemes covered 99.8 percent o f what was planned, as well as additional repairs and
improvements related to the flooding.

Prior to 2008, farmers were not charged for the volume o f water they used becausethere
was no infrastructureto monitor the volume o f water usage by such a large number o f
small-holders. They were charged a fixed fee based on the area o f their irrigated crop
land. InNovember2007, the Government issued a Decree on irrigation fees that
stipulated that from 2008 on, farmers were exempt from the irrigation fee. The decree
eliminates one o f farmers' biggestexpenses but had impacts touched on below.

The utilities participating inthe Water Supply Projectwere subsidized entities at the
beginning o fthe project, but by the end all were able to cover their operations and
maintenance costs and make payments on the Bank loan. Following loan closing some
beganto experience revenue shortfalls and water quality problems. In2006, the
government decided to impose price controls on urban water, which had a bigger impact

                                                 xv


 on the utilities that had been lagging behind.The first objective was to improve the
 quality of water service by connecting more households. The total number o f connections
 more thandoubled, going from 275,000 to 630,000. A second objective was to ensure the
 sustainability o f the physical investmentsby developing institutional capabilities and staff
 skills, and facilitating commercialization. Since project initiation, the volume of water
 sold increased dramatically inQuang Ninhand Hanoi, but it remained constant in
 Haiphong, where coverage has been at the 100 percent level for some time. The amount
 o f non-revenue water supplied has gone down inall three cities inthe course o f the
 project and since project closing. The most dramatic decline occurred inHaiphong which
 went from fifty percent to twenty percent. Duringnegotiations, local governments gave
 up-front commitments to raise tariffs annually to specific levels determined at appraisal.
 As long as they were allowed to, water supply companies didraise tariffs to levels that
permittedthemto cover operating costs and debt service. Just as inthe irrigation sector
 (withthe abolition ofcharges for the agricultural use o fwater), the government's
 decision to freeze water tariffs i s a definite complicating factor, the full impact o f which
will be a function o fthe lengtho ftime it is left inplace.

The InlandWaterways andPortProjectcontributedto a huge increase inwaterway
traffic and transported cargo. In 1995,23.5 million tons o f cargo was carried through the
inlandwaterway. By 2004, the last year for which data is available, 55 milliontons to
cargo was transported through the waterways. Duringthe five-year period between2000
and 2004, the annual average increase incargo exceeded 8 percent. The project: (a)
eliminated a dredgingbacklog; (b) prepared main routes for the routine use o f large
vessels and barges, (c) financed canal widening, ensuringthat the required water depth
was present throughout, (e) increased overhead clearances, and (f) eliminated sharp bends
inwaterways. On-ground towers and beacons were installedas aids to navigation. Itwas
reported that the installation ofthe floating and on-land navigationaids has helpedthe
canals to be safer for 24 hour operation. Waterway operations have also benefited from
better police enforcement o f rules and the accident rate has gone down. A recent
government decree eliminated fees for the thousands o f ships usingthe inlandwaterways.

Widening the waterways involved land acquisition, and resettling a larger than
anticipated number o f families slowed the implementationprocess. Also, no plans had
been made about what to do with the spoil (dredged material) or where to deposit it.
Figuringout what to do with countless tons o fmudtook time although it was ultimately
usedby local landowners to raise their holdings above the flood water level, thus
reducing potential damage due to floods and enhancing building and property values. The
increase inship traffic, and especially the use o f the waterways by high speed water
transport, has severely eroded canal embankments. Siltation, caused by bank collapse and
deforestation, i s clearly reducingthe time before maintenance dredging i s again
necessary. The project financed major improvement to Can Tho Port including the
pavement o f the entire port area, installation of dock bumpers and other improvements to
berths, and cranes for container loadinghnloading. The increased ship traffic inthe
project-improved canals and waterways i s reflected ina dramatic increase inthe Port's
throughput. Duringproject preparation Can Tho's cargo flow was originally predictedto
increase to about 1.2 million tons by the year 2010. By late 2008, however, total cargo
flow was already at 3 million tons; about 6 times what was to be expected at this stage.
At project closing, the profitability o f Can Tho Port was not upto appraisal expectations.

                                               xvi


 Inthe time between the ICRandPPARmissions, however, operating revenueat CanTho
 grew six fold. Can Tho Port was legally mergedwith SaigonPort inJuly 2002 inorder to
 consolidate the operation o f all the port terminals inthe Mekong delta. There is also a
planto set up anoperation center consisting o f 5 smaller satellite portsthat would make
up anetwork o fMekong Deltaports feeding CanTho. And a follow-on project is under
preparation that will create two more canal systems runningthrough the delta to reduce
pressure on the current system, and eliminate the slowdown caused by one narrow stretch
whichhas proved to be a bottleneck for shipping.

The Coastal Wetlands Protection Project was very innovative, and it was one ofthe
first IDA funded efforts inthe forestry sector. Because it was a very new kindo f
undertaking, it took about half a decade to put together. A great deal happened during
that period that made that early appraisal effort irrelevant and out o f date, and it had to be
repeated. Several varieties o fmangroves were planted along the beach, and taller
indigenous species that look like casuarinas were put inslightly inlandto serve as a
windbreak. About 370 million trees have beenreplantedalong 460 kilometers of coast.
Creating a capacity and willingness to protect the environment was also extremely
important: Protection contracts given out to smallholders made the reforestation
achievement sustainable by effectively protecting mangroves.

The project's humanimpacts were greatest interms o fthe resettlement effort and the
technical and economic support provided to the households inthe project area to wean
them from reliance on forest products. Average per capita incomes have increased
steadily inall provinces andpoverty rates have decreased significantly. Poverty rates in
vulnerable communes.served by the project decreasedby 38 percent and average annual
incomes increased by 55 percent by the end o f implementation, according to survey
respondents. The resettled households are much better off than they were before. People
used to live on land so low and so near the sea that even slightly higher than normal tides
caused flooding. The new resettlement sites are protected from the sea by dikes, and they
enjoy improved access to critical infrastructure, road networks, and markets. People find
it much easier to earn a livingthrough commerce.

An ethnic minority development planfocused on 17 Khmerpagodas andtheir
congregations. The plan, developed using participatory techniques, included the
upgrading o f classrooms for Khmer children, the construction o f crematoria, and the
procurement o fmusical instruments and huge Khmer racing canoes for use intraditional
festivals. Khmer communes significantly improvedtheir quality o f life which helped
themto betterintegrate into Vietnamese society. Inreturn for project support to their
pagodas, religious authorities have spoken strongly to their congregants about the
importance o fprotecting the reforested sites. Improved land tenure was granted to
farmers living inthe buffer zones through the issuance o f certificates granting land use
rights for residential and productivelands.

Outside o fthe projects, important developments are happening. The National Water
Resources Strategy has begunbuildinga broad consensus around corrective measures
that will ensure a more environmentally sustainable future. The Bank has worked well
with the government on refining a strategic approach. Reports such as the six volume
series on Vietnam's infrastructure challenge ensure that development community

                                              xvii


investments helpthe country to build on a solid foundation. And the partnership o fthe
Government with the broader donor community inthe Water Sector Review has ledto
highly meaningful, open, and transparent communicationon key issues.

Inconclusion, the water sector is doing quite well inVietnam.The four projects reviewed
inthisreport are all ratedsatisfactory. All have made significant achievements and
fulfilled the objectives set for them at appraisal. Monitoring and evaluation was given
highattentioninall four projects. The major donors (includingthe Bank) have
established a productive relationship with the Government inthe water sector.

The projects' experience suggeststhe following lessons:

The achievementsof Bank-financed waterprojects in many subsectors are often
constrainedby environmentalproblems thatpre-date project appraisal. InVietnam it i s
increasingly likely that projects that build water infrastructurewill be called on to
perform environmental restorationas well as their core activities, ifthey are to have
sustainable outcomes. The four projects studiedshare certain characteristics. First and
foremost is the nature o f their relationship to the environment. Whereas traditionally
Bankwater sector projects hadeither an institutionalor infrastructurefocus or both, it is
becoming nearly impossible to avoid addressing environmental restoration and
environmentally related landuse questions inmany areas o fthe country. InVietnam
(which i s not unique inthis respect) Bank-financed projects inmany sectors are
increasingly constrained by environmental problems that pre-date project appraisal. Inthe
four evaluated projects it was assumed that investments ininfrastructure would overcome
what were inessence environmental problems. The project experience of the IRP, WSP,
InlandWaterways, and CWP projects showsjust how difficult it has become, evenin
widely different subsectors focusing on highly divergent activities, to achieve anything
lasting without addressing the problems that have been caused by an extendedperiod o f
environmental neglect.

Environmental restoration is challenging because thepeople causingtheproblem have
to becomepart of the solution. Ifall the mangroves have beendestroyed it is never
enoughjust to plant new ones: reforestationand forest protectionhave to address the
underlyingsocial causes o f encroachment andprovidealternative sources o f income if
they hope to stop environmentally negative actions that produce income for the
malefactors. Conversely, addressing livelihood problems can have positive environmental
impacts.

Waitingto confront major issues on which theBank and borrower disagree until after
loan approvalcan lead to major delays,enormous costs, andforegone opportunities.
While there were other factors contributing to the early-stage delays identifiedinthis
report, resolving policy differences between Bank and Borrower before Board approval i s
perhaps the easiest to correct.

A common problem, associated with the design o fthe four water-related projects
evaluated inthis report, i s that important aspects o f each project were not ready to
implement after the loan was approved. Highlevel engagement i s needed to find a way to
move project preparationfwrther along and speed up implementation.

When the economicincentives shift, thepriorities of water serviceproviders willfollow
with negative effects on the environment. As users become accustomed to not paying
fees, service providers become accustomed to not thinking about them as clients.
Although the country was moving towards integrating user charges and fees to support
institutional and service sustainability, the recent suspension o f most user charges for the
use o f irrigation water and river transport, as well as the freezing o f urban water tariffs
are quite an about-face. Subsidized water for urbanusers further strains existing supply
andtreatment problems, andthe removal o f incentives to conserve water use inirrigated
areas has several pernicious results, including higher levels o f agricultural chemicals that
make their way to the rivers, which are tapped for drinking water, and so on.

Water resources are difficult to manage efficiently and effectively when there is no
mechanismfor involved agencies to communicate, much less coordinate. The four
projects point to a number o f challenges which Vietnam needs to overcome to progress
towards integrated water resources management. First, that key players have a long way
to go before they integrate. Agencies that should be talking to each other and planning
ways to maximize synergies are not yet at that point. Second, there i s still greater
emphasis and attention given to end o f pipe solutions that increase the available supply
than to managing the watershed inways that will makethe delivery o f water services
easier inthe next year and duringthose that follow. Water utilities are more concerned
with gettingpollutants out ofthe water they deliverthanthey are about stopping
polluters. And around the major cities new factories open at an alarming rate. Third, the
abolition o f economic incentives to conserve and make services economically sustainable
(use charges and tariffs inline with costs) poses risks for water quality and river health
going forward, and increases the likelihood that conflicts over access to water between
various user groups will increase; and this ina future where climate variation looks likely
to reduce supply.

1. Water inVietnam

         This Project Performance Assessment reviewsthe experience o f four projects: the
Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (IDA-27 1lo), the Water Supply Project (IF-N0260, TF-
1.1

29548, TF-29270, TF-20966), the InlandWaterways and Port RehabilitationProject
(IDA-30000), and the Coastal Wetlands Protection Project (IDA-3292). As a building
block o fthe forthcoming IEG study, The Effectiveness of Bank Supportfor Water, it also
reviewsthe way inwhich the Borrower andthe Bank have approached water-related
issues generally, how this approach has changed over time.

COMING TO TERMS         WITH CONSTRAINTS
1.2      Since 1990 Vietnam's economy has recorded an annual average GDP growth rate
o f nearly 7.5 percent,' but its remarkable economic achievements inthe period leading up
to the global downturn have placed heavy demands on the nation's fragile natural
resource base. As demands for water grow withinthe expanding industrial economy and
from the households o f the increasingly affluent and growing urban populations, the
protectiono f the quality o f water resources and the sustainable management o f water
generally have not beengiven adequate attention.

1.3      Rapid industrial and commercial development around major cities has ledto the
loss o f some natural drainage channels and floodplains. As has happened almost
everywhere else on the planet, one o f the first casualties o f development are swamps and
wetlands (the natural coastal protections from storms and floods; see the discussion inthe
2007 IEGpublication Development Actions and the Rising Incidence of Disasters).

1.4      There is general agreement that the challenges facing Vietnam's water sector
include:

         Increasing competition for unpolluted freshwater resources including
         groundwater;
         Increasing quantities o f effluent from industrial, municipal, and
         agriculturaljaquacultural sources (water pollution);
         Increasingly severe and frequent storms and floods affecting a growing population
         living inlow-lying and coastal zones;
         Risingcosts o f supplyingwater and sanitation. (So that tariffs do not exceed the
         ability o f users to pay for it, several city systems operate at a deficit.)
         Increasing saltwater intrusion, loss o f wetlands and their filtering capacity, and
         deforestation with concomitant siltation o f rivers and canals.

Box 1. Some Good News
The Governmenthas made substantialprogress inwater sector reforms since 1995.Specific reforms
include:

Passage of the Law on Water Resources in 1998.
Establishmentofthe Ministry ofNatural Resources and Environment (MONRE) in2002.
Establishmentofthe National Water ResourcesCouncil (NWRC) as the water sector apex body.
Adoption ofthe sustainability concept inthe following important documents:

         ---- Law
         - National    Strategy for Environmental Protection
              StrategicOrientation for Sustainable Development(Agenda 21)
             National Water ResourcesStrategy(NWRS)
                   on Environmental Protection
              Rural water supply and sanitation strategy (2005).


A task force reviewing water sector issues concludedthat these actions signal an important shift toward
recognition ofthe importanceofthe sustainability of the natural resourcebase to the Government'sefforts
to achieve sustainable socioeconomic development

1.5      The NationalWater Resources Strategy prioritizes "The protection, efficient
exploitation, and sustainabledevelopment of water resources on the basis of integrated
and unifiedwater resources management."*

ONCE AMPLEWATER RESOURCESARE STRESSED
1.6      Vietnam is richinwater resourcesand honeycombedwith rivers and canal^.^ Itis
one of the world's highest rainfallcountries, having a distinct rainy season, and four to
five months account for about 75-85 percent of the total rainfall. This variability causes
water shortages inthe dry season and flooding at other times. The country's water
resources are also not evenly distributed interms of where they fall. About 60 percent of
river water is concentratedinthe Mekong River and its vast delta.

1.7      The country has 13 river basinswith catchment areas over 10,000 km2,10 of
which are international. The out of border basin area i s over 3 times bigger than what is
in-country. The quality of water that flows through industrial zones and major cities
gradually deteriorates. Lakes and canals inand aroundurban areas gather sewage and
other effluents, which has a strongly detrimentalimpact on downstream surface water
and groundwater.

1.8     Vast highland forests have beenunsustainably exploited and have evenbecome
barreninplaces, and farmers cultivate steep and unprotectedterrain, leading to runoff
and erosion. Deforestation contributes to flooding (see Box 2) and siltation of waterway
transport corridors and coastal irrigation systems.

Box 2. Some Bad News: Flooding and Tropical Storms All Too Common
Vietnam is exceptionally disaster-proneinways that firther stress water resouces.The 2006 IEGnatural
disaster evaluation notedthat the country was fifth inthe world interms of GDP at risk from two or more
hazards. More than 80% of the population live at risk from water-relatednatural disasters. Inthe 10years
to 2006, natural disasters causednearly 5,000 deaths, and destroyedmore than 6,000 fishing boats, nearly
300,000 houses, 3.9 millionhectaresofpaddyrice, with the total cost of damage surpassing 50 billion
VND. Most impactsare inthe centralregion. While the Governmenthas agoodrecordofrespondingto
flooding and storm events and providing assistanceto stricken communities, it isjust beginning to become
less reactive, and to pursue environmentalrestorationmeasuresto mitigate the adverse impacts of water-
related disasters, inpart through the World Bank Natural DisasterRisk Managementproject.
Embankmentsand dikes provide but modest protection from typhoons and surge events, yet they require
considerable investmentintheir maintenance andrepair, especiallywhen they are not stabilizedby trees,
grasses, and plants capable ofholding the soil together and protecting it from the fillonslaughtof heavy
rains.Non-structural measuressuch as risk identification, community-baseddisaster managementand
preparednessgenerally can also help peopleto better cope with their currentrisk profile as well as prepare
them for what is to come with climate change.

Nevertheless,the approachto natural disasters has been largely reactive with insufficientattentiongiven to
the avoidanceof disasters or the inclusion indevelopmentplanning of measuresthat would preventnatural
phenomena from becomingdisasters. There has also beenlittle attention given to the role of affected
communities inthe planning, implementation and management of disasterrisk reduction measures.
Although the frequency and severity of natural disasters are increasingandthere is now a needto
incorporateclimate change implications such as sea levelrise, guidance for improvingdisaster risk
management at the national and provincial levels is provided by the new National Strategy for Natural
Disaster Prevention, Control and Mitigation until2020.

Bank Involvement: The Water Portfolio in Vietnam

1.9      Over the last ten years (since FY 1997), there have been 32 water-related
interventions approved or completed inVietnam and financed by the World Bank. These
programs, projects and grants represent a total o f US$2.74 billion (see Figure 1.l).4              As
happens with water projects everywhere, water-related efforts are often mainstreamed
into the work o f other sectors and sometimes implemented by staff without a traditional
water background, without any ill-effects on project outcomes. The Rural sector board
has implemented nine o f these operations, the most inthe portfolio. Water Supply and
Sanitation has six projects/grants, and the Energy andMiningsector has 5 projects
(mostly hydropower). The Environment, Urbanand Transport sectors each havetwo.
Three o fthe projects involve the Global Environmental Facility.




4 Almost US$2.38 billion were traditional Specific InvestmentLoans and Adaptable ProgramLoans and
US$350 millionwere for developmentpolicy andPRSC loans. Grants andtrust find monies totaljust over
$3 million.

 1.10    Likethe overall portfolio inVietnam which tendsto perform well, IEGratings
have been very good for water projects. Eightprojects have been completed and rated
and all have been rated Satisfactory inOutcome and Borrower Performance. All but one
had a Satisfactory rating for Bank Performance. Six o f them were rated as Likely to be
Sustainable andhad Substantial Institutional Development Impact. The two most recently
closed projects were evaluated for the new rating for Riskto Development Outcome, and
both were rated as Moderate. They are also rated as Likely to be Sustainable and have
Substantial Institutional Development Impact.

1.11    O f the eight Bank-financed interventions approved duringthe five-year period
between 1995 and 1999, there were two hydropower projects, and one loan each for
irrigation, water supply, urban sanitation, and transport. And there was one grant for the
environment.

1.12    The next five year period saw a shift: There was more attentionto the
environment-    two loans and two grants. There were quite a few multi-purpose projects,
which combined two or more water related activities - such as flood protection and water
infrastructure, or irrigation and water supply. And one development policy loan inthe
form o f a PRSC.

RECENT   WATER LENDING        INVIETNAM

1.13    The last three years have seena continued attentionto development policy
lendingand a slightreturnto sector-specific lending.O fthe ten interventions approved,
three are considered development policy lending, while two are classed as urban
sanitation and two are overall WS&S. There i s one environment project and a disaster
mitigationproject as well as one trust fund grant.

INTEGRATION OF THE BANKWATER PRACTICE AND RESOURCEMANAGEMENT                                        AT THE
 COUNTRYLEVEL
 1.14     Until2006, the Bank dealt withwater and sanitation issuesthrougha number of
unitsmappedto two networks(infrastructure andEnvironmentaland Socially Sustainable
Development, ESSD). The integration o f the Sustainable Development Network inFY07
introduced one Water Sector Board. Across the regions there i s substantial variation in
terms o f whether the various subsectors remain within differentunits within the
 Sustainable DevelopmentNetwork, or whether they have integrated.' Staff inthe
Vietnam field office admitted that they are only just beginningto sit downtogether and
that they rarely find the time to look more broadly at water resources management and
services.

 1.15     In1993 the Bank's Board ofExecutiveDirectors endorsed a Water Resources
Management Policy Paper. This paper reflected the broad global consensus that modern
water resources management shouldbe basedon the "Dublin Principles.'' The Bank's
2003 Water Resources Sector Strategy i s based on experience with implementing the
DublinPrinciples6. The two documents are closely related, with the latter supplementing
rather thansupplantingthe former. Ingeneral terms, the World Bank's water strategy
seeks to provide effective, tailored assistance to client countries to improve water
resources management and enhance water services, inorder to enhance growth and
reduce poverty. The strategy i s anchored inthe premisethat most developing countries
need to be active inboth management and development o f water resources infrastructure.

ANOVERVIEW OFTHEFOURPROJECTS COVERED BY THIS PPAR
 1.16     Well conceived water investments provide the basis for overall regional
development and associated economic opportunities for the poor. This report focuses on
the experience o f four very differentwater projectsto track the approaches usedby the
water sector and how they are evolving.




5 Over time, the move toward one water Sector Board is expected to ensure that social, economic,
environmental, and technical dimensions are taken into account inthe management and development o f
water resources and water services, and appropriate trade-offs made and mitigated.
6 The Bank has taken on three Dublinprinciples, dealing with gender differently than some other agencies:
(1) the ecological principle-that    water should be managed by various water-using sectors at the river basin
level; (2) the institutional principle-that water resources management i s best done when all stakeholders
participate at the lowest appropriate level, and that women need to be included; (3) the instrument
principle-that   water is scarce and that greater use needs to be made o f incentives and economic principles
inimprovingallocation and enhancing quality.

Box 3. The Government Water Sector Review Task Force
Water-relatedresponsibilitiesare found inmany Ministries and at nearlyall levels of government. In2005
the GoV decidedto conduct a comprehensivereview ofthe Water Sector, contributing$50,000 of its own
resourcesto the Review.The World Bankis contributingby conductingthe Irrigation andDrainage sub-
sector review, as an integralpart ofthe overallWater SectorReview.The process is stronglysupportedby
ADB with a grant of $3 10,000 and co-financingfromthe Netherlands ($160,000), Australia($60,000),
Denmark($50,000). Additionally, the CooperationFundfor the Water Sector is a major contributor
($200,000 from a hndadministeredfiom ADB headquarterswith contributionsmainly from the
NetherlandsandNorway). The Task Forceoperates underthe auspices ofthe NationalWater Resources
Council(NWRC) and it is supportedby representativesfrom key Ministries.



1.17     The IrrigationRehabilitationProjectwas the first Bank-assistedirrigation
project inmodern Vietnam.7 Irrigationwater inVietnam i s mostly surface water
provided by the Mekong and, to a muchlesser degree, 108 other "main" rivers.

1.18     The Water Supply Projectwas designedto dealwith the aging hydraulic
infrastructure found inmost cities. Creating conditions that would attract foreign direct
investment was a GoV priority, but water infrastructure constraints inurbanareas was a
negative inthe otherwise positive investment climate. Lack of safe water and upgraded
sanitation facilities were the major causes of Vietnam's higher incidence of water-borne
andhygiene-related diseases and childhood morbidity and mortality. Dating from around
the beginning of the 20th century, aging water and sewerage infrastructure hadnot been
adequatelymaintained.

1.19     The MekongDelta is the breadbasket ofthe country, andInlandWaterwaysand
PortImprovementProjectwas intendedto facilitate the low cost water transport of
goods and agricultural products towards the northand overseas, to export market.

1.20     Creating thousands of ponds infragile coastal areas to produce shrimp devastated
the mangrove forests along the coast and the shoreline's natural environment to a degree
that endangeredthe very activities that produced steadily rising incomes. The
impossibility of controlling shrimp disease close to the sea ledproducersto move shrimp
farming more inland, but it left an environmental wasteland behind.The Coastal
WetlandsProtectionProjectwas aimed at restoringandprotecting critical coastal
ecology, devastated originally by tropical storms andthe pursuitof quick gains from the
unsustainablefarming of shrimp. By doing this, it made a more sustainable approachto
shrimp farming possible further inland.

2. The Four Projects: Objectives and Components

THEIRRIGATIONREHABILITATION PROJECT
2.1     Lyingto the north o fVietnam's highly productive Mekong Delta is another
important agricultural area, the Central Coastal Plain (CCP). Inthe late 1980s and early
90s food production on this plain was severely constrained by lack o f water, and the
available rice was often insufficient to feed the local population. Poverty and malnutrition
were endemic.

2.2     After reviewing the situation inthe field, the appraisal team concluded that a
major rehabilitation was what was needed. Most of the irrigation systems serving this
plain date back to colonial times, and by the early 1990s, it was clear that most o f them
had deteriorated considerably. Most damage was due to inadequate maintenance and the
failure to make timely repairs, although severe weather events over the years hadtaken a
toll. Within each system most canals, earthworks, buildings were crumbling, and
pumpingand electrical equipment were inurgentneedo frepair or replacement. Many
existing canals were no longer a part o f an operable system-they had no water at all
flowing through them. Construction or repair o f sluices was indispensable for
maintaining the proper salinity, whether for shrimp production or rice cultivation.

2.3     The IrrigationRehabilitation project was focused on the restoration o f irrigation
schemes inthe CCP (and ina few cases their expansion). Specific problemsthe project
attempted to overcome included: irrigation canal siltation, insufficient pumpingcapacity;
frequent breakdowns o f pumps and lifts, an intermittent electric power supply; and major
losses o f canal water due to leakage and seepage. Farmers' cooperatives, the direct
beneficiaries, prepareirrigation schedules, runthe systems, and collect water fees and
agricultural taxes.

2.4     The provinces are responsible for the construction o fminor canals,' andthey are
also responsible for the O&M o f the main irrigation and drainage systems. For these
purposes they generally use the Provincial Water Resources Services (PWRS) and
Irrigation Management Companies (IMCs). Intense farmer participation inthe
construction, operation and maintenance of irrigation facilities i s the norm inVietnam,
and water users operate and maintain tertiary systems. Each irrigation scheme i s
comprisedo f one or more cooperatives, groupingfrom a few hundredto several thousand
hectares, organized around a branch o f the canal system. As part o f a broader increase in
private ownership individual land leaseshave beenintroduced, giving farmers more say
over cropping and marketing, but thereby weakening the cooperatives. They are
essentially reduced to the organization and supervision o f maintenance tasks at the
present.




8 Minor canals are defined as those serving less than 150 hectares.

Box 4. Objectives and Components
The developmentobjectivesofthe projectwere to increase agriculturalproduction(primarilyofrice for
food) andfarmer incomes, andto reduce poverty in selectedruralareas of Vietnam.
The projectconsistedof three components:
(1) Rehabilitation and completion of seven irrigation schemes (estimatedcost US$lOS. lmillion, actual
cost US$95.3 million). This component includedrehabilitation and completionof sevenirrigationschemes
comprising a gross areaof around 130,000 halocatedinthe south, central andnorthernregionsofVietnam.
The mainworks would be rehabilitation ofdiversionandhead-works,maincanals, structures andpumping
stations, andcompletingconstructionofmain, secondary andtertiary canals andon-farmworks.
(2) Institutional development (estimatedcost US$4.6 million, actualcost US$7.0 million). This
componentincludedinstitutional developmentthrough: (a) the transfer oftechnology for engineering
design, procurementand constructionof irrigationworks throughtechnicalassistanceandonthejob
training; (b) the improvementof operation andmaintenancepracticesandcost recovery mechanisms; (c)
the strengtheningof irrigationmanagementcompanies and farmer user groups throughtraining; and(d)
supportfor accountingandauditing; and
(3) Resettlement and rehabilitation (estimatedcost US$7.4 million, actual cost US$3.9 million).This
componentincludedresettlementandrehabilitation of families whose landand/or assets are acquiredby the
state for the project.

THEWATERSUPPLY PROJECT
2.5       When the Water Supply Project was approved inFY 97, about 20 percent o f
Vietnam's population was urban(about 15 million). In2005, over 22 million people lived
inurbanareasandofthese over 8.5 millionpeople didnot have accessto cleanwater. By
2010, it i s estimated that the urbanpopulation may be more than 30 million. The cities o f
Hanoi, Danang, Ho Chi MinhCity, and Haiphong are predominant, while the rest o f the
urbanpopulation is highly dispersed, scattered in500 other small cities andtowns. At the
outset o fthe WSP project, it was already quite clear that continuing rapid growth inthe
larger cities could easily overwhelm existing water supply and sanitation facilities, and
lead to social dissatisfaction at a level that could have a drastic impact on foreign
investmentand tourism.

2.6       Pipedwater was only available to about 50 percent o fthe urbanpopulation; and
people living inthe larger cities were better served than those inthe smaller towns. An
estimated 80 percent o f the water supplieddid not meet national water quality standards.
Distribution systemsleaked so muchthat service was available only at low pressure.
Sewers mixed sewage with rainwater, makingtreatment expensive.

2.7       The Government adopted a ten-year plan' that focused on three priority areas:
Hanoi-Haiphong-Quang Ninh;Ho ChiMinhCity-BienHoa-Vung Tau; and the Danang
area. The Planproposed decentralizingimplementationto local governments. Additional
priorities were: 1) usingthe development o f infrastructure to promote investment; 2)

improvemento fmanagement within state enterprises, and 3) where possible,
transforming state water enterprises into private companies.

2.8       Privatizing the firms would not be easy. State water enterprises had long provided
basic services free or nearly so to as many as possible. Billinghad long been neglected.
Physical water loss and non-collection o f user accounts yielded non-revenue water o f
over 50 percent insome WSCs.

2.9       Increased cost recovery was to take place through the more strict impositiono f
user charges and gradual elimination o f central government subsidies.

2.10      The IDA approach was based on the Country Assistance Strategy. Transitionto a
marketeconomy andreformo f State Enterprises were important goals. While the project
was originally conceived so as to include waste water components, inthe event the
project was focused entirely on water supply, and a sanitation project followed later.


Box 5. Objectives and Components
The Water Supply project's development objectives were as follows:
  0  To improve the quality of water supply services inHanoi, Haiphong, QuangNinhand Danangthrough
     renovationo f existing facilities in order to satisfy the demand of about 2.5 millionpeopleup to the year
     2000.
  0  To ensure sustainability ofthe physical investmentsby developingthe institutional capabilities ofthe
     Provincial Water Supply Companies(WSCs), facilitating their commercialization and upgradingtheir staff
     skillsthroughtraining.
     To assist inpreparationof a future investmentprogramto satisfy water demand after 2000.

Components identified at appraisalwere:
(1) Renewal and upgrading of water supply facilities (estimatedcost US$87.58 million, actual cost US73.16
million)." This componentincluded investmentsinraw water extraction; water treatment; primary, secondary
and tertiary distribution networks including bulk water meters; new and replacementwater connectionsincluding
consumer water meters; and equipment, materialsand vehicles for Operations and Maintenance(O&M).
(2) Institutional measures to ensure sustainability: (estimatedcost US$9.19 million, actual cost US2.67
million). This component included upgrading accounts receivablesystems; improvingcustomer management;
preparationof guidelines for O&M andrelatedbudgets; and development of corporate plans.
(3) Support activities including construction management, training and various studies:(estimatedcost
US$15.85 million, actual cost US9.25 million). This component included construction management; studies to
w e s s raw water quality andto identify actionsto protect water quality; identifying, quantifying, reducing and
monitoring, non-revenuewater; periodic dam safety audits; staff training; and studies for future investment
beyond2000.
:4) Compensating, resettling and rehabilitating people affected by the project: (estimated cost U W . 2
nillion, actual cost US3.82 million). This component included acquisition of land andrelocation of affected
iouseholds,

THEINLAND WATERWAYS AND PORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
2.11       Vietnam has approximately 41,000 kmof inlandwaterways extending to almost
all populated areas and four international seaports." Before the project, waterway
capacity had declined due to the silting of channels, largely a function of watershed-wide
deforestation andinadequatebank stabilization. As the higher elevations beganto lose
their forest cover, they were poorly protected from heavy rains. Floods are common in
the wet season, but as water levels drop inthe dry season, they can fall below sea level,
impeding navigation and leading sea water to intrude farther than normal into rivers and
man-made water courses.

2.12       Waterway safety was compromised by inadequatenavigation aids, sharpbends,
shipwrecks, and other obstacles. Only about a fourth of waterways were capable of
supporting transport through prolonged periods of no rainfall. And only one tenth was
deep enoughto allow passage of large commercial vessels. The dredging backlog was
estimatedat 25 million cubic meters.

2.13       The InlandWaterways and Port Rehabilitation Project was designedto overcome
these problems by widening and deepeningthe Mekong Delta routes; replacing and or
improving bridges; treating canal-side slopes, constructing landings, and upgrading
navigation aids. Excavating and dredging sections of two mainwaterways southof Ho
Chi MinhCity was expectedto provide increasedvessel haulage capacity. Improvements
to Can Tho Port were expectedto provide for better cargo handling, cargo storage, and
treatment/disposal of ship wastes.



Box 6. Objectives and Components
The project's overarching developmentobjective was to enhancethe capacity, efficiency and safety of
inland waterway transport inthe Mekong Delta. Its specific objectiveswere to:

  0  Enhancethe safety and traffic carrying capacityofthe two main inland waterway routes connectingthe
     Mekong Delta with Ho Chi MinhCity (HCMC);

  0  Rehabilitateand improve the Port of Can Tho to improve the efficiency of cargo transshipmentand
     distribution; and

     Improve the institutions involved so they can better plan, administer, operate and maintain the inland
     waterway system inthe Mekong Delta.

The project comprisedofthree components.

(1) Waterway Improvements (estimatedcost US$56.3 million, actualcost US$57.1 million).
This component includedthe improvementsofthe two main inland waterway routes (Ho Chi MinhCity to
KienLuong and Cho Lachto Ca Mau) totaling 546 km.

(2) Can Tho Port Improvements (estimatedcost US$l.6 million, actual cost US$] .6 million).
Improvementso f Can Tho Portthrough: (i)      replacing fenders alongthe berth of 144 meters; (ii) providing
facilities for the collection of vesselbilge water and chemical spills; (iii)supplying cargo handling
eouinment (one 40-ton mobile crane. one 40-foot self loadindunloadinsztrailer and a mime mover/tractor)

to improvecargo flows andreducewaitingtime; and (iv) providingtechnical assistance and stafftraining
to Can Tho PortEnterpriseto strengthenportmanagement in marketing, financialmanagement, and
businessdevelopment.

(3) Institution Building (estimatedcost US$10.7million, actual cost US$19.7million).
Followingthe mid-termreview,the scope ofthe projectwas extendedto include:sections ofthe waterways
from CaMauto NamCanand from KienLuongto Ha Tien(a total of 97 km), a feeder sectionofthe canal
from GanhHao to GiaRai(40 km), six additionallandingstages, further upgrading of Can Tho Port
consisting ofaperimeterroadand apavedcontainerlopencargo storage yard, and supplementaryinstitution
building activitiesthat includedtechnical standards for inlandwaterways, ariver management information
system(MIS), improvingnavigationonthe Bassac river and simulators for training.

THECOASTALWETLANDSPROTECTIONPROJECT
2.14     Mangrove forests provide a variety o f economic and environmental benefits, even
when they are simply left alone. Mangroves support fisheries by providingbreeding,
feeding, and nursery grounds for commercially important fish and shellfish, and they
lessen the impact o ftoxic substances on water and soil by serving as natural filters.
Equally important, mangrove forests serve as buffer zones that protect against
typhoodflood damages and limit salinity intrusion. Mangrove belts help to preventsea
dike breaching and coastal abrasion-as          much as 25 meters of shore get washed away by
storms and tides every year along some 20 percent o f Vietnam's coastline. But they are
rarely left unmolested: to people living near them they are a source o f low (or no) cost
wood products, food, and even roofing thatch and traditional medicines. So, in spite o f all
their contributions, coastal inhabitants' cavalier disregardo fthe needto preserve them
along the seaside had ledto their widespread eradication inmany areas.

2.15     The project was designed to preserve and restore wetlandecosystems. Lessons
learned from experience with natural resource management projects inthe Southeast Asia
Regionhighlightedthe needto implement forest protectionwhile addressing the
underlying social causes of encroachment. Inthis case, it was understood that a lack o f
income-producing opportunities had led to the over-exploitation o f forest resources, and
thus the project would have to help the poorer families to become more economically
self-sufficient. Restoring the environment would contribute to this process: better
protectedareas would inevitably increase coastal and marine productivity, the latter
especially inareas close to the shore where the smaller boats usedby the poor could
safely go.

2.16     The project was designed to balance environmental protectionwith the livelihood
needs o fpeople dependent on natural resources. Improving the income status of the
adjoining communities, (particularly the more vulnerable poor) was seento require a
combination o f extension, credit and social support. This inturn would be tied to
contractual measures that created the incentives necessary to assure that environmental
protectionwould take place. Implementationwas decentralized to the provincial level,
butthe seven components identified duringproject designprovedto betoo complex

                                                     13


institutionallyfor provinceswith weak absorptivecapacity, andthey were ultimately
allowedto pick and chooseto some degree.

Box 7. Objectives and Components
The objective ofthe project,which coversthe SouthernMekongDeltaprovinces of Ca Mau,Bac Lieu, SOC
Trang and Tra Vinh, is to reestablishthe coastal mangrovewetland ecosystems and protect sustainably
their aquatic nurturingand coastalprotectionfunctions. Progresstowards this objectivewas to be measured
and monitoredbasedon:
     minimizationof landlosses to and maximizationof landgains from the sea throughreducederosion
     and increasedaccretion,
     decline inthe barrenareas inthe full protectionzone (FPZ), and
     increasedcoastaland near-shoremarine productivity.

A formal restructuringofthe project, with amendments to the DevelopmentCreditAgreement, was
approvedby the IDA BoardonNovember 23,2004 on a "no-objection" basis.It did not change the nature
ofthe components. The total financingofthe Project was reducedfrom US$65.6 million equivalentto
USS55.4 millionequivalent. It was determinedthat mangrovereforestationwas no longer feasible inmany
areas becausedramatic increases in land values had occurred, increasingthe riskthat poor households
would become increasingly marginalized. The Project was refocusedon povertyreductionby prioritizing
assistanceto the pooresthouseholds.Approximately US$6.0 million were reallocatedto the Vietnam Bank
for Agricultureand RuralDevelopment(VBARD) so that it couldprovide loansto support smallholders in
the projectarea. Specific reforestationtargets were eliminatedalthoughthe activity continued.l2

(1) Mangrove Planting, Rehabilitationand Protection (estimatedcost US$13.9 million, actual cost
US$3.8 million). This component consistedof three sub-components: (a) reforestationinthe FPZ andthe
buffer zone (BZ); (b) protectionof newly-plantedand existingforests inthe FPZ; and (c) protectionand
management ofpriority key protectedareas inthe FPZ, includingtwo nature reserves(Dat Muiand Ong
TrangNature Reserves) and one fish sanctuary (Bai Boi Fish Sanctuary), which were subsequently merged
into the MuiCa MauNationalPark.
(2) Technology Development and Transfer in the BZ (estimated cost US$15.9 million, actual cost
US$14.5 million). This component hadtwo sub-components:(a) implementationof the technology
developmentandtransfer (TDT) program; and (b) the provisionof creditto localfarmers through VBARD.
(3) Social support program (SSP) for vulnerable communes and commune villages receiving re-
settlers including ethnic minorities (estimated cost US$10.2 million, actualcost US$6.5 million). This

                                               the
 Khmer minority (above 20 percent), to provide them with additional support to meet their specialneeds
 through the preparationand implementationof EMDPs.
 (4) Policy and institutional development (estimatedcost US$2.1 million, actual cost US$1.4 million).
 This componentsupportedactivities for: (a) carrying out land and water use zoning; (b) improving the
 security and allocation of long-term land-userights to farmers inthe BZ; and (c) restructuring selected
 SFEs.
 (5) Resettlement of FPZ occupants(estimatedcost US$16.2million, actual cost US$17.5 million). The
 component was designedto supportthe relocation ofthe FPZ occupants into the BZ with safer living places
 (Le., not directly exposed to sea surges or risingsea levels, strongwinds and typhoons) and better living
 conditions (Le., with improved access to basic infrastructure such as schools, health care, drinking water
 and transport).
(6) Project monitoring and evaluation (estimatedcost US$2.3 million, actualcost US0.8 million). This
component consistedof five groups of activities: (a) water quality monitoring; (b) aquaticproductivity
monitoring; (c) coastalareas and landuse monitoring; (d) biodiversity monitoring; and (e) socioeconomic
monitoring.

(7) Project coordination and management (estimatedcost US$13.9 million, actual cost US$3.8 million).
This componentprovided the necessary resources, including the required technical assistance, for effective
project coordination and managementat all levels.

3. Project Experience andAchievement of Objectives

THEIRRIGATION          REHABILITATIONPROJECT
3.1       Theproject took place at a time whenthe economy was fully engaged ina process
o f liberalization, and it rehabilitatedirrigation infrastructurejust as the market economy
and the private sector were coming into their own.l3 The freeing-up o f agricultural
commodity prices inthe 1990s made rice a profitable crop indeed for farmers inthe
Central Coastal Plain. Increases inrice production due to a reliable supply o f agricultural
water contributed to improved farm incomes andreduced Vietnam's rural poverty.
Vietnamwent from a food deficit country to the world's secondlargest rice exporter. The
total irrigated area increased from 67,000 hectares to 133,889 hectares; total rice
production rose from 518,000 tons to 926,000 tons with average rice yields going from
3.0 to 4.8 tons per hectare.

3.2       The Central Project Office was incharge of coordinating implementation, which
meant that it had to oversee a number o f subprojects scattered over a wide and difficult to
access area, which proved to be challenging. Floods and typhoons in 1998 and 1999 in
Central Vietnam and in2000 inthe Mekong Region also slowed the speed o f

months later than expected.l4       The various holdups also made time which some systems
usedto expandthe coverage providedbythe canals. By credit closing, 12provinces had
been served, compared to the seven originally envisaged. Despite an expansion o f the
project's scope, the actual costs o f civil works and goods were only 75 percent o f the
original estimate (owing to a more favorable exchange rate and the introduction o f
competitive bidding). The ICR reportedthat:

     1. the overall ERRwas 19 percent (compared to the 17percent forecast at appraisal).
     2. 25 district-level agricultural extension centers had beenconstructed and staff had
         been extensively trained, which led to the delivery o f effective extension services
         to farmers.
     3. an Environmental Action Planwas satisfactorily complied with.
     4. the Resettlement Action Plan, the first ever executed by the Ministryo f
         Agriculture, was successfully implemented-22,104                families were ultimately
         served, compared with the 8,451 projected at appraisal.
     5. the project helpedthree o fthe largest SOEs belongingto the Ministry o f Water
         Resources to privatize, and used them effectively for the construction of dams,
         canals and hydraulic structures.

3.3      The IEGmission made field visits to an irrigation system located onthe periphery
o f Ho Chi MinhCity.l5All aspects o fthe operating irrigation system were inspected
includingbridges, locks, sluice gates andstate andprivate farms. The system is ingood
operating condition and, more importantly, unquestionably delivering water that permits
the production ofhighvalue crops such as soy beans that farmers were often afraid to
plantbefore. Duringthe project (from 1995 to 2003) corn yields increased from 1.2 to 3.6
tons per hectare, and peanut yields have increased from 1.3 to 2.5 tons per hectare inthe
project area.16Animal husbandry i s takingplace inways not previously possible because
o f intermittent access to water. Not only were pigs, chickens, and cattle to be seen, but
even alligators and bats were being raised (the former for meat and leather, the latter
becausethey produce an excellent fertilizer). Small but valuable increases infruit
production have taken place that were not anticipated, the mission observed pineapples,
pomelos (a citrus fruit), and papayas.

3.4      The entity responsible for continuing operation of the system, the provincial
Irrigation Management Company, i s clearly more focused on the industrial consumers of
the system's water than on farmers, however. The growth o f the economy generally, and
Ho Chi MinhCity specifically, has ledto rapid urbanization and sprawl. Many industries


14 The financial and organizational arrangements for project management were betweenthe centralproject
office and severalother MARD departments which resulted at times indelays inproject decisionmaking,
and it contributed to the implementation delays. The East Asia financial crisis between 1997 and 1999
reducedthe availability of counterpart funding-an  additional contributor to delays. Since actual subproject
costs were much lower thananticipated, savings were reallocatedto an expanded scope ofwork in 1998.
The hnds were ultimately usedto repair flood damage, andto finance complementaryworks associated
with the original subprojectsor flood-damagedstructures.
15 For comparisonpurposes, and to see how the approachhad evolved over time, another system
constructedby the follow-on project was visited inthe Bac Lieuprovince.

requiringuninterruptedaccessto water have chosen to move into (formerly) rural areas
served by the irrigation project, and these industries pay fees, at a much higher rate than
farmers were charged, that essentially underwritethe activities o f the IMC. This i s true to
the degree that income from the sale o fwater for agricultural purposes i s more o f an
afterthought than raison d'btre for Company staff, more so now when there are no longer
such charges, o f course (see Box 8). While there are areas where industrial use i s not the
predominant purpose o f water suppliedby the Irrigation Rehabilitationproject
infrastructure, the abolition of water tariffs for most agricultural users o f water has made
the sustainability o f systems significantly more precarious and managers jobs that much
more difficult.

Box 8. The Abolition of Irrigation Tariffs
Prior to 2008, farmers were not charged for the volume o f water they use because there was no
infrastructure to monitor the volume o f water usage by such a large number o f small-holders. They were
charged a fixed fee based on the area o ftheir irrigated crop land. InNovember 2007, the Government
issueda Decree on irrigation fees that stipulated that from 2008 on, farmers will be exempt from the
irrigation fee. The decree cuts one o f farmers' biggest expenses. Afterjoining the WTO, irrigation fee
exemption became a vital component o fthe Government's assistance policy for farmers. An annual
exemption o f VND1,OOO billion (US$625 million) is expected. However, this exemption has raised a
number o f concerns: that it may lead to water shortages, efficiency o f water usage will drop, effectiveness
o f irrigation companies will be compromised, and water transferred to other usages by irrigation
companies, etc. "At present, there are 121 companies engaged in irrigation. As the irrigation companies are
public entities, the revenue shortfalls have generally required government subsidies. The size o f these
subsidies has increased inrecent years. Over time, the monopoly position o f these companies and
expectations o f government assistance have contributed to a culture o f poor cost management: insufficient
competition and accountability have contributed to operational inefficiencies that affect water management.
A firther consequence is that irrigation companies do not retain sufficient revenue to cover their
requirements for infrastructure maintenance and development. This has led to a decline inthe physical
assets used for water distribution (e.g. canals, off -take gates). Inadequate maintenance reduces the
reliability o f the irrigation system and contributes to operational inefficiencies that affect water
management."

3.5       Achievements interms o f the rehabilitationo f irrigation schemes (US$l08. 1
million appraised, US$95.3 million actual) covered 99.8 percent o f what was planned, as
well as additional repairs and improvementsrelatedto the flooding.

3.6       Institutional Development (US$4.6 million appraisal; US$7 million actual)
activities had significant achievements. Financial management and maintenance plans for
the IMCs were prepared for the first time, and basic equipment was purchased. A project
management information system proved capable of tracking project transactions for
accounting and auditing purposes. Among the ID achievements:

          furnishings for the extension centers were provided
          550 participants completed irrigation-related training courses
          a total o f 10 overseas training programs were organized

                                                17


        training o f extension agents and farmers took place in25 districts
        dam safety inspections were carried out, and additional dam safety features were
        incorporated including (typically): installation o f additional spillways and
        spillway gate-hoists complete with fail-safe emergency actuators

3.7     The IRP dates from 1995 and, as often happened back then, an effective
performance monitoring and evaluation systemwas not developed. One problem was that
the contract for international consultants was signedmuch later than planned. This
delayed the preparation o f O&M plans, financial management support including the MIS
system, environmental monitoring, biddingdocuments and bid evaluationprocedures,
andmay have contributedto anM&Esystem not being developed. Environmental
monitoring o f compliance with the action planwas undertaken, and no detrimental
physical, chemical or socioeconomic impacts were reported. The resettlement component
(US$7.4 million appraised; US$3.9 million actual) supported 312project-affected
households that were relocated (175% of the SAR estimate), as well as 22,104 project-
affected households. The latter receivedcompensation for loss o f land (both permanent
loss and temporary loss o f use).

WATERSUPPLY PROJECT
3.8     Ina sense, the WSP grew out ofseveral Government-prepared strate ic
documents that were put together inthe early 1990's with donor assistance.''These
documents stressedthe importance o f upgrading existing water supply systems over the
coming decade. A second strategic priority at the time was to strengthen the management
capacity o f the urban Water Supply Companies (WSCs) so that they would be able to
steadily increase water delivery capacity ina financially sustainable manner.

3.9     Startingout as subsidized entities at the beginningo fthe project, all three WSCs
were able to cover their operations and maintenance (O&M) costs and make payments on
the Bank loan," accordingto the ICR. And Hanoi and Haiphong WSCs built up
substantial financial reserves.

3.10    Following loan closing the Hanoi WSC mergedwith another WSC and began to
experience revenue shortfalls andwater quality problems while Haiphong went from
success to success. In2006, the government decided to impose price controls on urban
water, which, as will be seen, had a bigger impact on the utilities that had beenlagging
behind.

3.11   Duringthe preparation of this PPAR, field visits were undertaken to selected
Water Supply project sites. These includedvisits to the offices o f the Haiphong and
Hanoi Water Supply Companies, with side trips to the Nam Duand Haiphong water
treatment plants (plants serving Hanoi and Haiphongrespectively), and network
expansions under construction. Inaddition visits were made to the ongoing Kien An


17 (1991) TheSocio-Economic Stabilization andDevelopment Strategy to the Year 2000. There was also a
UNDP/WorldBank Water Supply and SanitationSector Study (1990) and aFinnish-fundedNationalUrban
Water Supply Strategy (1994).
18 The Bank Creditwas on-lent by Governmentto the WSCs at commercial terms.

water supply project to discuss the achievements o f the closed projects inlight o f current
practice. The WSCs kindly provided updated data (on what has happened since project
closing andthe ICR mission). Unless otherwise stated, this is the source o f information
used inthis section.

3.12     Although one objective was to improve the quality o f water services infour cities
through renovation o f existing services, the city o f Danang did not, inthe end, participate
inthe project. The Danangsub-project was cancelled prior to any expenditure on actual
infrastructure due to misprocurement.l9 The estimated cost o f the project at appraisal was
US$142.6 million. The actual cost o fthe project (inthe three remaining cities) was
US$88.9 million. The closing date was extended by two years resultinginan overall
project period o f seven years. Not taking Danang into account, targets and performance                    r-
indicators for each participating city were exceeded.                                                     ,

3.13     Connections: The primary way inwhich the quality o f water service was
improved by the project was by connecting more households. Anecdotally, residents in
the three cities also benefitedfrom ahigher level o fwater treatment, generally increased
pressure and 24 hour water supply service, although quantitative data was not made
available on these parameters.

3.14     The total number of connections for all three cities more thandoubled since
initiation o fthe project, from 275,000 to 630,000 (see Figure 2). Quang Ninhquadrupled
its connections from 24,000 in 1999 to 100,000 in2007. Since before appraisal, Hanoi
has had a problem with the presence o f ammonia inthe groundwater it taps for system
use from a series o f wells near the Red River (a contaminant presumably due to some
amount o f untreated wastewater reachingthe aquifer).20 The solution was to install
special ammonia removing units at the treatment plant.Under the project, equipment with
a cost o f $2.4 million hadbeeninstalled inthe water plantto remove this contaminant
from the water. International consultants had supported its early use. Duringthe field
visits, however, the mission notedthat the facility has not been usedinquite a while. It
had been completely dry for months, and significant quantities o f airborne dust had
settled on the treatment media. Staff declined to provide the date that it went out o f
service, but agreed that the equipmenthad beendecommissioned for a while, stating that
it hadbeendisabled for maintenance; butthey admittedthat the chemicals that were
required for its use were expensive for the utility at the current tariff levels.




19Danangcity insistedon using its own procurementproceduresrather than following Bank guidelines. Of
the original Creditof SDR 71.3 million, SDR 24.5 millionwas cancelled due to the misprocurement, and a
firther SDR2.25 million was cancelledat project completion.
20 "Ground water in some regions has beencontaminatedby Ammonia andNitrogen, especially inHanoi
region.The researchshowedthat: Insouth of Hanoiand Gia Lam district, the concentrationof Ammonia is
higher than standardfor domestic use. The result of sample analysis o f some operatingwells showedthat
the concentrationof Ammonia is increasingwith time. Currently, there is no conclusion for the preseason
o f Ammonia contamination. However, the researchshow that, the south of Hanoi is the wastewater storage

3.15      WaterSold: A second objective was to ensure the sustainability o f the physical
investmentsby developingthe WSCs' institutional capabilities and staff skills, and
facilitating commercialization. Since project initiation, the volume of water sold
increased dramatically inQuang Ninhand Hanoi, but evened out at close to 30 million
m3/yearinHai Phong, where coverage has beenat the 100percent level for some time
(see Figure 3).

3.16      Nun-Revenue Water:The amount of non-revenue water suppliedhas gone down
inall three cities inthe course ofthe project and since project closing (see Figure4). The
most dramatic decline occurred inHaiphong which went from fifty percent to twenty
percent.

3.17      Water Tariffs:Duringnegotiations, local governments gave up-front
commitments to raise tariffs annually to specific levels determined at appraisal. The
WSCs didnot actually meet these targets, but for as long as they were allowed to, they
did raise tariffs to levels that permit them to cover operating costs and debt service. Tariff
increases intendedto keep revenues inline with rising costs to protect the financial
sustainability o f WSCs didnot take place as anticipated because, following a period o f
inflation, the government froze the water tariff at their 2006 levels as a safety net
measure. Figure 5 below shows how residential water tariffs went up followingproject
closing but soon after were frozen by the government.

3.18    The following innovations to help the WSCs to function on a more commercial
basis were introduced during the project: computerizedbilling and collection systems,
customer management systems, a GIS water management and monitoring system, O&M
manuals, and standardized budgetingprocedures. The customer network management
systems inHaiphong and Hanoi, the largest companies can integrate customer and GIS
data to identify the abnormal consumptionpatterns associated with leakage or meter
tampering. Duringvisits to the Haiphong WSC, the mission spent time with the staff
responsible for these various systems and it could be perceived that they were highly
motivated and competent. Inexercises observed by the mission it was clear that they have
been well trained and are capable o f responding to all eventualities. They can even
pinpoint the causes o f highly unusual system malfunctions. Reportedly, staff skills were
initially improved through training, and further-upgraded by project-financed study tours
to other utilities abroad.

3.19    A third objective was to assist preparation o f a future water investment plan. Only
Haiphongprepared an investmentplan, however. The other two cities opted to use the
intendedfunds for institutional development instead. Eachcompany was also assistedto
plan for and prepare annual performance agreements by using a corporate planning
system as a basis for agreements with city authorities. The system that was produced
under the project i s based on detailed operation and maintenance manuals with costing
procedures for preparing annual budgets.The studies on raw water quality and source
protection inHaiphong ledto the establishment o fprotection zones around the river
intakes to minimize the risk o f contamination, and contingency plans were developed to
deal with accidental spillages o f hazardous materials. Hanoi developed a computerized
model o f water quality inthe aquifer and monitored ground levels to detect signs o f over-
exploitation o f the aquifer.

                                                       22


3.20       The mission did not visit QuangNinh.Reforestationwas also actively promoted
there to protect water quality. Reportedly, the authorities were forced to take measuresto
reduce pollution stemmingfrom mine tailings, and they ultimately acted to stop illegal
mining inthe Cao Van reservoir catchment. The Cao Van Dam was subject to dam safety
related modifications, including the wideningo fthe spillway, thereby preventing
catastrophic failure.

3.21       The WSP requiredresettlement of 130 households, and the ICR states that
appropriate compensation was provided. Many informants stated that Bankprocedures
had greatly improved the way resettled families were now treated.

Box 9. Recent Modificationsto Practice in WSS Work in Vietnam
The Urban Water Supply DevelopmentProject, the second IDA-supported water supply project in
Vietnam, adopted a more demand-responsive approach. Potential consumers inthe smaller cities where it
usually works are informed in advance ofthe likely monthly bill they would have to pay when they are
connectedto the system. Sub-projectsproceedonly ifover 60% ofhouseholdssign awritten commitment
to connect to the system at the projectedtariff level and even then, only ifthe local government approves
the tarifflevel required. This seems agood approachwhere the existing coverage is limited, but it would be
of little use where coverage levels are alreadyhigh and consumers havebecomeusedto subsidizedprices.

In2001, the Bank andthe Vietnam Water and SanitationAssociation carriedout abenchmarkingexercise
of all (68) ofVietnam's WSCs. Encouraginga subsector-wide commitment to the generationand
transparent sharingofkey statistics helps water supply companies to understandhow they compare with
other similar organizationsand highlight the best places to go for field visits, advice, and consultants
familiar with national conditions. Furthermore, this exerciserevealedthe strengths and weaknesses ofthe
sector and resultedinpositive exchanges of knowledge amongst the companies. Many companies have, or
are inthe process of, replicating the initiatives and innovations introducedthrough the project by Haiphong
wsc.

3.22      Staffing: Staffing became much more efficient, compared to the 1995 baseline
before the project began(see Table 2). InQuang Ninhthe number o f staff per 1000
connections went from 35 to 8.4 - more than a fourth less. InHanoi and Hai Phong, the
numberis less than halfwhat it was beforethe project.

meeting the increased demand, however, has been quite different (see Table 3). Hai
Phong has maintainedthe 100percent coverage it achieved inthe course o f the project.
Hanoi however has not been able to keep up with its population growth and has kept
close to coverage levels it had before the project. This i s due inpart to the enlargement o f
Hanoi city, and the merging o f Hanoi Water with another company that had historically
provided quite low coverage levels. Quang Ninhhas more than kept up with its doubled
population and gone from 16percent coverage to 57 percent (see Figures 6).

3.25     Commercialization o f water was intendedto support the goal o fpoverty
alleviation by redirecting existing subsidiesto activities with higher social returns. Just as
the mission found inthe irrigation sector, with the abolition o f most charges for the
agricultural use o f water for irrigation, the GoV's decisionto freeze water tariffs for the
major WSCs i s a definite complicating factor, the full impact o f which will be a function
o fthe lengtho f time it i s left inplace. It i s true that the tariff freeze has little effect on the
Haiphong WSC: water quality remains high, the utility i s making a profit, helped
immeasurably by hugereductions innon-revenue water. Infact, as intended during

diligence for an IPO.

INLAND    WATERWAYS
3.26     The PPAR mission (accompanied by officials from the Ministry o f Transport,
Waterways Department) traveled by boat from Ho Chi MinhCity to the port o f Can Tho,
ajourney o f about 100 kilometers through the Mekong Delta. Duringthe trip the mission
could confirm that ship traffic was heavy. Inplaces congestion caused the mission's boat
to wait for a lull intraffic before proceeding. The most recent statistics bear out this
observation. In 1995,23.5 million tons o f cargo was carried through the inland waterway.
By 2004, the last year for which data could be found, 55 million tons o f cargo was
transported through the waterways. Duringthe five-year eriod between 2000 and 2004,
the annual average increase incargo exceeded 8 percent.        E

3.27     As the voyage unfolded it became clear that the project accomplished what it
intendedto do. It: (a) eliminatedthe dredgingbacklog; (b) prepared mainroutes for the
routine use o f large vessels and barges, (c) it financed canal widening, ensured that the
required water depth was present throughout, (d) where necessary it increased overhead
clearances, and (e) it eliminated sharp bends inthe waterway. On-ground towers and
beacons were installed as aids to navigation. It was reportedthat the installation o f the
floating and on-land navigation aids has helpedthe canals to be safer for 24 hour
operation.22Waterway operations have also benefitedfrom better enforcement o f rules.
Equipmentand vessels o fthe typespurchased underthe project were observed at work:
buoy-laying craft could be seen servicing navigation aids and police boats were observed
inaction.

3.28     A recent government decree eliminated fees for the thousands o f shipsusingthe
inland waterways. Staff from the Waterways Department interviewednoted that fees had
been small and tedious to collect. And they said that their agency receives the same
amount as before for their work, only now it i s entirely from the national budget. The
governing legal document for the inland waterway sector i s the Vietnam Inland
Waterway Law. According to a report prepared for the Water Sector Review, this Law
has not developed sufficiently to deal with environmental issues. It established a range o f
fees for captains licenses and certainpermits, but it did not specify the amount for the
"channel fee" which was intendedto cover the cost o f regular maintenance by charging
thistoll. That the amount was not regulatedinany legal documents, is a situationtermed
inthe report as "not rea~onable."~~

3.29     The project experienced delays attributable to landacquisition: the numberof
households that requiredresettlement was 7,215 (compared to 5,000 estimated at
appraisal). Having a larger than anticipated number o f families to resettle slowed the
implementation process.24No plans hadbeen made about what to do with the spoil
(dredgedmaterial) or where to deposit it. Identificationof a disposal site had been
postponed until implementation, and figuring out what to do with countless tons of mud25
took time; albeit an unforeseen partial solution proved to be a widwin: Inmany small
towns the spoil was used by local landowners to raise their holdings above the flood
water level, thus reducing damage due to floods and enhancing building and property
values. Delays inthe implementation o f the project were caused by two other issues: 1)
the failure o fthe government andthe Bank to reach agreement on the eligibility o f state
owned enterprises to participate incivil works contracts; and 2) a larger number o f people
needingresettlement than anticipated as well as the failure to identify a mechanism for
assessingand paying compensation prior to project start-up. Bothof these topics are
covered inadequate detail inthe ICR and, since the mission found no new information on
these topics, this history will not be repeated inthis report.

3.30     Because one o fthe main concerns related to the dredging was its potential impact
on fisheries and agriculture, duringimplementation the environmental management
requirementsfor dredgingwork were integrated into the contracts as apart oftechnical
specifications.26 The PPAR mission did not detect and it was not made aware o f any
environmental problems stemmingfrom the dredgingprocess.27Regarding cargo
movements on the waterways, a key performance indicator, sampling at three sites at
project closing showed increases intraffic ranging from 48-237 percent.28

3.3 1    The ICRnotedthat: "The operational phase o fthe waterways andthe Thoi Binh
Lock will cause increased erosion and the collapse of canal banks.. ." The mission could
not helpbut note that this is, infact, what has happened on a massive scale. The increase
intraffic, andespecially the useofthe waterways byhighspeedwater transport,29has
had a deleterious impact on canal embankments-the                 bulko fwhich were either severely


24 The ICR states that all resettledfamilieswere compensatedinaccordancewith Bank guidelines.
25 The total amount of spoilthat neededto be removedby dredging was estimatedat about 12 million
cubic metersinthe SAR. This amount was a multiple ofthe annualmaintenance dredging requirement
(estimatedto be 1.5 million cubic meters), and it is largely due to the drainage backlog.Dredgingactivities
were overseenby three entities: (a) Vietnam Waterway ConstructionCorporation, a state-ownedcompany;
(b) DredgingCompanyNo. 1and DRECONTunderthe Ministry of Water Resources; and (c)
VIETDREDGE, ajoint venture betweenVietnamesedredgingcompanies andthe Netherlands Portand
DeltaConsortium.
26 The ICRnotesthat due to the mitigationmeasures employed, adverse impactsfrom dredgingwere lower
than expected.
27 Only catastrophic impacts would have been detectable so many years after civil works were completed.
28 The volume of shipping and cargo carried on the waterways was obtainedthrough a physicalcount of
vessels at nominatedspots over a periodof a few days while the volume of cargo is determinedby the
vesseloperators' declarations.
29 Hydrofoil and other high speed passenger vessels have recentlybeenprohibitedfrom usingthe
waterways for regularly scheduledruns inorder to stop bank erosion. This missioncouldnot ascertain
when the ruling went into effect or how longit will last, butthere are still quite a few such craft at wharfs
or at anchor.

                                                      27


eroded or collapsed. Insome instances as much as 10-20 meters o f land have been lost to
the canal. Very little bank stabilization was carried out under the project, and the
stabilized areas we examined carefully were quite poorly done, essentiallyjust covered in
small stones heldinplace by sheets o f tom and rusted chicken wire.30Although the
mission asked to see the landing sites constructed under the project, and we were assured
that we would visit some, inspite o f repeated promptings duringthejourney none were
ever identified. It can be safely assumed that they were a casualty o f bank instability. A
number o f towns have invested their own resources inbank stabilization, mostly using
steel reinforced concrete, but again, these stretches o f the canal are highly notable
exceptions.

3.32     Siltation causedby bank collapse and deforestation i s clearly reducing the time
before maintenance dredging i s again necessary, although, according to some informants,
insome areas sandminingbyprivate contractors provides a costless solution. The areas
where the river bottom i s sandy enough for commercial use are limited, however, and
becauseminers are a hazard to navigationthe places they are allowed to work i s
controlled by the authorities. The maintenance dredgingrequirement i s estimated at an
annual average o f a little over one million cubic meters for the project rehabilitated
canals, although it i s unclear how often a given area will receive maintenance. Irrigation
staff said that the time betweenrequired canal dredging i s now four years, but this figure
was never confirmed by the Waterways Department.

3.33     The InlandWaterways and Ports project financed major improvement to Can Tho
Port including the pavement o f the entire port area, bumpers and other improvements to
berths, and cranes for container loadinghnloading etc. The missionvisited the port and
was given a presentation by the manager incharge. Port development has continued
steadily since project closing in2006, financed wholly by the port's operatingprofits.
The projects' provision o f a newpaved yard, the upgrades and replacements to cargo
handling equipment, new facilities for the collection o f vessel bilge water and chemical
spills, stafftraining time inDemark and technical assistance, have provided a solid
capacity increase and they have ledto clearly improved port management at Can Tho
Port.

3.34     The increased ship traffic inthe project-improved canals andwaterways is
reflected ina dramatic increase inthe Port's throughput. Duringproject preparationCan
Tho's cargo flow was originally predicted to increase to about 1.2 million tons by the
year 2010. By late 2008, however, total cargo flow was already at 3 milliontons; about 6
times what was to be expected at this stage. At project closing, the profitability o f Can


30 Gabions are wire fabric containers, uniformly partitioned, of variable size, interconnectedwith other
similar containersand filled with stone at the site ofuse, to form flexible, permeable, monolithic structures
such as retaining walls. Mattresses are usedinsea walls, revetmentsand weirs for earthretention.
Mattresses are relatively small inheight inrelation to the lateral dimensionof a gabion and are generally
usedfor channel linings.For optimal wear and durability, welded and stiffened mattressesare generally
preferred over those made with twisted wire. Gabions and mattresses will revegetate over time as the
structurecollects soil andthe airborne or waterborne seeds of locally occurring plant life. This spontaneous
growth will create avery natural environment and will increasethe efficiency of a gabion structure as the
plants enhance the soil stability. http://www.gabions.net/mattresses,html

                                              28


Tho Port was not up to appraisal expectations (expected increase 25 percent, actual 0.5
percent). Inthe time betweenthe ICR and PPAR missions, however, operatingrevenue at
Can Tho grew from 15 billion (VND) in2000 to 6 times that amount (over 90 billion
VND, without taking into account some December income [the missiontook place before
the closing of the month's accounting hadtaken place]). Surprisingly, while the economic
downturn has ledto drops incargo volume at Vietnam's other major ports, volume i s
rising unabated inCan Tho.

3.35     An increase inthe price o f oil coincided with the economic downturn. According
to officials at the port, the upsurge has created a market for oil contaminated bilge water.
At least at the time ofthe mission visit, bilge water was no longer being treated because it
was being sold to entrepreneurs. It i s beyondthe remit o f this report to ascertain what
happens to this liquidwhen it leaves the port and/or to comment on the advisability o f
this practice.

3.36     Most o f the cargo that was observed going through Can Tho Port are loose goods:
constructionmaterial such as sand, clay, clinker, timber. Containers are filled with frozen
seafood; and rice for the Asian markets. Worker wages are rising along with shipping
activity. In2000-2001,the average monthly wage was about 800,000 (VND), while in
2008, it i s 3.5 million (VND).

3.37     Training provided to port staff inDemark brought about a total restructuring o f
business procedures and services at the port, as it began focusing more on its comparative
advantages inthe search for new business. Instead o f marketing to all shippers across the
board, the port has identifiedshippers by the craft making up their fleets. As a shallow
water port well-located interms o f Deltaresources, staff have carefully marketedport
services to companies runningflat bottomed sea barges up to 12,000 tons and ocean ships
below 5,000 tons. Can Tho also increased its competitiveness by offering free short-haul
transport and, thanks to the yard expansion, 5 months o f free storage. Saigon and other
nearby ports typically offer only 1 month. Inthe near future, Can Tho is looking to
deepenthe channel to the sea andfurther enlarge its cargo handlingcapacity so it can
attract larger container ships currently forced to use the port at HCMC.

3.38     Can Tho Port was legally mergedwith Saigon Port inJuly 2002. The purpose o f
the mergerwas to consolidate the operationo f all the port terminals inthe Mekong delta
underthe management ofthe director o fCanTho port. There is also a planto set up an
operation center consisting of 5 smaller satellite ports that would make up a network o f
Mekong Delta ports feeding Can Tho. And a follow-on project i s under preparation that
will create two more canal systems runningthroughthe delta to reduce pressure on the
current system, and eliminate the slowdown caused by one narrow stretch which has
proved to be a bottleneck for shipping.

3.39     A dredgingindustryis essential to regular maintenance activities. Giventhe state
o f the canal banks it seems that finding sufficient funding for maintenance-an       estimated
$1,900 per kilometer o f waterway annually-has       beenproblematic. But without regular
allocations, private sector providers will find it difficult to be financially stable. While the
rehabilitation o f major waterways performed by this project gave the domestic dredging

                                                    29


industry anopportunity to flourish through aninfusionof capital innew equipment, the
capacity it represents needs to be usedregularly for it to be sustained. Budgetary
allocations to the Inland Waterways Administration Southern Department in2005, the
                                                              -
last year for which there i s data, were $870 per kilometer lower than estimates o f the
amount needed.

PROTECTION OF COASTAL WETLANDS


3.40     The PPAR missiontraveledto SOCTrang and Bac Lieuprovinces to visit sites
served by the Coastal Wetlands Protectionproject. Little new data has beencollected
since credit closing, and, unless otherwise stated, the PPAR uses ICR data for project
achievements while relying on visual observation for the descriptions o f the results on the
ground.

3.41     By credit closing, monitoring data confirmed that, because o freforestationefforts,
the coastal erosionarea was substantially reducedandthe accretionzone hadbeen
increased. Because o f the replantedmangroves, coastal erosion was reduced by 40
percent inCa Mau and the lengthand the area o f coastline accreting was increased by 20
percent duringthe same period. It was not possible for the mission to visit Ca Mau, but it
i s reported to be the province where the reforestationeffort went best. The project office
inHanoireported that 370 milliontrees hadbeenreplanted along 460 kilometers ofcoast.
Site visits confirmed that an increase inmangrove and casuarinas plantation (and
therefore protected area) took place inthe FPZ-staff            stated that under the project forest
coverage increased from 48 percent to 96 percent inthose zones. The mission sees no
reason to question these assertions. But stakeholders pointed out that this result i s only
partially attributable to the project as bothNGOs and Program 661 worked inthe same
areas during the same time period. Infact, Program 661 i s probably responsible for 80
percent o f all that was accomplished interms o f reforestationinthe project areas.31

3.42     There was an improvedinstitutional capacity for mangrove plantingand
protection at the local level due inpart to the up-gradingo f forest guard stations with the
necessary equipment provided by the project; and improved protection awareness among
local communities led to a decline inforest law violations inthe project area. The
objective regarding the sustainable protection o fthe aquatic environment and coastal
protectionfunctions was partially achieved inthe areas visited, confirmed by the
reappearance o f shellfish near the shore and (anecdotally) improved fishing. But arguably
where the project impacts were greatest was interms o f the resettlement effort and the
technical and economic support provided to the households inthe project area.

3.43     The CWP project was very innovative, and it was one o fthe first IDA funded
efforts inthe forestry sector. Because it was a very new kindo f undertaking, it took about
half a decade to put together. It will be recalledthat the early 1990s was a periodwhen
Vietnamwasjust beginningto gain experience with Bank-financed projects and



3 1 Inthe fully protectedand buffer zone areas 126,245 hectares of forest were replanted. Ofthose, Program
661 was responsiblefor about 100,000 (79.2 percent).

procurement procedures. The upshot was that project preparation was based on a forestry
and landuse reconnaissance that (unfortunately) took place five years beforethe loanwas
actually approved. A great deal happened duringthat period that made that early
appraisal effort irrelevant and out of date. First, shrimp farming all but replaced rice
paddies. Then, an outbreak o f shrimp disease devastated family incomes and ledto
uncontrolled exploitation o f forestry resources. Luckily for the coastal environment and
the people's disaster vulnerability, the disease outbreak forced farmers to abandon their
shrimp ponds inthe tidal areas andto move further inland, where there was less chance
o f contaminating shellfish inthe                Having shrimp farmers move away from the
seashore opened coastal areas to reforestation. Adding to the complexity, some o f those
areas that had beenmapped as deforested had beenreplanted by State Forestry
Enterprises supported by the Government's Program 661. Others that had beenreforested
five years earlier hadbeenchopped down as aquaculture moved inland. By the time
project staff started work, the forestry and farming situation had changed so much that
the reconnaissance was highly unreliable and it had to be done again. Yet not knowing
exactly where to work was just part o f the problem, there were also issues regarding how
to work.

3.44     Project staff interviewed admitted that the way they beganreplantingmangroves
didnot give good results inthe most environmentally fragile areas. Several varieties o f
mangroves were planted along the beach and, slightly inland, taller indigenous species
that look like casuarinas were put into serve as a windbreak. The mangroves were
planted ina two-stage process, seedlings spending their first months inproject-managed
nurseries and then, when they reached a height where they no longer needed special
attention to survive, they were still short enough that they could essentially bejust shoved
into the sand along the beach. For this approach to work requiredgood luck and, more
importantly, good weather. But the project area i s a storm-tossed coast, with frequent
rough seas, hightides, and strong along-shore currents. The mission visited one coastal
zone inBac Lieu province where mangroves had beenreplanted. Not only was there not a
single surviving mangrove to be seen, without the mangrovesto holdthe beach inplace,
there were many areas where, over the years, the coast hadwashed/worn away.
Sometimes as much as 100 meters seemed to be gone where sea action found a weak spot
and worked its way inland.Without further actions the sea dikes protecting the
resettlement zones could soon be at risk.As long as the landdid not wash away, the
casuarinas seemedto do all right.Villagers indicated to the mission how far out onto the
mudflats mangroves hadbeenreplanted, andalso pointed out pieces o fthe signthat had
been put up to draw attentionto the replanted area. The signhadbeen knocked down by
wave action, it was splintered into many pieces, and it would soon be indistinguishable
from driftwood.

3.45     To be really successful replantinginthe more challenging areas requires letting
the mangrove seedlings spend more time inthe nursery, according to staff that
accompanied the mission. When they eventually become too big to be put into the sand



32 Farmershave discoveredthat removingall the water from the ponds and lettingthem sun dry between
harvests effectively sanitizesthe ponds and kills of the pathogens.

                                               31


manually, they can (and should) be plantedusinga hand augur to set them deep enough
to resist wave action. But even then a severe storm that came before the roots couldtake a
firm holdinthe sandwould take out enoughofthemto require yet another replanting. In
some places, replanting took place twice before the trees took hold, although inothers
zones project staff gave up: no replanting with larger trees took place and little or nothing
i s left o f the work that was done. Reforestation was not the only project activity that was
difficult to get right, however, andthenthere was the question o f who was actually going
to be doing the work.

3.46      The project involved a whole range o f activities that were unfamiliar to local
institutions. To compensate for weak institutional capacity and complex tasks, the project
design called for the employment o f 500 new staff to support community organization,
resettlement, technology transfer, and the reforestationeffort. Staff from the central to the
provincial and even village levels were to be hiredtogether under a single TA contract.

3.47     After Boardapproval, having the loanproceeds available for project activities did
not really helpto get things started as long as 500 critical positions remained unfilledand
the geographic areas wherework was to take place could not be clearly defined. A
DANIDA grantwas to cover the staffing aspect, butinthe event it only became effective
some 15 months after the credit approval (February 200l),      causing serious
implementationdelays.The project has many significant achievements to its credit, but
beingready to implement was not one o fthem.

3.48     As couldbe seen from the experiences ofthe other water projects described
earlier inthis report, there were huge differences inthe level of achievement between
project areas, with SOCTrang achieving far more than Bac Lieuinterms o f
environmental and livelihood restoration. The stabilization o f the beach with mangroves
along the coast in SOCTrang has turnedthe coast into an accretionzone, andthe re-
established mangroves have caused hatchlingsto return, improving catches using
artisanal fishing methods. Incontrast, inthe areas o f Bac Lieu visitedby the mission the
replanted mangroves have largely beenwashed away and the coast i s eroding rapidly.
The mission was strongly discouraged from visiting the resettlement sites inthat
province. InSOCTran, incontrast, resettlement has beena resounding success: most
houses have been improved since handover with the beneficiaries' own finds, and most
householders earn a good living from agriculture and aquaculture inthe lots they have
received under the project.

3-49     Creating a capacity and willingness to protect the environmentwas an extremely
important achievement. It has been notedthere was a decline inbarren coastal areas as a
result o f project activities in SOCTrang. Protection contracts given out to smallholders
made this achievement sustainable by effectively protecting mangroves. As long as the
trees remain, the zones around their roots are protected from the violence of the sea,
creating breeding grounds for fish and shellfish. Sea crabs and clams re-appeared insome
places and increased inothers (most obviously at My LongNamcommune inTra Vinh).

3.50     The Dat MuiNature Reserve (which was mergedwith Ong Trang nature reserve
and Bai Boi fish sanctuary) was upgraded to nationalpark status, and apark management

                                                   32


   planwas prepared. Improvedenvironmental awarenessamong local forest rangers helps
   protect the park area.

   3.5 1    The project permanentlyresolved landlessness and livelihood problems for about
   2,000 families. Average per capita incomes have increased steadily inall provinces and
   poverty rates have decreased significantly. According to surveys undertaken shortly
,  before the project closed, poverty rates invulnerable communes had decreased by 38
   percent and average annual incomes had increased by 55 percent. So, although the first
   year and a quarter was devoid o fprogress, having hundreds o f new staff come on board
   meant that the last four years o f implementation ledto significant positive environmental
   andsocial impacts, and new employment opportunities. Cottage industries established
   under the project, including a women's basket makingproject visitedbythe mission, that
   incorporates several villages and uses invasive plants (hyacinths) to goodpurpose.
   Poultry and fish farming projects were other major income earning successes, and a pig-
   raising project is inits early stages, although results look promising.

   3.52     Social aspects o f the project created the enabling environment that protected the
   reforested area. Inthe sites visited, there i s no question that the resettled householdsare
   much better off than they were before. People showed the mission where they used to
   live. It was on land so low and so near the sea that even slightly higher than normal tides
   caused flooding. Numerous families visited intheir newhomes mentioned that the
   quality o f their lives inthe new resettlement sites i s muchbetter now. With
   improvements inaccess to critical infrastructure, road networks, and markets, it i s much
   easier to earn a living through commerce. There are many small stores inthe resettled
   villages, some providing distinctive products such as veterinary medicine, yard goods,
   and cosmetics. Most resettled households have pondsthat are used for fish or shrimp
   cultivation. And many have poultry. A few village leaders have gone into pig production.
   Women received special training on livestock raising and credit was made available to
   themunder the project. Improvementsinhealth and sanitationconditions, literacy and
   other social aspects particularly benefitedwomen and children.

   3.53     An ethnic minority development plan focused on 17Khmer pagodas and their
   congregations. The plan, developed usingparticipatory techniques, included the
   upgrading o f classrooms for Khmer children, the construction o f crematoria, andthe
   procurement o f Khmer traditional racing boats and musical instruments used infestivals.
   Intotal, anestimated 5,000 Khmer minority households have benefited.Site visits
   revealed that the effort was well received by the community and highly appreciated by
   local Khmer religious leaders. Khmer communes significantly improvedtheir quality o f
   life which helpedthem to better integrate into Vietnamese society. Inreturn for project
   support to their pagodas, religious authorities insome sites have spoken strongly to their
   congregants about the importanceo f protectingthe reforested sites. A monk inone site
   mentionedto the mission that inhis village, people still are not convinced andthey cut
   down more trees thanthey should.

   3.54     Improved landtenure was granted to farmers living inthe buffer zones through
   the issuance o f certificates granting landuse rights for residential and productive lands.
  The missionwanted to make sure this hadhappened and asked several householdto

                                              33


produce their certificates-all   were able to do so. Access to commercial credit from
 various sources was improved. Altogether, the RFprovided loans o f around a total of
VND 14.2 billion(equivalent to US$O.9million) to morethan 5,200 poor households in
the project area. Theproject made aparticular effort to ensurethat landcertificates
included the names o f husbandand wife, which gave them an equal say over the use o f
the landandthe decisionon whether it shouldbeused for collateral. Diversifying crops
and animal husbandry (especially the increased attentionto fishproduction, which i s
 subject to less production risksand market vagaries), not to mentionthe reduced
vulnerability to storms and the sea, has reduced the risks to which all project beneficiaries
are now subject.



4.       Ratings for the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project

RELEVANCE
4.1      The current Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was designed to be
fully aligned to Vietnam's tenth Socio Economic Development Plan (SEDP). The SEDP
sets out four broad objectives, which inturn are the organizing principles o f the CPS:

         (a) Improve the business environment;
         (b) Strengthensocial inclusion;
         (c) Strengthennatural resource and environment management; and
        (d) Improve governance.

4.2     As organizing principles they are known as pillars.This project can be seenas
providing support for Pillar 1. According to the strategy, improving the business
environment will involve improved competitiveness with full integration o f Vietnam in
the world economy, includingenhanced agricultural competitiveness, and more efficient
andreliable provision o f infrastructure services. Not only is this integral to the project,
project funded activities can also be seen as providing support for Pillar 2: Strengthening
Social Inclusion. Priorities for Bank Group currently include increasing access to quality,
basic infrastructure services for the rural poor.

4.3     The relevance o fproject objectives is ratedhigh.The project objectives were
consistent with GoV priorities for the sub-sector as well as the Bank's first CAS at the
time o f approval. The 2002 CAS and the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth
Strategy (CPRGS, as the PRSP i s called inVietnam) developed three themes, two o f
which were highly relevant to this project: 1) high growththrougha transition to a market
economy; 2) an equitable, socially inclusive, and sustainable pattern o f growth; and 3)
adoption o f a modernpublic administration, legal, and governance system. The CAS
notes that aroundthe three cross-sectoral themes, the Bank Group program should
continue to operate at the sectoral level, and continueto promoterural and urban
development, and investmentinhumanresources and physical infrastructure. Activities

                                                 34


were clearly alignedwith the objectives, and the project designincorporatedlessons from
previous experience.

4.4      The relevance o fproject designis rated substantial. Project designtook account
o fthe organizational arrangements and capacities o fthe State Owned Enterprises and the
implementingagencies that were emerging and helpedtheir transition to the market
economy.

4.5      Inlightofthe above, the PPARratesrelevance as substantial.

EFFICACY
4.6      Objective - to increase agriculturalproduction (primarily of ricefor food) and
farmer incomes, and to reducepoverty in selected rural areas of Vietnam: substantial.

4.7      The project produced substantial socioeconomic benefits, although it was clearly
fortuitous that it coincided with a liberalization o f markets and the empowerment of
individual farmers interms o f cropping decisions. The final agricultural production
achievements generally exceeded the appraisal targets: the irrigated area was 103 percent
o f the target: the increment inannual rice output was 144 percent o f the target; and maize
producedwas 150 percent o fthe target. The project benefited338,000 families (108
percent o fthe target). The impact o fthe project on farm incomes has been substantial. At
the ICR, the incremental netannual income of farm households which adopted improved
irrigation and technology under the project has beenraised by US$86 (about 246% o f
SAR) inCam Thuy, US$12.4 (about 17.2% o f SAR) inSouthNgheAn, US$52.1 (about
75.6% of SAR) inLinhCam, US$69 (about 82.1% o f SAR) inAn Trach, US$152 (about
175% o f SAR) inThach Nham, US$17 (about 188.9% o f SAR) inDong Cam, and
US$78.9 (not available inSAR) inthe Hoc M o n North BinhChanh subproject area. The
                                                       -
overall average net farm income for farm households in7 original subproject areas has
increased about US$66.8 (about 112% o f SAR). This indicates strong financial incentives
for farmers to participate inthe project. While average incomes o f farmers went up
substantially, it i s not clear the extent to which overall poverty was reduced inthis area.

4.8      Inaddition, the project providednumerous, non-quantifiable social and
environmentalbenefits, including an increase inthe reliability o f water delivery,
enhanced drainage, improved road access to communities, and improved dam safety.
Repair to flood-damaged irrigation systems in 1998, 1999 and 2000 was an additional
benefit. The project was also expected to provide salinity intrusion protection, and
although it could have done so, it didnot: the emergence o f aquaculture and what is
known as the rice-fish approach-fish        thrive inrice fields irrigated with slightly saline
water-made      that no longer relevant.

EFFICIENCY
4.9      Economic analysis conducted following credit closing showed an overall ERR o f
19 percent for the seven original subprojects (compared with the 17percent at SAR) and
an ERR o f 20 percent for the seven additional subprojects, leading this PPAR to conclude
that the project's efficiency was substantial.

OUTCOME
4.10     The overall project outcome is rated satisfactory (Table 4). As was noted above,
the overall economic rate ofreturnwas 19percent. The Borrower overcame anumberof
significant challenges including unfamiliarity with Bank procedures, andthe challenge o f
managing a large number o f subprojects. The provision o f technical assistanceto
geographically-dispersed farmers achieved considerable agricultural production gains
with a direct impact on rural incomes. Careful project management ledto substantial cost
savings, andpermitted implementers to expand the scope o f the project.

RISKTO DEVELOPMENT           OUTCOME
4.11     Water use fees for most farmers have been abolished. Inthe face o f a government
decisionto pay budget support directly to the IMCs, institutional sustainability for future
operations i s considered adequate. The PPAR notes, however, that results o f this decision
has beenthat the IMCs are much more concerned with supplyingthe industrial users than
farmers. Non-farm users still pay them directly, and at highrates. As long as the GoV
keeps the amount it pays the IMCs inline with expenses, and especially energy costs,
risksfor the continued delivery of O&M and water management services through the
IMCs are controlled. Inlight o fthe impacts o ftraining given, current trends infood
prices, and continued attentionto maintenance, the risk to development outcome i s
considered to be moderate.

BANKPERFORMANCE
4.12     Bank performance inensuringquality at entry i s rated satisfactory. The
preparation work culminating inappraisal built on the best available knowledge. The ICR
notes that the attentionpaid to managing resettlement issues at entry and during
implementation was more than adequate, and that the RAP was a model for subsequent
projects and even for non-Bank efforts. This could not be verified by the mission because
it hadtaken place morethan a decade previously andthe character ofthe areas visited
hadbeen dramatically altered by the expansion o f HCMC and industrializationthat had
taken place inthe interim. Attention to the special environmental conditions inthe
Mekong Delta Region was also commendable. Bank performance duringproject
preparation i s rated as satisfactory.

4.13     Quality o f Bank supervision during implementation i s rated satisfactory.
Reportedly Bank missions were regular and timely, cooperationwith the implementing
agency was good, especially interms o f bringingkey staff up to speedwith Bank

                                             36


procedures which were totally new to them. Supervision performance i s ratedas
 satisfactory.

4.14     The overall Bankperformance is rated satisfactory.Having key members ofthe
project task team inthe Hanoi ResidentMission facilitated their frequent access to the
field, and direct communication with the borrower facilitated timely mid-course
corrections and avoidedproblems.

BORROWER      PERFORMANCE
4.15     Government implementationperformance i s rated satisfactory:Although the
Borrower was unfamiliar with the Bank, its involvement inand contributions to project
preparationwere fully satisfactory. Relevanttechnical, institutional, environmental and
social issues were systematically addressed, and the planningand coordination o f
activities was well handled.

4.16     The implementingagency's performance is rated satisfactory:Bank staff note
that the Central Projects Office (CPO) performance improved steadily. On-the-job
learning needed to take place and it did. Financial management still needed further
strengthening by project closing, however.

4.17     The overall Borrower performance i s ratedsatisfactorybecausethe Ministry o f
Agriculture and Rural Development, the Central Projects Office, the Sub-project
Implementation Office and Irrigation Management Company showed commendable
flexibility. Their determinationand commitment to successful outcomes carried the day.
Most project targets have beenachieved at or below budget and to an acceptable standard
o f quality. Numerous additional tasks were also completed due to unforeseen risks and
natural hazards.

M&EDESIGN,IMPLEMENTATION,ANDUTILIZATION
4.18    The overall quality o fproject monitoring and evaluationis rated substantial.

4.19    M&E Design.The Central Project Office (CPO) was expected to monitor,
evaluate and report project physical and financial progress o f activities to be implemented
underthe project. As designed at the outset, the M&E system could only provide
decision-makers with information on the status o f inputs and outputs and not on
outcomes or impacts. N o performance measurement framework was included inthe SAR
that demonstrated the results chain, linkingproject objectives to outputs, outcomes, and
impacts. However, provisions inthe SAR elucidate how the M&E systemneeded to be
established duringproject implementation. Baseline information and key indicators were
to be identified in Subproject ImplementationPlans (SIP) and the CPO was to develop
and implementa computerized monitoring, evaluation andreporting system (M&E). The
focus was on progress and impact o f works construction, implementationo f resettlement
and environmental action plans. O&M costs and irrigation fees, water use and efficiency,
crop areas, yields and.productionand farmer incomes were also to be monitored. The
informationwas to be collected at the provincial level. Inaddition, on the job training in
monitoring and evaluation was to beprovided by consultants.

                                               37


4.20    M&E Implementation. A detailed performance measurement framework with
output and outcome indicators was developed during implementation. The framework
links outcome indictors to objectives and output indicators to components, thus
demonstrating a clear results chain. The plan was fully implemented,providing support
for sustainable improvements inagricultural productivity as well as social benefits. In
addition, the project's environmental action plan helpedto mitigate the impacts during
construction and operation.

4.21    M&E Utilization. A specific Environmental Monitoring Program was carried out
for the Hoc Mon-North BinhChanh sub-project as part o fthe safeguards policy activities
because o f special soil and groundwater conditions prevailing there. Reports from the
environmental monitoring contractor showed that soil salinity and water pollution levels
had beenreduced, although they were inconclusive on soil acidity due to cyclical
fluctuations inobserved values.

OTHER ISSUESCOMPLIANCE, FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE, AND UNINTENDED
                (SAFEGUARD
POSITIVE/NEGATIVE     IMPACTS)
4.22    The project triggered three safeguards: 1) OP/BP 4.01 on the environment, 2)
OP/BP 4.12 on involuntary resettlement, and 3) OP/BP 4.37 on the safety o f dams. They
were fully complied with.

4.23    OP/BP 4.01 -Environmental Assessment. An EnvironmentalAction Planwas
approved by the Bank. Environmental monitoring o f compliance with the action planand
water quality inthe Hoc Mon-North BinhChanh subproject was requested by the Bank.
Monitoring was undertaken to determine potential physical, chemical and socioeconomic
impacts. It was determinedthat civil works did not measurably affect the environment,
plants or domestic animals; andthat ultimately the completed structures helpedto
improve water quality by reducing levels of metals and flooding.

4.24    OP/BP 4.12 -Involuntary Resettlement.A Resettlement Action Plan (the first o f
its kindto be executed by the Ministry o f Agriculture) was successfully implemented.
The principles o fthe Resettlement Action Plans were largely complied with ina timely
and efficient manner by the organizational structures and systems established for this
purpose. Eligibility criteria for beneficiaries were followed.

4.25    OP/BP 4.37-Safety of Dams. A dam safety improvement activity that was
included at appraisal was expanded following the acute floods o f 1998 and 1999.
Specifically, the project provided dam safety inspection o fthe Thung Bang, Dau Tieng,
Lower Yazul and Hinhdams. A technical evaluation by an independent panel o f experts
was provided by Hanoi University o f Water Resources experts. It determinedthat
national and World Bank dam safety standards had been met. Following the 1998 floods,
it was decided to support further improvements indam safety and associated irrigation
systems inPhuNinh,Liet Son, Hoa My and VUCTron, as part of the additional scope o f
work. Internationaltechnical expertise was provided for this activity, which was paid for
by the Government o f Italy.

4.26    Reservoir rehabilitationand improved dam safety features typically included:
installation o f additional spillways and spillway gate-hoists with fail-safe, emergency
actuators to increase flood retention and spill capacity. Dam slope erosion protection was
addressed, as was improved drainage.



5.      Ratings for the Water Supply Project

RELEVANCE
5.1     At appraisal, the WSP was closely aligned to the 1997-2001 CAS that identified
the need to upgrade infrastructure to tackle bottlenecks to development, the needto
transition to a market economy, and the need for reform o f state enterprises. The 2002-
2006 CAS continued these objectives. With regard to the current Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), this project can be seen as providing support for more efficient and
reliable provision o f infrastructure services, improving infrastructureto address the needs
o f the urbanpoor, and reducing vulnerability to adverse shocks, including diseases. These
are all strategic priorities.

5.2     The relevance o f project objectives i s rated high.The project objectives fully
supported the Government's sector strategy for urbanwater supply which was based on
analytical and advisory (AAA) work supported by the World Bank and the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1990 and the FinnishGovernment in 1994.
The mainthrust ofthe strategy was to consolidate and expand access to basic water
supply services to meet the demands of rapidurbanization, andto facilitate growth in
foreign investment and tourism.

5.3     The relevance o fproject design i s rated substantial.The design o fthe project was
conventional for the sector and included a mix o f activities shown to be effective for
agencies insimilar Bank-supported projects. The designrecognizedthat the WSCs had
very limited experience o fimplementinginternational contracts and attempted to
ameliorate this by including all construction ina single contract for each city and
providing significant construction management supportby international consultants.

5.4     Inlight o fthe above, the PPAR ratesrelevance as substantial.

EFFICACY
5.5     Objective 1 - to improve the quality of water services -had substantial
achievement. The three participating cities met their physical targets and all performance
indicators for each city were exceeded (see Table 3 andparas 3.13-23). The PPAR
accepts the ICR reasoning for not including Danang inthe assessment-that        is, that
Danangnever started and received no Bank financing.

5.6     Objective 2 - to ensure sustainability of thephysical investments by developing
the WSCs' institutional capabilities and staffskills, andfacilitating commercialization of

                                             39


the WSCs-had high achievement (see Figures3-5). Institutional capabilities and staff
skills improved substantially. The following were introduced: computerizedbilling and
collection systems, customer management systems, a GIS water managementand
monitoring system, O&M manuals, and standardized budgetingprocedures. Training
included study tours to other utilities abroad. A corporate planning system was also
developed as a basis for future annual work plan agreements with city authorities. These
developments, together with the financial achievements described inthe previous chapter,
provide a strong base for the WSCs' future sustainability.

5.7     Objective 3 - to assistpreparation of afuture water investmentplan - had
modestachievements. Only Haiphongprepared an investment plan, the other two cities
preferring to use the intendedfunds for institutional development instead. However, the
additional fundingfor institutional development contributes to Objective 2.

5.8     Based on the above, this PPAR rates efficacy as substantial.

EFFICIENCY
5.9     The project's overall economic rate o freturn(ERR)as recalculated inthe ICR
was 13.9 percent, compared with 16.7 percent as estimated at appraisal. The ICR's re-
estimated ERRsby individual cities were 17.9 percent for Hanoi, 12.2 percent for
Haiphong and 2.1 percent for Quang Ninh.The ERRs by city estimated at appraisal were
19.2 percent, for Hanoi, 24.4 percent for Haiphong, and 12percent for Quang Ninh.The
reduced ERRs were due to the extension o f the actual constructionperiod and, in
particular, the higher than expected operating costs. Therefore, the PPAR rates efficiency
as substantial.

OUTCOME
5.10    The overall project outcome i s rated satisfactory (Table 5). The project addressed
Vietnam's needto expand access to basic water supply services. During implementation,
the total numberofconnections more than doubled, going from 275,000 to 630,000. The
sustainability o f physical investments was ensured by developing institutional capabilities
and staff skills, and by facilitating commercialization. While utilities were subsidized in
the beginning, by the end they were all able to recover their operations and maintenance
costs and make payments on the Bank loan.

Overall Project Outcome                                                    Satisfactory



RISKTO DEVELOPMENT               OUTCOME
5.11      Riskto development is ratedmoderate.Water sector policies have been
reformed, Water Supply Companies (WSCs) hadtheir institutional capacity strengthened,
andtheir O&M capacity improved. However, although WSCs demonstrated solid
financial performance, the assumption made on the national government's willingnessto
allow themto raise tariffs was overly optimistic, given the inflationary spiral that ensued,
andthe GoV's desire to protect the poor from the worst effects o fthe economic
downturn. It i s assumedthat the tariff freeze will be o f short duration, however, andthat
the government's longer-term interest is inensuring the utilities self-sufficiency.

5,12     The measures introducedto protect andmonitor the quality ofraw water supplies
are an important first step. The risks posed by an accidental spillage o f hazardous
materials still loom, and inthe longer term establishing protected areas around water
intakes and inthe catchment areas will not be sufficient without a broader and more inter-
sectoral pushto reduce pollutant discharges. The measures carried out on Cao Van Dam
inQuangNinhto bringit upto internationaldesignstandards are important interms of
increasing the reliability o f the water source, as well as protecting the lives o f people
living downstream from the dam.

BANKPERFORMANCE
5.13     The overall Bank performance i s rated satisfactory.The project benefited from
staff continuity from preparation through supervision. Multi-sector teams covering a
range o f critical activities were made available to the water companies at critical stages o f
the project. Coordination was good withthe three bilateral co-financiers. The team also
arranged information exchange workshops to enable the companies to learn from one
another. The work carried out on this project, and the establishment o fthe water team in
the ResidentMission, were bothinfluential inthe Bank's productive long-term
engagement inVietnam's water sector, and this has delivered benefits well beyond the
objectives o f this initial intervention.

5.14    Bank performance inensuringquality at entry i s ratedsatisfactory. The project
was based on an appropriate and effective sector strategy. And more importantly, by the
time the project was presentedto the Board detailed designs and biddingdocuments were
available for around 70% o fthe works.

5.15    Quality o f supervision i s rated highly satisfactory.The project benefittedfrom
staff continuity and decentralization o fthe supervision function to the country office.
Remedial measures, ifneeded, were quickly carried out becausethe team was able to
follow up by phone and short visits. Missionreporting was regular with richly detailed
back-to-office reports with sound recommendations producedfor each subproject inboth
English andVietnamese.

BORROWER      PERFORMANCE
5.16    The overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.The WSCs can bee seen
as both the borrowers and the implementingagencies inthis project. The WSCs were
effective and proactive, and consultant inputs were used effectively. Haiphong in
particular performed very well. Contract implementation was generally carried out within
budget and on time. Resettlement and landacquisition was carried out inaccordance with
the approved resettlement actionplans.Longprocurement,delays were aresult of GoV
procedures that involve sequential and often redundant reviews o f designs and contract
awards at the local and central levels. The Ministry o f Planning and Investment(MPI),
acted on behalfo f central government to oversee implementationwas effective in
coordinating project supervision, chairing wrap-up meetings for supervision missions,
and providing guidance to the implementing agencies. Counterpart funds were provided
on time.

5.17   Government performance i s rated moderately satisfactory. This moderately
satisfactory rating i sjustified because o fthe long`procurement delays at the central level.
These were a result o f GOV's procedures which requiremultiple, often redundant,
reviews o f designs and contract awards at local and central levels prior to submission to
the Prime Minister for approval.

5.18   The implementing agency's performance is ratedsatisfactory. Implementation
was generally carried out within budgetand on time. Counterpart funds were allocated on
time and resettlement and land acquisition was carried out inaccordance with the
approved resettlement action plans.

M&EDESIGN,IMPLEMENTATION, AND UTILIZATION
5.19   The overall quality ofproject monitoring and evaluation is ratedsubstantial.

5.20   M&E design.Performance was to be monitored against an implementation
schedule and a project implementation plan, while the agencies' operational, financial and
managerial performance was to be assessed against monitoring indicators. The key
performance indicators are percentage o fNRW, number of household connections, and
the working ratio. These relate, respectively, to the desired project goals of rehabilitating
the networks, expanding coverage, and improvingfinancial performanceofthe WSCs.

                                               42


 5.21    M&E implementation and utilization.Duringproject implementation, the three
 WSCs developed good management information systems to monitor all aspects o f water
 supply, performance, billingand financial and corporate management, and their systems
were also able to monitor the performance indicators. And they have continuedto use
thempost-closing, and for that reason were able to provide current figures for the PPAR.

OTHER ISSUESCOMPLIANCE, FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE, AND UNINTENDED
                  (SAFEGUARD
POSITIVE/NEGATIVE      IMPACTS)
5.22     The Vietnam Water Supply Projecttriggered the following two safeguards: 1)
OP/BP 4.12 on involuntary resettlement, and 2) OP/BP 4.37 on the safety o f dams. They
were fully complied with.

5.23    Resettlement requiredrelocation o f only 130 households, and the ICR indicates
that appropriate compensation was provided, which was anecdotally confirmed. A dam
that risked overtopping i s reported inthe ICR to have beenbrought up to international
design standards.



6.      Ratings for the Inland Waterways and Ports
        Project

RELEVANCE
6.1     Relevance o f project objectives i s rated high.The project objectives were highly
relevant at the time o f preparation. Inland waterways inVietnam's Mekong Delta carried
over 70% o f the total freight traffic, however the waterways' capacity and safety was
declining. The Bank'sCountry Assistance Strategy (1995) prioritized the rehabilitation o f
the basic transport infrastructure and strengtheningthe public sector institutions
responsible for infrastructure provision and management. Project objectives continue to
be relevant whenjudged against the current Country Partnership Strategy which aims at
reducing logistics and transportation costs and improvingtransport efficiency.

6.2     The project was consistent with the Government's Mekong Delta Master Plan
which identifiedthe priority investments for rehabilitating the main inlandwaterways o f
the Mekong Delta as well as the regional port.

6.3     The relevance o fproject designwas substantial.The project components were
clearly linkedto the achievement o fproject objectives. Appropriate performance
indicators were developed except for tracking safety where targets were not set. The
design of the project took into account the potential negative environmental impacts and
the need for resettlement. However, the method o f payment o f compensation for
resettlement was not addressed duringpreparationwhich caused substantial delays during
implementation.

                                                   43


6.4     This PPAR rates relevance o fthe InlandWaterways and Ports Project as
substantialinview o f the highrelevance o fproject objectives and moderate
shortcomings with respect to project design.

EFFICACY
6.5     Objective 1-to enhance the safety and trafic carrying capacity of the two main
inland waterway routes connecting the Mekong Delta with Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC):
high. Safety was improved and the accidents on project waterways dropped from 0.0034
per hundredvessels in2000 to 0.0023 in2005, a 32 percent decline. The traffic carrying
capacity o fthe two main inland waterway routes has increased ~ignificantly.~~             The
throughput o f the Can Tho Port increased commensurately. The travel distance o f the two
main routes was shortened by 50 kmthereby reducing the transport costs by an estimated
US$2 per ton.

6.6     Objective 2 - to rehabilitate and improve the Port of Can Tho to improve the
eficiency of cargo transshipment and distribution:high.

6.7     The entire area at Can Tho Port was paved. Bumperswere implementedand
berthsand cranes were improved. This facilitates transshipment o fthe mostly loose
goods, such as constructionmaterial, seafood, and rice. Fees for the thousands of ships
usingthe inlandwaterways were eliminated.This increasedefficiency since fees were
small and tedious to collect.

6.8     Objective 3 - to improve the institutions involved so they can better plan,
administer, operate and maintain the inland waterway system in the Mekong Delta:
substantial.

    e   The project financed the development o f a River Management Information
        System to better plan and manage the waterways network inthe Mekong Delta.
    e   The staff skills were improved through training inwaterways and port
        management.
    e   Training simulators were provided for the InlandWaterways Training School to
        train vessel and port handlingequipment operators.
    e   The project financed equipmentfor more efficient operations and maintenance o f
        the waterways systems. This includedvessels andworkshop equipment to support
        maintenance o f navigation aids and other waterways facilities.
    e   A feasibility study on improving the navigationat the Bassac River was carried
        out.

6.9    Based on the above, this PPAR rates efficacy as substantial.




33 The average daily cargo traffic increased237 percent at Cho Gao, 48 percent at RachGia and 180
percentat Vi Thanh.

                                               44


EFFICIENCY
6.10     The ex-post ERR for the two main corridors HCMC to Ha Tien and Cho Lachto
Nam Can are >50 percent and 29 percent respectively compared to appraisal estimates of
27 percent and 24 percent. For the waterways improvement component the ex-post ERR
i s >50 percent, muchhigher than expected than the appraisal estimate o f 26 percent.
These very highrates o f returnfor HCMC to Ha Tien corridor and the waterway
component are largely because o f the hightraffic growth inthe Chao Canal, the main
route from the Delta to HCMC. The ex-post Financial Rate o f Returni s 24 percent
compared to the appraisal estimate o f 17.8 percent. Therefore, the PPAR rates efficiency
as substantial.

OUTCOME
6.11     The overall project outcome i s rated as satisfactory(see Table 6). Before the
project, inland waterways inVietnam's Mekong Delta carried over 70 percent o f the total
freight traffic; however, the waterways' capacity and safety was declining. Inresponse,
the Inland Waterways and Port Project improved Can Tho Port, canals, and waterways,
and contributed to a large increase inwaterway traffic and transported cargo. In 1995,
23.5 million tons o f cargo was carried through the inland waterway. By 2004, the last
year for which data i s available, 55 million tons of cargo was transported through the
waterways. Duringthe five-year period between2000 and 2004, the annual average
increase incargo exceeded 8 percent. On-ground towers and beacons were installed as
aids to navigation. Waterway operations have also benefittedfrom better police
enforcement rules, and the accident rate has gone down. A recent government decree
eliminated fees for the thousands o f ships using the inlandwaterways, which increased
efficiency. At project closing, profitability o f Can Tho Port was not up to appraisal
expectation. Inthe time betweenthe ICR and PPAR missions, however, operating
revenue at Can Tho grew sixfold.

Overall Project Outcome                                            Satisfactory



RISKTO DEVELOPMENT         OUTCOME
6.12    Riskto development is rated moderate.Most o fthe planned outcomes were
achieved by project completion although the Can Tho port's journey to profitability took
a few years longer. The project's primary risk continues to be the inadequacy of funding
for maintenance. Proper maintenance o fthe waterways requires an estimated US$1,900
per kmannually. Budgetary allocations to Vietnam InlandWaterways Administration -
Southern Department are lower than the amount needed, and more attention to bank
stability i s requiredifmaintenance costs have any hope o f remaining at the current level.

                                              45


Onthe other hand, the likelihood of the government allowing the canals to returnto their
former condition i s negligible. They will be kept inoperational condition and economies
will bemade by leaving the canal banks inpoor condition, which is an inconvenience but
not a serious threat.

BANKPERFORMANCE
6.13    The overall Bank performance i s rated moderatelysatisfactory.The project
objectives were highly relevant for improving Vietnam's inlandwaterways and their
management. The Bank team paid adequate attention to environmentaland social aspects.
However there were few shortcomings. Duringpreparation full agreement was not
reached betweenthe government and the Bank on the eligibility o f state owned
enterprises to participate incivil works contracts. Compensation issues could have
receivedmore attention.

6.14    Bankperformance inensuringquality at entry is ratedmoderatelysatisfactory.
The designo fthe project and the approach taken inplanningits implementation was
highly relevant to the development strategy for improving the country's inlandwaterways
and their management. However, duringpreparationfull agreement was not reached
between the government and IDA on the eligibility o f state owned enterprises to
participate incivil works contracts. This was to prove a significant cause o f delay in
subsequent implementation and as such this rating is lower than the QAG quality at entry
review, which rated the project as excellent at entry for the attentionpaidto
environmental and social issues.

6.15    The quality o fBank supervision was satisfactory.Issues that emerged during
implementationwere attended efficiently and promptly. Compliance with safeguard and
fiduciary policies was closely monitored. Regarding the merger o f Can Tho and Saigon
Ports the supervisionteam could have been more proactive inaddressing the unexpected
mergerby advising on its viability. The profitability issue surroundingthe port thankfully
resolved itself.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE
6.16    The overall Borrower performance i s rated moderately satisfactory.This rating
i s based on the Borrower's commitment to the project, its oversight and monitoring o f
project implementation and the nature and timing o f its interventions insupport o f the
project. One weakness was the lack o f advance information to the Bank, as a key
financier o f the port, for the Can Tho port expansion plans and the subsequent merger
with Saigon port.

6.17    Government performance i s rated moderatelysatisfactory. The Government
failed to provide the Bank with advance information on Can Tho port expansion plans
and the subsequentmergerwith Saigon port. The performance o fthe implementing
agency was satisfactory.

6.18    The implementing agency's performance i s rated satisfactory.The project
management unit (PMU-W) was newly established. It successfully managed 36 civil

                                             46


works and equipment supply contracts and some 30 contracts relating to resettlement and
the monitoringo fenvironmental and social impacts over a wide geographical area. The
PMU-W completedthe project with outputs inexcess o f planned targets and at a cost that
was less than estimated. Although the project was completed later than expected, the
delay was largely not attributable to any shortcoming on the part of PMU-W.

M&EDESIGN,IMPLEMENTATION, AND UTILIZATION
6.19    The overall quality o fproject monitoring and evaluation i s rated modest.

6.20    M&E Design. M&Edesignwas satisfactory. The indicators developed at
appraisal were appropriate for monitoring the outcome o fthe project. These included: (a)
increase inaverage daily cargo traffic at selected locations along the project waterways;
(b) increase inthroughput ofthe Can Tho Port; and (c) financial performance o f Can Tho
Port, interms of increased operating profits. How improvements intraffic safety would
be monitored was not adequately addressed.

6.21    M&E Implementation. M&Eimplementation was inadequate largely because the
data collection was weak. The volume o f shippingand cargo carried on the waterways
(used by the ICR) was obtained through a physical count o fvessels at nominated spots
over a period o f a few days while the volume o f cargo i s verbally declared by the vessels'
operators and then projectedto arrive at the annual traffic volume. Hadchannel fees been
collected data gathering would have beenautomatic.

6.22    M&E Utilization. According to the ICR, the River Management Information
System financed under the project will provide a more systematic approach to data
collection and analysis. The proposed Mekong Transport InfrastructureDevelopment
Project (MTIDP) will follow through on the developmentand use o f this system with the
aim o f providing evenmore reliable planning data.

OTHER ISSUESCOMPLIANCE, FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE, AND UNINTENDED
                 (SAFEGUARD
POSITIVE/NEGATIVE     IMPACTS)
6.23    The assignment of Category A was appropriate as the project involveda
waterways improvement component that could adversely affect agriculture, fisheries and
aquatic life. Also, waterway widening and related disposal would involve land
acquisition which would requireresettlement o f affected households. At appraisal an
environmental assessment (EA) was carried out for the Waterways Improvements
Component, an environmentalanalysis was conducted for the Can Tho Port component,
and a ResettlementAction Plan was prepared.

6.24    Duringimplementationthe environmentalmanagement requirementsfor dredging
work were integrated into the contracts as a part o f technical specifications. One o fthe
main concerns related to the dredgingo f acid sulphate soil and its potential impact on
fisheries and agriculture. The ICR notes that the mitigation measures were good and, in
general, adverse impacts were lower than expected. The PPAR mission heard not
complaints, and found no visual evidence a decade after dredging took place. The

                                                 47


 Environmental monitoring was carried out inaccordance with the Environmental
 Management Action Plan (EMAP).

 6.25     Resettlement was carried out inaccordance with the Resettlement Action Plans. A
 total o f 7,215 (compared to 5,000 projectedat appraisal) project affected families were
 compensated inaccordance with Bank guidelines and governmental stipulations. This i s
 largely due to the increase inthe scope o f work and as a result of limited identification o f
 spoil disposal sites at the time o f appraisal. There were some complaints at a resettlement
 site where utilities had not beeninstalled ina timely fashion but these issues were
 resolvedbefore project completion.

 6.26     Fiduciary: Compliance was satisfactory.

 6.27    UnintendedImpacts: At selected sites the dredged materialwas usedby local
communities to raise their landabove the flood water level, thus reducingpotential
damage due to floods and enhancing its value.



7.       Ratingsfor the CoastalWetlands Protection
         Project

RELEVANCE
7.1      Relevance o f project objectives i s rated high.The objective ofthe project has
maintained its overall relevance and remained fully consistent with the country's
development priorities and the Bank's Country and Sectoral Assistance Strategies. With
regard to the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), this project can be seen as
providing support for strengtheningsocial inclusion, one o f the four pillars. Priorities for
BankGroup support include the mainstreaming of gender issues andthis project provided
landtitle and income generation to women. Empowering ethnic minorities inthe
development processes i s another CPS priority. Also, reducing vulnerability to natural
hazards i s called for inthe strategy. Evenmore important, another Pillar i s Strengthening
Natural Resource and Environmental Management. This project was entirely focused on
a range o f challenges relatedto land, forestry, and water resources.

7.2      The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Vietnam inthe 1990s
identifiedfive areas inwhich the Bank Group would needto shift support to: (a) a deeper
focus on poverty and social issues; (b) clearer links betweenprojects and policy dialogue;
(c) broader partnerships and decentralized implementation; (d) redirection o f lending
towards rural development; and (e) better aid coordination and a transition towards
program financing. The project contributed to this shift inall five areas.

7.3     The relevance o fproject designis rated modest.There were two key weaknesses
inproject design: (1) apoor appreciation ofthe institutional arrangements o fthe forest
sector especially interms o f what Program 661 was going to do. Procurement delays in

                                              48


turncontributedcomplexity to what was already a challengingimplementation
 environment; and (2) the lack o f reliable land survey on which to base the assessmento f
mangrove planting needs. The project designwas too complex institutionally for
provinces with weak absorptive capacity. Moreover, it called for the employment o f 500
new staff under a single TA contract. Virtually all o f the project implementation
depended on one contract, which only became effective some 15 months after the
approval o f the IDA Credit, thus severely handicappingimplementation.

7.4      Inlight ofthe above, relevance is ratedas substantial.

EFFICACY
7.5      The Project Development Objective (PDO) called for action intwo areas: 1) the
re-establishment o fthe coastal mangrove wetland ecosystems and 2) the sustainable
protection o f the aquatic environment and coastal protectionfunctions. The project
achieved its development objective and met the revised targets.

7.6      Objective 1 - to increase mangroveplantation andprotection areas and decrease
the extent of the barren areas in the zones requiringfullprotection: substantial.An
increase inmangrove plantation and protectionareas took place inthe FPZ. Inthe fully
protected and buffer zone areas, 126,245 hectares o f forest were replanted.O f those,
Program 661 was responsible for about 100,000 (79.2 percent), while the rest was
replanted under the Coastal Wetlands ProtectionProject. There was an improved
institutional capacity for mangrove plantingand protection at the local level due inpart to
the up-grading o f forest guard stations with the necessary equipment for effective forest
protection, Improved protectionawareness among local communities ledto a decline in
forest law violations inthe project area. Because o f the replanted mangroves, coastal
erosionwas reduced by 40 percent inCa Mau and the length and the area o f coastline
accreting was increased by 20 percent during the same period. Forest cover, which
exercises a coastal protection function, increased from around 50 percent in2000 to 96
percent in2007 as a result o f the project. Replanting inBac Lieuwas less successful,
mostly because o f heavy storms and flooding and poor plantingtechniques.

7.7     Objective 2 a decrease in barren areas in the FPZ: substantial. There was a
                    -
decline inbarrencoastal areas as a result o fproject activities. Protection contracts given
out to smallholders effectively protected mangroves, and the zones around mangrove
roots that were protected from the violence o f the sea created breedinggrounds for fish
and shellfish. Sea crabs and shellfish re-appeared insome places and increased inothers
(most obviously at My LongNamcommune inTra Vinh).

7.8     Objective 3 - to improve the managementandprotection in the Mui CaMau
nationalpark: substantial. The Dat MuiNature Reserve was upgraded to nationalpark
status, and a sound management plan was prepared for the Park. Improved environmental
awareness among local forest rangers helps protect the park area.

7.9     A reduction ofthe incidence of absolute poverty inthe target areawas caused by
the implementation ofaneffective technology developmentandtransfer program andthe
implementation o f Resettlement Area Social Development Action Plan inthose

                                               49


 communesthat received re-settlers. According to surveys undertaken shortly beforethe
 project closed, poverty rates invulnerable communes had decreasedby 38 percent and
 average annual incomes had increased by 55 percent. Improved land tenure was granted
 to farmers living inthe buffer zones through the issuance o f certificates granting land use
 rightsfor residentialand productive lands. Many informants notedthat livelihoods
became more sustainable after agriculture and aquaculture practices were improvedfor
vulnerable groups inthose zones. Inthe two resettled villages visited, all informants
 strongly stated how much better off they were after the project. Access to commercial
 credit from various sources was improved. The implementation o fthe SSP and EMDP in
poor and Khmer communes significantly improvedthe quality o f life for vulnerable
groups and the Khmer minority.

 7.10    Based on the above, this PPAR rates efficacy as substantial.

EFFICIENCY
7.11     An economic analysis carried outjust before closing showed anEconomic Rate of
Return(ERR) for the overall project of 17percent and aNet Present Value (NPV) of
US$14.2 million compared to the ERR o f 14 percent calculated at appraisal. The higher
ERRis due principally to a combination o fthe reducedproject costs (which were scaled
down by US$10.2 million), the increased investments insmallholder credit andthe
impact o f the technology transfer program. The long-term benefits from the increase in
the land area (from reduced erosion and increased accretion) and the restoration o f the
mangrove systems inthe project area (which are difficult to quantify) are not reflected in
this analysis. A sensitivity analysis indicatedthat the ERRis quiterobust. With a
reduction inbenefits o f 20 percent for all categories, the ERR estimates remain at 14
percent. However, the project i s sensitive to a reduction inthe price o f shrimp as a 10
percent decrease inprices reduces the ERRto 15 percent. The poor institutional designo f
the project was the fundamental cause o fimplementation delays.

7.12     Local political and religious leaders noted that environmental awareness had
greatly increased inthe general populace as a result o f project activities. Unquantifiable
benefits generated by the project include the improvedrestored and improved
biodiversity, secure landtenure that facilitates credit access (and the mission confirmed
the issuance of land certificates). The spill-over effect from project-supportedresearch is
that it will be usedby other development projects and by the government extension
service for the benefito f all farmers.

7.13     Takingthese factors into consideration, efficiency is therefore ratedas
substantial.

OUTCOME
7.14     The overall project outcome i s rated satisfactory (Figure 7). The project has
maintained its overall relevance and remained fully consistent with the country's
development priorities and the Bank's Country and Sectoral Assistance Strategies.
Institutional developmentwas significant and local institutional capacity was developed
notably, particularly interms o f environmental enforcement. By the Credit's closing,

                                                        50


 monitoring data showed that: (a) the coastal erosion area was substantially reduced and
 the accretion zone was increased; (b) naturalnear-shore aquatic resources reappeared;
 and (c) the incidence o f poverty decreased-average per capita incomes have increased
 steadily inall provinces and poverty rates have decreasedsignificantly.

Overall Project Outcome                                                          Satisfactory



7.15       Based on the revisedtargets accepted following the MTR and the Board-approved
restructuring, and the fact that the preponderance o f disbursementstook place post-
restructuring, the project i s rated sati~factory.~~Although the initial period was fraught
with delays, these were overcome to the degree that the last four years o f implementation
resultedinsignificant positive environmental and social impacts, poverty reduction inthe
poorest areas, increasing household incomes and new employment opportunities. Inany
event, the Board approval o f the restructuringchanges the standards to which this
projects can be held. As revised, the project directly benefited about 20,000 local
households and indirectly 100,000 households through research and extension, training
and dissemination.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT               OUTCOME
7.16       Riskto development is rated significant. While the project hadpositive
environmental impacts (inter alia on mangroves) and brought about significant poverty
reduction, these achievements are nascent and still fragile. They will need maintenance
and other types o f institutional support. Especially the project-established linkages
betweenforest protectiodconservationand livelihood development will need nurturing
for some time. On the positive side, significant achievements have been made in
institutional development and capacity building and there i s a strong commitment o f the
provinces to maintaining these hard-won outcomes. The rating o f significant i s not the
result o f any project deficiencies but rather a situation that i s generally true for most
environmental restoration and conservation projects, which often require the passage o f
time andconsistent effort over the intermediate termto create a sustainable impact.




34 The level of disbursementbefore and after the restructuring was calculatedbasedon the formula in
Appendix B of the OPCS ICR Guidelines (2006) where 2 refers to an Unsatisfactory rating, US$6.3m is the
disbursement amountbefore restructuring (see ICR, p. xi), US$55.4m is the total amount disbursedby
closing, 5 refers to a Satisfactoryrating, and US$49.lm is the amount disbursed after restructuring. The
result is [2 x [6.3/55.4]] + [5 x [49.1/55.4] = 4.7 (which roundsup to 5, equalto a Satisfactoryrating).

                                                51


BANKPERFORMANCE
7.17     The overall Bankperformance is ratedmoderatelysatisfactory.This rating is
given because o f a successful corrective restructuring following the MTR which allowed
the project to achieve the project development objective ina little less than four years.

7.18     Bankperformance inensuring quality at entry is ratedmoderatelysatisfactory.
The main weaknesses o f project design included: (a) poor assessment o f the mangrove
planting needs target, with little coordination with the ongoing national reforestation
effort working inthe same areas, Program 661; and (b) too much reliance on external TA
(about 500 positions from the central to commune levels to be packaged under one single
contract with a total cost o f above US$7 million). The poor institutional design of the
project was the fundamental problem causing serious implementationdelays.

7.19     The quality o f supervision i s rated satisfactory.Although the quality o f project
designwas poor and there were significant shortcomings inthe initial years o fproject
supervision, the Bank made substantial efforts to turn aroundperformance and provide
effective support toward the achievement o f development outcomes. With the change of
the TTL location from WashingtonDC to the Hanoi Country Office, corrective actions
were taken by the Task Team and Bank Management and the quality o f supervision was
significantly enhanced as a result o f the more proactive field missions and timely review
and responses, which accelerated the pace o f implementationdramatically and resolved
threats to the achievement o fthe project's development objective.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE
7.20     The overall Borrower performance i s rated moderatelysatisfactory.The PDO
and restructured targets were achieved with an extension o fthe project's life o f less than
one year. The IDA Credit and DANIDA Grant funds have also beenfully disbursed. The
concerned ministries, central agencies and implementing agencies cooperated closely
withthe Bank duringproject implementation and supervision.

7.21     The government's performance is rated moderately satisfactoryafter
restructuring, which, since the Board approved the changes, i s all IEGconsiders. That
said, it should be noted that borrower and implementing agency performance was
moderately unsatisfactory before the restructuring. The government was unable to
negotiate and conclude the TA contract inthe first two years, which resulted inextremely
slow implementation and eventually the restructuring ofthe project.

7.22     The performance o f the implementing agencies i s considered as satisfactory.
After restructuring, the performance o f all PPMUs was good. The implementing
agencies, through successful decentralization by MARD, made excellent efforts and
improvements inimplementation after project restructuring.

M&EDESIGN,IMPLEMENTATION, AND UTILIZATION
7.23     The overall quality ofproject monitoring and evaluation is rated substantial.

7.24     M&E Design. The monitoring indicators were presented inthe PAD. A separate
component was dedicated to M&E (which was largely TA-dependent). It covered a base-
line survey, environmental and socioeconomic monitoring and evaluation studies. During
the project restructuring,the indicators were reviewed and revisedto be more practical
andmeasurable duringthe remainingperiod, though these were rather too simpleto
capture all project impacts as they did not measure the quality o f mangrove plantingand
the linkages betweenpoverty reductionand forest protection.A revisedlog-frame was
discussed and agreed upon duringthe MTR.

7.25     M&E Implementation. A practical and effective MIS was established to provide
timely data for project monitoring and management. Itwas based principally on the
output indicatorsreflectedinthe project log-frame, supplemented by othersthat provided
progress and feedback informationto assist inmanaging the project. The MIS was
eventually incorporatedinto a monthly commune-level report that allowed timely
response to local issues. Based partly on the information inthe MIS,monthly, quarterly
and annual reports from the Central Project Office (CPO) and PPMUs were prepared
usinga standard format. Reportingshowed continuous improvementthroughout the
project.

7.26     M&E Utilization. The use o fthe project M&Esystemwas delayed by the late
arrival of the 500 staffers but was well utilized to support the supervision o f the project.
The TA team prepared an InterimProjectEvaluationReport: (a) to report onthe existing
data and the current state o f knowledge on the evaluation o f project activities; and (b) to
develop recommendations and an Action Plan for future project evaluation activities and
a relevant guide to future project implementation activities. The 2006 Action Plan was
implemented inthe first half o f 2007, including the collection o f primary and secondary
data inrelationto project evaluation indicators. Supplementary data was collected
through surveys o fresettled households.

OTHER ISSUESCOMPLIANCE, FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE, AND UNINTENDED
                 (SAFEGUARD
POSITIVE/NEGATIVE      IMPACTS)
7.27    Project implementation was incompliance with safeguard and fiduciary
requirements. The construction o f small works and all resettlement sites were closely
monitored for treatment o f waste-water and solid waste disposal. They were fully in
compliance with GoV and Bank requirements. Interms o f Social safeguards, the EMDP
and the RAP were prepared inaccordance with the Bank's O D 4.20 on Indigenous
People and OP 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement. The former not only helped improve
the social life and spiritualvalue o fthe local Khmer but also contributedto improving
social stability and integration. Most procurement activities took place at the provincial
level, they were mostly for small-value contracts and they were largely well handled. One
case o f collusion inbiddingfor small works was found inCa Mau in2004. It was
investigated by the PPMUand three colluding bidders were banned from participating in

                                                    53


all procurement under the project. An Action Planfor dealing with collusion in
procurement was developed and closely followed up to the end o fthe project.


8. Conclusionsand Lessons

8.1       The water sector is doing quite well inVietnam. The four projects reviewed in
this report are all rated satisfactory. All have made significant achievements and fulfilled
the objectives set for them at appraisal. But Vietnam i s doing well ina broader sense as
well. It i s on target to meet MillenniumDevelopment Goal 7,halving the numberof
persons without access to safe water and sanitation inurban areas.

8.2       The major donors (including the Bank) have established a productive relationship
with the Government inthe water sector. One example ofthe trust established was the
MinistryofConstruction's request to the Bankinmid2005 for assistancewithdrafting
Vietnam's first UrbanWater Supply Decree.35The decree promotes improvements in
water supply by creating an enabling environment for the mobilization of domestic
savings and private sector participation. The ongoing Water Sector Review (see
http://vnwatersectorreview.com) is an enormously promising GoV and multi-donor
initiative, and the links with differentministries and agencies' websites when followed
reveal important steps towards transparency and information sharing.

ENVIRONMENTAL           RESTORATION

8.3       While this PPAR only looks at a small parto f a larger water portfolio, the four
projects studied share certaincharacteristics. First and foremost i s the nature o f their
relationship to the environment. Whereas traditionally Bank water sector projects had
either an institutional or infrastructure focus or both, it i s becoming nearly impossible to
avoid addressing environmental restoration and environment-related landuse questions in
many areas ofthe country.36

8.4       The Irrigation Rehabilitation project can be seenas a responseto a series o f
environmental problems. Deforestationand poor land use patterns infragile areas leadto
erosion, which scours away precious topsoil and deposits it as silt inthe canals. Runoff
after heavy rains contributes to flash flooding which strains or even overwhelms project-
built canals, sluices, lifts, and bridges.



35 The Bank mobilized aprivate sector specialist and an institutional specialist and arrangedfor the
drafting team to visit regulatorsandpolicy-makers inEurope.

havethe worst water pollution, with "very severe" ranking for fecal coliforms, biochemical oxygen demand
and lead, and severe for suspendedsolids." WATER RELATED ECONOMIC ISSUES: Status Report

8.5     The InlandWaterways and Port Rehabilitationproject faces the exact same
problem, except that the silting o f the transport canals i s more rapid because of the
enormous increases infreight and passengertraffic that produce waves that accelerate
bank collapse. The affordable longer-term solution to the problems o f bothprojects i s not
just perpetual dredgingat $2,000 or moreper kilometer. To reduce maintenance costs,
canal maintenance should also encompass increased use o f gabions and mattresses and
the planting o fvegetation to stabilize the banks. Ofcourse problems tendto occur outside
o f highpopulation concentration areas because, inmany towns, property owners and
local governments have already invested inbank stabilization for convenience and flood
protectionpurposes. But bank maintenance will never happen without government
assistance inthe rural areas. Attention to the reforestation o f hillsides inrelevant
watersheds would also reduce maintenance costs and help to protect waterways from the
ravages o f severe weather.

8.6     The Coastal Wetlands Protectionproject is a textbook example o fthe benefits o f
environmental restoration, and the costs o fpostponing it. Where reforestationwas
successful, land i s accreting, biodiversity i s being restored, and farming and other
economic activities are protected from storms, wind, and salt. Incontrast, where
mangrove seedlingswere planted too small, at too shallow a depth, and not carefully
monitored (to replace plants washed away or dead), the coastline i s moving inland,
sweeping away solid ground and endangering the dikes built to protect the resettled areas.
The piece ofthe signthat the mission found on the beach (para.3.44) is an apt symbol
for what happens to project achievements when the environment i s not restored ina
sustainable manner.

8.7     The Water Supply Project has its own complex relationship with the environment,
and it highlightsthe environmental tasks that needto be addressed going forward. Hanoi
developed a computerized model o f water quality inthe aquifer. It also uses this model to
monitor ground levels (to detect signs of over-exploitation o f the aquifer). Attention to
aquifer i s critical becausethe groundwater that Hanoi relies uponfor much o f its supply
has sufferedbecause o f wastewater infiltration. Haiphong has hadto establish protection
zones around the river intakes to limit contamination, and accidental spillages of
hazardous materials inthe industrial area upstream are a persistent worry. InQuang Ninh
it was necessaryto promote reforestationto protect water quality, butthe newforests
were not adequate to keepthe pollution seeping out o f mine tailings from entering the
water supply. It ultimately proved necessary to close down the mines inthe reservoir
catchment area. While both Hanoi and Haiphong are fortunate inthat they have access to
river water that still is o f treatable quality, increasing pollutant loads inthe riversmean
that extractionpoints needto be carefully chosen and protected as muchas possible. But
industrial growth and the (sometimes clandestine) release o f untreated effluents into the
river pose huge risks, especially nowthat groundwater is no longer a reliable fallback
option.

8.8     Inconclusion, attentionto the environment inBankprojects usedto focus on
avoiding or mitigating adverse impacts that might be expected to occur from project-
financed activities. Worldwide, Bank-financed projects inmany sectors are increasingly
constrained by environmental problems that pre-date project appraisal. According to the

                                               55


National Water Resources Strategy, environmental protection i s a problem that the GoV
 intendsto devote more attention to as the country's industrialization and modernization
proceeds. Industryi s not the only problem, however. Aquaculture and agriculture also
emit chemicals that are a major factor inriver pollution, and spread waterborne diseases
which can put seafood stocks inthe wild inperil.

 8.9     This PPAR found reasonto believe that providing sufficient quantities o fwater at
national quality standards will become a challenge incertainurban areas. Inthe four
evaluated projects it was assumedthat investments ininfrastructure would overcome
what were inessence environmentalproblems. The project experience o f the IRP, WSP,
InlandWaterways, and CWP projects (as analyzed inthis section) showsjust how
difficult it has become, even inwidely different subsectors focusing on highly divergent
activities, to achieve anythinglasting without addressing the problems that have been
caused by an extendedperiod o f environmental neglect.

MORE ATTENTION TO INTER-AGENCY             COORDINATIONWOULD BEBENEFICIALAT THE
PROVINCIAL LEVEL
8.10     Relatedto the environmental problems described above, but with ramifications
that go far beyond them, is the institutional framework. When staff o f the Irrigation
Management Companies or the Waterways Department were asked why attention was
not givento vegetative soil and water conservation measures that would check runoffand
control sedimentation, their reply was always that it was someone else's responsibility.
Yet while Agriculture or Forestry staff are undoubtedly very aware o fthe deforestation
problem at the national level, and doubtless have mapped it quite thoroughly, it may
neverhave occurred to provincial staff to prioritize areasthat contribute to the specific
problems o f provincial irrigation and transport canals.

8.11    Water management inVietnam i s subject to considerable institutional overlap in
spite o fpositive steps at the highest levels. The (1998) Water Resources Law introduced
the River BasinManagement concept for the first time andproposed the establishment o f
a National Council on Water Resources. It also called for a comprehensive review o f the
water resources sector and a strategy intendedto reduce inter-agency conflict. The
promised review i s nearly complete (see Box 3), but it i s too early to predict its outcome
or impact.

8.12    The law includes provisions on water rights, water use and disposal, water
quality, construction and maintenance o f water works, and water resources management.
Interms ofcoordination, inthe opinion of some observers duringthe interveningyears
conflict has been avoided by an unfortunate retreat back into silos to some degree.
Irrigation and shippingcanals continue to fill with silt because no vegetative soil
stabilization has been done. But the Irrigation Management Companies and Inland
Waterway people do not often talk with Forestry and Agriculture staff about what needs
to beplanted, and where reforestation and bank stabilization would best supportthe
sustainability o fthe irrigation and waterways. Recent floods inHanoi mighthave a
positive side effect ifthey ultimately helpto promote integration.

 INTEGRATED    WATERRESOURCESMANAGEMENT
 8.13    What do the four projects show about Vietnam's progress toward integrated water
resources management? First, that key players have a long way to go before they
 integrate. This was especially apparent inthe inlandwaterways and irrigation projects.
Agencies that should be talking to each other and planning ways to maximize synergies
are not yet at that point. Resource management i s sector based, and not only i s there little
 sign of interest inworking across sectors, only the Coastal Wetlands Project exhibited
interest inintegrating stakeholders and community social values. Knowing that
traditional water management approaches simply don't work inthe long term, as the
pressures on water resources from rapid urban growth and industrial development
continue to increase making the work o fthe WSCs ever more challenging, the cost of not
managing resources in an integrated way pose higheconomic, social and ecological costs
on communities and on the environments upon which they depend. Second, there i s still
greater emphasis and attention given to end o fpipe solutions than to managing the
watershed inways that will makethe delivery o f services easier next year. This i s one
area where the Coastal Wetlands Protection Project offers clear lessons to the other
studiedprojects. Water utilities are more concerned with gettingpollutants out o fthe
water they deliver thanthey are about stopping polluters. And around the major cities
new factories open at an alarming rate. The irrigation management companies running
the infrastructure created by the IRP project seem more concerned with providing
aquaculture with saline water than evaluating the impacts on soil and groundwater o f
bringingever more salty water inland.Decision-makingweighs water demand now more
heavily than identifying options to reduce threats inthe future. Third, the abolition o f
economic incentives to conserve and make services economically sustainable (use
charges and tariffs inline with costs) poses risk for water quality and river health going
forward, and increases the likelihood that conflicts over access to water will increase, and
this ina futurewhere climate variation looks likely to reduce supply.

8.14    Outside o f the projects, enlightened approaches to the management o f water
resources are beingformulated. The National Water Resources Strategy identifies all the
problems mentioned inthis report and many more. And it has begunbuildinga broad
consensus around corrective measures that will ensure a more environmentally
sustainable future. The Bank has worked well with the government on refining a strategic
approach. Reports such as the six volume series on Vietnam's infrastructure challenge
ensure that development community investments help the country to buildon a solid
foundation. And the partnershipo f the Government withthe broader donor community in
the Water Sector Review has ledto highlymeaningful, open, andtransparent
communication on key issues, andthe preparation o f a huge range of technical inputsthat
will inform actions going forward.

WATER SECTOR PROJECTSHAVE             NOTBEENREADYTOIMPLEMENT
8.15    A commonproblem, associated with the designo fthe four water-related projects
evaluated inthis report, i s that important aspects o f each project were not ready to
implementafter the loanwas approved. The IrrigationRehabilitationProjecthadnot
really gotten government ownership for the hiring o f (what were perceived as expensive)
international consultants. Thus there were delays inpreparingthe contract for the

                                                57


consultants, and ultimately the contract was signedmuch later thanplanned, delaying the
preparation o f biddingdocuments andbid evaluation procedures, O&M plans, the MIS
system and related financial management plans, the initiation of environmental
monitoring, to name a few.

8.16    The Coastal Wetlands Protectionproject was far less ready to implement.The
project was based on a reconnaissance o f the area that was five years out of date. When
reforestationwas about to commence, some areas that hadbeen covered by forest no
longer were, and other areas that had beendeforested hadbeen reforested thanks to the
government reforestation project. Evenmore problematic was the reliance on DANIDA
to fund critical staff, and the time that was lost waiting for the money to come on line and
the 500 positionsto be filled. Also, the government decision-making process is highly
sequential, so even though expeditious implementationwas clearly going to be contingent
on the hiringo f the consultants, it still took 14-15 months to hire the first international
consultants to updatethe project planningonce the money was there. This begs the
question o f why decision-making could not have commenced before the date funds were
be made available.

8.17    There are more examples. Inthe waterways project, important policy differences
betweenthe Bank andthe Borrower onthe eligibility o f state ownedenterprises to
participate incivil works contracts had not beenresolvedprior to Board approval and
reaching a workable agreement ledto unnecessary delays during implementation.
Further, during appraisal it had never beenresolvedwhat to do with massive quantities o f
spoil. Also inthe IWPRproject, a larger number o fpeople needed resettlement than
anticipated and there was a failure during appraisal to identify a mechanism for assessing
and paying compensation prior to project start-up.

8.18    Highlevel engagement is neededto find a way to move project preparation
further along and speed up implementation. It i s not clear based onjust one mission why
water projects are only appraised about 20 percent right up to the Board Approval date.
Butwhenthere is only a smallpackage ready to implementafter approval one might
expect urgentattentionto gettingactivities moving. When it takes two years to get
consultants on board to preparethe remaining 80 percent o f the project there arejust too
manyopportunities lost.

INFLATION CRISISAND THE SUSTAINABILITYOF SERVICES
8.19   The 2006 National Water Resources Strategy notes that:

        Theperception that water is an economic goodhas not beensufficiently
       incorporated into Vietnam s currentpolicy and mechanism, especially
       in economic and financial policies, to create internal forces and
       incentives for     sustainable development, to ensure reasonable
       exploitation and sufficient supply of water for sociev, as well as to
       encourage efJicient and effective uses of water to preserve water
       resources.

                                                58


8.20    Most governments struggle to impose user fees. Eliminating them where they are
politically well-accepted i s likely to result inthe re-imposition o f these charges being
fraught. Although the country was moving towards integrating user charges and fees to
support institutional, environmental, and service sustainability, the recent inflationary
spiral and the suspension o f most user charges for the use o f irrigationwater and river
transport, as well as the freezing o f urban water tariffs are quite an about-face. It i s
certainly the government's prerogative to subsidize desirable activities when it chooses to
do so. Political considerations apart, the impact o f the abolition of user charges on
environmental sustainability i s another dimension. Subsidized water for urban users
further strains existing supply and treatment problems, andthe removal ofincentives to
conserve water use inirrigated areas has several pernicious results includinghigher levels
o f agricultural chemicals that make their way to the rivers.

TAKEBETTERADVANTAGE THE EXPERIENCEPROJECTCHAMPIONS
                                OF                    OF
8.21    Within the projects reviewed by this assessmentthere was enormous unevenness
between project sites and implementation teams. Inthe Coastal Wetlands Protection
Project, reforestationactivities went best inCa Mau andperhaps worst inBac Lieu.
Resettlement and cultural support to the Khmer community seemed to go best inSOC
Trang. Technology transfer went well inTra Vinh and SOCTrang. Interms of the
managerial achievements o fthe different Water Supply Companies, Haiphong has greatly
outperformedthe others. This i s true to such a degree that it i s visited by in-country water
supply companies that did not participate inthe project, and it even consults
internationally. Reportedly, some o f the Irrigation Management Companies are quite
profitable and good at maintainingtheir infrastructure, while others are struggling. Based
on these experiences, the PPAR will take a guess that some stretches o fthe inland
waterway are better run, safer, and better maintainedthan others.

8.22    The development literature has a great deal to say about the potential impact o f
project champions. Although the Water Supply Project facilitated contacts between the
WSCs, inthe opinion o f this review, more systematic and intensive inter-visitation
between project teams and/or agencies and sponsored outreach by project champions like
Haiphong Water will pay tremendous dividends. Vietnam seems to be approaching a
point inthe water sector where international experience will not always be instructive. It
has muchto learn from its own best examples, and it may have as muchto teach to other
countries as to learn from them.

REDEFINING THE BANK'SCOMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE


8.23    When asked what they would do differently ifthe opportunity presented itselfto
do these projects over, staff were quite frank intheir discussions with the mission, and
several people were quite persuasive inproposing ways this type of work could be done
better inthe future. The gist o ftheir thoughts i s shared here because the mission found
themquite compelling.

8.24    One point that was raised quite often i s that the Bank should recognize the areas
where Vietnam i s entirely competent and it should adjust the way it works to take into

                                                  59


 account where things go better without its supervision and sometimes even without its
 support. Take the case o f mangrove reforestation. Leaving aside the social aspects o f the
 CWP project for a moment, which admittedly were its greatest achievements, it i s clear
 that without direct Bank support, Program 661 achieved five times more mangrove
 replantingthanthe project was able to do, inabout the sameperiod oftime. This PPAR
 does not evaluate Program 661,but a cursory look at the numbers certainly would lead
 one to wonder if,going forward, the Bank and the GoV might not be better off with the
 Bank providing budgetsupport for forestry. It could be arguedthat the community
 awareness, technology transfer, resettlement, small enterprise development, and cultural
 heritage work undertakenby the project are still highly challenging to GoV agencies, and
 that these activities provided the essential enablingenvironment for the reforestation. In
 the likely event that this is true, it would indicatethe nature and scale ofa reforestation
 support effort that would best be supported by a standard sector investment loan.

 8.25    Itwas notedabove that Vietnam is ontrack to achieve the MDGsinits urban
 areas but, by extension, progress inrural areas remains behindthat target, however, and
 development o fbasic rural water services has not kept pace with economic growth,
 leaving around one third o f the populationwithout adequate water suppliesandtwo thirds
o f the population without sanitation. One staff member notedthat urban water utilities
have a "monopoly on a good that everyone needs to buy." The point, really, was how
much longer will a country that can equitize Haiphong Water need World Bank support
for the provision o fpotable water to urbanconsumers? Probably not much longer. Bank
strategy might be to get out o f urbanwater supply reasonably quickly and to concentrate
on sanitation, environmental restoration, and perhaps rural water. For Vietnamto meet
the MDGs for both urban and rural water and sanitationby 2015 has been estimated at
$600 million annually, or about four times the investmento f the last 10 years.37A broad
approach to sanitation that provides low-tech, step by step improvements may be
preferable to highcost treatment plants inmost cities.

LESSONS
8.26    The projects' experience suggest the following lessons:

The achievementsof Bank-financed waterprojects in many subsectors are often
constrainedby environmentalproblems thatpre-dateproject appraisal. InVietnam it is
increasingly likely that projects that build water infrastructure will be called on to
perform environmental restoration as well as their core activities, ifthey are to have
sustainable outcomes. The four projects studied share certain characteristics. First and
foremost i s the nature o f their relationship to the environment. Whereas traditionally
Bankwater sector projectshadeither aninstitutional or infrastructurefocus or both, it is
becoming nearly impossible to avoid addressing environmental restoration and
environmentally related landuse questions inmany areas o f the country. InVietnam                .
(which i s not uniqueinthis respect) Bank-financed projects inmany sectors are
increasingly constrained by environmentalproblems that pre-date project appraisal. Inthe

four evaluated projects it was assumed that investmentsininfrastructure would overcome
what were inessence environmental problems. The project experience o fthe IRP, WSP,
Inland Waterways, and CWP projects showsjust how difficult it has become, even in
widely different subsectors focusing on highly divergent activities, to achieve anything
lasting without addressing the problems that have beencausedby an extended period o f
environmental neglect.

Environmental restoration is challenging because thepeople causing theproblem have
to becomepart of the solution. Ifall the mangroves have been destroyed it i s never
enoughjust to plant new ones: reforestationand forest protection have to address the
underlyingsocial causes of encroachment andprovide alternative sources o f income if
they hope to stop environmentally negative actions that produce income for the
malefactors. Conversely, addressing livelihood problems can have positive environmental
impacts   .

Waiting to confront major issues on which the Bank and borrower disagree until after
loan approval can lead to major delays, enormous costs, andforegone opportunities.
While there were other factors contributingto the early-stage delays identified inthis
report, resolving policy differences between Bank and Borrower before Board approval i s
perhaps the easiest to correct.
A common problem, associated with the design ofthe four water-related projects
evaluated inthis report, i s that important aspects o f each project were not ready to
implement after the loan was approved. Highlevel engagement i s needed to find a way to
move project preparation further along and speed up implementation.

When the economic incentivesshift, thepriorities of water serviceproviders willfollow
with negative effects on the environment. As users become accustomed to not paying
fees, service providers become accustomed to not thinking about them as clients.
Although the country was moving towards integrating user charges and fees to support
institutional and service sustainability, the recent suspension o f most user charges for the
use o f irrigation water and river transport, as well as the freezing o f urban water tariffs
are quite an about-face. Subsidized water for urban users further strains existingsupply
andtreatment problems, and the removal o f incentives to conserve water use inirrigated
areas has several pernicious results including higher levels o f agricultural chemicals that
make their way to the rivers, which are tapped for drinkingwater, and so on.

Water resources are dijjicult to manage efficiently and effectively when there is no
mechanismfor involved agencies to communicate, much less coordinate. The four
projects point to a number o f challenges which Vietnam needs to overcome to progress
towards integrated water resources management. First, that key players have a longway
to go before they integrate. Agencies that should be talking to each other and planning
ways to maximize synergies are not yet at that point. Second, there i s still greater
emphasis and attention givento end o f pipe solutions that increase the available supply
thanto managing the watershed inways that will make the delivery ofwater services
easier inthe next year and during those that follow. Water utilities are more concerned
with gettingpollutants out ofthe water they deliver than they are about stopping

                                              61


polluters. And around the major cities new factories open at an alarming rate. Third, the
abolition of economic incentives to conserve and make services economically sustainable
(use charges and tariffs in line with costs) poses risks for water quality and river health
going forward, and increases the likelihood that conflicts over access to water between
various user groups will increase; and this ina hture where climate variation looks likely
to reduce supply.
