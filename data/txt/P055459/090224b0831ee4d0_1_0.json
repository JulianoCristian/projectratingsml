Despite\n            unprecedented economic growth, India faces a big challenge\n            in fighting poverty. Educational opportunities and access\n            were uneven at best and marked by wide regional disparities.\n            In 2000, around 39 million children under the age group of 6\n            to 14 were not being schooled. In 2002, the International\n            Development Association financed Elementary Education\n            Project named Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), to enroll all 6\n            to 14-year-olds in school by 2010. Since 2001, the SSA has\n            supported government efforts to bring 20 million\n            out-of-school children into elementary education. It\n            includes learners from long -deprived communities and\n            minority communities, and children with special needs.\n            Universal access was almost achieved, with more than 98\n            percent of children having a primary school within one\n            kilometer of home and many states almost approaching\n            universal primary enrollment. A paradigm shift in teaching\n            methods was pioneered in Tamil Nadu. In just two years, the\n            activity-based learning method was scaled up across the\n            schools. Several states were adapting the innovations."}, "docdt": "2009-09-29T04:25:05Z"}
