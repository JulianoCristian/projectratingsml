Targets for\n            SSA are all 6-11 year old children to be in schools, or\n            alternative centers by 2003; all 6-11-year-olds to complete\n            five years of primary schooling by 2007; all 6-14-year-olds\n            to complete eight years of elementaryschooling by 2010;\n            elementary education to have satisfactory quality with\n            emphasis on education for life; to bridge all gender, and\n            social disparities in primary education by 2007, and in\n            elementary education by 2010; and, to reach universal\n            retention by 2010. SSA spans across several Five-Year Plan\n            periods, from 2001, and 2002, to 2008. The Project will 1)\n            establish, construct, and extend primary and upper primary\n            schools; provide training in social mobilization and\n            educational management; ensure salaries of teachers hired\n            under the program; and, support interventions to enroll\n            out-of-school children.

Finally, to improve quality,\n            teachers training will be provided, and,  school grants\n            available for repair and maintenance, materials and\n            equipment, as well as teacher grants for teaching and\n            learning materials will be financed."}, "docdt": "2004-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
