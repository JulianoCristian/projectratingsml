Between 1992/93\n            and 1998/99, net enrollment of the group of children aged\n            six to eight years increased from 68 percent to 82 percent\n            across the country. In rural areas, the net enrollment of\n            girls jumped from 55 percent to 76 percent, while that of\n            children as a whole increased from 72 percent to 84 percent.\n            Despite theseachievements, about 39 million children, or\n            about 21 percent of the group of six to 14 years, were the\n            school completion rate and the 5th grade was below the 78\n            percent national levelin 1999 and 2000. Large disparities\n            were common in all states and districts. Among other\n            activities, the government program funded by the innovative\n            initiatives were designed to encourage the attendance of\n            children to school, pay for more teachers,  give free\n            textbooks for girls and disadvantaged students, provide\n            teaching and learning materials, establishment of local\n            institutions to support schools and teachers, as well as\n            monitoring and evaluation. Several reports indicate that\n            quality improvement remains a challenge to be faced."}, "docdt": "2007-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
