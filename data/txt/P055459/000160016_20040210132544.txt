INTRODUCTION
Better design for cducatcnal infrastructure is a key thrust area under DPEP. The design of classrooms 1 schools i6, in fact,
the most important compfnert that needs interventions.
Traditionally. the echwoIs have been in the forrn of rectilinear boxes, reflecting very scant sensitivity to needs of the students
and the teachers. Hence, classes are usually hed in the open as it is a more comfortable environment than the school itself.
A school is probabty the first built environment that a child interacts with individuaIly, outsida her I his family's domain.
Therefore it is important that a school Is as comfortable and friendly as possible. both physiologically and psychologically. This
will help in ensuring that more students come forward and continue to remain in the education system.
The terms 'child- centred. 'activity- based'. 'user- friendly'. 'statc of the art' are usually stated as objectives of school I
classroom design. Unfortunately, there had becn little progress in translating these concepts into design-brief and thercaftcr
into designs.
Kerala was the first state to initiate a debate on the Issue. A workshop, in which policy-makers, cducationists, teachers and
architects participated, was organised in November. 1996. This was followed by a national level workshop on - Classroom
Design Criterion" at Delhi. attended by eminent educationists and architects. Several mectings were conducted in Madhya
Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa. The findings were more or less similar and served to orient both the client and
the consuitant to the needs of rural primary school I classroom.
The present document, - A GUIDE TO DESIGN FOR 5ETTER LEARNING ENVIRONMENT" is an attempt to collatc the findings
of all these workshops and present it in an explanatory manncr. The guidelines are by no means comprehensive or prcqcnptive.
It is envisaged that these guidelines will be enriched by the suggestions / comments I innovations proposed by persons
interested in this topic. particularly DPEF personnel. At this point it is important to stress the fact that locale specific
issues have not been included as they vary from state to state, though they must be considered.
Your comments and suggestions are welcom.c

CHALKBOARD
* Multigrade teaching implies different grades being taught by the samc teacher simultaneously. This
is practised because of dearth of teachers in the rural schools. At lea5t two chalkboards are
required in each class to facilitate this method of teaching.
*  Chalkboards  are also  required  for outdoor
classes or school notices. Light and mobile     xOl4LE
chalkboards are required which can easily be
transported in and out of the school.
*  Chalkboards nmay be provided at a lower level for
the childrcn's use.
.             ~~~~~CHI-LuveNr. IAC-F :
*  5ize and shape of chalkboard should be determined for their proper utilisation and convenience. A
1800 mm by 1200 mm (6 ft. by 4 ft.) board is generally recommcnded, the bottom being 600 mm (2
ft.) from the floor.
* Material is usually cement plaster. Colour of chalkboard is usually black, though green (using green
oxide) is preferred for psychological reasons and to reduce strain on the eyes.

FLOOR
Flooring is an important factor in 5chool design as a child subconsciously learns about various textures,
colours, patterns through the variety of floor used, visually and by touch.
It is important that choice of material for floor should conform to safety of children and the convenience
of maintenance. Hence, smooth finish for classroom floor is recommended.

Children prefer primary colours,.which may be used on the zxterior. However, community's decision should
be given high priority.
For the interior, white is recommended as this colour reflects light and increases the illumination level.

WALL DECOR
There are vacant external and internal wall surfaces which may be used for educational purposes.
* Students may be. encouraged to paint pictures from their science, geography or social science books,
which may be changed after some time and replaced with new ones.
IHPE SOLAK V(STEM _ImIEL'
*  Folk art should also be encouraged. The local artisans may be asked to display their skills on the wall
rby painting or decorating it, which helps in creating an awareness among the young children about
their traditional background.
FOR D15ABLED.
A little thought for the disabled children during design process of primary schools will make these
buildings more accessible to them.
A few simple things that will make movements easier for these children in school are -

DE5iGN OF. 5FACE5
The school should be functional. comfortable and attractive, so that both teachers and
students find it i-teresting.
In order to attain.such cnvironmcnt. guidelines regarding the following spaces may be considered
while designing primary schools.

CLA55ROOM
01. 5ize.
Classroom size depends on the number of students, activity patterns and type of furniture.
The optimum 5ize for a classroom of forty students in a teacher-centered teaching environment is at
least about 30 sq. m. ( 320 sq. ft.) The activity-based teaching method involves group activities,
and a classroom 5ize should be modified to satisfy the functional requirements.
The size of a classroom should be sufficient to accomodate storage of study materials and teaching
aids. For details, refer page no. 4
Though the objective of OPEP is to ensure 90% retention, at present the dropout level at second
standard is quite high. One option would be to design classrooms with flexible partitions. so that the
classroom size may be adjusted according to necessity, during the formative years of Universal
Elementary Education.

03. Ventilation
Venitlation is an important factor to be consicdered
for creating  comfortable  indoor conditions  in
classrooms . According to 15 8827:1975, level of         UNE   .                  V1/V2
ventilation in classrooms is six air changes per hour.
Ventilation level required in a classroom depends on the climate of a place and the time of the year.

04. illumination
According to 15 8827-1978, level of illumination at classroom de5k-top and chalkboard is 150 - 800 lux.
A general illumination level of 152 lux is recommended. At the same time, glare (i.e. unwanted light) should
be avoided.
The methods of achieving proper illumination of indoor spaces in buildings include:
* Making the window size about l1lOth of floor area. Window size implies only effective open surface --
- areas occupied by frames, shutter 5tyles and bars etc should be neglected.
*  Windows in room should be on two opposite       AICLA
walls to achieve uniform light in the interior.
*  Care should be taken 5o that there is no
glare from window shutters or chalkboards.

05. Accoustics
According to 15 &&27-1978, maximum acceptable noise level from external sources is 40 d3. The school
building itself should be located at a maximum possible distance from noisy roads (in cases where any
other site is not available ). If possible, the windows should not face the direction of source of noise.
*  Care must be taken while designing two adjoining ,                              LOW--HEV-T
classrooms so that noise from one does not reduce the
audibility level of the other.

5CHOOL BUILDING
Design of a school building implie5 integration of the classrooms, verandah5, teacher5'room and in some
cases,. toilets and kitchens to form a whole building.
* The teachers' room should be accessible from
the classrooms as well as from the entrance of
the school building.
* In multi- grade teaching method, a 5ingle teacher teaches two or more classes simultaneously. This is
easier with children of similar mental and physiological maturity. Hence, standards I and II form one
cluster while standards 111, IV and V form another. Classroom grouping has to be done accordingly.

5ITE PLANNING
In order to design a 6uccessful and workable institution, the functional relationship among the various
buildings and the open 6pacc5 have to be satisfied.
Guidelines for site planning have been described under the following heads:
Layout: general
school building
services
balwadi
open space
Landscape
5oundary
Miscellaneous
The section ends with a chccklist for the designers.

LAYOUT: GENERAL
A design of primary 5chool 5hould be prepared with the following and indicated on the master
plan:
5CHOOL bUILDING         Five cla55rooms with verandahs and spill over areas
One teachere' room
5ERVICE5                Toilets

Kitchen and 5tore (optional)
DALWADI (optional)
OPEN 5PACE               5emi-open space for outdoor teaching etc.
Open space for games, assembly etc.
* Layout of the spaces on a site ehould be such that they create a sequence ( hierarchy of
space) which begin5 with the entrance and the most public parts, then leads into the slightly
more private areas and finally to the most private domains.

The buildings have to be properly oriented to ensurc comfortable indoor conditions without the use of
energy intensive technical devices.
In hills, where the temperature can be low, sun
penetration is welcome to heat up the classrooms.
In hot dry areas with strong winds and dust-storms,
the courtyard layout plan will be appropriate. creating
protected enclosed spaces.
In warm- humid tropical areas, the sun should bc
excluded from penetrating the windows by facing      f                       g
the building North-5outh.Ventilation is essential
and the layout plan should allow for the prevailing
winds to flow into and around the building.

LAYOUT: 5CHOOL BlJILDING
*  The school building should be preferably located in the semi-public zone of the site. There should be
enough space all around the building to allow proper illumination and ventilation In the interior. Refer
page no. 14, 15 for details.
*  The entire school building is usually not built at once. Initially, only two or three classrooms with
adjoining verandahs and spill over areas may be constructed and. the rest may be completed in
phases. Choice between vertical and horizontal expansion depends on local norms and availability of
land.

Toilet is an essential requirement in a primary school in order to ensure the enrollment and retention of
rtudento (especially girls). For design of toilet6, refer page no. 22.
*  Toilets may be attachea to the school building, or separated from it by a buffer zone. The privacy of
the entrance to the toilets must be considered in either case. Avoid designing the toilet as a isolated
unit, as this hampers mainttenance.

maintenance. The drainage and waste disposal may be through septic tanks, soak pits etc. in places
where a sewer line is not available. These have to be located so as not to contaminate wells and
ground water.           _                WA"

BOUNDARY
Dounrdary of a school must be defined to create a sense of cnclosure and ensure safety. It also helps to
prevent encroachment of land at a later stage.
The height of fencing may be low to simply provide a psychological definition of school premises, unless
constrained by local condition5 like safety from wild animals.

A  primary school consists of built up areas like classrooms, teachers' room, toilets etc. and open
spaces for assembly, cultural activities, sports & outdoor teaching etc.
The size of the site is determined on the basis of built up areas and open spaces and it is preferable
to have a site size of one acre, as illustrated below. However, the site can be bigger or smaller
depending on requirements of school and availability of land in the locality.

CONCLU510N
A prnmary school plays an important role In shaping the minds of young children. The claseroom itscif, along with the built
environment of the school and Its immedlate surrounding as a whole, should be designed for this purpose.
In addition to such functional and psychological requirements, a school building should also be contextual. Context means the
local materials and resources available, the climate, topography, social and cultural background of a particular place. The
design and technology selected for a school should conform to these local conditions.
Moreover, a school should not be dseigned for it. appearance on the Inaugural day. but for Its looks after a period of time.
This implies that proper maintenance should be ensured. This can be facilItated by a good design.
Thus a primary school is a consequence of a hollistic approach from Its starting point.
The present book is a guide to the functional and psychological requirements of a -mary xhool and the related design
features. This should be read In conJunction with the data of resource mapping and books on cost-effective technologies and
maintenance;

CLIMATIC CONSIDERATION5 IN PRIMARY 5CHOOL DE51GN IN INDIA
Suilding (Including school) design and techniques have been developed over many centuries in all climatic zones - the aim being
to provide more or less comfortable Indoor conditons wlthout the use of energy-intensive technical devices. One can benefit
from certain climatic featurcs and overcome those that are less favourable, merely by means of appropriatc bullding shapes.
location & orientaUon. Additional celments, like vegetation and water. may also be integrated into the design to improve
microclimatic conditons.
5ince different iocations within large areas have very similar climatic characteristics. these can be grouped together to form
a more or less accurately defined climaUtc zone, within which the climatic design requirements for buildings are generally the
same, with minor differences only due to local environmental conditions.
India has six such climatic zones viz. hot-dry, warm-humid, moderate, cold-cloudy, cold-sunny and composite, as shown in
the following figure
