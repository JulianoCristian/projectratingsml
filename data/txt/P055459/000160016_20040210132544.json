This report identifies probable\n            environmental issues and impacts and comprises various\n            manuals, documents, and guidelines that have been\n            disseminated to the states to address such issues. The\n            salient theme is: community participation in planning and\n            construction ensures that implementation is free from\n            potential environmental hazards. Site selection will\n            consider the location's vulnerability to natural\n            hazards (flooding, cyclone, earthquakes); ensure buildings\n            are designed according to code, for disaster prevention;\n            prefabricated school structures will be dismantled and\n            shifted to new location to avoid flooding; and some schools\n            are designed to double up as shelters. Facility related\n            impacts include locating water facility to avoid\n            waterlogging, reusing wastewater to flush toilets or water\n            plants; rain water harvesting; using toilets designed on the\n            twin pit system; and alternatively, using septic tanks only\n            where the water table is very low and there is a\n            contamination risk. Encourage hedges and green fencing as\n            environmentally-friendly options for school boundaries.\n            Address basic site management  issues such as reducing\n            wastage, ensuring safety, avoiding damage to flora and\n            fauna, restricting air and noise pollution, and work\n            scheduling. Choose school construction materials that avoid\n            potentially hazardous materials like asbestos and minimally\n            deplete natural resources. Use alternate technologies like\n            rat trap bond wall, filler slab roof, and stub foundations,\n            and promote less energy-intensive alternatives that are\n            maintainable, replicable, and durable like stabilized mud\n            block, fly ash brick, brick corbelled structures, etc."}, "docdt": "2004-01-19T00:00:00Z"}
