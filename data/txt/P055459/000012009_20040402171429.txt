A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Country and SectorIssues

 1.     India, a country of over abillion people with aper capita GDP of $515,' has made
remarkable progress in poverty alleviation and education. The incidence of poverty
declined from 45 percent in the 1980sto 36 percent in the 1990sand to 26 percent in the
early 2 0 0 0 ~Between 1992/93 and 1998/99, net enrollment of the 6-to-10-year-olds
                 ~
increased from 68 to 82 percent across the nation. Much of the enrollment expansion in
the 1990s was attributable to improved access, especially for girls and rural ~hildren.~
The number of out-of-school 6-to-14 year-olds declined from 39 million in 1999 to 25
million in 2003. About 160 million children were enrolled in elementary education
(Grades 1-8)in 2002.4

2.      In spite of these remarkable achevements, India accounts for one-quarter of the
world's 104 million out-of-school chldren.'        Despite further improvement in the
enrollment of 6 to 11 year old children since 1998/99, overall 13 percent of children in
the 6 to 14 age grou are still out-of-school. Grade 5 completion rates are also under 70
percent nationwide!    In addition, 27 million 6-year-olds have to be absorbed by the
system every year, which is more than the number who leave the sy~tem.~Wide-ranging
disparities remain across states and districts. For example, in 1998/99,the net primary
enrollment ratios ranged from 63 percent in Bihar to 98 percent in Kerala. Grade 5
completion rates varied from 64 percent in West Bengal to 94 percent in Himachal
Pradesh for boys, and 43 percent in Rajasthan to 98 percent in Kerala for girls. Children
of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) are less likely to enroll in and
complete elementary education. Quality of elementary education is uneven across states,
districts and sub-districts. Student and teacher absenteeism remains high. Insufficient
public and household financial resources, social inequality, uneven capacity and
insufficient accountabilityconstrain effortsto improvethe system and outcomes. (Annex
1).

3.      The Government of India (GOI) is deeply committed to universalization of
elementary education of satisfactory quality by 2010.           The 86th Constitutional
Amendment (2002) makes elementary education a fundamental right of every chld. To
provide a comprehensive policy and budgetary framework for achieving this goal, GO1
launched the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), which is a National Program for Universal
Elementary Education' (UEE). Its goal is consistent with the Millennium Development
Goal (MDG) for education and goes beyond it, covering 8 years of elementary education
in a tighter timeframe. (Annex 4).

2. Rationale for Bank Involvement

4.      The reasons for supporting SSA are compelling. First, the Bank and other
development agencies have supported the GOI's District Primary Education Program
(DPEP), through eight projects, on which the SSA builds.           The Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy for India (CAS, 2001) highlights the achievements of DPEP and
recommends its scaling up. The CAS progress report (2003) commits the Bank to
supporting SSA, aligning its development objectives with the GOI's. Continuity of
                                             1

support would ensure the broadening and deepening of policy reform and development
impact. Second, SSA is technicallysound. Owned by the GOI, it is designed for a large
federal system, with a decentralised framework for service delivery and a built-in
accountability mechanism at the school and community levels. The SSA pays special
attention to gender and social equity and inclusive education. The emphasis on quality
reinforces the dnve to improve access, efficiency and equity (Section D2 and Annex 4).
Third, achieving SSA goals would not only realize the GOI's development objectivesbut
also help to meet the global MDG for education by enrolling one-quarter of the world's
out-of-school chldren.

5.      In addition to providing financial resources, the Development Partners [United
Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID); European Commission
(EC); and International Development Association (IDA), subsequently referred to as
Partners in this document] would add value as follows: (i) By supporting the
strengtheningof the feedback system already being used by GO1 for continuous review
of program design and implementation, the Central Government, states and districts can
make better decisions regarding the allocation of financial resources and adjustment of
policy and practices. The development of mechanisms to assure cross-state and cross-
district observation, dialogue, and learning for program refinement could be among
SSA's most enduring features. (ii) The Partners would be able to contribute to the
technical support to the ongoing SSA program, especially in strengtheningareas such as
student assessment, financial management, procurement, tribal development planning,
and environmental management. (iii) Recognition of the need for prioritization of
resources, while retaining the focus on quality and the challenges of uneven capacity
across states and districts would lead to the development of a more robust monitoring
mechanism, for identifying issues and delivering strategic support in a timely manner.
(iv) The Partners would enrich the national technical resource base by drawing attention
to national and international best practices. (v) The project pioneers the Sectonvide
Approach (SWAp) in India, in the hope that it will provide a model for more effective
development assistancefor other sectorsin the country.

3. Higher Level Objectives to which the Project Contributes

6.      The Project would: (a) assist GO1 in its efforts to attain its goals of universal
elementary education, and (b) support educational development that contributes to
participativeeconomicgrowth andpoverty alleviation.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lending Instrument

7.      The proposed instrument is a Sector Investment Credit (SIC) for which the
Partners will pool funds with GO1to support SSA through a SWAp. The Partners will
agree on their financial contribution to the program and rely on GOI's own rules and
procedures to implement the program. The GO1 and Partners will use a common
reporting format for expenditures. GO1will provide audited accountsto the nodal partner
and GO1 will also provide information on implementation progress and impact of SSA
activities, based on India's own information systems at different levels of government.
                                           2

The SWAP is chosen because it would honor GO1 ownership, facilitate Partner
harmonization, strengthen sectoral management capacity, and reduce the transaction
costs, comparedwith a traditional SIC.

2. ProjectDevelopment Objectivesand Key Indicators

8.       GOI's targets for SSA are: (i) all 6-11 year old children to be in schools or
alternative centers by 2003; (ii) all 6-11-year-olds to complete five years of primary
schooling by 2007; (iii) all 6-14-year-olds to complete eight years of elementary
schoolingby 2010; (iv) elementary education to have satisfactoryquality with emphasis
on education for life; (v) to bridge all gender and social disparities in primary education
by 2007 and in elementary education by 2010; and (vi) to reach universal retention by
2010. SSA spans across several Five-YearPlan periods: from the last year of the 9thPlan
(2001), to the lothPlan (2002-07) and the 1lthPlan (2008-12).

9.       The Development Partners' long-term objectives are aligned with the SSA goals.
This project covers the remaining years of the lothPlan (2004-2007). Given that 25
million children were out of school in 2003, the GOI's SSA targets will be stretchedout.
The developmentobjectives of this project are as follows:

  (0  To reduce out-of-school childrenby at least 9 million in the 6 to 14age group, with
      an increase in enrollment,in the process of universalizingelementary education;
 (ii) To narrow existinggender and socialgaps so that enrollment of girls will be near
      parity with boys, enrollment of children of SC and ST will be near paritywith that
      of the other groups; and enrollmentof children with disabilitywill increase;and
(iii) To enhancethe qualityof educationof all elementaryschool studentsso that
      learningwill be improved and transitionrates from primary education(Grades 1-5)
      to upper primary education (Grades 6-8)will increase.

10.     The beneficiaries are the 9 million out-of-school children and all children in the
school system. The key indicatorsare as follows:

        The number of chldren in and out of school;
        The number of childrenin and out of schoolby gender, SC, ST;
        Transitionrate fromprimaryto upper primary; and
        Studentachevement in languageand mathematics in Grades 3,5 and 7/8.

11.     The project would be considered satisfactoryif the above targets of reduction in
out of school childrenby 9 million and progress in gender and social parity are acheved;
it would be considered highly satisfactory if all development objectives are met and the
agreed targets are exceeded. The Bank would consider support to SSA with a second
credit, if requested by the GOI, contingent on effectiveimplementation and the outcomes
of this project.

3. Project Components

12.     SSA is a centrally sponsored scheme (CSS) designed to operate in a large federal
system in which the states are responsible for providing and financing elementary
                                            3

education. The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) provides (i) clear,
time-bound targets; (ii) a coherent fkamework for their achievement through norms for
planning and costing;and (iii) additional resources to achievethe targets. The targets and
norms for planning and costs ensure that the districts with the greatest needs have the
largest claims for resources. State governments articulate their commitment to UEE
through a process of needs assessment and planning, and by matching Central
Government allocations with state funds in a cost sharing ratio of 75:25 during the loth
Plan period. SSA envisages total involvement of communities in implementation,
monitoring of quality, and social audit, involving elected representatives in local self-
governments, school management committees, parent-teacher associations, mothers'
committees, and other stakeholders.

13.     Planning begins at the levels of village and urban ward, is aggregated at the
district level. State plans cover activities at the state level only. States' and districts'
annual work plans, which are guided by long-term perspective plans on how to achieve
UEE between 2001 and 2010, are appraised by the Project Approval Board, which is
convened by MHRD. The Central Government allocates the budget which is released to
the states to fund the plans. There is also a national component covering training,
capacity building, technical support, monitoring and evaluation, financial management,
dissemination, and media campaigns. Because the scope of interventions and resource
requirements vary across states, districts, and sub-districts, and also from year to year,
project activities will respond to changing circumstances in order to best meet the
development objectives. The project, therefore, is unlike a traditional investment credit
with predefined components and associated ex-ante allocation of finance (Annex 4).
Instead, the project will finance states' and districts' annual work programs and the
national component, covering the following categories of activity, in additional to
supportingprogram management and monitoring and evaluation:

  (0    To move towards UEE:
     a  Establishment,constructionand extensionof primary and upper primary schools;
     a  Provisionof training in socialmobilization and educational management;
     a  Payment of the salaries of teachers hred under the program; and
     a  Interventionsto enroll out-of-schoolchildren.

(ii)    To narrow existinggender and social gaps:
     a  Provision of fkee schooltextbooks to girls and studentsfrom scheduled castes and
        scheduledtribes;
    a   Specialschoolsand facilities for girls, including residential schoolsand toilets;
    a   Hiring of femaleteachers to aim at paritywith male teachers; and
    a   Provision of grants to districtsto support studentswith disability.

(iii)   To improvequality:
    a   Provision of training for new and continuing teachers;
    a   School grants for repair and maintenance, and for materials and equipment;

4. LessonsLearned andReflectedin the Project Design

14.     SSA builds on the experiences of a series of past CSSs, for example, Operation
Blackboard,Mid-day-MealScheme (MDM), Teacher Education and externallysupported
projects like Lok Jumbish Project (People's Movement), the Mahila Samakhya (MS)
(Program for Women Empowerment), and perhaps the most comprehensivebefore SSA,
the District Primary Education Projects (DPEPs). Several new CSSs will also be
incorporated into SSA, namely, National Program for Education of Girls at the
ElementaryLevel (NPEGEL) and Kasturba Gandhi Swatantra Vidyalaya (KGSV), which
builds special schoolsfor girls in areaswith low female literacy.

15.     The Bank's engagement in elementary education began in 1993 with Uttar
Pradesh (UP) Basic Education Project, whch had achieved highly satisfactoryoutcomes.
It became the precursor of a follow-on Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Project and eight
DPEP projects (DPEP I, 11,111,Uttar Pradesh DPEP 111,Rajasthan DPEP I & 11,Andhra
Pradesh Economic Restructuring Project (APERP), and Gujarat DPEP). Other
Development Partners -- DflD, EC, Government of Netherlands, and UNICEF --
cofinance DPEPs with IDA. The total IDA for the 8 DPEP projects amounts to $1.34
billion, complemented by Partners' commitment of $866 million, and the states'
contribution of $192million. Collectively, these DPEP projects have covered nearly half
of the 600 districts in 18 of the 28 states, focusing on districts with female literacy rates
below the 1991national average. (Annex2).

16.     These projects have contributed to increased enrollment and primary completion
rates in participating districts; other non-DPEP districts also showed gains but with less
progress towards increased completion. DPEP shows that the following strategies are
important to stimulate demand for quality education: (i) decentralization of educational
management and oversight through partnership with the Village Education Committee
(VEC), Panchayat Raj (local self-government) institutions, women's groups, other non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), and school management committees; (ii) use of
national, state, and district level apex organizations in educational planning, research,
training, and management to support capacity building; (iii) teachers' resource centers at
the Block and Cluster levels that provide on-site support to teachers for improvingquality
and makmg the pedagogy more child-centered; (iv) State Implementation Societies
(SISs), whch are autonomous legal entities, for effective implementation. DPEP has
built the foundation of the monitoring and evaluation system and state-basedassessment,
which will be strengthenedand extendednationwide under SSA. (Annexes4 and 6).

17.     SSA builds on DPEP, but differs in the following aspects. SSA has nationwide
coverage, encompassingmost of the previously discrete CSSs under a singleprogram. It
is complemented by the other CSSs, such as MDM and revamped Teacher Education
Scheme. SSA extends universal enrollment from primary (Grades 1-5)to upper primary
education (Grades 6-8) and focuses on school completionat both levels. While in DPEP,
central share was funded entirelyby external partners and the states' contribution was 15
percent, in SSA, there is a substantial and growing contribution from the Central
Government acrossPlan periods.

5. AlternativesConsidered and Reasons for Rejection

18.    SSA is the only national program designed to achieve and go beyond the
education MDG. The Partners'judgment is that this program will lead to results on the
ground. In this national program that covers 28 states, 7 union territories (UTs) and some
600 districts, the conventional contract-based disbursement arrangement is not suitable.
SWAP was adopted because it integrates the "project" into the regular education system
and ensures institutionalsustainability.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. PartnershipArrangements

19.    The World Bank, DfID and EC appraised the project jointly, and will be pooling
their funds to support the program. Of the $3.5 billion total project cost, GO1 will
contribute 45 percent, Partners 30 percent and states 25 percent (Table 7.3, Annex 7).
Within the external pool of $1.046 billion, IDA will provide 48 percent, Dm> 33 percent
and EC, 19 percent. The Partners have agreed with GO1 on common technical and
financial indicators as well as reporting formats, relying on GO1monitoring and reporting
systems, which will be strengthened wherever required.               A Memorandum of
Understandinghas been agreed among the Partners and GO1to guide interaction amongst
themselves in support of SSA. The Partners will join GO1in reviewing implementation
twice a year. EC's proposal for capacitybuildinghas been reconfirmed.

2. Institutional and ImplementationArrangements

20.    SSA is designed and owned by GOI. The National Mission chaired by the Prime
Minister, sets policy and exercises oversight. State legislatures through State Missions
chaired by the Chief Minister, and the District Committees, chaired by the District
Collector, Magistrate, or Chief Executive Officer of the District Panchayat, perform the
equivalent function at their respective levels. The Department of Elementary Education
and Literacy (DEEL) of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) issues
norms and guidelines, appoints appraisal teams, convenes Project Approval Board (PAB)
meetings to appraise state and district plans, and organizes technical support groups to
enhance capacity and address emerging issues. The Education Department of state
governments and district governments, working with State Implementation Societies
(SISs), which are legal, autonomous entities, ensure implementation on a daily basis.
Stakeholders at the levels of school and community under the broad umbrella of the
Panchuyati Raj, NGOs and the private sector also play key roles in program delivery and
oversight. (Annex 6).

3. Monitoring and Evaluationof Outcomes

21.    SSA has a community-based monitoring system and is subject to independent
research and supervision by autonomous research institutions at the state level, with 93
percent of monitoring resources targeted to sub-national institutions. In addition, the
apex institutions, National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and
National Institute for Education Planning and Administration (NIEPA), have developed a

                                             6

framework for monitoringprogram results. During the preparationphase, key indicators
were agreed, and baseline measures for most indicators have been collected, using
existingdata collectionsystems and special sample surveys. (Annex 3).

22.     The key indicators are: (i) the number of children in and out of school; (ii) the
number of children in and out of school by gender, SC, and ST; (iii) transition rate from
primary to upper primary; and (iv) student achievement in language and mathematics in
Grades 3, 5 and 7/8. Data would be disaggregatedcompiled by formal and alternative
schools; by state and district; and by public, grant-in-aid and recognized private (un-
aided) schools, whenever possible. Due to the short project duration, improvement in
achievement may not be demonstrable, and intermediate indicators such as pupil-to-
teacher ratios, and student and teacher attendance would be used. The thrust and
direction which the project would promote in implementation would be towards
improving quality of service delivery with a view to achieving the above developmental
objectives. In addition, special studies will be conducted to assess the quality of
education as and when required, which could cover aspects such as time-on-task,
determinantsof achievement,and cost-effectivenessof interventions.

23.     Joint Review Missions (JRM)). The Partners will join GO1 and the designated
SSA monitoring institutions to review project implementation semi-annually in January
and July, as per terms of reference agreedbetween the GO1and the Partnersprior to each
JRM. In January, the JRM would (i) review district plan approvals and GO1 budget
allocations; (ii) visit selected districts in 8-10 states to review progress in overall
implementationincluding financial management, procurement and safeguard issues; (iii)
estimate financial contribution of the Partners; and (iv) identify any studies to be
undertaken in the following six months.          The July mission would carry out a
comprehensive review of information received on (i) annual progress on agreed
indicators in terms of compiled EMIS data and other data sources; (ii) FMRs, audited
accounts and GO1 budget allocations for SSA against expenditures; and (iii)
implementation of safeguard policies. The mission will also study quarterly reports fiom
monitoring agencieswhich are expected to provide more qualitative information and any
research studies that may have been undertaken. The field visit will focus more on the
states lagging behind. Mission participants will be from GOI, EC, DflD and the Bank.
GO1 will provide the coordination and leadership. Fifty percent of the persons in the

2006 will constitute the mid-term review by the Partners. (Annex 3).
JRMwill be fiom GO1andthe otherhalf amongthe three agencies. TheJRM inJanuary

4. Sustainability

24.     Long-term sustainability of SSA will depend on three key factors: (i) that it is
based on national consensus; (ii) that necessary financial resources are available; and (iii)
that there is sustained demand and the institutional arrangements are in place. The SSA
currentlymeets all three criteria.

25.     The 86thConstitutionalAmendment making elementary education a hdamental
right of every child has ensured a significant level of political commitment across all
parties. Subsequent legislation will strengthen the political imperative to uphold this
right and securelong-termfinancialcommitmentfrom the Center and the states. GO1has
                                             7

demonstratedits commitment to elementary educationby increasingits financingten-fold
between 1993and 2003. This has resulted in a rapid expansionof primary education and
narrowing of gender and rural/urban gap in enrollment. India has witnessed a growing
demand for basic education over the past decade, in part fostered by the gains of the
DPEP and other initiatives targeting marginalized groups and areas. Linked to the
Constitutional Amendment, the public pressure for schooling is likely to increase. SSA
involves the community from planning to implementation and oversight. It also fosters
partnership with NGOs for community capacity development, and establishment of
alternative education centers. Transparency and the right to information are features of
SSA's thrust for community ownershp. All these factors are expected to contribute to
the program's sustainability.

5. Credit Conditionsand Covenants

        There is no conditionof effectiveness. The covenantsare as follow:

     Central Governmentwill maintain financial commitment in real terms to the level
     of FY2002/03in elementary education; and cause the Project States to maintain
     their financialcommitment in real terms to the level of FY1999-2000with their
     contributionto SSA, over and abovethis commitment;
     The Project will be implemented by GOI, the Project States and State
     Implementation Societies (SISs) in accordance with the "SSA Framework of
     Implementation";
     Financial management and procurement will be carried out in accordance with the
     "Manual on FinancialManagement and Procurement";
     GO1will provide the Annual Procurement Plan and carry out procurement audits,
     and the Development Partners reserve the option of post review of contracts, in
     consultationwith GOI;
     GO1will ensure that (a) financial records are maintained, (b) semi-annual financial
     management reports (FMRs) are delivered within 90 days of close of the half year,
     (c) the ConsolidatedReport on Audits is delivered within nine months after the end
     of the GO1 fiscal year, and (d) the individual state audit reports are provided upon
     request;
     GO1 will provide evidence of progress on agreed indicators and undertake
     evaluation studies agreed during the Joint Review Missions (JRMs) and the January
     2006 JRM will constitutethe Mid-term Review;
     GO1will implementthe agreed Tribal Development Plan; and
     GO1will ensureno involuntaryresettlement.

6. CriticalRisks and Possible ControversialAspects

27.     SSA enjoys wide public support and is non-controversial. Risks exist but are
unlikely to derail the program. The SWAP would continue to improve capacity during
implementation. The EC's 10 million Euro for a Technical Assistance program would
provide resources to support capacitybuilding. Nonetheless, a national program of such
a scale using SWAP is the first of its kind, and until a track record is firmly established,
the overall risk rating is "substantial". (Table 1).

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and Financial Analysis

28.     Cost-BenefitAnalysis. This analysis covers onlythe project period from 2004 to
2007. For the costs streamthe analysis used (i) a project cost of US$3.5 billion (financed
by Center and State contributions and external funds); (ii) private, direct costs of
schoolingincurred by households; and (iii) the opportunitycosts of earnings foregoneby
children going to school. For the benefits stream it used (i) increased life-time earnings
of workers who have higher levels of educational attainment; and (ii) increased
productivity as a result of SSA's quality-enhancing interventions. The number of
beneficiaries are aligned with the project development objectives. An internal rate of
return (IRR)of 22.4 percent was obtained assuming an unemployment rate of 5 percent,
showing that this public investment would be highly profitable. Sensitivity analyses

to 21.1 percent. This IRR is based on the assumption that primary and upper primary
found that even with a higher unemployment rate of 12percent, the IRRgoes down only
school completion rates will rise over their hstorical level as a result of SSA's quality
interventions. (SeeAnnex 9, Table 9.1 for net present value and internal rates of return).

29.     Financial SustainabilityAnalysis. In 2002 India spent around 4.3 percent of its
GDP on education ($17.8 billion), which is above the 3 percent average for low-income
countries. Forty-two percent of total public spending on education went to elementary
education ($7.5 billion). The provision and financing of elementary education is mainly
the responsibility of the states, which account for 85 to 90 percent of the total spending
on elementary education. The Centerprovides the remainder through its CSSs. SSA is a
single line item in both the Central and the states' budgets. Ths project provides 7.2 to

                                             10

9.4 percent of additional financing per year to total elementary education spending in the
country.

30.     The analysis of the fiscal sustainability of SSA focuses on how large the
incremental recurrent costs (salaries, books, teaching materials, school grants, training
etc.) would be as a share of the states' total recurrent expenditure on elementary
education. Since civil works are capped at 33 percent of the cost per plan and
management costs at 6 percent, and the Education Guarantee Scheme and various
transitional strategieswith high unit costs (such as residential schools)will be phased out
as more children are main streamed, it is assumed that 50 percent of the total program
costs will be incremental recurrent costs. Even if the economy grows at 5 percent per
annum in real terms up to 2024 (whch is a conservative assumption, compared with the
Bank's projection of 6 percent per annum)and public spending on elementary education
also grows at the same rate, the incremental recurrent cost to be absorbed by the states
afier the end of the llthPlan period in 2012 would be about 5 percent of the total state
expenditure on elementary education. SSA should therefore be financially sustainable in
the long run. Nonetheless, a few states having higher deficits and large numbers of out-
of-school children may have difficultymatching SSA allocations from the Center if they
experience economic downturns. Close monitoring by the Center is needed to minimize
delays in program implementation.

2. Technical Analysis

31.     SSA pursues strategiesto address the supply and demand constraints to universal
enrolment and completion of elementary education that are similar to the Education for
All (EFA) plans in other countries in South Asia, and in East Asia, Latin American and
the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Ahca. Designed for a large federal
system, SSA is far greater in scale. It allows for flexible strategies that can address a
variety of challenges in a complex, decentralized environment. In addition to achieving
the quantitativetargets of D E , it aims to improve system efficiencyand effectivenessby
building accountability at the school and community levels. It has a strong focus on
equity for vulnerable and marginalized groups-girls, SCs, STs,childrenwith disabilities
and other chldren in difficult circumstances. It emphasizes quality by improving the
conditions for learning and begins to measure achievement nationwide. As parents enroll
their chldren and keep them in school only if they learn something of value, the
emphasis on quality complements the drive to improve access, efficiencyand equity.

3. Fiduciary

32.     Financial Management. The program is implemented primarily by the states
through SISs, and frundedjointly by Central and state governments in a cost sharingratio
of 7525. Expenditures include building new classrooms/other amenities, provision of
free textbooks, salaryto additional teachers, andbringing about quality educationthrough
training provisions and aids for teachers. Between 65 to 85 percent of the expenditure is
incurred at the sub-districtlevel.

33.     The SSA's FM system builds on existing GO1 and state financial procedures, as
well as on the experience of DPEP. As many as 18 states and nearly half of the 600

                                             11

districts nationwide are familiar with Bank procedures since they have participated in
DPEP. SSA, which commencedin September2001, extends the FM systemto the rest of
the country and aims to put in place many of the systems,processes, checks and balances
considered to be good practice from past experience. This also includes systems in
budgeting/planningand recording of financialinformation. Some significantweaknesses
however, exist: (a) the number and quality of staff at district and sub district levels are
often variable and insufficient; (b) sometimes there are delays in preparation and
consequent approval of Annual Plans which could lead to a slowing down of
implementation; (c) the flow of funds through the multiple layers of the program is not
always timely; and (d) there are frequently delays in audit reports - for example, Audit
Reports for 11 out of the 21 states due under SSA had not been received by MHRD by
the due date. The mitigating measures have been reported in the table on risk ratings
(Table 1).

34.     A detailed Financial Management Capacity Assessment of the program was
carried out. Weaknesses were identified in the system of budgetary control, funds flow
arrangements, and accounting. While GO1has taken a number of steps to improve the
quality of financial management, further effort is required in terms of an ongoing FM
capacity assessment exercise whch could use, using indicators to track progress, and
developing and implementing of a training plan for staff responsible for finance and
accounts functions. GO1has initiated action on these and the same are documented in the
Framework pages 31-32 and "FM and Procurement Manual" paragraphs 2.1-2.2, 83 and
Annex XIII.

35.     Separate Bank Accounts are maintained at all levels (state, district and sub-
districts, including Block Resource Centers, Cluster Resource Centers, and Village
Education Committees) for receipt and expenditure of the program funds. Based on the
approved District Annual Work Plan, funds are released by GO1to the SISs twice a year
which also take into account the approved outlays of the Plans, cash flow forecasts and
reported expenditure. SISs transfer funds to districts on a quarterly basis with adequate
control over their expenditureand balances. Districts transfer fundsto sub-district levels
more frequently (having varying norms for civil works and other expenditure) but also
with adequatecontrolover their expenditureand balances.

36.     Audits of SISs are conducted by a firm of Chartered Accountants selected under a
standard criteria. Audits are on an annual basis as per specific Terms of Reference
(TOR). These audits cover all state/district and sub-districtoffices on a sample basis. In
addition to the statutory audit, GO1 has also instituted an annual Concurrent Financial
Review of a sampleof program states each year. Ths will provide GO1with information
on effectivenessof the financialmanagement arrangementswithin the program.

37.     GO1is appointing a Director (Finance)with full time responsibility for the entire
SSA program. He/she will be adequately supported by GO1 staff. Technical support
group consultants will provide additional support on FM to states and GOI. GO1 has
issued guidelines for staffing of the Finance and Accounts and Internal Audit function at
the state/district levels. The guidelines provide for a ControllerFinance at the state level
supported by a team of five persons, and a Finance and Accounts Officer at the district
level, supportedby a team of three persons.
                                             12

38.     Disbursement. Disbursement will be made against Eligible SSA Expenditures
incurred at the school, community, subdistrict, district, state and national levels. (For
disbursementarrangements,seeAnnex 7, paragraphs 7.29to 7.34).

39.     Procurement. Under SSA, all procurement (such as civil works, teaching
materials, textbooks, computers and consultant services) is expected to be conducted
following the GOI's and the States' procurement rules and procedures. The Partners
carried out an assessment of the procurement procedures in the states of Haryana, Punjab
and Tamil Nadu and have shared the findings with MHRD. These states, selected in
agreement with the MHRD and the Partners, represent 10 percent of the student
population. Based on the findings of the Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR), State Procurement Assessment Reports (SPAR) and assessment of the three
states, the Partners concur with the GO1that the existingprocurement legal framework is
generally acceptable for procurement under SSA and guarantees adequate transparency.
The areas for strengthening have been identified in the report "Review of Procurement
Procedures under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA)" and will be addressed in due course
through the GOI's and the States' procurement reform efforts. GO1 has prepared a
"Manual on Financial Management and Procurement under SSA" after consulting all
stakeholders and this has been issued to the States. Procurement of all goods, works and
serviceswill be conducted followingthe Guidelinesin this Manual.

40.     The Procurement Capacity Assessment of the SSA program was undertaken in
five states - Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. Collectively,
they account for a large percentage of the total student population. The assessment was
conducted at all levels of SSA implementation        - State, District, Block/Cluster and
Village levels. Because DPEP has been in implementation in 294 districts of 18 states,
the SSA has a good foundation to build on. The five states selected included both DPEP
states and non-DPEP states (Punjab) so that a broader view could be obtained. The
assessment covered the procurement capacity (clear definition of functions and
delegation of authority, staffing, internal procedures) of the implementing institutions
responsible for procurement at each level. The main conclusionsof the assessment report
are as follows: (i) Capacity of institutions in processing large civic works is well
established ; (ii) Institutional capacity for procurement of papers and computers is also
well established but could be improved further by developing Standard Bidding
Documents; (iii) there is a need for strengthening procurement capacity of the VECs by
appropriate training and design of detailed manuals; and (iv) there is a need to prepare
guidelines for purchase of smallvalue items.

41.     Based on the findingsof the CPAR, SPARSand the assessment of the five states,
the Partners concur with the GO1 that the procurement implementation capacity is
generally acceptable for procurement under SSA. The "Review of Existing Procurement
Capacity under Sawa Shihha Abhiyan (SSA)" has identified the above mentioned areas
for strengthening. GO1would continueto take necessary actions during implementation
to strengthenthe capacityof institutionsat all levelsthat handleprocurement under SSA.

42.     Given the size and spread of the operation, it has been agreed that a copy of the
Annual Procurement Plan prepared by MHRD would be forwarded to the Partners


                                              13

annually. However, tlvs purchase plan will not be directly linked to any disbursement
under SSA.

43.    The Partners have agreed that the audit/post review of contracts will be carried
out in accordance with the systems and procedures of the Government of India and the
respective state. In addition to an internal audit, the audit by a Chartered Accountant
Firm and the externalaudit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India which are as
per procedure, the GO1has also hred the services of a firm for apost review of a limited
number of contracts awarded on procurement of goods, works and services by the
implementingagenciesat all levels. As per the TOR of the fm,each year six states will
be subject to the review. GO1 will share all reports of the above mentioned external
audits with the Partners during the Joint Review Missions (JRMs). GO1will review the
reports for a period of one year and consider, modification to the TOR, if required which
would be shared with the partners. In addition, the Partners reserve the option to post
review contractsin consultation with GOI.

4. Social

44.    The Social Assessment appraised the SSA Framework and its implementation
processes at state and district levels, examining the mechanisms and criteria used to
ensure social and gender equity. The Framework focuses attention on the "special focus
groups" (SFGs), notably girls, SCs and STs, and deprived urban children. Activities for
these groups are mainstreamed in state and district planning, appraisal and
implementation,training and monitoring. In view of the large gaps and less experience at
the upper primary level, special attention would continue to be paid to meeting the
educational needs of socially disadvantaged 11-14 year-olds. Gender and social issues
would also continue to be addressed by efforts to ensure communityparticipation in the
program and to sensitize administrators to social realities. Equity would, in turn, be
enhanced through these efforts.

45.    To strengthen local planning, each district would continue to collect and use
quantitative and qualitative information disaggregated by social group and gender and,
where possible, further break down the data to specific sub-groups and smaller
geographical units. The annual district plans articulatewhat will be done specifically for
the enrolment, retention and learning outcomes of the SFGs. Similarly, gender issues
would continueto be addressed in all aspects of the program and in other related schemes
with which the SSA will converge. The NPEGEL aims at concentrated action for girls in
the most backward blocks of the country. The DEEL has prepared checklists for
planning and appraising the plans to ensure that specific actions are taken for the SFGs.
These have been incorporated in the Planning & Appraisal Manual (Revised January
2004) for use during program implementation.

46.    GO1 is well-equipped to address equity issues through the Framework, with
decentralized planning being combined with responsive governance from the Center. To
ensure that gender and equity issues are addressed, the capacities of educational
administrators (planners and implementers) at the district, block and cluster levels would
continue to be built systematically especially to prepare context-specific plans and to
track implementation.

5. Environment

47.      Environmental issues are related mainly to civil works, including construction of
toilets and water facilities in schools. A partial environmental assessment (EA) was
carried out as the works are small in scale and issues relatively small and local. Some
environmental safeguards are alreadybuilt into the norms and standards specified for the
SSA. The EA Report identifies the probable environmental issues in the program and
describes the manuals, directives and guidelines that exist to address environmental
issues and arrangementsto implement and monitor actions, to ensure that environmental
issues are mainstreamed in the program. Detailed guidelines are contained in
"Community Construction Manual", "Guideline on Design of Rural Primary Schools",
"Compilation of School Designs", "Handbook of Chld-Friendly Features", and
"Guideline for Utilizing Maintenance Grants" to ensure better constructionmanagement,
better learning environments, and health and hygiene on school premises. Some specific
strategies are to include environmental parameters in appraisal of annual work plans, in
annual reviews of program implementation, and in the joint review missions.
Independent third-party evaluationsof civil works would examine the implementationof
environmental management measures. At least one such evaluationwould be carried out
in states,where there are substantialcivil works, during the project.

48.      The program does not require any GO1 environmental clearances. However, if,
during implementationany schools need to be located in forests or other protected areas,
site-specific clearances would be obtained, and all requisite GOYstate conditions would
be fulfilled. Community consultation is an integral part of the SSA. Communities and
local-level institutions such as VECs are involved in identification, planning, design,
implementation, operation and maintenance of schools and all other program activities.
Consultationswith schoolteachers,experts, NGOs and other stakeholderswould continue
throughout implementation. The SSA websiteg discloses important aspects of the
program and would includethe EA documents.

6. SafeguardPolicies

49.      OP 4.01: EnvironmentAssessment. See sectionD5 above.

50.      OD 4.20: Scheduled Tribes (ST). A Tribal Development Plan (TDP) has been
prepared (Annex 10). In view of SSA's framework approach, the TDP aims to ensure
that (i) ST children are a focus of the districtplans and their appraisal; (ii) a wide range of
interventionsis availablein the program for districtsto provide benefits to tribal children,
Le., to enhance their school enrolment, retention, and learning outcomes; (iii) ST
representatives participate in all educational structures and processes, formal and
informal; and (iv) key monitoring indicators and processes measure the results being
acheved for tribal children. The SSA program provides a specific annual financial
allocation to every district for the SFGs, including ST children. Given the wide range of
actions, definite and possible, including instruction in tribal languages and sensitization
to tribal cultures of teachers and administrators, and given the program stipulation that
only govemment/panchayat-owned and donated lands are to be used for construction of
educational buildings, the Project is not expected to have any negative impacts on tribal
people. On the contrary, considerablepositive impacts are expected.

                                              15

51.     OP 4.12: Involuntary Resettlement. Participatory and transparent processes
would be followed to obtain land for construction of educational structures both in rural
and urban areas. Normal government procedures would be followed for documentation
of transfer of govemment/panchayat-ownedand donated land. In some states the records
are available at the Tehsil Office, while in others they are maintained by the village
Patwari (Accountant). The documentationwould be accessibleto JRMs on field visits to
ascertain that no displacement (loss of residence or livelihood) has taken place in
obtaining the land. Reviewing the processes of obtaining land and transfer of ownership
would be a part of the third party evaluation of civil works. Almost all sites for
construction are expected to fall in the above categories. Land for educationalbuildings
under the SSA program is not expected to be purchased on a `willing seller-willing
buyer' basis, nor acquired under the Land Acquisition Act. SSA would not fund
constructionon any land for which clear title is not alreadyavailable.

52.     To ensure voluntary donation and no significantphysical displacementor adverse
impact on incomes, all land transfers would meet the following criteria: (i) the land
would be free of squatters, encroachers, other claims and encumbrances; (ii) to protect
the poor, land would not be accepted from any donor who is below the poverty line,
whose holding would then be reduced below the minimum size stipulated to be
economically viable locally (generally2.5 acres); (iii) any land with disputed title andor
legal or illegal settlementswould be excluded; (iv) the voluntary nature of the donation
would be verified by the local administration; and (v) land transfers would be completed
with land title vested in the panchayat or other government body through a registered
deed or MOU, or through any procedure prescribed by the law of the state. In keeping
with program principles, all sites would be selected by or be acceptable to the concerned
community. Any minor impacts of land obtained through voluntary donations would be
addressed by the panchayats with due consideration to vulnerable groups. Provisions
would be made for redressal of grievances.

7. Readiness

53.     The SSA program was already in the process of implementation for the last two
years before the Development Partners were invited to participate in the financing of the
program. The fiduciary arrangements have been in place; state implementation societies
are operational; the Central and state governmentshave demonstrated their commitment
through budget allocations; disclosure requirements have been met; M&E institutional
obligations have been spelt out; M&E capacity is in place and indicators specified;
baseline data collected; and SWAP arrangements and Memorandum of Understanding
agreedupon between GO1and Partners.

54.     The project requires two exceptions from Bank policies: (i) It will allow
retroactive financing of up to $100 million to cover expenditures fiom April 1, 2003 to
credit signing. Within this time period, total expendituresincurred by GO1and the states
are estimated to be about $578 million. The retroactive financing will help to ensure
smooth implementation and also provide a boost to program activities. This has been
approved by Bank Management. (ii) The project will allow the Consolidated Report on
Audits to be submitted nine months after the end of GOI's fiscal year. Under SSA more
                                            16

than 30 Audit Reports would be expected annually from states and union territories and
GOI's "Manual on Financial Management and Procurement for SSA" requires that the
Audit Reports be furnished to the GO1withm nine months of the close of the financial
year for being placed before the Parliament. The Bank agrees to follow GOI's own
reporting procedures and timetables in accordance with the principles of SWAP. This
exceptionhas alsobeen approved by Bank Management.

                 Annex 1. Country and Sectoror Program Background

1.1.    The GO1 had recognized the importance of elementary education and made a
resolve in the Constitution of India as long ago as in 1950:"The state shall endeavor to
provide within a period of 10 years from the commencement of the Constitution for free
and compulsory education for all chldren until they complete the age of 14 years"
(Article 45). However, the agenda of universalizing primary education in India has
remained an unfinishedpromise.

1.2.    On the other hand, significant progress has been made in poverty alleviation and
eradication, in social development, and in the provision of literacy and educational
services.    The successive governments in recent times have resolved to provide
elementary education free to all and the first step towards ths was the 86th Constitutional
Amendment (2002) of the constitution that guarantees free and compulsory Elementary
education as a fundamental right of all children in the age group of 6-14 years. The
successful implementation of this Amendment requires adequate financial allocations to
elementaryeducation.

Access and Equity

1.3.    Between 1950-51 and 2002, the number of primary schools in India increased
three-fold, from about 210,000 to a little over 640,000 schools and the number of upper
primary schoolshas increasedby almost 15times from 13,600to almost 200,000 schools.
The introduction of New Education Policy in 1986heralded an era of gradual expansion
of education with a rise in the number of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) with
targeted assistance to primary education. Gross enrollment rates (GERs) in primary
education increased from 81.9 percent in 1993-94to 96 percent in 2001-02, and that in
upper primary education, from 54.2 percent to 60.2 percent. While GERs at the
secondary level are well below primary GERs, they increased from 20.5 percent to 30.5
percent over the sameperiod. The most remarkable improvement was in the education of
girls, rural and poor children. Between 1993 and 1999, not only did GERs rise overall,
but also the gap between rural and urban enrollment narrowed, as did the gender gap and
the expendituregap. Figures 1.2to 1.4explainthese improvements.

1.4.     Notwithstanding these gains, gaps between boys and girls, rich and poor, and
rural and urban areas remain. Moreover, the extent and magnitude of these inequities
differ geographically, across districts and across states. The educational outcomes of

                                                          19

some states (e.g., Kerala and Tamil Nadu) are comparableto those of developed countries
while some other states (e.g., Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa)have yet to achieve
the same levels. Moreover, progress in reaching positive education outcomes, as well as
in bridging inequitygaps, differs across states(Figures 1.5, 1.6, 1.7and 1.8).

1.6.    School Completion is just as important as access. It is often the case that some
children who enroll in grade one drop out before completing the primary cycle. Again,
social, gender, regional and geographical differences affect school completion rates, as
presented in Figures 1.11and 1.12.

Quality

 1.7. The quality of schooling is typically measured directly through assessments of
student learning achievement and school completion rates, and indirectly through such
quality inputs as time for learning, teacher quality, school facilities and educational
materials.

1.8.    Learning Achievement: SSA aims to ensure that all students have satisfactory
learning outcomes. The baseline assessment of Grade 5 student achievement conducted
by NCERT in 2002 provides the first national data and points to low levels of learningin
public schools. Table 1.1 shows that there was a very small gender gap in mathematics
and language achievement. The ruravurban gap was also small for mathematics but
larger in language. Overall, the achievement level is not high, but more worrying is that
the standard deviation is large, particularly for mathematics. It is common across many
countries that mathematics achievement is lower than language achievement, and the
pattern in India is not an exception. However, it would be important to raise the
mathematicsachievement of all studentsas it is a fundamental skill.

1.9.    Table 1.2 shows that the achievement level is uneven across states. This reflects
perhaps a combination of factors, such as the selectivity of the education system in the
states and the quality of education. For example, the high average scores of Bihar
probably reflect the selectivityof the system, as it has a lower enrollmentratio than other

states. On the contrary,the statesthat have over 99 percent of the relevant-age childrenin
school--Kerala and Himachal Pradesh-have             low average scores, particularly in
mathematics; however, their smaller standard deviation shows lesser variations in quality
than most states.

1.10. Student Timefor Learning: Studentsnot attending classes is an indication of the
quality levels of the education imparted to them, as without any learning, students have
little incentive to be in school. Studies have shown that the quality of inputs has a
substantialimpact on child learningand provides incentivesfor chldren to attend school.
Table 1.3 shows that student attendance rates are low and vary tremendously across

                                             23

states. Absenteeism tends to be the precursor of dropping out. Studentsin public schools
tend to have lower attendance rates than private schools. In Bihar, for example, student
attendance rates in public schools are as low as 39 percent, but those in private schools
were 66 percent. There are exceptions to this pattern. For example, Maharashtra's
attendancerates in private school are lowerthan those in public schools.
1.11. Teacher Timefor Teaching: Recent estimates of teacher absence rates show that
the problem is serious. Teacher absence reduces the amount of time for learning and
hence lower overall quality of schooling. Table 1.3 shows the results of a recent study
carried out by the WDR.

Provision and Financing of ElementaryEducation

1.13. India is a union of 28 states and 7 union territories (UTs). The Constitution has
made Education a subject on the concurrent jurisdiction of the Central and State
governments. State governments undertake direct activities related to elementary and
secondary education, though Central government provides funds for specific programs
through its centrally sponsored schemes. States and UTs account for 85-90 percent of
total government spending on education. Central government share was around a high
15-20 percent when it actively established hgher educational institutions in the early
decades of 1950s. Subsequently, it went down to around 8-10 percent. Figure 1.13
presents the trend in total expenditure on elementary education in the 1990s and early
2000s.

1.14. Public schools account for 90 percent of enrollment in elementary education and
private schools (aided and unaided, recognized and unrecognized), for about 10 percent.
Government-aided private schools receive a share of the government expenditure on
education through a system of subventions (grants-in-aid) whereby the schools are
managed by their own boards, be that missionaries, NGOs or other private bodies, and
public finance covers teacher salaries and various operating costs. However, private
unaided schools receive no recurrent public assistance. Public expenditureon education,
therefore, covers not only public schools, but also government-aided private schools.
Increasingly in urban areas, the numbers and proportion of children going to private
schoolsare growing,though as sharesof the total, these figures are small.

HouseholdEducationExpenditure

1.15. An analysis of out-of-pocket expendituresincurredby households on primary and
upper primary education reveals the continued importance of public provision and
financing. This is particularly true for the children from the poorest households in the
country as the National Sample Survey (NSS) of households on education expenditures
reveals (Table 1.5). Nearly 90 percent of children from the lowest expenditure quintile

attend government and local body schools, compared with only a little over half the
childrenbelongingto households in the hghest expenditure quintile.

1.16. Public education at the elementary level is free, although annual household
expenditures on education averaged Rs. 334 in 1996 (Table 1.6). These out of pocket
costs vary across school type, with the average annual expenditure incurred by
households with children in private schools (on fees, uniforms, textbooks, transportation
costs, etc.) being six to seven times hgher than those incurred by households whose
children attend Government or Local Body schools. The average annual expenditure by
households in the lowest three quintiles is significantly lower than the annual average
expendituresincurred in private schools.

1.17. Students in the government schools incur lower private costs for their education
because government is subsidizing them either directly through free provision of
education facilities, or indirectly through many incentive schemes and other concessions.
The ability of the state governments to finance education depends heavily on fiscal
transfers fi-omthe Central government. In this context, extension of educational benefits
to the poor is closely related to the fiscal relationship between the Central Government
and the states.

Public Expenditure on Education

1.18. Fiscal Transfers between Central and State Governments. Two key aspects of
the Indian fiscal system that impinge on resource availability for the education sector are
the division of taxation powers and the arrangements for fiscal transfers between the two
levels of government.

1.19. Two types of transfers from Central to state governments exist general purpose
                                                                         -
and specific purpose. The former include Finance Commissions awards which devolve
fixed shares in specified central taxes to states to support states' recurrent expenditure
and Planning CommissionAwards to support states' development expenditure. Specific
purpose transfers are essentially centrally-sponsored schemes (CSSs) which target
resources for specific purposes, such as SSA. These CSSs may involve matching grants
from the state in ratios specifiedin the scheme, as in SSA.

1.20. For the educationsector in a state,thus there are multiple sources of finance:
        The state's own receipts (tax revenues and non-tax revenues)

1.21. Expenditureon education increased during the 1980s at a reasonablyhigh rate of
growth, particularly compared to the preceding two decades. The following indicators
highlightthe key trends.

1.22. Education Expenditure as a Percentage of National GDP. Public expenditures
on education, both as a percentage of GDP and as a percentage of total government
expenditure, have increased since 1950-1951. This is evident from Figures 1.14 and
1.15,which depicts education expenditures in India between 1951-52 to 2000-2001 and
across all the Five-Year Planperiods.

1.23. Education and training expenditure as a percentage of GDP rose from below 1
percent in 1950-1951to over 4 percent by 2000-01. This compares favorably with the
low-incomecountries' average of 3 percent, although it falls short of India' own target of
6 percent. As a percentage of total government expenditure, education expenditure
increased from about 8 percent to about 14.6percent over this period; the latter is on the
lower side of the range of public education spending of low-income countries. Figure

                                                                                29

1.15illustratesthat there was a dip in the emphasison basic educationacross the plans as
secondary and tertiary education gained in importance. It is only in the Ninth Plan that
the emphasis on primary educationwas restored.

1.24. Education Expenditure in State GDP. The expenditure on education as a share
of state GDP has been increasingconsiderablyin a few states,including some of the poor
states. In fact, in poor states like Bihar, the proportion was above 6 percent. However, if
the income of the state is low (or declines over the years), even a relatively small amount
or stagnant level of expenditure on education gives an impression of an increased
proportion of state income being invested in education. In a high income state like
Punjab, education spending might be 3 percent, but more resources per capita are spent
on education in real terms than in Bihar. Overall, the variations in the educationalefforts
of various statesdo not fall into any systematicpattern.

1.25. As a share of the total Central Government spending, education expenditure
remained at around 2.5 to 3 percent in the 1990s to date (Figure 1.17). At the States'
level, allocations on education increased fiom 51 percent of all social sector expenditure
in mid-1980s to 53 percent by the late 1990s. As a share of the total state spending,
educationremained around20-22 percent (Figure 1.18).

1.26 Intra-Sectoral Allocation. In the early years, up to 1976, constitutionally,
elementary education was a state subject. As a result, the central government spending
on elementary education was under 10 percent of total education expenditure of the
Central government. However, with the shift in focus to elementary education and the
introduction of many CSSs, such as the DPEP, the Central government expenditure on
elementary education increased to 43 percent. CSSs have become the driving force
behind the elementaryeducation developmentreform by the states(Figure 1.19).

1.27. Most states increased spending on elementaryeducation between 1990and 2000,
except a few like Gujarat and Kerala, where the expenditure on elementary educationwas
already quite satisfactory. The states that reduced elementary education expenditure
increased spendingon secondary education (Figure 1.20).

1.28 In summary, intra-sectoral resource allocation has shfied over the years in favor
of elementary education, which is pro-poor. Nonetheless, the growth in expenditure on
elementary education took place along with a rise in the expenditures on other sub-
sectors of education such as secondary and higher education sectors. Figure 1.21 shows
the increase in spending on all sub sectors of education in real terms between 1990/91
and 2000/01. Thus, the focus on elementary education has not been at the expense of
other sub sectors.

student is about $44, or 8.5percent of per capita GDP, which is lower than the averageof
10-12percent of per capita GDP among low-income countries. There is much variation
across states (Figure 1.22).Per student spendingin India ranges from $16 in West Bengal
to $68 in Himachal Pradesh (Hp).The variation across states is attributable to different
conditions. Three states which have high per student spending are HP, Kerala and Bihar.
Their high unit costs are due to different reasons                   -mountainous setting and remote
schools in HP, commitment to spend a high amount per child in Kerala, and low
enrollmentin Bihar resulting in higher spending per child. The overall trend, however, is
encouraging as most states have increased per student spendingbetween 1990and 2000,
except Haryana, Rajasthan, and Maharashtrawhich experienced a slight decline.

1.30 Conclusion. This review of indicators on access and quality, as well as
household and public expenditure on education, comes to several key conclusions:

       The trend of increased public spending on education demonstratesthat GO1 and
       state governments are committed to universalizing elementary education by
       mobilizingpublic resources to financeit in a sustainedmanner.
       The increase in per student spending shows that rapid expansion of elementary
       education has not occurred at the expense of reducing spending per student.
       However, per child spending is still low in comparison with the other low income
       countries.
       In spite of the very impressive progress made, 25 million children are still out of
       school,the gender and social gaps still exist, and the qualityof educationcouldbe
       improved.        This suggests that additional public investment in elementary
       educationis needed to reach UEE goals.
       These findings make supporting SSA all the more compelling, not only because
       the needs are huge, but because the track record of education in India provides
       assurancethat the program canproduce results on the ground.

   Annex 2. Major Related Projects Financed by the Bank and/or Other Agencies

2.1.    The first Bank-financed basic education project was approved in 1993 for the
state of Uttar Pradesh. It was followed by two multi-state District Primary Education
Projects and another five state-specific projects. UNICEF, DflD and the Netherlands
have also financed basic education projects. These efforts have resulted in a partnershp
in the internationalcommunityin support of the Governmentof India's efforts to expand
access, improve retention and educational quality, and enhance management capacity at
the state, district and sub-districtlevels.

                     Annex 3. Results Framework andMonitoring

3.1.    SSA has a community-based monitoring system and is subject to independent
research and supervision by autonomous research institutions at the state level, with 93
percent of monitoring resources targeted to sub-national institutions.               The apex
institutions, National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and
National Institute for Education Planning and Administration(NIEPA), have developed a
framework for monitoring program results. During the preparation phase, the monitoring
framework and the formats for qualitative and quantitative monitoring were developed
and finalized in consultation with the states in a series of five regional workshops. The
DEEL has also identified40 national- and state-levelResource Institutions (RI). Each of
these RIs will monitor progress in up to 25 districts assigned to them. Key indicators
were established, and baseline measures for most indicators have been collected, using
existing data collectionsystems and special sample surveys.

3.2.     Key indicators include (a) children in and out of school; (b) children in and out
of school by gender, SC, and ST; and (c) the quality of education, indicated by transition
rates and achevement level.

3.3     Children Out-of-School. A central indicator of program results will be the
decline in out-of-school children in the 6-14l age cohort. There are two data sources
which allow for consistencycheck of the baseline data on the school-agepopulation: (a)
India's 2001 Census; and (b) SSA'shousehold child census of 2002 whch collected data
on the education status of children from birth to 14years. The 2001 Census Bureau will
release in March 2004 the single-agepopulation age 0 to 18years and the number of each
age group currently attending school, fi-omwhich the number of children out of school in
2002 can be computed, nationally and by state. Although the two census took place one
year apart,they would allow for consistencycheck of data.

3.4.    In addition, at the village and urban ward level, data on children in and out of
school have been collected through an MHRD administrative household and school
census in 2002. These data are available in village and urban ward registers and updates
are anticipated on an annual basis. Finally, enrollment data for urban and rural public
and recognized private schools are collected and published annually by NIEPA for its
"District Report Card", whch covered 459 districts in 18states for the 2002/2003 school
year, and is expected to cover all districts for the 2006/2007 school year. Monitoring
changes in the number of out-of-school children would be facilitated by including
updates from village and urban ward registers in the annualDISE data collection.

3.5.    Gender and Social Parity. Data on children in and out of school will be
disaggregatedby age, gender, and ST/SC at the stateand district level.

3.6.    Quality. NCERT has established a plan for the assessment of student learning
achievement in selected subjects at grades 3, 5, and 7/8. Tests for grade 5 were

administered in the school year 2001/2002 to students in a sample of schools from a
sample of districts in all states; results were made available in February 2004. Tests for
grades 7 and 8 were administered in the school year 2003/2004 to studentsin a sample of
schools from a sample of districts in all states; data entry is ongoing. Tests for grade 3
are currently under development and are expected to be administered in 2004/05. These
assessments would be repeated every three years and trends monitored. In addition,
quality will be assessed through measures of school completion rates, by age, gender and
SC/ST status. Studiedthird party evaluations would also be carried out periodically on
specific interventions/issuesrelated to quality and equitywhch are identified and agreed
upon in the course of the semi-annualjoint review.

3.7.    The intent of the project is to closely link quality with access, enrolment,
completionand learning. Due to the short duration of the project, it would be difficult to
measure outcomes or to show increase in completion rates. However, the thrust and
direction which the project would promote in implementation would be towards
improving quality of service delivery with a view to achieving the above developmental
objectives. In addition, special studies will be conducted to assess the quality of
educationas and when required (for example,time-on-task, determinantsof achievement,
and cost-effectivenessof interventions.)

3.8.    External support to SSA would aim for the following common results and
monitoring fiamework as presented in Tables 3.1,3.2, and 3.3.

Joint Review Mission

3.9.    The Partners will join GO1 and the designated SSA monitoring institutions to
review project implementation semi-annually in January and July, as per terms of
reference agreed between the GO1 and the Partners prior to each JRM. The January
mission will visit the field. The field visit will focus more on the states lagging behind.
JRMs will review issues related to state and district implementation capacity and agree
on actions taken to support weaker states. Mission participants will be from GOI, EC,
DfID and the Bank. GO1will provide the coordination and leadership. Fifty percent of
the persons in the JRM will be from GO1 and the other half among the three agencies.
The JRM in January2006 will constitutethe mid-term review by the Partners.

3 10. In January, the JRM would:

  (i)   review districtplan approvalsand GO1budget allocations;
  (ii) visit selected districts in 8-10 states to review progress in overall implementation
        including,financialmanagement, procurement and safeguardissues;
  (iii) identify any studiesto be undertaken in the followingsix months; and
  (iv) estimate the financialcontributionof external partners.

3.11. The July mission would carry out a comprehensive review of information
received on:

 (i)   annual progress on agreed indicators in terms of compiled EMIS data and other
       data sources;

                          Annex 4. Detailed Project Description

4.1.    Sarva Shiksha Abhyan (SSA) is a national program that aims at achieving
universal enrollmentin and completion of elementary education (Grades 1-8).SSA spans
from 2001 to 2010. The program combines centrally set, time-bound targets and norms
for costing, with bottom-up planning and decentralized implementation. It is financed
jointly by the Central Government and the states in a cost-sharing ratio of 85:15 during
the last year of the 9thPlan (2001), 75:25 during the lothPlan (2002-07) and 5050
subsequently.

4.2.     This project will support SSA fkom 2004 to 2007. During the project period, the
financing consists of contributions of 45 percent fkom the Central Government, 30
percent from the Partners, and 25 percent from the states. The Partners contribute to the
Central Govemrnent'stotal share of 75 percent.

Project Description

4.3.    The project will finance SSA expenditures of MHRD, states and districts, which
are based on their annual work plans designed to reach universal elementaryeducation of
satisfactory quality. These plans are costed according to the norms in SSA Framework
for Implementation (pp. 7-11). Thenoms include the following:

(0      interventions on teacher (e.g., one teacher for every 40 students, two teachers in a
        primary school,and one teacher for every upper primary class);
(ii)    school/alternativeschoolingfacilities(withinone hlometer of everyhabitation);
(iii)   upper primary school (e.g., one upper primary school/section for every two
        primary schools);
(iv)    classrooms;
(VI     freetextbooks (for girls and students of SC and STbackgrounds);
(vi)    civil works (not exceed 33 percent of the program cost),
(vii)   maintenance and repair of schoolbuildings;
(viii) upgrading of Education Guarantee Schemes (EGS) to regular schools, or setting
        up of a new primary school asper statenorm;
(ix)   teaching, learningmaterials and equipment for upper primary education;
(XI     school grant (forreplacement of non-functional school equipment);
(xi)   teacher grant (forpurchase of teaching and learningmaterials);
(xii)  teacher training;
(xiii) State Institute of Educational Management and Training(SIEMAT);
(xiv) training of communityleaders;
(xv)   provision for disabledchildren;
(xvi) research, evaluation,supervisionand monitoring;
(xvii) management;
(xviii) innovative activities for girls education, early childhood care and education,
       interventions for children belonging to SC/ST community, computer education
       especially for upper primary level;
(xix) Block Resource Centers (BRCs), Cluster Resource Centers (CRCs);


                                             46

(xx)    interventions for out-of-school children, preparation activities for micro-planning,
        household surveys, studies, community mobilization, school-based activities,
        office equipment, training and orientationat all levels.
(xxi) provision for the education of girls at the primary and upper primary levels; and
(xxii) carrying out activities at the national and State level including training, capacity
        building, technical support, monitoring and evaluation, financial management,
        disseminationand media campaigns.

4.4. The long-term perspective plans and annual work plans from the states and
districts have been appraised and approved by the Project Approval Board convened by
MHRD. There is also a national component for supervision, monitoring, technical
support, capacity building, research and evaluation, management, and public awareness
campaign. The Central Government allocates a budget which is released to the State
Implementation Societies (SIS) to fund the district plans and the state component.
Because the scope of interventions and resource requirements vary across states, districts,
and subdistricts, and also from year to year, project activities will respond to changing
circumstancesin order to best meet the development objectives. The project, therefore, is
unlike a traditional investment credit with predefined components and associated ex-ante
allocationof finance.

4.5.    Key SSA activities - both supply-side and demand-side to be financed by the
                                                                     -
project include the following, in addition to management and monitoring and evaluation:

(0      To move towards universal elementary educationby reducingthe number of out-
        of-school children and increasingenrollment:

     e  Establishment,construction and extension of primary and upper primary schools;
     e  Provision of trainingin socialmobilizationand educationalmanagement;
    e   Payment of the salariesof teachershired under the program; and
     e  Interventionsto enroll out-of-school children.

    e   Provision of grants to districts to support childrenwith disability (for example, to
        fund installation of special facilities in buildings, medical assessment, and special
        training for teachers).

(iii)   To improvethe qualityof education:

    e   Provisionof training for new and continuingteachers;


                                              47

        School grants forrepair and maintenance, and for materials and equipment;
        Teacher grants for teaching and learningmaterials;
        Establishment and buildingof BRCs and CRCs; and
        Innovative activities.

SSA Features

4.6.    SSA has the following features which distinguishes it from other centrally
sponsored schemes (CSSs),includingDPEP:

        National leadershp with the Prime Minister as the Chairman of the National
        Elementary Education Mission;

        Supportthrough passage of the 8fjthConstitutionalAmendment (2002) to give
        every child between the ages of 6 and 14the right to elementaryeducation
        (Grades 1-8);

        National scale,notjust concentrating on a few states as in DPEP;

        Planningbased on data collectedfrom a household census of the educational
        statusof childrenfrom 0 to 14years of age, combinedwith schoolmapping, both
        startingat the habitation level which is below the village level;

        Inclusiveeducation,even in case of severedisability;

        Fundingmechanism provides incentives, ensures equityand rewards
        implementationprogress-(a) Cost-sharingbetween the Central Governmentand
        the statesprovides a built-in incentivefor statesto make maximum use of
        centrallyprovided grants; (b) norms ensurethat the districtswith the greatest
        needswill receivethe largest amount of resources; (c) districtswill only get
        additionalresourcesafterhaving utilized 50 percent of the first tranche and after
        stateshaveprovided the matching funds; and

        Stateshave to undertake reform (includingteacher rationalization)to make
        schoolsmore accountableto local communities, and to match the allocation from
        the Union Governmentin order to benefit from theprogram.

4.7.    SSA differs from DPEP in two key areas: (a) the latter only targets support to
districts with female literacy rates below the national average, covers only Grades 1-5;
and (b) the states contribute 15 percent of the counterpart funds up front to match IDA
credit, while the Central government's contribution is mainly in repayment of the credit,
not in upfi-ont financing. The features that SSA builds on and shares with DPEP are as
follows:
        District Annual Work Plans as the basis for resource allocationand program
        implementation;


                                             48

        Focus on girls and other disadvantaged groups (SC, ST, and childrenwith
        disabilities).
        Centralrole of teachers -focus on their development needs through BRCs and
        CRCs;
        Capacity-buildingand monitoring and evaluation handled by research and
        training institutions at the national, state and district levels (NCERT,NIEPA,
        NCTE, SCERT, SIEMAT and DIETS); and
        Communityownershipwith key roles played by Village Education Committees
        (VECs)of the local self-government (Panchayati Raj), women's groups and
        NGOs in planning, implementation and monitoring.

4.8.    SSAhas been in implementation since 2001. The followingsectionswill describe
the activities in the preparatory phase in 2001-02 and the process of appraisal of district
plans that led up to implementation in 2003-04.

The Preparatory Phase

4.9.    Preparation for SSA included the followingprocesses:

        Micro-planning,school-mappingand household surveys;
    0   Communitymobilization;
    0   Establishinginformation systemswith provisionof computers and office
        equipment;
    0   Training and orientationof communityleadersand others; and
    0   Baseline studies (includingstudent achievement tests).

4.10. The planning process began with the formation of a core group of government
and non-government personnel. Teachers were organized to carry out a household
census in April-May 2002 to record the educational status of children from 0-14 years,
collecting information on age, gender, scheduled caste/scheduled tribe/other status, and
disability, and whether they were in school, out of school or had dropped out. The data
were then used to prepare village/urban ward registers so that action could be taken to
enroll out-of-school chldren or to ask parents to bring dropouts back to school or to
alternativeeducation centers.

4.11. The habitation is the basic level of data collection and planning. The data are
aggregated at the village, block, cluster, district and state levels for preparation of long-
term perspective plans (up to 2010, when all targets are expected to be met) and an
annual work plan in each district. The plans are expected to includethe following:

   0   Information on available school facilities and the 0-6 and 6-14 year population
       with projections up to 2010;
   0   Rationalization of teachers, and calculationof the requirement for teachers;
   0   Trainingrequirementsand steps to fulfill them;



                                               49

        Otherrequirements such as school facilities,toilet for girls;
        Civilworks;
        Strategyto cover marginal groups (SC, ST, and children with disabilities);
        Effective community participation    -  VECs, school management committees,
        parent-teacherassociation (PTA);
        Convergence with other interventions such as the Mid-Day Meals Scheme,
        TeacherEducation,and tribal developmentprograms; and
        Costs of the interventions based on SSAnorms (Annex 8).

Appraisal of DistrictPerspective andAnnualWork Plans

4.12. After the districts have submitted their Perspective and Annual Work Plans, the
MHRD convenes an appraisal team consisting of experts from various disciplines to
appraise the plans.      Appraisals assess the level of mobilization and community
participation; identification of problem areas; the quality of data used for planning;
interventions suggested forvarious components; and convergence in implementationwith
other CSSs (Mid-Day Meals), tribal development, other infrastructure schemes (such as
drinking water, toilets for boys and girls). Appraisal will take about 40 days, and may
include a field visit to selected districts. Key elements of the approach are a prior
briefing by GO1 on areas of special focus (e.g., teacher vacancies, policy change,
decentralization and out-of-school children), document review, and if necessary, prior
interaction with state functionariesto clarify points. The appraisal missions to the states
are supportive in nature and place emphasis on providingtechnical assistance to the state
and districtswhere it may be necessary to strengthenthe plan formulation process. Table
4.1 at the end of this annex illustrateshow each state's estimated cost and proposed usage
of SSA allocationsdiffer fi-omeach other.

                                 Annex 5. Project Costs

5.1     The cost of the program is drivenby the interventionsneeded to achieveuniversal
elementary education of satisfactory quality. As needs vary across villages, clusters,
blocks, districts and states, both the long-term perspective plans and the annual work
plans, as well as corresponding costs, will also vary. The needs will also change from
year to year, depending on whether resources have been made available to fully fund the
annual work plans, and also on the implementation capacity to execute the program.
Unfunded mandates and unused funds will be carried over to the following year. While
the districts and subdistricts can decide on interventions, they have to cost the
interventions according to the norms set by MHRD for the entire country. These norms
do not vary by districts and subdistricts(Table 4.1).

5.2.    Decision about allocation of external funds is guided by the followingprinciples:
(i) Central Government will maintain financial commitment in real terms to the level of
2002/03 in elementary education; (ii) external funds will be additional to, not substitute
for, domestic funds; (iii) estimation of needs is based on the approved annual work plans
by states and districts; and (iv) implementation capacity could pose a constraint to full
utilization of availablefunds.

5.3.    Table 5.1. presents the approximate distribution of the cost across various
categories of intervention,based on the approved outlays of 2003/04. Distribution of the
costs over the project period will depend heavily on implementationcapacity.

                        Annex 6. ImplementationArrangements

6.1.   The implementation arrangements could be considered to have three mutually
supporting structures at all levels of the society: (a) policy direction and oversight, (b)
management and implementation, and (c) technical support. The structure that will
implement and support the Project is (b) and (c). The organization chart illustrates their
relationshipand linkages amongdifferent levels.

PolicyDirection and Oversight

6.2.   The policy and oversight function is performed by members of elected bodies,
representativesof various departments of government,and stakeholders:

       At the national level: The National Elementary Education Mission which is
       governed by a General Council, headed by the Prime Minister with the Human
       Resource Development Minister as its Vice Chairman. This mission is served by
       an Executive Committee which is headed by the Minister of Human Resources
       Development, and Secretary, Department of Elementary Education and Literacy
       (DEEL) is its Vice-chairman. The Joint Secretary for Elementary Education in
       the DEEL is the Director General of the mission and has overallresponsibility for
       implementation of the SSAFramework.

       At the state level: A State Mission Authority has been set up as an autonomous
       society, for universalization of elementary education. The General Council of this
       Mission is headed by the Chief Minister and the Executive Committee by the
       Chief Secretary,with representation from other departments (e.g., Finance, Social
       Welfare, Women and Child Development) and from the educational profession.
       The Council has a key role in coordination with other departments to ensure
       convergence of programs (e.g., Mid-Day Meals Scheme, tribal development, and
       other infrastructure   - drinking water and toilets for girls) and overseeing all
       planning, administrative, financial and academicaspects.

       At the district level: The District Elementary Education Committee, headed by the
       District Collector/Magistrate/Chef Executive Officer of the District Panchayat,
       has representation from Block level officers, educationists, and members of the
       public. It is responsible for guiding policy, coordination and reviewing progress
       related to enrollment, retention and quality of education. It is accountable to the
       DistrictBoardlZilla Parishad).

   0   At the sub-district level: The Block Education Committee, headed by an elected
       representative of the Block Development Committee, is responsible for planning
       and coordination.

       At the community and school levels: The Village Education Committee (VEC) of
       the elected local government is responsible for planning, social mobilization and
       oversight at the village level, while the Ward Education Committee (WEC) does
       the same for the wards in urban areas. The VECs and WECs are to assist in
       household child census, update the village or ward register of the education status
       of the 6-to-14-year-oldsYand to monitor whether parents send their children to
       school. School Management Committee (SMC) and Parent Teacher Association
       (PTA) are responsibleto ensure that the educationalneeds of &l are met,
                                                                          chddren
       that gender and social parity is reflected in enrolment,that school grants are used
       and accounted for properly, and that teachers and students attend regularly.

6.3.   The key to successful implementation of SSA is to combine national and state
leadership in setting the policy direction and in ensuring the efforts are properly funded,
with the oversight at the community and school levels. The primary stakeholders are the
grassroot institutions -- the VECs or WECs, SMCs and PTAs. It is this emphasis on
developing structures and mechanisms at the grassroots level that promotes greater

improve accountability where it really matters: in the school and classroom. Such
community ownership of and involvement in the education process. This will, in turn,
grassroot organizations have been active in the entire process of SSA -- fkom micro-
planning to oversight ensuringproper financial accountability.

Management and Implementation

6.4.   The management and implementation structure is almost parallel to that of the
policy and oversight structureat all levels:

       At the national level: DEEL, through the Secretary and the Joint Secretary, is
       linked with the National Mission in all policy matters.               DEEL retains
       responsibility for technical and financial oversight of the entire program. Its core
       responsibilities are to appraise and approve state- and district-levelplans (through
       the Project Approval Board), contribute to capacity development, trouble-
       shooting,disseminate good practices and closely monitor the program.

       At the state level: State Departments of Education (DOES) work closely with
       State Missions, and are supported by State Implementation Societies (SISs),
       which is the key implementing organization. The SISs are headed by a civil
       servant who manages a team of professionals (pedagogy specialist, gender
       coordinator, planning and MIS specialist, financial and accounts officers, civil
       engineer). The SISs coordinate with district and sub-district level organizations;
       support districts in preparing perspective and annual plans; recruits
       implementation staff for district and BRC teams, CRC coordinators and hire
       consultants; handle the flow of funds from the Center to the districts and sub-
       district levels; carry out procurement, financial and project management; monitor
       implementation progress on agreed indicators using education management
       information system (EMIS) and project management information system (PMIS);
       commissionsresearch and evaluation studies; arrangetrainingof state, district and

                                            55

        subdistrict staff; get the accounts audited; submit implementation progress report
        and audited accounts to the DEEL; and facilitate national and Joint Review
        Missions.

        At the district level: SISs have units extending to the district level, which interact
        with District BoardslZilla Parishad, Block level organizations, Village
        Panchayats, and VECs/WECs, to oversee all planning and implementation of
        activities from the district to the school and community levels. The district
        education office has a team of 7 to 8 professionals according to the additional
        staff requirementin the areas that require specialfocus to achieve SSA objectives.
        This staff is supplemental to the mainstream staff available in the education
        department. They prepare district annual work plans for the Project Approval
        Board, manage the flow of funds, monitor the physical and financial
        implementation process, coordinate the work of the DIET, and establish BRCs
        and CRCs. Staff of the Department of Education posted in the district, including
        supervisory officials and functional specialists,work closely with the district SIS
        units.

        At the Block and Cluster levels: SISs have units extending to Block and Cluster
        Resource Centers and Block Education Officers to implement the program,
        including procurement and financial management. BRCs also serve as liaison to
        the Block level panchayat organizations and NGOs. In addition, BRCs provide
        inservice training to teachers and CRC coordinators. SSA has a provision of 3-4
        staff in the BRC to augment the existing staff in the Block Education Office.

        At the community and school levels: VEC and WEC also handle procurement.
        The schools receive grants for repair and maintenance of the school, and for
        purchase of teachingleaming materials and equipment. Teachers receive grants
        to purchaseteaching learningmaterials.

6.5.    It should be noted that the SISs are autonomous legal entities registered under the
`SocietiesRegistration Act 1860'and the rules framed there under. State laws regulating
societies are very similar, and they follow the same government rules applicable to
departments. Such mechanisms have been applied in India to implement time-bound
projects for over a century; they have been used in all eight DPEP projects. SISs have
three main advantages: (a) as parastatal bodies, they have administrative flexibility
combined with public accountability; @) representation of several departments of the
state government and the Central Government on the governing bodies of the SISs
facilitate planning and coordination; and (c) financial transactions are efficient and
transparent. SISs employboth staff on deputation from other organizations and those who
are directly recruited by the Society. The accounts of the SISs and procurement
compliance of SIS are subject to the provisions of the Comptroller and Auditor General
(CAG) of India (Duties, Powers and Conditions of service) Act 1971.

6.6.    Annex 7 provides information on Financial Management, and Annex 8 on
procurementwithm this multi-level implementation structure.

The Technical SupportStructure

6.7. There is a parallel structure that provides technical support to all levels of the
management and implementationstructureand undertake monitoringand evaluation:

     At the national level: There is a dedicated Technical Support Group that stands
     ready to provide assistance to DEEL in all aspects of planning, appraisal, and
     capacity building. Apex national institutions, such as the National Council of
     Education Research and Training (NCERT) and the National Institute of
     Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA) provide support to the DEEL
     and to state institutions in pedagogy, student assessment, teacher training,
     educational planning, and monitoring and evaluation of SSA. In addition, 40
     national and state level resource institutions will take part in monitoring and
     evaluationof the program.

     At the state level: The State Councils of Educational Research and Training
     (SCERTs) and State Institute of EducationalManagement and Training (SIEMT),
     apex institutions for improving the quality of school education and management,
     are involved in curriculum and textbook renewal; training of district teams for
     quality enhancement interventions; evaluation and research; and development of
     learning materials for students, materials for student assessment and teacher
     guides. In order to build capacityin educational planning and management at the
     district and sub-districtlevels, SSAprovides resources and technical assistanceto
     establisheitherfi-ee-standingSIEMTsor a unit within the existinginstitution.

     At the district level: The District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs)
     provide training to the BRCs and CRCs so that they, in turn,can train village and
     school level personnel. DPEP districts have some experience and capacity but
     non-DPEP districts in both DPEP and non-DPEP states will need considerable
     professional support from state and Central institutions and individual
     professionals. The Central and State Education Departments are apprised of this
     challenge and are working towards this goal. The DIETs remain weak and
     understaffed in several states. Also, newly created districtsneed to develop these
     institutions. The DEEL has made a special provision under the 100 percent
     funded Central assistance scheme to strengthen DIETs, and has urged the State
     EducationDepartmentsto involve the DIETs fully in SSAimplementation.

     At the sub-districtlevel: The CRCs and BRCs provide training to members of the
     VEC/Ward Education Committee/SMC, in such areas as management of
     community construction, micro-planning, conducting household surveys,
     mobilization of community and parents for enrolment and retention of children,
     verifying student and teacher attendance, recruiting teachers for EGS and
     alternative schools.     They also deliver training to teachers and in-school
     professional support to improve classroom processes and enhance student
     learning. These resource centers provide a link in the chain of information
     between the school and district levels.


                                         57

6.8.    The SSA Framework provides for participation of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and the private sector, and ths is being encouraged by the DEEL.
NGOs are increasinglyimplementing the EGS and alternativeschoolingin several states,
and also carrying out community mobilization, inclusive education for chldren with
disabilities, education of tribal children, early childhood education, the mid-day meals
program, educationof childrenin disadvantaged urban areas, and so on.

InstitutionalAssessment

6.9.     The Partners carried out an institutional assessment,which noted how improved
incentives and accountabilitiesachieved through autonomous management committees in
community-based informaYa1ternative schools have led to significant improvement in
resource use and performance of schools. The performance of permanent teachers in
formal government schoolswhich have weaker accountabilitymechanismsis found to be
considerably inferior. Thus, the lesson of improving performance by strengthening
accountability and incentives needs to be carried to formal schools, as well as to district
and sub-district level management and support structures for SSA. This task will include
clearly defining roles,responsibilitiesand relationships at various levels.

6.10. The institutional assessment emphasizes the need to disaggregate and understand
the special circumstances and needs of out-of-school children, and to develop planning
and management capacity to respond to the diverse needs of such children. The
flexibility advocated in the SSA Framework needs to be reiterated to the states and
below. Relevant success stories in differentparts of the country need to be disseminated
widely.

6.11. The problem of under-staffing has been noted, particularly at district and sub-
district levels. This is a particular risk to the reach and effectivenessof teacher training
programs, which are seen as a core way of ensuring appropriate educationalquality. The
problem of under-staffing is further exacerbated by the heavy demands for information
that are imposed on staff, including teachers. The issue of teachers being deployed for
non-teaching tasks is widely recognized, yet remains a significant challenge. The
mitigating strategy is to restrict non-teaching duties to assistingin election,national polio
campaign and decadent census. In addition the skills and experience of staff engaged in
the DIETSare not always relevant to elementary education (as some have experience in
secondary education or other areas). Existing hierarchical educational institutions often
stifle creativity. BRCs and CRCs are created to address these issues and foster learning
and professional growth.

6.12. The roles of national apex institutions, principally the Technical Support Group
(TSG), NIEPA and NCERT, are critical in providing oversight and support to the states.
In terms of oversight, effectiveness will center on the development, implementation and
quality control of a system that produces reliable and relevant information. There is an
urgent requirement to develop a coherent set of core indicators, to rationalize the current
systems of information and data gathering which are currently taking too much time.
Improving the use of information at the appropriatelevel is a related challenge. The plan
appraisalprocess developed for SSAprovides the main mechanism to ensure that planned
interventions match needs. The supportive approach being adopted is noteworthy, and
                                              58

the institutional assessment reiterates the need for further development of "customized"
support.

CapacityBuilding

6.13. Capacity building is critical for the success of the program. Various assessments
have identified the need to continue to enhance the capacities of different implementing
units and personnel at all levels. It is envisaged that the capacity enhancement efforts
will be undertaken in three ways in SSA:

       through existingnational,state and district institutionsand mechanisms;
   0   through collaboration between existing government and autonomous institutions
        as well aswith non-governmental organizations,within and across states; and
       through exposure to and exchange of national and internationalbest practices.

6.14. EC's proposal to utilize a 10millionEuro fund for capacitybuildinghas been
reconfirmed.

          Annex 7. Financial Managementand DisbursementArrangements

Financial ManagementSystem

7.1.    The SSA's financial management (FM) system builds on existing GOUstate
financial procedures and that of its precursor, DPEP, which has been implemented in 18
states (out of 28 states and 7 union territories) and half of the districts in the country.
Furthermore, SSA has been in implementation since 2001. Many of the systems,
processes, checks and balances are already in place or being tested under actual
implementation. FM has established systems in areas of budgeting/planning and
recording of financial information. These strengths,however, are balanced by a number
of significantweaknesses which were discussed in the main text in paragraphs 33.

        The followingmitigatingmeasureshave been adopted:

        GO1 has issued a "Manual on Financial Management and Procurement" to
       provide uniformity in accounting policy, process and reporting formats, and
        initiated the process of "Concurrent Financial Review" to identify weak
        statedareas to help improvethe FM capacityof the entireprogram;
        GO1 has issued norms for staffing to ensure adequate provision of staff at all
       levels;
        GO1will be monitoring the provision of adequate training to finance and accounts
        staff across the states;
       GO1 has prepared a Budget Calendar to ensure timely preparation/ approval of
       PlansBudgets;
       GO1has issued guidelines for timely release of funds;
       GO1 and states are working to transmit funds electronically to expedite the
       process; and
       GO1 will take necessary steps to ensure that Audit Reports fkom states are
       received on a timelybasis.

       The following country issues also applyto SSA:

   The quality and consistency of Audit Reports are issues, in light of the fact that
   different Auditors will be auditing accounts of each SIS. To address both issues,
   model TORS for Auditors have been prepared and the same are acceptable to the
   Partners. Additionally a criteria for selection of Auditors has been developed; this
   will ensure a minimum acceptable standard of Auditors. MHRD will review audit
   reports for qualityand consistency and ensurethat adequatefollow up action is taken.

   Funds may not be availableon time. There have been instances of delay in provision
   of funds after approval of the Annual Budget of the state. In case of states under
   fiscal stress, there may be delayshhortfallin provision of the 25 percent states' share.
   Timelines on release of funds have been laid down to ensure that adequate funds are
   available.



                                           60

FinancialManagement Capacity Assessment

7.4.    A FM capacityassessment of the SSAprogram was undertaken in five states,viz.,
Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Assam and Uttar Pradesh, in each of whch one to
two districts on sample basis were visited. Within each district, a sample of all the

(DPOs), DIETS, BRCs, CRCs, and VECs -- were visited and discussions held with the
entities involved in the program -- State Project Offices (SPOs), District Project Offices

officers in-charge. These states formed a reasonable representative sample of the entire
program with a wide geographical spread and coverage of approximately 40 percent of
the program budget for the year. Additionally the FM policies and procedures of GO1
were also examined covering the following aspects at each level: forecastinghudgeting,
accounting policies/procedures, funds flow arrangement, internal controls, reporting
requirements, auditing arrangements, financial procedures/guidelines, and staffing.
MHRD's ongoing Concurrent Financial Review will continue to assess the FM and
procurement capacity of states and findings of these studies will be shared with the
partners.

7.5.    Key findingsof the assessment are as follows:

   Budgetary control: The process of planning/ budget preparation is based on certain
   norms and is reasonably well established. There is a defined cycle of preparation/

   the same by the Project Approval Board (PAB). Delays were noted in submission/
   approval of perspective plans and then formulation of annual plans and approval of

    approval of plans, but this is expected to improve as the states gain a better
   understanding of the process. Plans preparedformats used are not consistently
   followed across the states leading to problems at time of consolidation of the plans.
   In addition, duringthe process of monitoring progress against budgets, the correlation
   between financialand physicalprogressmay be weak in somecases.

   Stafing of the finance and accounts function: An assessment of staffing of the
   finance and accounts fknction reveals that DPEP states/districtsare better staffed than
   the non DPEP ones. Norms for qualifications,tenure of staff are variable.

   Accounting: Accounting at the state level is based upon the state's own financial
   management policies. The basic accounting records/procedure, i.e., the cash book,
   ledger and bank reconciliation have been prescribed at all levels. Variations exist,
   however, in the quality and timeliness of accounting at various levels across states. It
   was observed that the process of preparation of a bank reconciliation statements was
   not timely, in all cases.

   Auditing arrangements:Auditing of the State Implementation Societies are conducted
   by private auditors,i.e., Chartered Accountants(CA) as per the Societies Registration
   Act. Their scope is usually limited to audit of the SIS and coverage regarding audit
   of utilization of the funds at the district level and below is variable. Delays in
   appointmentof auditors and conduct of audit have been observed in some states. The

   This audit is generally conducted once in 2-3 years covering the entire period. While
   Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) conducts an audit of the entire program.


                                           61

    a review is conducted, information may not be available in time (annually) for pre-
    control.

    Evaluation offinancial management capacity: The assessment of the program at the
    state level has led to the conclusion that there is a significant variation in financial
    management aspects (both in terms of procedures and quality) of the program across
    different states; these are in terms of norms for release of funds, maintenance of
    accounting records and other accounting procedure, budget monitoring, staffing
    numbers etc.

        The issues identified in the assessments have been addressed by MHRD as
explainedin subsequent sectionsof Annex 7.

BudgetaryControl

7.6.    A list of account heads has been developed to enable data to be captured and
classified by expenditure center and type of expenditure. The same heads of accounts
will be used by all the states for the planning and budgeting process to ensure consistency
in reporting of expenditure.

Funds Flow

7.7     GOILeveZ: Funds from partners will be received in separate accounts (Special
Account or SA) maintained with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The account will be
denominated in currency of the respective credit/grants. MOF will maintain the accounts
in the RBI and transfer the rupee equivalent to the Consolidated Fund of India and would
provide adequate funds withm the budget of MHRD for release of funds to the states as
per their annual work plans (Chart 7.1).

7.8.    GO1to States: GO1will release funds based upon the approved annual plans of
the states and districts. The release will be in two installments. The first release will be
made soon after approval of the annual plan. Considering a 75:25 sharing arrangement
between GO1and state governments, the first installment will be half of GOI's share @e.,
37.5 percent). This amount will be released in a separatebank account maintained by the
SIS for the program. Similarlythe state govemment will release its proportionate share
to the SIS. The second installment will be released based upon demand from the state
(usually six months after the first release) in a similar manner. Additionally, this release
will take into account the expenditureincurred and a forecast of cash requirements for the
next half-year.

7.9.    State to Districts:A separatebank account is maintained by all district offices for
the program. The SIS will release funds to the district periodically based upon the
approved annual plan, statements of expenditures, and performance of districts in
periodic installment. The releases will also take into account the expenditure incurred till
the date of release.

7.10. District to sub-districts:District offices will release funds to VECs and BRCs at
shorter intervals. Ths release will be made in the bank accounts maintained by these
entities for this program. The release will be based upon their fund requirement and
reporting of expenditures out of the money advanced in the past. For civil works, money
will be released based upon achievement of 3-4 milestones (e.g., leveling of land,
construction up to plinth level, completion of the superstructure, finishing, etc.) for
construction. Releases for other purposes take into account past expenditures and a
forecast of future expenditures.

Information Systems

7.11. Computerization of the financial management system is not envisaged by GO1at
present. Accounting information is recorded under a manual system at all levels and
computers are used to a limited extent for compilation of information (through a
spreadsheet sohare) and transmission of the same to a higher level through floppy
disks/E-Mail.

Staffing

7.12. MHRD is already staffed with a Financial Advisor and a Chief Controller of
Accountswho have the overall responsibility for financial management/ book keeping of
the department, respectively. They are adequately supported by qualified, trained staff.
GO1 is appointing a full time Director (Finance) at the national level with exclusive
responsibility for SSA. The Director will be adequately supported by a team consisting
of GO1 staff. Technical Support Group consultants will provide additional support on
FM to states and GOI.

7.13. At the state level, the present capacity is variable. GO1has issued guidelines for
strengthening staffing of the Finance and Accounts and Internal Audit function at the
stateldistrict levels. The guidelines provide for a Controller Finance at the state level
supported by a team of five persons, and at the district level, a Finance and Accounts
Officer supportedby ateam of threepersons.

Capacity Building of the Finance and Accounts Function

7.14. FM capacity levels vary across the country and improving the quality of FM will
be critical to delivery of the program, especially as states with weak capacity are often
those with the greatest needs. Capacity building of FM staff is therefore an important
component of the SSAprogram.

7.15. In the Framework and the Manual MHRD has provided the states with policy
level guidance for FM capacity building which gives the states some flexibilityto assess
and address their training requirements. The Manual has been provided to all the
implementing units. Training, along with other management costs, is funded from a 6
percent allocation of total SSA resources. Delivery of FM training is supported by the
TSG and SIEMATs,which have some capacityto provide direct support to districts. The
State Finance Departments provide finance staff to SISs and district offices and so share
responsibility for FM capacity.
                                           64

7.16. MHRD management regularly monitors states' performance on FM and directs
them to take corrective action if required. Monitoring is carried out at various levels.
The EE Bureau in MHRD reviews FM performance across the program and the SIS
reviews FM at district and sub-district levels. FM performance can be tracked through
regular financial reporting (per the Manual), internal and external audit and concurrent
financial review. The Manual provides for regular reporting on FM staffing levels and
training provision. Information on FM capacitybuilding will be shared with the Partners
and discussed in JRMs.

AccountingPolicies and Procedure

7.17. A Manual on Financial Management and Procurement has been prepared. It
documentsthe accounting and financial management processes and procedures in detail.

7.18. Books of accounts for the project are maintained using double-entrybookkeeping
principles. Standard books of accounts (cash and bank books,journals, ledgers, etc.) are
maintained at the state and district levels on a manual basis. Bank reconciliations are
carried out on a monthly basis. Compilation of information at the district level is on a
standard spreadsheet software and in many cases,transmittedto the state level through E-
Mail. A similarprocess of compilationand transmissionto GO1takes place at each SIS.

7.19. A Chart of Accounts (activity list) has been developed to enable data to be
captured and classifiedby expenditurecenter and type of expenditure. This will be used
by all the implementing entitiesto ensure consistencyin recording of information.

7.20    The key issues that have been addressed in the design of the accounting policies
and procedures are:

        Release of funds to states and districts will be accounted for as advances in the
        books of accounts and treated as expenditures only upon submission of
        expenditureinformation.

        Releases of funds to entities below the district level will be accounted for as
        advances in the books of account (of the district office) and treated as
        expenditures only upon submission of expenditure information. These advances
        will be considered as Program Expenditures, eligible for claiming reimbursement
        from the Partners as explainedin paragraphs 7.29 to 7.34of ths Annex.

7.21. All accounting units will maintain CasWBank Book and Ledgers and cany out
bank reconciliation on a monthly basis. In addition, they will retain all vouchers, bills,
supportingdocuments and ensurethat the Bank pass books are regularlyupdated.

Internal Audit

7.22. Internal Auditswill be the responsibility of the Internal Audit Unit. This unit will
be staffed by persons drawn from the state audit cadres. In states where an in-house


                                           65

InternalAudit Team is not available, a firm of Chartered Accountantswill be engaged to
carry out the internal audit hnction asper a specified TOR.

7.23. Internal auditswill review and report on adequacy of internal controls, accounting
for and safeguard of assets, accuracy and propriety of transactions, bank reconciliation
activity, level of compliance with SSA financial norms, procurement procedures, etc.,
InternalAudit Reports will be submittedto the State ProjectDirector for necessary action
and also to the Executive Committeeof the SIS.

ExternalAudit

7.24. Audits of SISswill be done by a firm of Chartered Accountants. Selectionof the
firm of CharteredAccountantswill be based on criteria,which assess the size of the firms
in terms of the number and experienceof staff and relevant experience

7.25. The Audit will cover Program Financial Statements, including a Statement of
Receipt and Expenditure and a Balance Sheet. The Audit will cover the SISs, District
Project Offices and sub-districtunits selected on basis of a sample. Audits will be carried
out in accordance with TORS which are documented in the Manual and which meet
requirement of the partners. Based on need, GO1may augment the TOR, in which case it
will inform the Partners.

7.26. An Annual Report (on the working of the SIS) along with the Audited
AccountdAudit Report will be furmshed to GO1 within nine months of close of the
Financial Year.

7.27. Audit of the expenditure incurred at level of GO1will be subject to Audit by the
Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). In addition, accounts of the SIS shall also be
subject to provisions of the CAG's(Duties,Powers and Conditionsof Service)Act, 1971.

7.28. GO1 has agreed to provide the Partners with a Consolidated Report on Audit of
the program. This report will consolidate the Program Expenditure incurred under the
statehational components. The report will also consolidatethe key observations forming
part of the audit report of each state. Based on the key observations,Partnersmay request
GO1 to provide copies of audit reports of specific states. Thus, the following audit
reports will be monitored in the Audit Reports Compliance System(ARCS).

ProgramExpenditures and Eligible Expenditures

7.29. Program Expenditures are defined as expenditures on goods, works and services
related to the activitiesunder the SSAprogram. Eligible Expenditures for IDA financing
are defined as total Program Expenditures by GO1and by eligibleproject states and UTs
(Le., those whch sign a Letter of Undertaking with GOI) in excess of annual thresholds.
Thresholds will be set at the following levels or such other levels as the GO1 and the
Partnersmay agree:

           Rs. 1,500crores ($333million) for expenditureperiod April 03-March04
           Rs. 1,800crores ($400million) for expenditureperiod April 04-March 05
           Rs. 2,400 crores ($533 million) for expenditureperiod April 05-March 06
           Rs. 3,000 crores ($667million) for expenditureperiod April 06-March 07

DisbursementArrangements

7.30       Together, the partners will disburse against two-thirds of Eligible Expenditures.
The shares of the partners in total external financing would be 48 percent for IDA, 33
percent for DfID, and 19percent for EC. Disbursement of external funds is structured in
such a way that full disbursement of these funds could be achieved if total Program
Expenditures for SSA over the last four years of the lothPlan period reaches Rs. 15,766
crores ($3.5 billion). An illustrative scenario showing the estimated expenditure eligible
for reimbursement is presented in Table 7.2.

Notes:
(i) Disbursement is based on Rs. Crores, which the external partners will convert to their respective
      currencies. The Rs. Crores are rounded and disbursementfigures are indicativeonly.
(ii) This table uses GO1 fiscal years, whch are different from World Bank and EC fiscal years. GO1
      fiscal year is the same as the UK fiscal year.
(iii) The indicative figures given for DfID may exceed funds available in any one year, and therefore
     the overallproject contributionof 22 percent may vary on an annualbasis.
(iv) Ths table presents SSA expenditures that would allow the full amount of external funds to be

7.31. Given (i) IDA'S share in total external financing (48 percent), and (ii) the
Partners' total share in financing of Eligible Expenditures (two-thirds), IDA'S share of
Eligible Expenditures (defined in paragraph 7.30) will be 32 percent. DflD's share will
be 22 percent and EC's, 12.7percent.

7.32    With respect to total Program Expenditures,the contributionof externalPartners
is expected to be 30 percent, with GO1contributing45 percent and states 25 percent, as
illustratedin Table 7.3.

7.33    It is expected that the total level of GO1 funding that would be released for SSA
would exceed the amount indicated in Table 7.3 and could be in the order of Rs. 7500 to
8000 crores, with a corresponding contribution by states, to avoid any constraint on
implementation and allow for a possible acceleration of pace and higher level of
expenditure.

7.34 Apart from the initial advance (paragraph 7.34) disbursement will be made once
per year around July, for eligible expenditures incurred in the prior fiscal year.
Disbursements in the first year will be based on the audited reports, as reported in the
Consolidated Report of Audits, which is due in December 2004. Thereafter annual
disbursements will be based on FMRs, covering the previous fiscal year. The Program
Expenditures reported in the FMRs will be subject to confirmatiodcertification by the
annual audit reports of all implementingagencies. The GO1would submit to the partners
a Consolidated Report of Audits summarizing the findings and certifying total program
expenditures as reported in the individualaudit reports of all implementingagencies.Any
discrepanciesbetween the amounts of program expenditures reported by the FMRs and
those reported in the Consolidated Report on Audits will lead to adjustments of
subsequent disbursements, to be recovered from or reimbursed to GO1 through the next
disbursement in the followingschedule:

 * Retroactivefinancing

7.35     The followingpoints highlight somekey disbursement features:

     e   The Credit Effectiveness date is around June 04. TheAssociation has agreedto
         provide an advance of 15percent upon effectiveness, expected in July 2004 to
         meet the EligibleExpendituresincurredby GO1and eligibleProject States and
         UTs during the project period. This advancewill be recovered from the final
         disbursementdue in 2006/07.

     e   If the Consolidated Report on Audits, which is due in December, is not received
         by June of the followingyear, no further disbursement will be made until the
         outstandingConsolidatedReport is received. However, GO1will still be required
         to submitthe FMRs on the due dates.

     a   When audit reports indicatehigher levels of EligibleExpenditureswhen
         comparedto the FMRs for the sameperiod, the excesswill be added to the next
         report based disbursement (as in paragraph 7.33); and

     e   When audit reports indicate lower levels of eligibleexpenditures against the
         relevant FMRs, an adjustmentwill be made to the next disbursementby
         reduction (as in paragraph 7.33).

Reportingand Monitoring

7.36     Program Expenditureswill be reported by the district to the state and by the state
to GOI. Expenditure Statements of all the stateswill be consolidated by GOI, alongwith
its own expenditure, for submission to the partners as a single statement for the entire
program. Reporting will be on a semi-annual basis with FMRs due within 90 days of
completion of reporting period, i.e., the end of June and the end December. The
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) will include state-wise and activity-wise
expenditure for the previous half year and year-to-date. Additionally, information on
physical progress achieved (number of teachers, progress of civil works, training, text
books, etc.) will also be presented as part of FMRs.




     3 Since the closingdate is December 07, adjustment could only be made by April 08, which
        '

is the expirationof the disbursement grace period.

Plan for Joint Review Mission

7.37  From a financial management perspective,the project will need intensive review,
looking at internalcontrols,fund flows, auditingarrangements,training, etc. This will be
through desk review/field visits. Partner agreed to monitor FM performance during
program implementation. Reports will be provided during JRMs with informationon the
following:

ImplementationArrangements

8.1.     The SSA program is implemented by State Implementation Societies working
within a national structure, but in a highly decentralized setting through four tiers, viz.,
states, districts,blocks and villages. (SeeAnnex 6 for details).

ProcurementArrangements

8.2.     The implementation of the SSA entails procurement of textbooks, Teaching
Learning Equipments (TLE), Teaching Learning Materials (TLMs), h t u r e , school
equipment, materials required for teacher's training, office equipments, computers and
accessories, improvement of school facilities, construction of primary and upper primary
buildings, additional classrooms, toilets, drinking water facilities, boundary walls,
separationwalls, electrification, construction of Block Resource Centers (BRCs)/Cluster
Resource Centers (CRCs), maintenance and repair of school buildings, construction of
State Institute of Educational Management and Training (SlEMATs), luring of experts
for specific tasks such as in-service training of teachers, principals, members of the
village education council and monitoring and evaluation. Since the financing of SSA is
based on state and district-generated annualwork plans, it is not possible to determinethe
total value of works, goods, and servicesprocured duringthe life of the project. Table 8.1
provides the breakdown by indicative categories of expenditure according to the
approved SSA outlays for 2003-2004. However, the distribution of expenditure could
change from year to year.

Procurement Legal Framework

8.5.    The Constitution of India (Seventh Schedule) lists specific subjects in which the
Union Government or the State Government alone can make laws and concurrent
subjects in which both the Union and State Government can make laws. Procurement
under contracts falls in the concurrent list.

8.6     Procurement of goods, works and services by the Government of India and the
State Governmentsis regulated only by the contract governed by the Indian Contract Act
and the Sale of Goods Act and, in special cases, by the Essential Commodities Act.

Country Procurement Assessment Reports (CPAR) and State Procurement Assessment
Reports (SPARS)

8.7.    A CPAR was prepared in the year 2001 which provides an understanding of the
national procurement system. A SPAR was also prepared for the states of Karnataka,
Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh in 2002 and 2003. Based on these
assessments, the existingbasic framework of rules and procedures in India requires open
tenders, open to all qualified firms without discrimination, use of non-discriminatory
tender documents, public bid opening and selection of the most advantageous tender
tahng all factors (preferably pre-disclosed) into consideration.        The weaknesses
identified in the CPMSPARs are: absence of a dedicated policy-making department,
absence of a legal framework, absence of credible complaint/challenge/grievance
procedures, absence of standard tender documents, preferential treatment in procurement
and negotiation, delay in tender processing and award decision, and the two-envelope
system.

Assessment of existingprocurementprocedures to assess acceptabilityfor use under SSA

8.8.   As all the 28 States and the 7 Union Territories are participating in the SSA
program, the review of existingprocurement policies and procedures was carried out on a
samplebasis for the three states of Haryana, Punjab and Tamil Nadu to identify areas for
strengthening of the State Procurement Laws and Regulationsrequired to allow their use
for procurement under the SSA. The states were selected with the agreement of the
Ministry of Human Resource Development and the partners. These three states represent
10percent of the studentpopulation.

8.9.   Based on the findings of the CPAR, SPARs and the assessment of the three states,
the funding partners concur with the GO1 that the procurement legal framework are
                                             74

generally acceptable for procurement under SSA and guarantee adequate transparency.
The areas for strengthening have been identified in the report "Review of Procurement
Procedures under Sarva Shiksha Abhyan (SSA)" and will be addressed in due course
throughthe GOI's own procurement reform programs in the states.

8.10. The procurement procedures of the three states were studied and the findings are
briefly describedbelow.

TamilNadu

8.11. Tamil Nadu has well-established procedures for government procurement dating
back to more than 50 years. These have been codified in the Tamil Nadu Financial Code,
Public Works Department Code and Public Works Accounts Code. These Codes and
Manuals regulated the bidding procedures reasonably but some of the provisions are now
outdated in light of today's global context of transparency in bidding. In general, the
rules prescribe wide publicity of requests forbids, public opening of tenders and award of
contract to the lowest tenderer.

8.12. Aimed at bringing uniformity and transparency in procurement processes, the TN
Government has taken three important initiatives the appointment in 1996 of a high-
                                                      -
level Committee to examine and recommend procedural reforms and other measures for
eliminating corruption in the administration, the adoption of a law in 1997on the Right
to Information, and in 1998on Transparency in Tenders. In addition, the passing of the
Information Technology Act, 2000, by the Union Parliament provides another instrument
for enhancing efficiency and transparency in government procurement through speedy
introduction of e-commerce.

8.13. All procurement for the government departmentsand undertakingsare coveredby
the Transparencyin Tenders Act, 1998.Under this Act procedures are established for bid
advertisingin Newspapers and Websites for generaluse of standardbid document, for the
specification of eligibility criteria, for public bid opening and for criteria for evaluation
and award of contracts for the use of a Bid security in a specified form. Preference to
some categories of bidders such as government undertakings, small scale industries, etc.,
is allowed.

8.14. The SPAR for Tamil Nadu was completed in 2001. The report identifies areas of
deficiency in the current procurement system. The TN Government has examined
various recommendations of the report and has identified the priority areas where efforts
should be taken to improve the current procurement system. An action plan for
upgrading the procurement system has been formulated by the government based on the
recommendation in the SPAR. Full implementationof the plan is expected to be spread
over three years.

Punjab

8.15. The procedures and Rules for the purchase of stores by all departments and
offices of the Government of Punjab is regulated by Punjab Financial Rules (PFR). The
procurement of works is generally carried out by the Department of Public works and is
                                              75

regulated by rules in Financial Handbook No. 3. (Department Financial Rules relating to
Department of Public Works and Forest Public Works Department Code and Accounts
Code 111).

8.16. The PFR establishes that every Government employee incurring or sanctioning
expenditure from the revenues of the state should be guided by high standards of
financial propriety. Each Head of Department is responsible for enforcing financial order
of strict economy at every step. The PFR broadly cover the system of indenting stores on
the Controller of Stores, the system of dealing with these indents by the Controller, as
also the procedure for inviting bids and asking for bid deposits, samples, bid fees, other
modes of purchases as alternatives, powers of departments for local purchases, the system
of price preference to be followed, methodology of rate contracts, payment to suppliers
and the way to deal with exceptions and departures from the general rules in special
circumstances.

8.17. Procurement and execution of works by PWD is governed by the department's
own manuals. In essence, these manuals, combinedwith departmental instructions issued
from time to time, lay down in detail the procurement and inspection procedures, along
with the system of maintaining accounts and registers, and the rules for payment to
contractors. These procedures generally provide for "Contract Agreement Forms",
"General Principle for Operation of Contracts", "Preparation of contracts", "Register of
Contracts", "Quotations", "Communication of Approval", and "Acceptance or Rejection
of Tenders". In addition, the rules lay down detailed procedures to be adopted for
specifying the amount of earnest money, security deposits, security for supply of
materials, interest on and refund of security deposits, issue of material to contractors,
recoveries from contractors, advances to contractors, intermediate payments, arbitration
and disputeresolution, etc.

8.18. It is understood that Punjab is soon going to bring about a bill in Vidhan Sabha
similarto TamilNadu's Transparencyand TenderingAct.

Haryana

8.19. Procedures and rules applicableto Haryana are generally similarto rules in Punjab.

ProcurementProcedures and Methods

8.20. To strengthen the capacity of the procuring agencies at all levels, in conducting
procurement, the GO1has, in consultation with the stakeholders,prepared a "Manual on
Financial Management and Procurement under SSA"(the Manual). The Manual lays
down guidelines generally as per the procedures followed in Bank-fimded procurement.
The guidelines contained in the Manual, and as modified fiom time to time, have been
issued to the states for Financial and Procurement Implementation under SSA.

8.21. The Manual lists the followingprocurement methods for procurement under SSA.
The thresholds indicatedagainst each method have been agreed with GOI.



                                             76

Procurement of Goods and Worh

8.22. Given the size and spread of operation, it has been agreed that a copy of the
Annual Procurement Plan prepared by MHRD would be provided to the Joint Review
Mission.

      All procurement of goods above US$50,000 and works above US$20,000 will be
      carried out as per the open tendering procedures prescribed in the Manual. Per the
      Manual, Open tender is the competitive bidding procedure normally used for
      public procurement in India. The proceduresprovide for adequate competition in
      order to ensure reasonable prices and the methods used in evaluation of tenders
      and the award of contracts shall be made known to all bidders and not be applied
      arbitrarily. The open tender does not preclude the foreign bidders from
      participation. The steps generally followed are notificatiodadvertising, issuance
      of bidtender document, submission of tender document, public opening of tender,
      evaluation, selection of lowest evaluated responsive bidder based on post
      qualification, negotiation (when necessary), contract award and contract
      performance.

      For a limited amount of goods, namely IT equipment, in aggregate estimated to
      cost US$20-25 million, the package size may in a few casesreach US$2.0 million
      per contract. Because major foreign IT firms are well represented in India, which
      would ensure a reasonable level of competition, it has been agreed that the
      procurement of this equipment will follow the open tender procedures contained
      in the Manual. The estimated cost per contract for all goods, except the IT
      equipment referred to above, and all works is expected to be less than
      US$300,000.

      Goods estimated to cost US$50,000 equivalent or less per contract may be
      procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparing price quotation
      obtained from at least three suppliers following the limited tendering process
      prescribed in the Manual. Per the Manual, Limited Tendering is a procurement
      method based on comparing price quotations obtained from several suppliers,
      usually at least three, to ensure competitive prices. The request for quotations
      shall be made indicating the description, specification and quantity of goods as
      well as desired deliverytime and place. Quotationsmay also be obtainedby telex
      or facsimile. The evaluation shall follow sound public or private sectorpractices.
      The terms of the accepted offer shallbe incorporatedin a purchase order.

      Goods estimated to cost less than US$30,000 equivalent which are specifically
      certified as of proprietary nature or only a particular firm is the manufacturer of
      the articles demanded and textbooks estimated to cost up to US$300,000
      equivalent or less per contract may be procured following single tender
     procedures, whch is obtaining tender from single source. Goods includingbooks,
     teachmg materials, school facility improvement, hiring of vehicles and operation
      and maintenance of equipment may be procured under contracts awarded under
     the single tender system. Rate contracts of Director General of Supplies and

                                          77

        Disposals (DGS&D) and Rate Contracts of State Government shall also be an
        appropriatemethod under single tender system.

        Purchase of articles or group of articles estimated to cost less than US$l,OOO per
        contract may be made without invitingtenderdquotation.

    0   Works estimated to cost US$20,000 equivalent or less per contract may, as per
        the Manual:

         be procured by direct contract, without competition (sole source) following
         singletender method;

         be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded under limited
         tender process on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three (3)
         qualified domestic contractors in responseto a written invitation. The invitation
         shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic specification,
         the required completion date, a basic form of agreement and relevant drawing
         where applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the
         lowest price quotation for the required work and who has the experience and
         resources to completethe contract successfully.

         be procured under the unit/piecerate through qualified contractors or registered
         non-governmental organization, other beneficiary association or Village
         Panchayats.

         be procured by communities carrying out the works themselves and taking up
         technical/managerial assistance from government agencies, NGOs or individual
         experts.

Selection of Consultants

8.23. All Consulting Services will be selected as per the procedures prescribed in the
Manual. The main consideration governing the selection process prescribed are (a) the
need for high quality services; (b) the need for economy and efficiency; and (c) the
importance on transparency. Service Contractsin SSA may cover hiring of services such
as housekeeping and security services for construction of SIEMAT. They also include
academic, technical and resource support provided by institutions/organizations in all
areas including research, evaluation, monitoring and supervision of civil works. It is
expectedthat the maximum value of consultancycontractswill be below US$lOO,OOOper
contract.

ProcurementImplementation Capacity

8.24. The procurement at the SchoolKommunity level will be handled by the
VEC/SMC/GP;at BRC/CRC level by the BRC/CRC coordinators; at District level by the
District Program Officer; and at State Level by the State Implementing Society. The
existing procurement capacity and the recommended strengthening measures are


                                            78

described in the subsequent paragraph under the heading "Procurement Capacity
Assessment of ImplementingAgenciesunder SSA".

Procurement capacity assessment of implementing agencies under SSA

8.25. In the preparation of SSA, a procurement capacity assessment has been carried
out at the sectoral level, covering the SSA procurement activities on a sample basis for
the five states of Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.
Collectively, they account for a large percentage of the total student population. The
assessment was conducted at all levels of SSA implementation -State,               District,
BlocMCluster and Village level. Because DPEP has been in implementation in 294
districts of 18 states, the SSA has a good foundation on which to build. The five states
selected include both DPEP states and non-DPEP states (Punjab) so that a broader view
can be obtained. The assessment covered the procurement capacity (clear definition of
functions and delegation of authority, staffing, internal procedures) of the implementing
institutionsresponsible for procurement at each level.

8.26. The assessment report identifies: (i) the need for improvement in procurement
capacity at the Village level committees by providing appropriate training and detailed
manuals; (ii) availability of a well-established capacity of the Institutions in processing
large civil works; (iii) sufficient institutional capacity for procurement of papers and
computersthat could be improved by developing Standard Bidding Documents; and (iv)
the need to prepare guidelinesfor the procurement of smallvalue items.

8.27. Based on the findings of the CPAR, SPARS and the assessment of the five states,
the funding partners concur with the GO1that the procurement implementationcapacity
is generally acceptable for procurement under SSA. The areas for strengthening have
been identified in the report on "Review of Existing Procurement Capacity under Sarva
Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA)" and will be addressed in due course of implementation of the
SSA.

Auditing of Procurement

8.28. The partners have agreed that the audit will be carried out as per the system and
proceduresof the GO1and the respective states as per the provisionsin the Manual.

8.29. The auditingwill be done in the followingmanner:

Internal Audit

8.30. InternalProcurementAudit, as is the casewith the internalFinancialManagement
Audit (as described in Annex 7 of the PAD and Chapter VI11 of the Manual) is the
responsibility of the Internal Audit Unit. In states where an internal audit team is not
available, and with a view to strengthen the in-house internal audit system, qualified
CharteredAccountant firmswill be engaged for carrying out the internal audit function.

8.31. The internal audit of all District Project Offices and Sub-DistrictUnits should be
conductedat least once in a period of three years.
                                             79

8.32. Procurement procedures adopted for civil works, goods and consultancy services
should be reviewed by the internal auditors (or by Chartered Accountants as per a
specified TOR) and it should be ensured that the correct procurement procedure is
followed for each procurement. Further it should be ensured that records of all
procurement arrangements, works, purchase orders, invoices, receipts, stock registers,
etc., areproperly maintained, duly linked and retained.

8.33. The Internal Audit Report shall be placed before the State Executive Committee.
Discrepancies noticed in the Internal audit should be reported to the State Project
Director for taking necessary remedial measures.

Audit by the CharteredAccountant Firm

8.34. The State Project Director shall cause the annual accounts of the Society to be
prepared by a date not later than June 30 and after approval by the Executive Committee
of the Society. He shall have the accounts audited annually by a Chartered Accountant
appointed for the purpose by the Executive Committeein accordance with the provisions
of the SocietiesRegistrationAct applicableto the state.

8.35. The TOR of the Chartered Accountant firm to be hired by the state will include a
procurement audit.

External Audit

8.36. Audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India: The accounts of the
Society and the procurement compliance of the Society shall be subject to the provisions
of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India (Duties, Powers and Conditions
of Service) Act, 1971, as amended from time to time and which also provides for a
special audit/performanceaudit of Societiesby the CAG to be undertaken as necessary.

8.37. In addition the Elementary Education Bureau in MHRD shall cause a post review
of the contracts awarded on procurement of goods, works and services by the program
implementing agencies at all levels on a random basis. For this purpose, the GO1 has
hired the services of an independent firm. All documents relating to the award of
contract are required to be retained by the project's implementing agencies and made
available to the firm. As per the TOR of the firm, six states will be subject to the review
annually. The duration of the consultancyis for two years. The firm may select any 2-3
purchase items and do a thorough review of the procurement procedures followed, assess
violations, if any, and physically verify items purchased. This type of procurement audit
will cover one major item at the Society level and the remaining items at
district/BRC/Schoollevel as deemed fit by the firm.

8.38. GO1 will share all reports of the above-mentioned external audits with the
partners through the Joint Review Missions (JRMs). GO1 will review the reports for a
period of one year and consider, modification to the TOR, if required which would be
sharedwith the Partners.


                                             80

8.39. Cases of non-compliance will be reported to the relevant authorities for necessary
remedial actions.

8.40. In addition, the funding agencies reserve the option to post review contracts in
consultationwith GOI.

Misprocurement

8.41    The goods, works and services that have not been procured in accordancewith the
prescribed procedures outlined in the Manual or other State Government Procedures, as
the case may be, shall be treated as misprocurement. The expenditure incurred on such
procurement shallnot be eligiblefor financing from the SSA funds.

ComplaintHandling Mechanism

8.42. In order to deal with the complaints received from contractorshppliers
effectively, a complaint handling mechanism is available at both the national and state
level. On receipt of complaints, immediate action is initiated to redress grievances. All
complaints are dealt with at levels higher than that of the level at which the procurement
process is being undertaken. Complaints and the allegations made in the complaints are
thoroughly enquired into and if found correct, appropriate remedial measures are taken
by the appropriateauthorities.

8.43. In cases where an individual staff is found responsible, suitable disciplinary
proceedings areto be initiated against such staffunder the Civil ServiceConduct Rules at
national level or the Classification, Control and Appeals Rules at the State Level. The
receipt of any illegal gratificationby staff is to be considered as misconduct and results in
disciplinaryproceedings against such staff, in additionto penalties under the law.

8.44. The existing provisions under the law, the discipline and appeal rules and the
powers of the Central Vigilance Commission are to be strictly followed to deal with the
complaintsof contractorshppliers.

Frequency of Procurement Supervision MissionProposed

8.45. Procurement supervision shall be part of the JRMs which will be undertaken once
every six months.

                       Annex 9. Economicand FinancialAnalysis

9.1.    Investment in elementary education is one of the key solutions to breaking the
vicious cycle of poverty in India. It is widely acknowledged in international literature
that completing primary education has a major impact on economic and social
development. The SSA program strives to enhance the positive economic and social
impacts by extending support for the entire elementary sub-sector,i.e., Grades 1-8 to the
entire country.

9.2.   Private Rates of Return. Completingprimary and elementary education has high
rates of return to the individual. There is widespread international evidence to support
that the private returns are, in fact, higher in developing countries like India than in
developed countries. Private returns are high because completing this basic level of
education enhances the wage-earning capacity of the individual (Tilak, 1987; Acharya
1995). Improving the quality of education at this level can further enhance wage-earning
capacity (Azariadis and Drazen, 1990). The SSA program seeks to improve both
completionrates and the qualityof education.

9.3.   Social Returns and Externalities. The rates of return to society(social returns) are
also high for elementary education as there are significant positive externalities to an
educated population (Psacharopoulos, 1994). There is a wealth of international literature
on the externalities associated with elementary education (Sen and Sengupta, 1983;
Cochrane and Farid, 1984; Bourne and Walker, 1991; Visaria, 1993, Dasgupta, 1990).
These range from improved health outcomes such as lower infant mortality rates and
better nutrition, to lower fertility rates and better health seeking behavior. Elementary
education is thus beneficial to society, thereby making government investment in and
external supportof this sector apriority.

9.4.   Poverty Alleviation and Equity. Since elementary education has high private as
well as social rates of return, it also has a long term impact on alleviatingpoverty. This
impact is both direct and indirect. Directly, a better educated workforce earns higher
wages. Indirectly, lower fertility rates and better health outcomes improve human
development indicators and reduce poverty (when it is defined more broadly than just
`incomepoverty'. It enhances individual `capabilities'(to use the Senterminology). The
SSA program also seeks to enhance equity by targeting investments at deprived groups
such as scheduledcaste and tribe children and girls.

Cost Benefit Analysis of SSA

9.5.   The SSA program seeks to universalize elementary education for all children in
India in line with the internationally ratified Millennium Development Goals and the
national constitutional amendment making elementary education a hndamental right. It
makes available an holistic package of inputs to provide access for all children, and to
improvethe quality and management of elementary education.




                                              82

9.6.    The cost benefit analysis done for the project found an internal rate of return

$8.7billion using a discount rate of 12percent.
(IRR)of about 22.4percent and the net present value ofthenet economicbenefit is about

9.7.    The benefits of the project are estimated to be composed of two streams. The first
is the increased number of students who completeprimary and upper primary school thus
getting higher wages than if they had not completed these levels of schooling. The
second stream of benefits is an estimated small increase in wages for all upper primary
school graduates due to improved quality of schooling. Since the quantitative analysis
here is limited to the financial benefits due to higher wages only, this provides a lower
bound to the economic benefits of the project. As is widely known, acquiring good
quality elementary education also has many positive externalities such as lower fertility
rates, and improved health-seekingbehavior. These cannot be quantified easily. Thus,
the actual economic rate of return for the project wouldbe higher than 22.4 percent.

Benefits Stream

9.8.    The benefits stream, as explained above, is estimated fkom the increased wages
due to a higher number of primary and upper primary school graduates and also from
slightly higher wages for the latter due to better quality schooling. The increase in the
number of primary and upper primary school graduates is one of the key goals of the SSA
program. It is expected that this will occur for two reasons. The first is the expected
increase in enrollment (particularly of girls and other disadvantaged groups) due to the
efforts of the program to reach out to all chldren via communitymobilization campaigns,
enrollment drives, greater involvement of village education committees, and provision of
schools within one kilometer of every habitation. In addition, the SSA program focuses
considerableattention and financeson improvingthe quality and efficiencyof elementary
education. The focus on quality is evident in the SSA norms which provide for one
teacher for every forty children, the provision of free textbooks and supplementary
teaching learningmaterial,provision of regular in-servicetrainingto teachers, and special
provisions for disabled chldren, for example. It is expected that improving the quality,
as well as community mobilization, will reduce the hgh repetition and dropout rates.
This would result in higher completion rates and an increased number of primary and
upper primary school completers. In addition,it is assumed that the increase in quality of
schooling will marginally improve wages that upper primary graduates can expect in the
labor market, also adding to the benefits stream.

9.9.    The following are the assumptions used in estimating the benefits stream for the
cost benefit analysis:

        The population of 6-13 year olds4has been projected using the projections for
        1996-2016 by the Registrar General (Ministry of Home Affairs, GOI). The
        official projections have been computed for the age groups 5-9 and 10-14 years.
        These have been appropriatelymodified to estimate projections for the 6-10 year
        old and 11-13 year old age groups (the target groups for primary and upper
        primary grades, respectively).


      This age grouprefers to children between their sixthbirthdayand fourteenthbirthday.

                                             83

 Next, the enrollment for the age groups 6-10 and 11-13 year olds is projected.
 Until 2004, the enrollment projections from the 10th Plan working group on
 elementary education are used. Beyond this year, it is estimated that enrollment
 will increase by approximately 3.3 million children per year. According to this
 simulation, the elementary education gross enrollment ratio GER is 101 percent
 in 2007. After this year, the elementary GER is increased at about 3 percent a
 year until it stabilizes at 110percent in 2010 to account for some underage and
 overage chldren in the system.

0Projections are also done for the number of students completing primary and
 upper primary grades. The proportion of children completingprimary and upper
 primary grades used as a base is 61.4 and 55.8 percent, respectively (National
 Family Health Survey 11, 1998-99). Since SSA is putting a lot of emphasis on
 quality, completion rate is projected to increase by 2 percent a year from 1999
 until 2002, by 3 percent per year from 2003 to 2005, by 4 percent per year from
 2006 to 2007 and by 6 percent per year afterwards for primary and the last
 number changed to 5 percent a year for upper primary where it is much more
 difficult to raise completion rates. Based on these assumptions, 100 percent
 primary completion is achieved in 2009/10 and 100 percent upper primary
 completionis achieved in 2011/12.

 A wage equation is estimated to compute the wages associated with different

 Survey on employment are used for estimating this regression equation. It is
 levels of completed schooling. Data from the 55thround of the National Sample

 assumed that there is no additional benefit in terms of increased wages to
 additional years of schooling; only to additional completed levels of schooling.
 Thus, as mentioned earlier, the economicbenefits arise from increased wages due
 to higher number of children completing primary and upper primary grades.
 Increased enrollment does not directly lead to any economic benefit. However,
 increased enrollment does have an indirect effect by increasing the number of
 children completing primary and upper primary school. In addition, the reduced
 repetition and dropout rates, i.e., increased completion rates also increase the
 number of students completingprimary and upper primary school. Finally, it is
 assumed that after the first five years of the project, better quality of schooling
 leads to a 1 percent increase in the wages received by all students completing
 upper primary school. The unemploymentrate is assumed to remain at 5 percent.

Economic Costs

9.10. Economic costs of the project include: (i) the project cost from 2003/04 to
2006/07 of $3.5 billion; (ii) the private costs for the students, and (iii) the opportunity
cost of students' foregone earnings by going to school instead of working. An exchange
rate of 45 rupees to $1 was used. Data from the 1995196 National Sample Survey are
used to estimatethe private cost. The private cost per studentper year accordingto these
data was Rs. 622 for primary school and Rs. 978 for upper primary school. These are
converted to constant 2003 rupees. The private per student cost is multiplied by the
number of additional pupil years due to the project to get the cost of the project. The
opportunity cost of a student'stime is estimated to be the wages foregoneby the student
attending school instead of working. It is estimated that about 20 percent of the children
in the age group 6 to 13years would have been working for wages.

9.11. Using the above benefits and cost streams, the project has an internal rate of
return (IRR) of 22.4 percent with a net present value of US$8.7 billion using a discount
rate of 12percent (See Table 9.1 below). Tlvs is a fairly conservative scenario in terms
of increase in completionrates. If the completionrate increases faster, the rate of return
to the project would be even higher.

SensitivityAnalysis

9.12. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determinehow sensitivethe rate of return
of the project is to the unemploymentrate. The unemployment rate is varied and the rate
of return is estimatedusing a 12percent unemployment rate.

9.13. The results of the sensitivityanalysis are reported in Table 9.1 below. The rate of
return of the project does not vary widelybetween the two scenarios. It is 22.4 percent in
the optimistic scenario and 21.1 percent in the pessimistic scenario. Thus, the rate of
return is reasonablyrobust to changes in externalconditions (unemploymentrate).

Fiscal SustainabilityAnalysis

9.14. In 2002, InQa spent 4.3 percent of its GDP on education ($17.7 billion), of which
42 percent went to elementary education ($7.5 billion). This is above the 3 percent
average for low-income economies, but lower than the 5 percent average of OECD
countries. For more than a decade, India has set itself a goal of raising public spending
on education to 6 percent of GDP. The lothPlan reiterates the country's commitment to
doing so, although it remains a target that is yet to be met. SSA is a multi-Plan, centrally
sponsored scheme, jointly financed by the Central and State Governments in a cost-
sharingratio of 85:15 during the last year of the gthPlan (FY2001), 75:25 during the loth
Plan (FY2002-06) and 5050 during the 1lthPlan (FY2007-11). The additional financing
provided through this project would increase total elementary education spending by
about 10 percent per year in FY2004, and 9.2-9.3 percent in FY2005 and 06 (Refer to
Table 9.2). This fiscal sustainability analysis is carried out at two levels: (a) the
aggregated national level and (b) statelevel for fourteen major states.

9.15. The Aggregate National Level. This analysis covers Central government
expenditure on education and aggregated state level expenditure on education. The
analysis is based on the following four assumptions5: (i) the Central government will
contribute 75 percent of the SSA funds during the lothPlan period; (ii) the Central
government will contribute to the cost sharing ratio of 5050 with the states during the
11th Plan period; (iii) the Central Government will help sustain the incremental recurrent
costs from the lothPlan; and (iv) the states will absorb the full incrementalrecurrent costs
from FY2012 while the Center's share would end with the completion of the program.
An analysis of the fiscal sustainability of SSA at the national aggregate level will focus
on how large the aggregate incremental recurrent costs would be as a share of the states'
total expenditureon elementaryeducation.

9.16. It is estimated that $3.5 billion will be released and spent during the life of the
project from April 1, 2003 to March 31, 2007. The incremental recurrent costs are
estimatedto be 50percent of the total program costs because of the followingreasons: (i)
The SSA Framework caps civil works at 33 percent of total district plan costs and
management costs at 6 percent, and (ii) the Education Guarantee Schemes and other

       How the llthPlan will finance SSA is likely to be contingent on the implementation
progress and target achievement of the lothPlan. The assumptions discussed above are based on
ajudgment of a likely scenario.
                                              86

various transitional strategies are assumed to be phased out as more children are
mainstreamedinto regular elementary schools.

9.17. The aggregate level analysis involves three scenarios with the following

base-case growth at 5 percent, (ii) medium growth at 6 percent (World Bank, 2003b), and
assumptionsof average GDP growth rates at the national level per annumup to 2024: (i)
(iii)hgh growth at 8 percent which is the GOI's own target6. The assumptionssharedby
all three scenarios are: (i) the total public spending on elementaryeducationwill stabilize
around 1.68 percent of GDP7 from 2005 through 2024; and (ii) state spending on
elementary education will be 85 percent of total public spending on elementary
education.

9.18. Table 9.2 presents the slow growth scenario to show that even in a slow growing
economy, the states collectivelywould have to contributebetween $163-239million each
year in the next four years (or 2.1-2.8 percent of total state spending on elementary
educationper year) and continue to contributebetween $250-305 million each year in the
llthPlan period (or 2.5 percent of total state spending on education). After 2012, the
states would have to absorb about $640 million, based on the assumption that SSA-
related expenditurewould grow at the same rate as the GDP. This would amount to 4.3
percent of the total state expenditures on elementaryeducationthrough 2024. The share
of incremental recurrent costs to be absorbed due to the implementationof SSA and the
increased developmentexpenditure flows into the states seem to be relativelymanageable
in the aggregate.

9.19. Given this fairly optimistic growth forecasts for India, and the fact that today the
GO1 has built-up foreign exchange reserves of over $100 billion, in spite of having a
budget deficit that is over 10 percent of GDP, it is likely that the GO1 will still be in a
good position to make resourcesavailableto reach the SSAgoals.




       These long-term growth projections are based on some shorter term scenarios defined in India:
Sustaining Reform, Reducing Poverty. The World Bank. Oxford University Press 2003. The scenarios
project growth rates of 5 percent for the 10" Plan period under the base case, i.e., with no further reforms
measures undertaken, and at 6.5 percent over the same period under full reform measures. Our high case
scenariois the Government's own growthtarget for this Plan period of 8 percent.
       1.7percent of GDP from2005 through 2024 represents about 40 percent of total public spending on
educationallocatedto elementaryeducation.

    9.20.      State Level. There is a complex system of fiscal transfers between the Central
    State governments as has been described in Annex 1. Resource availability for the
    education sector is determined by the division of taxation powers and the arrangements
    for fiscal transfers between the two tiers of government. The fiscal posture of many
    Indian states has become less rosy in the last decade, this is notwithstandingmeasures to
    curb state expenditures. This makes it imperative to analyze SSA sustainability at the
    state level. Thus, ths analysis attemptsto understand the risks posed due to the potential
    difficulty of states' to ensure their counterpart funding towards SSA program, and the
    specific goals of the program.

    9.21. Participation in SSA requires state governments to commit to maintaining as a
    lower bound, in real terms, elementary education expendituresat the FY1999/2000level,
   whle contributing a matching fund towards the program's implementation as described
   in Paragraph 9.15.


                                                       88

9.22. To assess whether states would have the capacity to sustain the incremental
recurrent cost incurred by implementing SSA in the respective states, this analysis
projects up to 2024 for 14major states' the following: (i) growth in state GDP (SGDP);
(ii) statetotal and elementaryeducation budgetary allocations;and (iii) and required state
allocations for SSA'. These budget projections on elementary education are assumed to
be a function of the SGDP growth rates. Thus the projected GDP growth rates are state-
specific.

9.23. Table 9.3 presents the states' per capita GDP, total and elementary education
expenditure as a percent of SGDP in 2000/01, as well as the projected SSA expenditures
as a percentageof state elementaryeducation spending. Assumptions are made regarding
the growth of State GDP, and the budgetary allocation made at the state level towards
education in total, and elementary education in particular. There are two scenarios for
growth in SGDP, viz., (a) Base Case SGDP Growth (BC-SGDP) and (b) High SGDP
(H-SGDP) Growth'o, and two scenarios for changes in budgetary allocation to all
education and elementary education, viz.,(i) Base Case Budgetary Allocation (BCBA)
and (ii)High Case Budgetary Allocation (HCBA).

9.24. Under the BC-SGDP scenario, the SGDP is projected to grow until 2024 at the
same rate as the state's mean growth between FY1994/95 and FY2000/01. Under the
H-SGDP scenario, states are projected to grow at a rate that is 2 percentagepoints higher
than this average over FY1994/95 and FY2000/01. Under the BCBA scenario, state
expenditures on all education, and the share of ths on elementary education as a
percentage of SGDP, are assumed to remain unchanged from their FY2000/2001 level.
Under the HC BA scenario, by the year 2020, we assume that state expenditures on
education as apercent of SGDP rises to 6 percent", and that the share of elementary
education as a proportion of ths rises to 50 percent (for all states whose initial allocation
to educationwas less than 6 percent and whose share of elementaryexpenditureswas less
than 50 percent)12. This provides a total of four possible scenario^'^ and these are
illustrated in Table 9.3.

      'The  Major States include the 14 states shown in Table 9.3 and Goa. The Special Category States
(whch includes the NortheasternStates, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and J a m u and Kashmir)
were not part of the sustainabilityanalysis. The deterioration in fiscal situation has been acute in these
special category states following the 1997-98 Pay Commission reforms. However, the cost sharing
arrangements for special category states are 90:10, with the Central Government covering a much larger
share, and thus were not included in this analysis.
       Assuming that SSA will be the only centrally sponsored scheme towards elementary education till
2025.

      l1 A figure that has been repeated in numerousplan documents as the level of spending that the GO1
(and states)hope to acheve on education.
      12 The increasedallocationtowards educationto 6 percent of SGDPby 2020 is quite reasonablegiven
that several states governments of even the poorer states, like Blhar, Rajasthan and Orissa already allocate
more than 4 percent of SGDP to education. The assumptionsthat 50 percent of total public expenditureson
education at the state level go towards elementary education is different from the aggregate national level
analysis,but allows for a proper allocations and expansionof the system.
          These include BC-SGDP&BC-BA,              BC-SGDP&HC-BA,           H-SGDP&BC-BA         and H-
SGDP&HC-BA.

9.25. The Central government will continue the cost-sharing arrangement with the
states at the ratio of 5050 during the llthPlan period. The amount of Central
government assistanceis expected to match the incrementalrecurrent costs that the states
would have to absorb by implementing SSA in the lothPlan period, and this is estimated
to be about 50 percent of the current Plan periods total investment. This continued
Central support after the lothPlan will lessen the burden on states during the llthPlan
period. Ths analysis, therefore, also focuses on the incremental recurrent costs that the
State's would have to absorb at the end of the llthPlan (March 31, 2012). Given that
SSA is the flagship program of the Central government in its delivery of elementary
education services, it is unlikely, and not rational, for State governments to expand state-
level interventions in elementary education outside of SSA. Thus, the Center's offer to
compensate for all incremental recurrent expenditures incurred from loth Plan
development expenditures,in the 11th Plan period, addresses a key concern of most states
over central schemes, i.e., the difficultyin having to absorb all incremental expenditures
at the end of the plan period. SSA is the first central scheme where the end date of the
program is not co-terminuswith the end of the Plan period during which the program was
initiated.

9.26. The State level analysis reveals that for 7 out of 14 states, in 2007, the projected
SSA expenditure, as a percent of that state's expenditureon elementary education,would
be below 5 percent, even if SGDP were constrainedto grow at exactlythe same rate as it
has between FY1994 and FY2000.                These include Gujarat, Haryana, Kerala,
Maharashtra, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. In the case of Andhra Pradesh,
Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, the projected
SSA expenditure as a percent of each state's expenditureon elementaryeducationwould
be above 5 percent (Refer to Column 5), with Madhya Pradesh and Punjab at 9.87
percent and 13.65percent, respectively.

9.27. Under the H-GSDP scenario, only four states, viz., Madhya Pradesh, Punjab,
Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, are seen to have their projected SSA expenditures above 5
percent of that state's expenditure on elementary education (Refer to Column 6). As
stated earlier, these incrementalrecurrent expendituresarising due to the implementation
of SSA at the state level will be covered by support from the Central government for the
next Plan period. In Punjab, where the spending of elementary education as a share of
state GDP is the lowest among all states (0.82 percent) due to a large private sector
involvement in elementary schooling, SSA expendituresas a percentage of state spending
on elementary education is likely to be in excess of 10 percent in both low and high
growth scenarios in 2013 even though Punjab has the highest per capita GDP in the
country. It is projected to spend more on elementary education because it has the
resources to do so, and from a lower current base due to a considerable private sector
participation. In Madhya Pradesh, which has already spent 2.84 percent of the state GDP
on elementary education, and has made remarkable progress in reducing out-of-school
children in the last decade, SSA'sincremental recurrent cost is likelyto be over 8 percent
of its elementaryeducationspending after 2013.

9.28. For the five states with particularly large out-of-school populations, viz., Bihar,
Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and West Bengal, the respective shares of SSA
incremental recurrent cost in the state elementary education budget at the end of the 1lth

Plan (March 31, 2012) range from about 4.47 percent to 8.12 percent, under the
constraint that SGDP growth is restricted to be at the same level as the growth
experienced between FY1994 and FY2000 (Please refer to Column 7). Under the
H-SGDP scenario, the respective shares of SSA incremental recurrent cost in the state
elementary education budget at the end of the 1lthPlan range from about 3.49 percent to
7.02 percent (Referto Column 8).

9.29. Columns 9-12 illustratethe scenarioswhere expenditure on education increases to
6 percent of SGDP for all states by 2020, and correspondingly the share of this spent on
elementary education increases to 50 percent over the same period. Under the combined
BC-SGDP and HC-BA scenario, only three states, viz., Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and
Uttar Pradesh, have SSA expenditures above 5 percent of total state expenditures on
elementaryeducation in FY2007 (refer to Column 9). Under the high growth (H-SGDP)
and higher allocation (HCBA) scenario, only Madhya Pradesh and Punjab, have SSA
expenditures above 5 percent of total state expenditures on elementary education in
FY2007 (refer to Column 10). In FY2012, together with the three states above,
Rajasthan is seen to have SSA expendituresabove 5 percent of total state expenditures on
elementary education (refer to Column 11) in the base growth scenario, while under the
high growth scenario only Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan illustrate the same
(refer to Column 12).

9.30. In conclusion,there remain some concerns on the abilityof the states to cope with
the fiscal pressures brought upon them through the adoption of this program. However,
the Central and State governments have made concerted efforts to reduce the fiscal
burden of accommodating the incremental recurrent costs by engaging in a multi-Plan
period program, thus ensuring that SSA would prove to be financially sustainable and
viable. First, as a centrally sponsored scheme, it is an incrementalprogram with a cost-
sharing arrangement that provides incentives to the states to implement the program but
that eventually transfers full financial responsibility to the states. Second, there is a
significant level of civil works that have low recurrent cost implications, albeit the need
to provide financing for repair and maintenance. Third, the salaries component is
relatively small- 11percent of the total program cost -because most of the new teachers
hired are para-teacherswith lower salariesthan regular teachers (Table 5.2). Fourth, with
respect to IDA, which only finances 13.5 percent of the total program costs, the risk is
low. The disbursement arrangements which reimburse GO1expenditures only when they
exceed an eligibility level ensures that the project has met the incremental test of Bank
policy on financingrecurrent costs.

                           Annex 10. Safeguard Policy Issues

10.1. The safeguard policy issues include (a) environment assessment and management
and (b) tribal development plan.

EnvironmentalAssessment And Management

10.2. The following four sectionscover (i) the overall environment assessmentprocess,
(ii) major issues and associated management measures, (iii) community consultation and
disclosure, and (iv) implementation and monitoring. They are based on the Environment
Assessment Report (December 2003) and supporting documents fi-om DEEL. The
EnvironmentAssessment Report is availablein project files.

OverallEnvironmentAssessment Process

10.3. Environmental Assessment (EA).             The DEEL prepared an Environment
Assessment Report for the SSA in December 2003 through the Technical Support Group
of Education Consultants India Ltd. The report identifies the probable environmental
issues in the SSA, describes the manuals, directives and guidelines that have been
prepared by the DEEL and sharedwith the statesto address environmental issues, and the
arrangements for implementation and monitoring to ensure that environment aspects are
mainstreamedin the planning and implementation of the program. The EA was based on
the large number of state-specificevaluations of civil works undertaken in both DPE and
SSA.

10.4. As the environmental issues in the SSA were not anticipated to be very grave, a
limited environmental assessment, rather than an extensive one, was done. The EA
process included a desk review of the ongoing SSA and recently concluded DPEP and
other completed projects such as Lok Jumbish. The EA recognized that environment
issues are mainly related to civil works and that these projects have already considered a
number of environmental issues in their planning, design and implementation, and
developed and implemented a number of good practices for environment management.

10.5. Civil works in the program include (i) construction of additional classrooms in
existing schools, (ii) constructionof new primary or alternative schools, (iii) construction
of Cluster or Block Resource Centers (CRCsBRCs), (iv)repair of existingbuildings, and
(v) provision of drinking water and sanitation facilities. These are all small-scale
construction activities. During 2000-02, SSA approved plans for 70,000 new schools,
32,196 new primary school buildings, 14,180 upper primary schools, 115,087 additional
classrooms, 7,673 resource centers, 106,707toilets and 73,481 dnnkingwater facilities.

10.6. Guidelines and Manuals. Several guidelines have been prepared (as part of the
SSA and the earlier projects such as DPEP) to ensure better construction management,
better learning environment, child-fhendly elements of the schools, and health and
hygiene on the school premises. These guidelinesform essential parts of the EA.



                                           93

10.7. Environmental Clearances. The program as a whole does not require any
environmental clearance. Normally school sites would be located in areas already
approved for suchpurposes. During implementation of the program, there couldbe a few
schools to be located in a forest or any other protected areas (such as the coastal
regulation zone). If such cases arise, site-specific clearances will be obtained, and all
requisite GOYstateconditionswill be fulfilled.

10.8    Community Consultations and Public Disclosure. Community consultation is
an integral part of the SSA program. The overall program is being planned as a
participatoryprocess where communities and local level institutions including the village
education committees are involved in identification, planning, design, implementation,
operation and maintenance of the schools and all other program activities. Consultations
with school teachers, experts, NGOs and other stakeholders will continue throughout the
implementation period.         The DEEL has a program-specific website for SSA
(www,education.nic.in), wherein important aspects of the program are disclosed for
wider dissemination. The EA documents are found at this website.

Environmental Issues, Mitigation and EnhancementMeasures

10.9. Environmental issues in SSA are mainly limited to building construction works
and sites. Overall, civil works in the SSA will be limited to 33 percent of the investment
in each state. The SSA approach is to move away from contractor-driven construction to
community-managed construction. As the individual works would be small, environment
issues will be small and local. In the implementation of SSA so far and earlier projects
such as the DPEP, substantial experience has been gained to manage these issues. Some
stateshave implemented innovativeand good environmental management practices.

10.10. Site Location and Sensitivity. The foremost environmentalissue in this program
relates to the selection of sites for the new schools, BRCs, CRCs, and DIETS. Buildings
are provided only for formal schools in SSA. For informal schools, communities are
expected to arrange for the physical infrastructure. This would mostly be unutilized
existing buildings in the villages or spare rooms in houses. Usually sites donated by the
villageAoca1 community for schools are free of environmental hazards. Site selection
procedures are part of the "Community Construction Manual" which is issued to
communities before the start of the intervention. The procedures recommend that
communities avoid hazardous sites, steep slopes, low-lying areas, siteswith filled-up soil,
sites alongrail tracks, highways, and industrial and effluent disposal areas. The choice of
site is usually done through a village mapping exercise, and is supervised by a local
engineer. In urban areas, schools are set up in designated sites in the slum improvement
schemes. Where slum improvement schemes sites are unavailable, schools are set up in
spaces provided by the communities. All such site selection are guided by relevant
municipal regulations.

10.11. Building Design-related Impacts. These issues relate to site planning (ensuring
proper and adequate drainage, providing safe slopes, safe excavation, removal of trees),
indoor air quality, daylight and ventilation (speciallyin hilly areas) in classrooms. These
issues will be addressed in the SSA by adopting guidelines contained in the documents-
"A Guide to Design for Better Learning Environment" and "Guidelines for Building
                                             94

Rural Primary Schools". These documents have already been circulated to the states.
The thrust of the civil works program in SSA is to create a child-friendly physical
environment, both inside and outside the classroom. During DPEP, alternative type-
designs have been prepared for each of the states, which take adequate care of features
such as illumination and ventilation of classrooms. All schools will be provided with
safe hnking water. The building designs consider the provision of toilets and their
hygienic maintenance. The provision of adequate hazard-resistant designs (such as in
earthquake, flood or cyclone-prone areas) include design and construction measures
commensurate with natural hazard zonation, and provision of emergency egress.
Hazardous building materials such as asbestos, paint containing lead and anti-termite
chemicals will not be used. The recommendations for building materials include the use
of fire-resistantmaterials.

10.12. SSA will provide a learning environment free of barriers - both social and
physical. Additional features will be incorporated in the new and existing buildings per
IS: 4963-1987 and IS: 4838 Part 1-1969 for children with locomotor, visual, hearing or
intellectual impairment. SSA will create a lively learning environment in all schools in
the country-both new and existing. SSA schoolswill address "furniture-less"situations
by providing in-built ledges, foldable wooden worktops, and bamboo furniture.
Classroom exteriors, verandah or the campus will be used as effective learning spaces
(free standing chalkboards under trees, boundary walls, exterior walls of classrooms).
Schools will develop gardens with h i t trees, flowering shrubs and medicinal herbs.
These would be maintainedby studentsand VECs.

10.13. Efforts towards energy efficient and environmental friendly buildings started
in the earlier Lok Jumbish and DPEP projects. Use of local materials was promoted.
Rainwater harvesting techniques were used in Gujarat and Rajasthan, while solar-passive
features were incorporated in schools in Himachal Pradesh. As specified in the SSA
Framework for Implementation, all these innovationsare being continued in the SSA.

10.14. Construction-related Aspects. Construction-related issues could be addressed
effectivelythrough good contract management, incorporatingconditionsin contracts, and
supervisiodcompliance monitoring. Guidelines have been provided in the "Community
ConstructionManual". Most construction will be executed through the VECs, whch will
arrange for materials and employ local villagers or contract labor for construction. All
rules and regulations relevant to construction laborers will be applicable if a labor
contractor is employed in SSA. In case of larger construction (CRCslBRCs), engagement
of a separate agency is possible. Government/public sector agencies will follow existing
noms and regulations with respect to construction, contract labor and environmental
management. For private contractors, the bidding documents will clearly specify the
requirement of the contractorto abideby all relevant environmentallaws.

10.15. Environmental issues related to constructionwill be managed through the system
of construction quality control already in place. The VECs and local masons will be
trained to address basic site management issues, which include reducing wastage of
materials, ensuring safety, avoiding damage to flora and fauna, and restricting air and
noise pollution. Technical staff (from government departments or recruited on contract)
will supervise all constructionworks.
                                           95

10.16. SSA will encourage the use of local construction materials and low-cost
technologies. Appropriate building materials will be identified through resource
mapping exercises. Efforts will be made to choose materials that cause a minimum
depletion of natural resources. Alternative technologies such as rat-trap bond wall, filler
slab roof, and stub foundations, already used in earlier projects, will be expanded. SSA
will promote alternatives such as stabilized mud-blocks, fly-ash bricks, brick-corbelled
structures,andjack arch roofs. There is a provision for settingup of an Innovation Fund
of Rs. 5million for each state in the SSA fiarnework, for further research on low cost and
appropriatetechnologies, if required.

10.17. Facility-related Impacts. These impacts arise due to the provision, or lack of
provision, and lack of maintenance of facilities that are needed. SSA provides for water
supply and sanitation facilities in schools as reflected in District Infrastructure Plans.
Guidelines have been issued to the states to provide safe drinking water to children,
locate water facilities to avoid water-logging, build platforms and channels to drain water
into nearby water channels, re-use waste water to flush toilets or water plants, and assess
water table and water-quality issues. States have been dxected to use the GO1program,
Swujaldhara, to provide deep bores where required. Rainwater harvesting techniques,
used successfullyin Rajasthan and Gujarat, will be expanded.

10.18. SSA will provide adequate sanitation facilities (low-cost, safe, two-pit type
toilets) in the schools. Septic tanks will be discouraged, except in cases where the water
table is very low.      The program will provide adequate maintenance support and
guidelines, and will allocate funds for maintenance of toilets. It will provide maintenance
grants of Rs. 5000/year/school. Maintenance includes whitewashng, roof and site
drainage, upkeep of water and sanitation facilities, site cleanliness, and greenery. Minor
repairs will also be addressed through these maintenance grants. For larger schools,
additionalfundsmay be generated through communities or other government schemes.

10.19. Teaching-Learning Environment.            Textbooks, teaching-learning materials,
training, resource support, etc., will include provisions to create a child-fiiendly
environment and contextual learning. Environmental studies are now an integral part of
the school curriculum. Concepts of science, environment, health and hygiene are
introduced to children. The National Curriculum Framework, developed by NCERT,
introduced the Art of Healthy and Productive Living, which includes education on
environment.      Some states have integrated textbooks combining Language and
Environmental Studies (EVS), or Language, Mathematics and EVS. Other states have
separateEVS textbooks.

10.20. Health and Hygiene. Many states already have a system of maintaining Health
Cards for children. Health and hygiene are integralparts of the curriculum. Topics such
as food, household health, good and bad habits, personal hygiene and common illness are
part of classroom transaction. Messages relating to health and sanitation are delivered to
children. Field trips to local hospitals and interviews with doctors are part of children's
activities in the schools. Schools have Sufai Samitis comprising of children who are
responsible for cleanlinessof the schools.


                                            96

Implementation,Monitoring and Evaluation

10.21. ImplementationAgencies. SSAis a decentralized program, and individual states
are free to decide on implementation strategies within the overall fiamework. GO1
monitors the program primarily against outcomes and budgetary utilization. The GO1
also plays a supportive role, strengthening the capacity of the states and helping them to
develop the right strategies and interventions. At the school level, implementation
responsibility lies with the VEC and the local community, which are supported by the
state agenciesprovidingresources, guidelines, overall supervisionand monitoring.

10.22. Environmental Guidelines.           GO1 has already circulated the following
guidelineslinstructions to the states for implementation of the program. The states, in
turn,have circulatedthese to the district and local implementingagencies:

        0   Community Construction Manual       -  this is a sample manual and the states
            have or are developing their own manual in the local language based on this;
            the manual lists issues related to site selection and good construction
            practices;
            A Guideline on Design that lists issues related to functionality of schools
            (illumination, ventilation, etc.), essential design requirements (storage,
            display, etc.), and basic facilities to be provided (toilets, water supply,
            boundary walls, ramps, etc.);
        0   A compilationof school designs developed through a nationwide architectural
            competitionthat givesthe basic requirements of rural primary schools;
            A handbook of chld-friendly features that can be incorporatedin a school;
        0   A Guidelinefor utilizingthe maintenance grantsprovided by SSA;
            An instruction to states to converge with programs like the Total Sanitation
            Campaign, Swajaldhara, and other statekentral government programs for
           providingwater supplyand sanitationfacilities in all schools; and
        0   Suggested management structures that can be adopted to implement civil
           works.

10.23. In addition a guideline on construction issues in urban areas, and a handbook on
barrier-free school environments are under preparation and will be circulated to the
implementing agencies. There are also region-specificdirectives fiom GO1that apply in
specificregions. The GOI, alongwith the Technical Support Group, will also play a pro-
active role in sharing experiences and encouraging cross-learning. Good practices, both
in terms of physical environment as well as the teaching-learning environment, will be
shared with the statesthrough documentation and workshops.

10.24. Training. As part of the program's regular training, supervisory staff at the state
and district levels will be trained in sound environmental and constructionpractices. The
VECs and local masons will also be trained in safe and clean constructionpractices.

10.25. Environmental Monitoring and Review. Appraisal of the Annual Work Plans
includes appraisal of the previous year's activities.        Ths serves as the basis of

                                             97

recommendations for the subsequent year. The SSA Manual for Appraisal of Plans
lays down procedures and parameters for appraisal. These include parameters that
addressthe major environmental concerns, for example:

       Whether specific (remedial) environmental actions have been integrated in the
       Infrastructure Plan and costed (specifying source of funds, implementation
       timeline and responsibility);
       How much the states have progressed in respect of the use of local materials and
       technologies (as part of the Infrastructure Plan), and whether these are in
       accordancewith guidance provided in the ConstructionManual; and
       Whether the training program includes appropriate orientation and sensitization
       on environmental aspects for supervisorypersonnel.

10.26. These appraisal parameters are qualitative in nature and will be augmented with
an annualreview to check quantitatively(as required)whether the stateshave adopted the
desirable quality interventions and technically-sound strategiedactivitiesthat are being
advocated by SSA.

10.27. National level monitoring will also be supplemented through the joint review
missions (JRMs). These missions will look into all aspects of program implementation,
including environmental aspects. The DPEP experience showed that the JRMs can be
effective in identifying shortcomings and highlighting good practices. Many of the civil
works initiatives under DPEP such as design renewal, use of local materials, efforts
towards child-friendlyschoolsemanated from these missions.

10.28. Evaluation of Environmental Management Practices. GO1 will carry out
third-party evaluations of the physical infrastructure constructed under the program.
Aspects such as school location, site selection, prioritization for planning, materials and
building technologies, quality of construction, community involvement and maintenance
will be evaluated in detail. Other environmental aspects (per the issues and good
practices identified in the EA Report) will also be included in such evaluation. At least
one such third-party evaluation would be carried out in states,where there are substantial
civil works during the project implementation period.         These evaluations will be
scheduled as early as feasible,in order to maximizebenefits to the project. Outputsfi-om
these environment evaluationswill be used to improve the work programs in subsequent
years.

10.29. Environment Budget. The budget for environmental management is integrated
with the program budget at all levels of implementation.

TRIBALDEVELOPMENTPLAN

Background

10.30. Broadly, the national Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan program (SSA) of which this project
is part aims to ensure that all 6-11year-old children have access to a five-year cycle of
primary education of appropriate quality by 2007, and all 6-14 year-olds complete eight
years of schooling by 2010. Importantly, these objectives result in a focus on children
from the socially and economically disadvantaged groups who have remained outside
education to date. Thus, the very objectives and focus of the project are to provide
benefits to tribal people.

10.31. Ths Tribal Development Plan (TDP) has been prepared on the basis of available
secondary information and primary information collected by the Social Assessment
carried out during project preparation. The nationwide SSA is implemented on the basis
of a Framework and guidelines to the states and districts, whch prepare detailed annual
implementation plans. As the preparation of these plans involves consultations with
tribal people (where relevant) (see section on Strategyfor Tribal Participationbelow),
consultationshave not been held forpreparation of this TDP.

Legal and Policy Framework for Tribal Education

10.32. The 86thAmendment to the Constitution of India (2000) made education a
fundamental right, calling for the state to provide free and compulsory education to all
children between six and 14years. At the same time Article 51 of the Constitution was
amended to enjoin parents and guardians to provide education to their 6-14 year-old
children. This Project aims to contributeto fwlfillment of the legal mandate for education
of all 6-11year-oldsby 2007, and all 6-14 year olds by 2010.

10.33. Article 46 of the Constitutionstatesthat the statewill promote the educational and
economic interests of the weaker sections of the Indian society, especially the Scheduled
Tribes (STs) and Scheduled Castes (SCs), and protect them from all forms of social
injustice and exploitation. The state governments have been made responsible for
promoting the welfare of SCs and STs. In compliance with the Fifih Schedule of the
Constitution (Part X), that provides protection to the Scheduled Tribes on account of their
disadvantages, all state governments have enacted laws to protect and promote the social
and economic interests of tribal people. These include measures intended to ensure that
STs do not lose their lands and are protected from bonded labor and usurious interests.

10.34. Tribalpeople have been recognized in India's development planning as one of the
most deprived and marginalized groups. Elementary education has been a priority area
for their development under `Tribal Sub-Plans' for at least the past 30 years. Further, the
National Policy on Education, 1986, accordedpriority to the opening of primary schools
in tribal areas, suggested the establishment `on a large scale' of residential schools,
encouraged the entry of tribal youth into teachmg, and posited the need for development
of curricula and instructional material in tribal languages for the early primary stage. In
addition, it called for incentives schemes to be formulated for tribal children to be drawn
                                             99

to school. The issue of improving tribal children's access to schools has continued to be
emphasizedin the Tenth Plan (2002-07) and is a thrust of the SSAprogram.

 10.35. Personnel Policies. The government "reserves" up to 12percent of places in all
fields of employment for tribal people. In states where tribal people form a larger
percentage of the population,the reservation quota is increased commensurately.l4 These
quotas apply to school teachers as well as education administrators.Rosters of candidates
are maintained, vacancies are carried forward, and age limits, qualificationrequirements
and application fees are relaxed to facilitate the entry of ST candidates into jobs. To
enhance human resource development and skill improvements, a number of training
programs are organized specificallyfortribal areadpeople.

 10.36. Land Tenure. Various state-level Acts (e.g.,TenancyActs), amended from time
to time, provide legal protectionto tribal people against alienationof their land. The Acts
usually prohibit transfer of tribal land to non-tribal people. Any transfer of tribal land by
sale, gift or bequest is void. No tribal land-owner can transfer the rights to hdher
holdings to a non-tribal in whole or in part. Other sectionsforbid letting or sub-letting of
whole or part of a holding by a tribal to a non-tribal, and prohibit exchangesof tribal land
with those of non-tribal people. Further, laws control trespassing on lands held by a
tribal person. There are also provisions for summary enquiries to be conducted in the
event of instances of infringement being brought to light. Anyone who has taken or
retained possession, without lawful authority, of land held by a tenant belonging to the
SCs and STs is liable to be ejected on an applicationin a summary manner. Proceedings
are to be concludedwithin three months. There is no such provision for non-SCs/STs for
whom such suits for ejectionwould have to be brought before a court.

10.37. Such laws provide protection to tribal people who are heavily dependent on land
and forests for their livelihood. However, the Project is not likely to raise issues related
to tribal peoples' land tenure. Schools established in tribal areas (and related facilities
such as playgrounds, toilets and water supply) would be situated (i) in rented or donated
buildings, (ii) on government- or panchayat-owned land, or (iii) on donated land.
Procedures have been established for voluntary donation of land (in general) in the
project. In addition, in tribal areas specifically,any transfer of donated land would obtain
the approval of the District Collector or other state authority as required by law. No land
alienation is expected to occur that might interfere with the tenurial rights of tribal
people. There are precedents for donation of buildings, usually in better-off tribal areas
and/orby better-off groups or families.

Baseline Data

10.38. Population and Literacy of Scheduled Tribes.                             The population of STs
according to the 1991 Census was 67.8 million, constituting about 8.3 percent of the
country's total pop~lation.'~Ths percentage varies among the states. Nine states


 ~    ~~    ~~~




        l4 The quota is also reduced in stateswhere there are few or no tribal people, such as Haryana.
        l5 2001 Census data on the ScheduledTribe population are not yet available, but would be expected
to be about 25% higher than the 1991figures.

                                                     100

together account for about four-fifths of the total tribal population of the country", but
the tribal percentages of these states'population vary from about 8 to 22 per cent. On the
other hand, several smaller states, notably in the north-east of the country, have much
hgher percentages (ranging from 64 to 95 per cent),but account for a small proportion of
tribal people in the country as a wh01e.l~According to government educational statistics,
there were 10.87million ST children aged 6-11years, and 5.12 million ST children aged
11-14years in March 2001.

10.39. The literacyrate of STs in India in 1999-00was 49.0% for all persons, 59.0% for
males and 37.0% for females,comparativelylower than that of the population as a whole:
62.0% for all persons, 73.0% for males, and 51.0% for females." At the time of the 1991

tribes or castes. Tribal literacy ranges from 17% in Andhra Pradesh to 82% in
Census, the ST population was roughly half as literate as those who were not scheduled

Mizoram." States with hgh proportions of STs (such as Mizoram, Meghalaya and
Nagaland) have higher literacyrates among tribals than states with lower proportions but
larger nurnbers of tribal people (e.g., A.P., M.P., Orissa, Rajasthan). For example, tribal
literacy in Madhya Pradesh in 1999-00was only 36 percent, considerablybelow national
tribal literacy.

10.40. About 174districts in the country (of the 418 that existed at the time of the 1991
Census)had ST literacy rates below the national average. There were 119districts where
female ST literacywas below lo%, concentrated largelyin five states.20

10.41. Tribal Groups, Habitations and Access to School Facilities. There are 573
major tribal groups in India, each one associated with a specific geographc area, some
more dispersed than others. Most have their own language, which is generally different
from the `mainstream'language of the state in which they live.2' There are a total of 270
such tribal languages.

10.42. Tribal people tend to live in two main types of situations: (a) in `mixed' (tribal
and non-tribal) rural communities, within reach of educational and other opportunities
and resources, and (b) in habitations that are small in size and located in relatively
inaccessiblehilly or forested areas of the country. About 22 percent of tribal habitations
have a population of less than 100people, a fwrther 40 percent have 100-300people, and
the rest around 300-500 people. The distribution of tribal people in these two types of

      l8 Figures fiom the National Sample Survey (55'   Round, 1999-00) are cited because they are the
latest available for the ST population. The literacy percentages for the population as a whole compare
favorablywith those of the 2001 Census (fromwhich ST literacy figuresarenot yet available).

     21 Most of India's states were formed on linguisticgrounds, and the main languages of instruction in
schools are usually the main language of the state, the national language Hindi, or English. Some

settlements varies markedly by state, district and even block, calling for different
strategiesto be used in different areasto provide elementaryeducationto tribal children.

10.43. In 1993 there were about 176,500 habitations without schools in the country.
They were mostly tribal habitations or those of Scheduled Castes. Coverage with school
facilities has improved steadily over the past ten years due to a number of programs   -
government estimates for 2003-04 state that 81,000 habitations remain unserved, the
largest numbers being in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Orissa, Rajasthan and West
Bengal.

10.44. Of the estimated population of 16 million ST children aged 6-14 years, over 14
million are enrolled in school (see TablelO.1). Thus, this Project would focus on
ensuringthat the remaining 2 million get enrolled, and that all children remain in school
until they complete five years (and, in the second phase, eight years) of education, and
get a quality education (judged by learning achievement tests planned for the program as
a whole).

10.46. The proportion of children out of school in remote tribal areas is usually higher
than among tribal children living in non-tribal areas. The main reasons for this are the
limited educational infi-astructureavailable in tribal areas because of their remoteness;
tribal hamlets being cut off fi-om main villages or well-populated rural areas by
geographic features; the difficulties faced by children living in smaller habitations in
accessing existing formal schools; and so on. Other reasons for low school enrolment
among ST children include the reluctance of ST families to educate their children -- in
addition to the high illiteracy among ST parents, they may not value the education
available, particularly in relation to its opportunity costs. Children are crucial family
workers in the tribal economy which includes agriculture as a main occupation, cattle
grazing, labor on work sites, collecting firewood or other minor forest produce, stone
quarrying,mining, and home-basedwork such as processing forestproduce.

10.47. Low levels of learning found among tribal chldren are not only due to household
factors and problems with the language of instruction, where this is not their mother
tongue, but to other school-related variables. The earlier DPEP has shown that the
achievement gap between tribal and non-tribal children can be narrowed by attention to
classroomtransactions and the school environment.

Development Activities in the Project for TribalAreas and Children

10.48. Planning and Appraisal Processes. The SSA Framework calls for special
attention to be paid to tribal chldren, among "special focus groups", which also include
girls, scheduled castes, working children, urban deprived children, migrant children,
childrenbelow the poverty line, and childrenwith specialneeds. One of the over-archng
goals of SSA is to bridge all gender and social gaps at the primary stage by 2007, and in
                                             103

elementary education by 2010. To achieve this, SSA emphasizes area-specific, tribe-
specific and issue-specific planning and implementation of interventions to meet the
learning needs of children. A Planning and Appraisal Manual sets out the processes for
formulation of district (and state)plans, and for their appraisal by national teams.

10.49. EveryDistrict Elementary Education Plan (DEEP) is expectedto articulate clearly
the district's strategy and approach to tribal education and adopt specific programs and
interventionsto translate the strategyinto action. It provides disaggregated data on tribal
education, spells out the educational problems of ST children, the interventions, quality
improvement efforts, and convergence between education activities and the programs of
NGOs and of other departments such as the Tribal Department. The assessment of
problems related to the education of tribal children is made through household surveys
and micro-planning exercises. District plans are developed on the basis of these findings
as well as on secondarydata.

10.50. Review and appraisal of the DEEPSis technical, managerial and financial, and
includes a focus on issues relating to tribal education. The Appraisal teams include
specialists in the education of the special focus groups, who may carry out field visits in
addition to conducting `desk appraisals'. The Project Approval Board which approves
the perspective plans of the state and the annual plans of the districts critically examine
the plans to ensure that the local issues including tribal issues are addressed through
                                          -                         -
clear strategies and specific interventions. It may request the stateddistricts to
reformulatethe plan and/or to allocatemore fimds to the educationof tribal children.

10.51. Checklists focusing on ST children (as well as separate ones for other focus
groups) have been formulated and have been included in the Manual. The key contents
of these are as follows. The Planners' Checklist calls for special attention to: a special
policy statement and strategy for education of ST children; provision of schools to
"pockets of ST concentration"; inclusion and analysis of disaggregated data on ST
children; special programs for urban ST children; community mobilization plans to
ensure participation of ST children in education; in-servicetraining of teachers to remove
biases especially in classroom transactions; remedial measures to improve learning
outcomes; innovationsto improve learning levels; links with other schemesto addressthe
problems of ST children.

10.52. The Appraisal Checklist calls for special attention to the following during
appraisal of the plans: presentationof disaggregated data on ST children; identification of
unserved habitations and plans to provide them with school facilities; strategyto motivate
the tribal community; availability of local and tribal teachers; capacity building of
teachers to teach tribal children;the match between problems identified and interventions
proposed; provisions for nomadic tribes; medium of instruction; attitudinal training of
teachers; convergence with tribal department schemes; and the utilization of the
allocation of Rs. 1.5 million ($30,000) for ST children in the district (see Costs and
Financingsectionbelow).

10.53. Planning teams at the state and district level have been sensitized to the approach
and provisions in the SSA framework for the education of ST cluldren.


                                            104

Interventions

 10.54. Someof the specificinterventions for tribal childrenin SSA are:

(a) SchoolFacilities and Functioning
          Setting up schools, education guarantee schools (EGS) and alternative schools
         within one kilometer of all habitations for non-enrolled children and dropouts;
         alternative schoolsprovide flexibilityin terms of timing, learning modalities, etc.,
         EGS are to be upgraded to regular schoolsafter two years of operation;22
         Attaching crkches and pre-school sections (angunwadis and balwudis) to schools
         in tribal areas to relieve girls of sibling-care responsibilities;
         Residential (ashram) schoolsor hostels; and
         Amending the school calendarin tribal areasto fit the availabilitypatterns of local
         children.

(b) Teachers
     0   Deploying teachers fkom the tribal communities, providing them special support
         accordingto their needs; and
     0   Providing special training to non-tribal teachers to teach in tribal areas including
         knowledge of the tribal dialect.

(c) Instructional Materials
     0   Preparationof `BridgeLanguage Inventories' for use by teachers;
     0   Textbooks in the tribal language in the earlyprimary stage;
     0   Preparationof locally-relevant materials for chddren; and
     0   Provision of freetextbooks (upto Rs. 150per child)to SC/ST childrenand girls.

(d) SchoolManagement
     0   Increasing the representation of ST members in Village Education Committees in
         tribal areas;
     0   Engaging community organizers from tribal communities to motivate and escort
         children from specifichouseholds; and
     0   Incentives: No tuition fees are charged to tribal children up to Class VI11 and
         other local fees are reduced .

10.55 In addition, several general features of the SSA program facilitate the enrollment
and retention of tribal children, for example:


     22   Several states have relaxed the norms to set up schools - for example, in Andhra Pradesh,
habitations with 20 school-age children can have a school; in Karnataka, the norm has been reduced to 15

states and Jammu & Kashrmr, EGS schools can be opened with only 10 children. A.P. has already set up
children for an EGS school especially for tribal areas. In remote tribal habitations in the north-eastern
community schoolsin all habitations with 15 childrenor more, Kerala with 20, and M.P. with 40 children.
Other innovative approaches to covering tribal children include "contract schools", "forest schools",
summer camps, seasonal hostels, and mobile teachers. Ashram schools are found in A.P., Clihattisgarh,
Gujarat, Jharkhand, M.P., Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan, and U.P. In some states, schools in tribal areas
are runby the Tribal Welfare departments,while the Education departmentsprovide the textbooks and set
the curricula,school calendarand examinations.

                                                  105

         surveysto identify non-school-goingchildren;
         awareness campaigns to increase enrolment;
         back-to-school camps, bridge courses for out-of-school children (dropouts and
         over-agechildren especiallySC/ST children and girls);
         earlychildhoodcare and education centers; and
         fiee middaymeals to all chrldrenat the primary stage.

10.56. Negative Impacts. The above strategiesand interventionsare expectedto result in
improved access to school for tribal children, their continuation in school and better
learning outcomes. They are also expected to provide a culturally-sensitive education.
The opening of schools will be based on demand from local communities,includingtribal
communities. Teachers and administrators will be sensitized to cater to the special needs
of tribal children. No negative impacts are thus expected from the project.

Strategyfor Tribal Participation

10.57. The SSA program calls for community ownership of educational activities
through effective decentralization. This involves Panchayati Raj Institutions, Village
Education Committees (VECs), NGOs and women's groups. The program involves
tribal people in decision-making at several levels. At the district level, representatives of
tribal people participate in the annual planning and local-level decision-making, in
oversight of project activities, and in providing feedback on the program to project staff.
Both the project and local government systems call for and facilitate such involvement.
At the block and village levels, locally elected ST representatives and teachers are
members of VECs (whrch include the ST members of the local villagepanchayats) and
other user groups such as SchoolManagement Committees, PTAs, etc. In predominantly
tribal areas, ST men and women are involved in community mobilization efforts which
include enrolment drives, village meetings, etc. Traditional tribal organizations and local
leaders are often involved in these activities.           Local approaches to community
mobilization are often used, such as tribal fairs and festivals to promote education, and
traditional media and art forms for communication. Finally, there is an emphasis on
recruiting tribal para-teachers as well as on selection of tribal candidates to fill vacant
teacher posts in formal schools. Teachers are also to be consulted in the preparation of
district plans.

InstitutionalArrangements and Capacity

10.58. The District and State Education Offices have officers specifically designated to
ensure that the provisions for the special focus groups and for tribal areas and children
are implemented. When necessary, the district units draw on the expertise of NGOs and
other institutions which have worked with tribal people in the field of education. Such
expertise is available and is particularly useful in the community mobilization and
pedagogical dimensions of the project. Specialized institutions (such as the District
Institutes of Education and Training) are also available to assist in the development,
implementation and management of activities as required. Project staff are trained to
carry out the special activities in tribal areas with the necessary sensitivityand diligence.

                                              106

The educational system and several of the related institutions have outreach capacity
which will be utilized and developed as needed to serve tribal areas. Specialists in tribal
educationare engaged, for example, in the planning and monitoringactivities of SSA.

Implementation Schedule

10.59. The implementation schedule for activities in tribal areas would follow the
general implementationschedule for the program as a whole. Activities are planned and
implemented in the districts on an annual basis.

Monitoring and Evaluation

10.60. The educational progress of ST children is monitored through the project
Education Management Information System (EMIS). EMIS data are analyzed at district
and state levels. The EMIS relates school-level data to communityinformation gathered
through surveys. Schools are encouraged to share all information with communities
(including information on grants received). Notice boards are to be put up in schools for
this purpose. here is intendedto be both transparencyand accountabilityto communities.

continuousmonitoring of activities in their areas, and provide feedback to local teachers
In addition, the VECs or user groups, including tribal people, are responsible for
and officials. The user groups also interact with local groups during their activities, such
as villagemeetings, enrolmentdrives, etc.

10.61. The Project has establishedbenchmarks for coverage and achievementsduringthe
project period which would be used to monitor implementation progress. A Program
Monitoring Mechanism is in place in which research and academic institutions all over
the countrycarry out continuous and comprehensivemonitoring of SSA. The monitoring
tools cover the school attendanceand pedagogic aspectsof tribal education. The national
Department of Elementary Education and Literacy also supervises the project, and
education of the special focus groups is one of the core issues of its missions.
Evaluations are to be carried out by independent agencies to determine the impact of the
project. Professional social scientistswould be involved in the monitoring and evaluation
activities. Evaluationreports are made public.

10.62. During the JRMs, the monitoring reports, studies and evaluations would be
reviewed. Particular attention would be paid to assessing progress on the following,
through appropriateMIS and field visits:

   Opening and functioningof schools in tribal habitationsin tribal and non-tribal areas;
   Enrollment and retention of tribal childrenin schoolsin tribal and non-tribal areas;
   Learning achievementsof tribal childrencomparedwith other groups;
   Availability of tribal teachers, teachers speaking the local tribal language, teachers
   trained to deal with tribal children (attitudinaltraining), and administrators sensitized
   to tribal issues;
   Availabilityof instruction and instructionalmaterials in the local tribal languages;
   Functioning of facilities such as CRCs and BRCs serving the needs of tribal children;
   and

                                             107

    Availability of other schemes and incentives to facilitate school attendance of tribal
    children.

10.63. The eventual goal of the project is to close the educational gaps between tribal
and non-tribal chddren, acheving full enrolment and primary school completionby 2007
and elementary education by 2010 for all groups, as well as similar learning
achievements.

Cost Estimates and FinancingPlan

10.64. As the activities planned for tribal chddren in tribal areas as well as those who
live as minorities in non-tribal areas would be decided and costed locally during annual
district plan preparations, it is not possible to provide cost or budget estimates for tribal
education. The SSA provides for approximately US$30,000 per district per year to be
spent on specific interventionsfor the education of ST and SC children, in addition to the
general program interventions,which also benefit the tribal children. As the district plans
are financed on the basis of an appraisal, financingplans for tribal activities are the same
as that for each district plan as a whole. The fimding partners and GO1 will share the
costs of the overall program (which is a SWAP or sector-wide approach), as described
elsewhere. The GO1 and state governments are responsible for sustaining project
activities, expendituresand outcomes over the long term.

Commission,DflD and the World Bank. No specificgrant for preparation was requested
by the Borrower. The partner agencies assumed responsibility for analytical work and
financed this from their own resources. The responsibilities were as follows: Social
Assessment: EC, InstitutionalAnalysis: DFID, Logical framework: DFID, Economic and
Financial Analysis: W, Environmental Assessment: WB, Financial Management
Assessment: WB, Procurement Assessment: WB.             A baseline study on student
