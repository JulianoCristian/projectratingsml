Project for India were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: Flexibility to support differentiated\n            needs is central to addressing the challenges in diverse\n            local contexts. A norms-based approach to planning and\n            resource allocation has been well suited to the need to\n            achieve equitable access particularly in rural and\n            underserved areas. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA)\n            experience increased the recognition of the need for a\n            differentiated approach to respond flexibly to the special\n            needs of diverse states and districts which themselves\n            differ over time, and to combine this flexibility with\n            accountability for agreed targets. In the special focus\n            districts (SFDs), the annual work plan and budget (AWBP)\n            process prioritizes access and equity; at the same time, SSA\n            supports quality enhancement measures identified by states.\n            Partnerships with local body and private aided schools are\n            encouraged under SSA while the growth of the unaided private\n            sector in urban areas suggests potential gains from\n            carefully designed partnerships with this sector as well.\n            The significant contribution of the unaided private sector\n            to the growth in enrollments particularly in urban areas,\n            suggests that innovative partnerships with un-aided private\n            schools can be explored to further scale up the achievement\n            of program outcomes. The SSA framework encourages\n            public-private partnerships, and the program is extended to\n            local body and private aided schools, but is less well\n            developed on partnerships with private unaided institutions,\n            to a large extent reflecting the lack of consensus either\n            nationally or in some states on how to move forward."}, "docdt": "2008-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
