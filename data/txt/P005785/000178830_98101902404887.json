{"cdata!": "The proposed project is primarily\n            designed to strengthen the institutional capability of the\n            Cooperative and Agricultural Credit Bank (CACB) and to\n            increase its ability to provide credit finance needed for\n            viable farm-level agricultural development initiatives. It\n            will also assist the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries\n            in the establishment of extension centers in the border\n            governorates of Saadah and Hajjah. The project comprises:\n            (a) infrastructure development (civil works, equipment and\n            supplies) needed to support credit activities and extension\n            services; (b) technical assistance and training in several\n            key areas of CACB operations; and (c) funds to assist CACB\n            to expand its lending program. The proposed project's\n            main benefit would be to strengthen CACB as an institution\n            and thereby establish a solid foundation for the ongoing\n            provision of agricultural credit to Yemeni farmers to enable\n            them in turn to finance the irrigation schemes, tractors,\n            improved seeds, fertilizers and other inputs which they need\n            to expand their production."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
