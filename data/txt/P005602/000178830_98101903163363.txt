INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROFOSED THIRD LOAN TO THE
SOCIETE NATIONALE DIINVESTISSEMENT OF TUNISIA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $ 10 million to
Soci6te Nationale d'Investissement (SNI).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       During 1965-1966 SNI was reorganized with a resulting
substantial decrease of the Government shareholding to the present
minority position and an extension of its activity from equity
investment to both equity investment and medium and long term loans.
As part of this reorganization, IFC made an investment of Dinars 300,000
(about $570,000) in SNI shares in May 1966 and the Bank made a loan
of $5 million. To keep pace with the increase of SNIts lending
activity, the Bank made a second loan of $10 million in September 1967.
At the same time, the Swedish Government made a loan of about $3 million,
two-thirds of which was to finance part of the local currency needs
of SNI. Since these resources will be fully committed by the begin-
ning of 1970, SNI has requested a $10 million loan from the Bank
(a small part of which to be used for local expenditures) and has
applied to the Swedish Government for a new loan along the lines of
the previous one.
3.       As of October 31, 1969, outstanding Bank loans and IDA credits
amounted to $99.3 million ($66.9 million Bank and $32.4 million IDA),
as summarized below:

4.         The slow disbursement of the cooperative farm loan and credit
(TUi-484 and TUN-99) reflects organizational difficulties encountered in
the execution of the project. Recent major changes in the Government's
agricultural policy promise to bring about a more effective concentratior
of effort on the Bank/IDA project. The Bank and IDA are following closely
the progress of the project and are working with the Government of Tunisia
to accelerate the pace of execution.  The Port Loan (TTJi-573) signed in
November 1968, became effective in April 1969. One large contract has
been let, others are being let, actual work is expected to start this month
and substantial disbursements should start soon.

5.       In May 1966, IFC invested the equivalent of $570,o0o in the
share capital of SNI, and in 1969, it invested $9.9 million in COFITOUR,
Compagnie Financiere et Touristique ($8 million loan and $1.9 million
share capital investment), a holding company for the promotion of
tourism. In addition IFC has invested $1.5 million and lent $2.0 million
to NPK-Engrais, a phosphate fertilizer company.
6.       It is planned to provide financing for a water supply project
before the end of the current fiscal year. Over the longer term,
operations in new sectors such as tourism infrastructure and family
planning are contemplated.

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of Societe Nationale
dlInvestissement" (DB-53) is attached.
9.       During the past two years SNIts investinent and lending opera-
tions have been expanding, the total increasing from D 2 million in
1966 to D 3.8 million in each of the years 1967 and 1968. Much of the
increase was due to the booming tourism sector, financing for which has
accounted for about 42% of SNIts commitments. The privately-owned
manufacturing and service firmis financed were mainly of the small or
medium size, characteristic of Tunisian private industry, and any signi-
ficant expansion of SNIvs industrial operations depended on its ability
to finance public enterprises. Accordingly, at the end of 1968 SNI's
board of directors, with the approval of the Bank, decided to finance
public enterprises up to a limit of 25% of its portfolio.
10.      Most of SNIts financing has been in the form of straight loans,
although equity investments have been important and accounted for over
30% of the total portfolio at the end of 1968. SNIts loan portfolio has
few arrears, and its equity portfolio has greatly improved in quality
in the past two years. The book value of the share capital at the end
of 1968 was 160 percent of par, and its reserves amounted to D 1,017,000
equivalent to almost 20 percent of the loan and equity portfolio out-
standing.
11.      SNI now has a sizeable backlog of projects and in the one and
a half year period from November 1969 to May 1971 it plans to commit
about $20.5 million equivalent, of which perhaps about $6 million would
be required for local currency expenditures. Taking into account the
amount which SNI can raise locally and its expected earnings over the
period, there is likely to remain a gap of $15 million. It is proposed
to cover the gap by a $5 million loan from the Swedish Government and
$10 million from the Bank. Of these amounts, some $1 million out of
the Bank loan and $2 - $2.5 million from Sweden would be available for
financing local expenditure.
12.      SNI will continue to direct the major thrust of its activities
to the private sector, but with scope for expansion in the private
sector being narrow, SNI's ability to finance public enterprises will
enable it to increase its total lending while keeping its portfolio in
balance between tourism and industry. SNI intends to scrutinize with
particular care all requests for finance by public enterprises and
decisions to finance projects in the public sector will require the
unanimous approval of SNI's Board.



13.      It is proposed that SNI debt limit be raised from three to four
times its equity, which is justified in view of the good quality of SNIJs
portfolio and its adequate debt service coverage. In view of SNIts good
performance in project evaluation, SNIIs free limit on private sector
loans made out of Bank loans is to be increased from $100,000 to $200,000.
However, any use of the Bank loan for loans to public enterprises is
subject to Bank approval and may not exceed in total 35 percent of the
Bank loan. SNIIs lending rate is currently 8-1/2 percent. Any exchange
loss resulting from a change in the value of the Tunisian dinar in terms
of other currencies would be borne by the Tunisian Government.
14.      Since its reorganization in 1965-1966, SNI has been strength-
ening its organization and improving the capability of its staff. Despite
some turnover in management and staff, SNI has raised its standards of
project appraisal while handling an increasing volume of business. Further
staff strengthening is planned by SNI. A few months ago SNI's first
President, Mr. Abdelaziz Mathari, took over the presidency of COFITOUR,
while continuing to hold the presidency of Societe Tunisienne de Banque,
Tunisia's largest commercial bank, and relinquished his presidency of SNI.
He was replaced by Mr. Moncef Belkhodja, previously Director of Credit at
the Central Bank and a director of SNI, who, since becoming president,
has devoted 6nergetic attention to Sta's operations.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
15.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and SNI, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed Loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The agreements follow closely the forms currently in use for loans to
development finance companies.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
16.      A report on the economy of Tunisia was distributed to the
Executive Directors on September 9, 1969 (9i4A 12-a). The conclusions
and recommendations of this report remain valid, although there are
two significant developments which are expected to affect some aspects
of the Bank1s work in Tunisia.  For some time the Bank had been dis-
cussing with the Tunisian Government the implications of a Ministerial



- 6 -
decision of January 1969, which envisaged the transformation into
cooperatives of the entire agricultural sector. In September 1969,
the Tunisian Government took the important step of modifying the
January decision by providing for individual, as well as cooperative
and state-owned, farms. The second development was the rains of
unprecedented severity in September, which caused heavy damage in
central and southern Tunisia, both in terms of human lives and of property.
Floods washed out bridges and rail tracks throughout the area. The
repair of this damage is causing some strain on the balance of payments.
In addition, the interruption of rail services has stopped exports of
phosphate rock and iron ore, and if this situation persists for any
length of time, the effects on the balance of payments will be serious.
17.      Broadly speaking, Tunisia has a well formulated development
plan and is making adequate development efforts. Funds for financing
the direct foreign exchange needs of important projects in the plan
have been forthcoming in reasonable amounts, thanks to the support
of the countries belonging to the Consultative Group, as well as
that from the Bank and IDA. The development plan, however, requires
funds in excess of the funds which are likely to be obtained from
this financing and from domestic savings, and there is, thus, a need
for the Bank Group and other foreign lenders to provide some foreign
exchange in respect of local expenditures for viable projects.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
18.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII- RECOMMENDATION
19.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
