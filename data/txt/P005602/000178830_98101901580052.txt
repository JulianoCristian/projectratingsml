SUMARY
(i)       Total approvals of loans and equity investments by SHI totalled
D 3.8 million ($7.2 million) in each of 1967 and 1968. This was higher
than had been expected wrhen a fivst loan of $5.0 million to SNI was anoroved
by the Bank in Nay 1966. A second loan for $10 million was approved in
September 1967, and a ti rd Bank loa n for $10 mllion is now recoammended.
(ii)      ONI's increase in busine.ss was largely due to the dym.m,c> growt.^,.h
of tourism iwith hotel investments, mostly in the private sector, averaging
D 10 million per year and projected to increase under the present foul-year
plan (1969-72) to an average of D 16 million per year. Nhile tourism haS
been booming, industrial investments have been maintanled at about D 16
million per year, with 15% of new investments being undertaken by the
private sector.  Industrial investments are expected to remain at about Lhe
same level dluring the 1969-72 period, although the private sector share 'is
expected to increase to 25% of the total. The slower growth of industry
as compared to tourism reflects the relative scarcity of attractive invest-
ment opportunities due to the smal. market and the gradual exhaustion of
import substitution possibilities.
(iii)     Late in 1968, SNlI operations seemed to have reached a plateau,
and in order to increase its level of business and participate in the
tourism expansion while diversifying its risks, SNI's Board approved a
change in its Policy Statement to allow SNI to finance public enterprises
up to a limit of 25% of its outstanding commitments.
(iv)      In January 1969, i4r. Mbncef Belkhodja, who was Director of Credit
at the Central Bank and a member oI the Board of Directors of SNI, was
appointed President of SNI.
(v)       SNI has been developing satisfactorily and despite shortcomings
in internal organization and high staff turnover, its appraisals have been
relatively good. SNI's loan portfolio has few arrears and its equity po:rt--
folio has improved in quality.  SNI's profits have increased from D 158,500
in 1967 to D 167,700 in 1968, representing a rate of return of 11.2' on
share capital. Profits are expected to decline sligh-tly in 1969 since SNI
will no longer be enjoving a tax exemption and Government subsidy.   They
are projected to increase again to D 240,000 in 1970 and D 362,000 in 1971.
(vi)      SNI will have exhausted its IBRD and Swedish resources by the
end of 1969, and its business forecasts of D 12.5 million for the 1970-71
period imply a resource gap of $20.5 million of which $4.4 million
equivalent will be needed for loca: cost financing.   SNI has applied for a
$5.0 million equivalent loan from the Swedish Government, half of which
would be available for local cost financing.   To cover the balance of its
resource needs for the next 18 mon-ths, SMI has applied for a Bank loan of



- ii -
$10 million of which $1.0 million could be used for the financing of local
expenditulre -  SNT is a sui-table and creditworthy borrower for this sum.
The 10% allotment for local cost financing is justified by virtue of the
high level of demand on MT! and its ownm efforts; which have been successful.
to increase its domestic currency resources.

APPRAISAL OF THE
SOCIETE NATIONALE D'INVESTISSEMENT (SI)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.         rinT-g 1965 and 1966, 9NI was reorganized and transformed from a
company devoted mainly to equity investment into a privately controlled
development finance company providing medium  and long-term capital (equitr 'n
loans) to the private sector. The reorganization involved an IFC investment in
May 1966 of D      300,000 (US $57l,428) in MI shares, and FC became the large-<:
single shareholder with 20% of the share capital. This investment was
co-upled with a first Bank loan of $5.0 million to SrI.
2.        A second Bank loan to SNI, for $10.0 million, was approved in
September 1967 and soon thereafter a Swedish loan for Sw.Kr. 15.0 million
('$2.9 million equivalent) was approved by the Swedish Government. The
Swedish loan complemented the Bank loan by allowing local currency expen-
ditures for subloans whose foreign exchange component was financed by the
Bank. By May 1969, SMI had credited approximately $6.0 million of the
second loan and it expected that it would need new resources by the begin-
ning of 1970. It therefore requested a third loan from the Bank for $10.0
million and applied to the Swedish Government for a new loan, part of which
would be utilizable in local currency.
II.  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONNENT -'
3.        Tunisia is still Dredominantly an agricu11lturall coi-it.-r, although
the share of agriculture in GDP declined from 25% in 1960 to 17% in 1968.
Important recent growth sectors have been tourism and crude oil which in
1968 replaced exports of phosphates and olive oil as Tunisia's main sources
of foreign exchange. Manufactulring activ.ity has been growing at a slower
pace, from 13% of GDP in 1960 to 15% in 1968. Industry is highly protected
and although this has led to some high cost heavyrj industries, most-ly in the
public sector, prices on consumer goods manufactured in Tunisia are not
excessive.  Prospects for dramatic growth in Manufacturing are da=pened by
Tunisia's small market and the gradual exhaustion of import-substitution
possibilities.  On the other hand, favorable factors are TLnisia's recent
trading association uith the Common Market and the adaptability of its work
force which may allow it to  crease its eports of 'igh labor content pro-
ducts. Tunisia's greatest possibilities lie in the further development of
its high toulrism potential and tourist cornnected industries.

D1uring 1968, the Tunisian econom, made good progress and output
increased by 8% after stagnating for two years.  Ilost of the improvement y
accointed for by- an i.cr-ease in agricull'tural output. In industry, grotuy

nominal since increases in the outpult of some industries were offset by
declines in textiles and fertilizers. Tourism continued its remarkable
growth and the number of tourist arrivals increased by M3% and total bed-
nights by 5C% over 1967.
5.        There was a change in the composition of total investments which
at D 118 million W.AS D 9.0 million below that for 1967, with a greater shnre
of the tota]. going to productive investments. As a result of a shortfall in
sav1ings of thp nnblic sector and in foreigm public capi+r  ) infJoz, f ixed
capital outlays of the Government were reduced by 10% and of public enter-
prises by over 20% while pvrivate investrment in touris.m, -ariculture and
transport (including cooperatives in these last two sectors) increased by

Investment Trends and Role of the lublic and Private Sectors
6.        Industry.  A major share of new industrial investments since 1960
has taken place in the public sector, particularly in the steel, light
engineering and textile industries. As a result of these initial heavy iLnves4..-
me nts, the rate of government investment in manufacturing amounted to 8%5'70
of the D 64 million total for the over-all 1965-68 plan period.
7.        The Tunisian Government pursues a fairly pragnatic poliCy ;f cS -
existence between public enterprises, cooperatives and the priva-.\e sector arcC
there appears to be a growing appreciation in some govermnent circles of the
relative efficiency of the private sector. There is also a realization of
the need for a more stringent approval mechanism for new public investmentE,
and particularly over the lack of follow-up on these.  A n.w Investment Code,
consolidating in one law various advantages already granted private investcrs,
was passed in May 1969, and a conference of foreign private investors was
also held in Tunis in May.
8.        Some predominantly private industries, such as food canning arLd
lignat engirneering enterprises, have not been successful due largely to the
uneconomically small size of individual enterprises wh-ch could, in some
cases, be profitably merged. SNI is working on facilitating some such
voluntary mergers between individual enterprises whose facilities appear
complementary.
9.        All enterprises, whether public or private, operate under a set of
government regulations comprising direct controls over domestic prices and
foreign trade and payments.  The Tunisian authorities have recently saidl that
they intend to introduce policies more effectively oriented towards the
market. These policies would act as a further incentive to private investors.
However, Tiuisia's tight foreign exchange position implies that not all direct
contrcls can be abolished inmiediately.



- 3 -
10.       For the 1969-72 plan period, total new investments of D 64 millfion
in manufacturi-ng are projectedj of which approximately 25% woultd be in the
private sector (as against 15% of the same total for the previous plan).
Mhior new public investments have been programmed in chei-cals (s1 huric
acid, phosphates), building materials and paper products whicle complementary
investments are planned for existing public enterprises in the textiles and
engineering industries. Planned investments by the private sector consist
largely of expansions by already successful enterprises  Uainly in the fIelds
of textiles, clothing, leather, furniture, printing and engineering indus-
11        mo-ar-sm..  Te extremel'- good perfurmance of this sector, wnich has
registered a 150% increase in the number of tourist nights in the 1965-68
period, is due to an active private sector guided by an enlightened Tourist
Administration.  The latter, through its powers to approve new investments
and grant incentives, influenced the building of hotel accommodations which,
while fairly attractive and comfortable, were characterized by low investmernt
costs per bed and were designed for the economy type travel business.  This
policy iwas successful, and because of Tunisia's extended season, has macde
possible the achievement of very high occupancy rates; these, coupled with
the low investment cost, have led to high financial returns.
12.       Investments in tourism facilities amounted to approximately D 40
mi'llion ir. 1965-68, of which 70% was in the private sector.  The 1969-72 plan
forecasts total investments of D 60 million of which 90% will come from. pri-
vate sources to finance approximately 32,000 new hotel beds.  The balance of
D 6.0 million will go mainly for infrastructure projects. Foreign exchange
requiremenits are expected to amount to slightly more than 20% of the t otal
hotel financing or approximately D 11 million equivalent. In viewi of the
fact that some Italian and 'Danish credits, equivalent to approximately D 5.0
million, are likely to be available for the four-year period, there will be
a gap of D 6.0 million needed in foreign exchange.
Financing of New Investments
13.       Since 1959-60, financing of public investments has been done by the
Government, either directly through budget appropriations or indirectiLy
through the Government's banking and insurance subsidiaries.  A significant
amount of financing for both the public and private sectors was also done
through renewiable short-term advances, extended largely by the government-
controlled Societe Tunisienne de Banque (STB), and through short-tern 5up-
pliers' credits. The Government and the Central Bank have moved within the
past three years to restric.t these two forms of financing.  Thus disbur--ements
of suppliers' credits of less than ten years' duration are projected; by the I'lan.
to decline to D 15 million in 1969, compared to D 17 million in 1968 and D 24
million in 1967.
14.       The reorganization of SNI in 1965-66 was a first step in the Gov rr>-
ment's and the Central Dank's efforts at improrving the supply of long-term
creditE.  Another was the new banking law, passed in December 1967 to d-iStin-
glish between ]ong-term finance institut-ions and short-terra 11deposit"' banks.



1Tho min n.1nrno  of the Tnuw is to nrepvent. the financing of long-term asEets
with short-.term resources, and SNI has emerged as the main source of long-
term fina.nce for the piate sector+
15.       Wjfrl+' respect to the public sectorn there is no specialized lone-
term credit institution, although STB can do a limited amount of lending
wVith some speciall resources,j--"-A-, ivfd a 1,nlo   gr'an+ted in 196R for llUM 10
million. LSNI has recently amended its Policy Statement, with Bank approval,
to allow some lend.ig to goverlmmental enterrises (paras. 18-19)    Such
lending is limited to 25% of SNI's total outstanding commitments and indivi-
uu-al operat;ions have to carr-y  heu -u- L-1  apdprIval of SNI's BoadV
10.       A major role in local currency  Lrianc±u-,g u± L'w n   investmnts
and in consolidating the financial structure of existing hotel enterprises,
is to be played by the new COrILTOUR (Compagnie hrianciere et Touristique)
promoted by IFC ancd SNI, of which IFC holds 20% and SNI 16.5% of the share
capital of D 5.0 millionc_/   COFITOUR wiii borrow an additional IJ ,1 ± L,llio
equivalent from IFC and the Government, and is expected to use these resources
for equity participations and loans to hotel enterprises.  Although CurFiTUr
does not exclude the possibility of doing some foreign exchange lending to
hotels, SNI is expected to do the bulk of this financing.
III.  OBJECTIVES, RESOURCES AND ORGANIZATION
Reorganizaltion
17.       ]?rior to the 1965-66 reorganization, SNI's share capital was held
58% by the Government and its agencies and 42% by more than 80,000 small
Tunisian shareho]errs.  From 1959 to 1965, SNI devoted its resources to the
provision of equity capital to new enterprises and it exhausted its resources
in its first few years of operation.   The reorganization of SNI involved a
reduction of its share capital from D 2.0 million to D 1.5 million, the pro-
vision of -a goverriment grant and a long-term low-cost subordinated loan,
and the sale by tale Gove.nment and the Central Bank of some of their shares
to IFC and to private banks, both Tunisian and foreign. Annex 1 provides a
list of SNI's major shareholders as of December 31, 1968.
Obiectives and Policies
18.       SNT's Policy Statement. adopted at the time of the reorganization,
was amended by SNI's Board in June 1969 and is shown as Annex 2. These
changes, which were introduced in consultation with the Bank and IFC, may be
summarized as follows:
(i)  SNI may finance government enterprises up to a limit
of 25%A of its totnal ontstanding commitments, provided
that each such financing proposal receives the unanimous
approval of NTI's Board.
1/  IFC/R69-25 dated May 21, 1969 and entitled "Proposed Investment in
Compagnie Financiere et Touristique (Tunisia)."



(ii') SNI may acquire securities not only by way of subscrip-
tion but also by purchase of existing securities; for
such operations, the lower limit of D 15,000 is not
applicable. SNI's Board has set an upper limit
D 50,000 for the total amount outstanding for these
transactions.
(iii)  SNI may increase its equity portfolio up to the equiva-
lent of its own equity plus the Government loan
(D 615,O00) ranking pari passu with share capital.
(iv)  Justified exceptions may be rade to the upper limit of
equity investments in single enterprises (10% of
equity plus subordinated Government loan).
19.       Tn view of the relatively small size of the private industrial
sector as contrasted to the groiwing tourism sector. SNI felt that it could
diversify its operations and increase its lending volume by engaging in
limited nublic Rsen.tor lendiinr   FTii-rt.hprmnrp_ +.hp in+.rnoduc^+.inn t.n the public
sector of SNI's stricter criteria for approving new investments (particularly

SeptemDer 3(, 1969.  They can be summarized as folo-ws:
DIOOO
Share capital                         1,500
Reserves                                517

22.       Dinars. Most of the local currency resources made available to SNI
at the time nf its reorgnanization oha-ve- been enmr.rit-ted, Tn c additi on; un 1o
t-wo thirds of the 1967 loan from the Swedish Government can be used by SWI to
cover local cl-orency costs no projercts whose foreign exchange component is
financed wiith IBRD funds. As of March 1969, about 70% of the portion of the
Swedish Gove- ment lon usable for local currency expenditures hand already
been committed, and SNI had few dinar resources left, available for new pro-
jects.  The position has become tighltuer withU11 LXJI's invest,ent I D   1. -1-'LIor.
in the equity of COFITOUR.
23.       Foreign Exchange.  The first Balk loan of $5.0 million (D 2.6 iril-
lion) is fully credited.  The second Bank loan, signed on September 14, :L96L.
is for $10 million (D 5.25 million) and as of October 31, 1969, $8.1 mil:lion
had been credited. As of March 1, $580,000 equivalent was still availab:Le cr
that portion of the Swedish loan to be used for foreign exchange commitmentz.
Organizationa
24.       Board and Executive Committee.  Annex 4 is a list of members of
SNI's Board and of its Executive Committee.  In addition to the changes ster.-
ming from the rotation arrangement agreed among the five foreign institutior!cl
shareholders in 1966 and among the private Tunisian banks, Mr. Moncef
Belkhodja, previously director of Credit at the Central Bank and SNI's new
President, was elected Chairman on January 24, 1969 to replace Mr. Mathari
who became a member of the Board representing STB.  Mr. Zghal replaced Mr.
Belkhodja as the Central Bank representative. Since June 7, 1968, Mr. A.A.
Khosropur has replaced Mr. E. Kuiper as IFC's representative on the Board.
The Board meets only twice a year, and the meetings are characterized by
franlc and effective discussions, which have led on occasion to projects being:
restructured.
25.       Daring the intervals between Board meetings,. SNI's Executive
Committee meets three or four times a year to consider applications for :lc'ui:
or eouitv investments not exceeding a total commitment of D 200,000 to arny
single enterprise. Although the intervals between the meetings are relatively
long, this has not caused any inconvenience to SNI.
26.       Managemery   Tn, his first few.1 months in officer Mr. Belkhodna has
already shown energy in dealing with some of SNI's outstanding problems.

29.      UOganization and Otaff. *   rmex 5 is an organization chart of Sn,
reflecting recent organizational changes introduced last summer.   The CrEdit
Department, headed by IVr. hiajou'., is in charge of ail customer contacts from
the appraisal stage, to the drawing of the 'Loan contracts and through the
disbursement stage.  Once loans and equity investments have been disbursed,
they are supervised by the Follow-up_Department, headed by Mr. El Goulli,1
whose departbment is also in c-large of managing SNI's equity portfolio and of
supervising relations with SITI's 80,000 shareholders.  The Administration and
Accounting :DepartIent, headed by Mr. Ferhat, has recently been given the
added responsibility of supervising SNTI's promotional work.  A separate pro-
motion department may be established in the future if the volume of promotior
activity warrants it.
30.       SNI has experienced in the past a fairly high rate of turnover,
caused partly by SNI's reputation as a good training institution for other
jobs.  The present Tunisian analysts have good potential, and in view of the
forecast increase in business, SNI should make a greater effort at keeping
them and at hiring others. Mr. Belklodja is aware of this need and has
already begun some additional recru%ting efforts.   The recent internal re-
organization has created a greater number of first-line supervisory jobs. a
step which may lead to less turnover as a result of the increased advancement
opportunities for SNI's younger staff.
31.       Appraisals are on the whole of good auality and the underlyine work
is quite thorough. SNI recognizes that it could use more market research
expertise, especially if it is to give some heln to new promoters rn expnor+-
oriented industries.  Hotel appraisals which account for a large proportion
of SNI's business are of good q'l -itir and are basd on sor. +ihorogh cos;t and
profitability studies of existing hotels carried out by SNI. SNI'Ms "free

32.       Followff-up activities on loans,  hi;ch used to be tbe repn   ib:L4-

33.       Although SNI did not have a separate _omotion department, it en-
gaged actively in several studies (dry- cells  plastics, toys, packaging)
which were conducted in the Credit Department by a chemical engineer who did
not fill a, definite organizational slot.  Tnese studies are expected to yield
some new industrial projects in the near future. SNI would like to ex-and
further its promotional role (see paras. 55-56) and the setting-up of a
separate division which might be expanded later into a full department, was
a first st;ep in this direction.

34.       Evaluation and Summarv.   Internal orzanization and staff development
have not been given enough attention in the past and turnover has been hLigh.

IV. OPERATIONS
W"L1"  Y
3i6.Annex u Is a s-ummary OI totai approvais in i9o6 ana i96o as weii as
a forecast made by SNI of its likely level of future approvals. During 1968)
SNI approved D 3.8041 million ($7.3 million equivalent) of new loans and _gLi3ut
investments, or D 48,ooo less than in 1967 in which approvals net of cancel-
lations totalled D 3.852 million.   Reflecting the tourism boom and the fact
that SNI was the main source of long-term credit in both dinars and foreign
exchange, approvals of hotel projects increased from D 2.02 million in 1967
to D 2.37 million in 1968, or 62% of total approvals during the year. SNI'_
industrial operations, however, lagged behind the previous year decreasing
from D 1.83 million in 1967 to D 1.43 million in 1968. This decrease can be
attributed to a slow-down in new industrial private investments which have
consisted mainly of extensions of existing enterprises. Planagement changes
and staff turnover at SNI may also have restricted SNI's operations and total
approvals during the first six months of 1969 amrounted to D 2.085 million,
of which D 325,000 was accounted for by SNI's investment in COFITOUR. SNl's
project pipeline increased, however, to over D 5.0 million by September 1969,
of which D 3.0 million approximately will be presented to SNI's Board meetirig
in December.
Loans and Operational Policies
37.       Approvals.  Annex 7 is an analvsis of loans apnroved, committed and
disbursed b;y SNI until the end of 1968.  It shows in recent years considerable
lags between approvals and commitments and also between commitments and dis-
bursements. Although the reason probably is that some projects were approved
at a premature stage, most delays were due to excentional circumstances and
few cancellations are expected.   MNI's management thinks that the lag be-tween
approvals and commitment will be reduced significantly during the next few
months.
.38.      SNI approved in 1968 thirty-three loans for D 3.252 million (41
loans for D 3.709 .million i  1967). 7      8 sh-ows SArs loan approvals ;las=
,3ified by cEurrency, size and sector. 65.5% of loan approvals in 1968 were



tor tounis,i, another 10.1% for the textile industry arid 6.6% to mechanical
indr,Mries. About 80% of the amount of the loans approved by S3I in 1958
will finance foreign exchange costs of projects, and the average size of
SNTI's Ionqn  decreasd from D 90ADO0  in 1967 to D 75,700 in 1968.  This is a
result of the fact that most industrial loans were for expansions. While:
the average size of SN tS touI rim lans was D 2n6.oO0n  industrial loans
averaged on:ly D 47,000.
39.       Interest Rate.   SNI increased its lending rate from 8% to 8-1/2%
in 1968 to rlaintain a spread of 2ra on 1toav fvm IBPf, '1his r       cnmrr-
able to or about 1/2% higher than rates charged by other banks except that
1I'J.L haLs pLaLLicaliv noco,.etton in LoreiL   ecag    fln.cing except f
some limited suppliers' credits and as a result of the tight liquidity situa-
i-loni UoL 'rle utnEsS  very ieiw d±riar resoureUi svc daVd±idU4l ify LU,lin ±IJU1L.
In view of the recent increase in the Bank's lending rate to 7%, a furthe!r
increase in SNI:s lending rate to 9% wiii be considered by SNI if it cannot
lower the average cost of its new resources.   The spread on the present
Swedish Government loan amounts to 4-l/2%, of wnich 2-1/2% is -o be allocatec
to a special studies and technical assistance fund for SNI's clients.   Since
disbursement;s on this loan have barely started, this fund is not yet sigrifi-
cant. SNI charges a commitment fee of 1% on the undisbursed portion of its
loans.  In addition, a study commission of 1/2% of the amount of the loan is
charged for loan applications approved.   SNI also charges a 1/2% fee on its
foreign exchange loans to cover possible small losses associated with small
fluctuations of the dinar around its par value. The foreign exchange risk
associated with a change in the official parity of the dinar is assumed by
the Government.
Changes in the Equity Portfolio
40.       knnex 9 shows changes in SNI's equity portfolio from January 1,
1966 to December 31, 1968. During 1968, SNI sold back to the Government uLfl5er
the Government Guarantee!/ equity participations at book value of D 236,UC(
consisting rnainly of SNI's holdings in SOGIC, SOGICOT and SOGILAINE (three
unprofitable Government-owned textile companies) and STOPA, a canned fruit
juice manufacturer. SNI approved in 1968 11 new equity investments for a
total of D '552 000. four times the total equity approvals during the previmc,--
year. Only D 182,000 of this amount had been subscribed as of December 31,
1968. This verv high level of equity approvals was partly due to the increas-
ing realization by SNI that it should obtain a larger share of hotel coralrani3

Contribution to the Economy
41.       By the end of 1968, SNI had provided finance to over 100 companies
by way of 3I4 equity investments and 93 loans.  MI's assistance is not
limited to the provision of finance, and it uses its extensive knowledge of
the Tunisian market to help promoters adapt their projects to local market
limitations. It has been particularly active in advising hotel promoters
about the most suitable characteristics for their projects.  MI has also
carried out independently some market studies which have led to new projects
(automobile parts, printing services) and it advises clients who encounter
operating difficulties (Sotuver-elass bottles).
42.       SNI estimates that the total investment related to the 93 projects
to which it granted loans in 1966-68 will represent, at completion, about
D 20 millione The proJects- inwnvirng SNI loans of D 8.8 million and a total
foreign exchange cost of D 6.8 million, are expected to earn or save foreign
exchange at an annual rate of D 7.7 .million, to generate annual value added
of D 7.0 million and to give employment to about 3,700 workers.
43.       SNI's appraisals include comparisons between projected prices of
industrial products and the CIf'T + cost o quivaler.t -Iported products. M4;Dst
of the industrial projects financedl by SNI appear competitive on this basis.

eign exchange earnings in relationr to their low ±Uvestmilent costs (see paras.
42 and 47).
44.       SRI is attempting to encourage savings and the beginnings of a
securities market by promoting, together with other financial institutions,
an open-end mutual fund. Shares of the fund will be sold to the public
through the sponsoring institutions wiho hope that the capital of the fund
will increase gradually from the initial D 320,000 to D 2.0 million over the
nect three years.  sNI has also requested the authorization to pay higher
rates of interest on deposits with a term longer than one year.
V. PORTFOLIO EVALUATION
45.       Portfolio Risks. SNI's outstanding portfolio as at December 31,
1968 was composed as follows:

the national airlinUe company; SJN.I will then be reimbursed not only for the
amount of the loan but also for its small equity participation in this com-
pany, D i,2uO. The other two arrears are on loans which are adequately
secured and. SNI has started legal steps to get reimbursed. Although the
quality of SNI'is loan portfolio appears satisfactory, a well founded judgment
on SNI's exposure to risk which lies mainly in its loan portfolio is difficult
considering the short time elapsed since SNI began making these loans after
the reorganization in 1966.
46.       Exposure in Tourism.   SNI's Board has set a limit of 50% of appro-
vals and outstanding commitments for SNI's financing in tourism. As of
December 31, 1968, 42% of SNI's approvals and outstanding commitments were
in tourism (Annex 11). This level has recently increased to approximately
50% with the recent participation of D 825,000 in COFITOUR's share capital
and the sale of some industrial equity participations and the refunding of
short-term advances to industry. ODn the basis of forecasts of future business
(paras. 59 to 63), including some prospective lending to the industrial public
sector, the 50% limit is not likely to inhibit future hotel business.
47.       Typical hotels financed by SNI show, on the basis of conservative
assumptions, projected returns of :15-20% on share capital. Many hotels pre-
sently in operation have higher returns. Normally, projected occupancy
ratios range from 60% upwards after the third year of operations but their
cost structure is such that they would break even at about 50% occupancy,
and would have a positive cash flow with an occupancy ratio of only 44%.
Thus, these hotels could weather a decline in business of as much as 25%
without endangering their debt-service capacity. Such a decline is not
foreseen. however, in view of the increasing number of tourists visiting
Tunisia and the fact that arrivals increased greatly in 1967 despite the
situation in the MitHdlp Eacst anrd in 1968 andi thp first half of 1969 desnite
financial restrictions in the U.K. and France. SNI's hotel investments ap-

The over-a:Ll quality of SNI's portfolio improved in 1968 witl the sale of
some unprofitable equity holdings to the Government. The dividend return of
2.8% is stiLl very low and is due largely to a low payout ratio, but SKE
expects a higher yield in the future.   Since January 1966, SNI has rece:ived
stock dividends for a nominal value of D 166,207 and although these cannot
be equated in the short run with monetary returns, they represent in fact a
device for ensuring greater returns to shareholders in the future.
VI. OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION
49.       Deposits and Mloney Market Operations.  A new banking law in ].967
restricted denosits receivable by investment banks to those with a term
longer than one year.  In the past, SNI had engaged to a considerable extent
in money market placementq miade frcm shnrt-term rPs.qrx,in   arnd had derived
the major source of its income from these operations. In order not to per-
tmrnh STI's situation, the Central Rank tacitly apreed to a tJemporarv continvia-
tion of SNI's short-term operations until such time as SNI's deposits at cali
(largely fro.rGn nve.nrnit a gencies and onv Tuhich SN\T pays no interest) were
withdrawi.  As a result of these developments, deposits decreased from D I.553

strative expenses and deDreciation fell from 2.1% to 1.9% of average total
assets. This is still high. SNI's income rose from D 158,500 in 1967 to
D 167.SO0 in 1968: this renresents a rate of return of 11.2% on share capita!
and 6.8% on average equity. This rate of return is low.

SNI has a reasonably liquid position, with a current ratio of 1.2:1.   Its
liquid asset,s consist mainly of bank deposits (D 1.11 million at 4% in S7B
and 3-3.5% in other banks), and accounts receivables (D 390,000 includine
Government subsidies of D 150,000 not yet paid to SNI). Wqhile average total
assets grew only by 10.3% and 18.4% in 1967 and 1968, partly as a result of
the decrease in deposits, the equity and loan portfolio as a percentage of
total assets increased to 47.1% and 70.1% respectively in these two years.
3NI's present borrcning capacity in terms of its Loan Agreement with the Bank
(512-TUN dated September 14, 1967) is about D 9.0 million (three times the
total of its own equity plus subordinated Government loan) of which only
D 3.1 million has been drawn down. SNI's zrant and reserves at the end of
1968 amounted to D 1,017,000, equivalent to almost 20% of the loan and ecluity
portfolio outstanding.  SNI's book value at the end of 1968 was 160% of par

VII. REIATIONS 1.TH GOVERNTMENT
53.       The influence of the Government over business activity is great,
and SNI could not function unless it enjoyed excellent relations with the
Government, which indeed it does. Despite the many important advantages it
granted SNI at the t:Lme of reorganization, the Government has left SNI inde-
pendent in i-ts investment decisions.
54.       The Government has been satisfied with SNI's performance in financ-
ing the private sector. However, in the face of the shortcomings of existing
mechanisms to finance the public sector, the Government has welcomed the
possibility for SNI to engage in some limited public sector financing (paras3
18-19). Tn addition, a recent Bank mission. which discussed with the Tunisiar
authorities the performance of public sector enterprises, reported that
officinls concerned. were    r    d in im"n1-mntAno one of t.h, alternatives
suggested to the Government for the financing of public enterprises, namely

up with many feasible projects soon.   In thie long rurn, sore of its9 basic
technical studies, coupled with SNI's practical knowledge on how to implement
them, should result in the promotion of financially and economically vUiave
new projec-ts.
57.       Government Obligations.   WJith respect to SNI's guaranteed equi.y
portfolio, the Government has adhered to the letter of its agreement to re-
purchase up to specified amounts every year according to a calendar agread
upon during negotiations for the second Bank loan. Some negotiations are
taking place at present between 5NI and the Government about the composition
of the last batch of shares to be sold back. This may put an end to the
guarantee agreement in advance of December 1970, thereby releasing SNI to
sell shares from the portfolio for its own account (see note, para. 40). SIVNI
is presen-tly thinking of selling back a final package of approximately
D 320,000 in participations (para. 64).

ments, balance sheets and cash flow statements for 1969 through 1973.
59.       Frivate Industry.   Total new investment in private industry between
1969 and 1772 is expected to average approxiMately D 4.0 i-,llion per year
(see para. 10) which is 25% of total manufacturing investment.   The list of
projects, form-ing the underlying base oI these estimates and summarized in
para. 10, would indicate that at least for the private sector, the projections
are fairly realistic since they are made up of definite projects, mainly
expansion plans to existing enterprises. SNI plans to increase its financing
possibilities in this sector by adopting a more active promotional role and
by increasing the number of customers eligible for its financing by privatiz-
ing some medtium-size public enterprises through equity investments by SNI
and other private investors. Thus, financing in this sector is projected at
D 1.7 million in 1970 and D 1,825,000 in 1971. This appears reasonable, and
1969 approvals on the basis of projects in the pipeline are expected to
reach D 2.15 million in this sector.
60.       E'ublic Sector Industry.  SNI has indicated that it intends to
extend loans only to those public enterprises wihich are economically viable
and financially sound both in terms of their prospects and their existing
structure. Although many of the larger public enterprises in Tunisia dc not
meet these criteria, there are a number of others in such industries as
building materials, textiles and food products which appear to have economic
merit and grood profitability prospects. Assuming that the necessary resources
are available, SNIts lending to the industrial public sector would only be
constrainedi by its level of lending to the private sector, in view of SfI's
Board decision to limit public enterprise financing to 25% of SNI's out--
standing commitments. SNI's management plans to further restrict such
financing to 30% of SNI'snow commitmentn- Tn v-inw of tho pron ctod level
of financing of the private sector, public sector approvals are expectedl to
amount to D 1.85 million in each of 1970 and 1971.
61.        Fourism.  Annex IL snimmrizes the infornation alreadv discussed in
para. 12 about projected investments and financing sources for the hotel
sector through 1972_ Pnrpirfn   rhnnnope resources needpd -imount to Tl 1 1 million
of which approximately D 5.0 million might be provided by Danish (D 1.0
mnillin) and itali-ar (n 4l 0riioin)  n.-er   +altog  these inntende  invest-
ments are far from certain. Thus, it can be reasonably assumed that SNI will
be called upon to provide the builk of the balance in foren;in ecnhnge need,r
i.e. D 5.0 million for the four-year period. SNI will therefore continue
its role of the pastn cigree years as the m.an sou--c o   ore' e-TIOnge in
TunLisia for hotel financing.



- 16 -
62.       With respect to local currency financing needed of approximately
D 43 million, COFITOUR is expected to provide a major share of this or
approximately D 20 million while private Tunisian entrepreneurs are expected
to provide another D 9.0 million mainly in the form of equity investments.
The balance of D 14 million is expected to be provided by SNI and by local
banks and insurance companies and SNI estimates that it can provide at least
D 5.0 million of this amount or approximately D 1.3 million per year in both
loans and equity.  This aDpears realistic considering the present and fore-
seeable tight liquidity situation of the commercial banking system and its
lack of available resources to commit on a longer term basis.
63.       Thus. altogether SNI nlans to apnrove loans and eauity investments
to be closely followed by commitments of approximately D 6.15 million in
1970 and D 6.h1 million in 1971, including D 1.85 million for public sector
industry in each of the two years. This appears reasonable.
64.       Planned Equity Portfolio Changes. In addition to its recent
investment of D 10 m-n-ion inC OFITOUR, \NIT nnq Prmlity nirticipatiorns of
D 450,000 per year of which two thirds in hotels.  SNI also plans to sell
-wnder the Goverm.ent G-nrant-e (LO IC nd 5~7) holdings totalling aypronn  ,-
mately D 320,000 including D 135,000 in El Fouladh, a Government steel mill
and D 60,00() in (rTri the C-'-rr     -owned hotel ch-in. Thee sales Two111
cover most of SNI's unprofitable equity investments, except for SOTUVER
which SN  thinks it can turnl arond anLd for which it feels it has some
responsibility as the largest shareholder. This program appears reasonable.
Resources Needed
65.       Foreign Exchange. At the beginning of 1969, SNI had uncommitted
,alances Of D 2.9 mdilion equivaien.t under 512-TMM and the Swedish loan.
As against these resources, SNI will have approved foreign exchange operations
for a total of D 1144 million for the period 1969-71. Tnus a resource gcap
of D 8.5 mi:Llion in foreign exchange remains to be covered.
66.       SNI has applied to the Swedish Government for a loan of D 2.5 aillion
equivalent (:>5 million), half of which (D 1.25 million) would be available for
foreign exchange financing.  SNI is looking to the Bank to cover the balance
of its resource gap amounting to D 7.3 million ($13.8 million equivalent'! for
a two-year period. A decision on the Swedish loan is expected in the first
nalf of 1970.
67.       Local Currency.  SrlI is in an extremely tight dinar resource situa-
tion; even :if no new dinar loans or equity investments are approved during
1969, SNI will end the year with a shortfall of D 533,000 in local currency
as compared to its commitments. At present, potential borrowers are turned
away from SNI, and they often have to postpone their local expenditure invest-
ment plans or resort in the more extreme cases to unsound financing schemnes
involving the use of short-term commercial bank credits (when these are
available) to finance long-term assets. Some potential foreign exchange
borrowers, when they cannot find their local financing complement at SNI,
turn to competing foreign suppliers' credits for their foreign exchange needs.
The situation is particularly critical in the tourism sector where projects
have a relatively low foreign exchange component and SNI lending for both

68.       Di order to meet this situation, SNI has made significant efforts

folio of DL.9 million, D 320,000 of wnich will be repurchased by the Govern-
ment.   (Government repurchases of D 697,000 of undesirable shares have already
taken place). More importantly, however, SNI would like to moDilize addi -
tional local resources and has therefore asked the Central Bank and the
riinistry of Finance to be allowed to pay higher rates of interest on long-
term deposits which, together with some requested rediscounting facility at
the Central Bank, would allow SNI to undertake some additional local currency
medium-term financing. The Government and the Central Bank have agreed in
principle to this proposal. If this is allowed, it would take some time,
however, for SNI's deposits to increase enough so as to significantly improve
its ability to finance such operations.
69.       In addition, SNI is planning on a share capital increase of
between D 1.0 and D 1.5 million to take place late in 1970 (see below
paragraph 73) and has applied for ,a '. of the requested Swedish loan of
$ 5.0 million equivalent to be avai:Lable for local currency financing.
Even with these efforts, the resource gap may still amount to about D 1.0
million for the period ending in 1971, and the shortage will be particularly
critical in the first part of 1970, before the proceeds of the proposed
share capital increase are available to SNI. The following table summarizes
SNI's local currency needs and available resources, and its resource gap
for the 1969-71 period:

70.         On the 'basis of paras. 66 and 69 above, and assuming that a
second Swedish loan of $5.0 million is made available to SNI with half of
this amount for local currency expenditures, SNI would have a total resource
gap through 1971 of about $16.0 million, of which $2.0 million for local
cost financing. In view of the Bank's commitment charge, SNI has requested
only a $10 million loan from the Bank, to cover its needs through the first
half of 1971. It also asked for part of the Bank loan's proceeds to be made
available for local currency expenditures. On the basis of SNI's forecasts,
and taking into account the timing of various cash flows, an amount of $1.0
million would cover SNI's remaining dinar gap for this period. Should such
local cost financing be made availaLble to SNI, it is likely that the greater
part of it would be for financing hlotels and industrial buildings while the
balance would be for the procurement of some locally produced capital goods
which SNI believes to be comnetitive on a CIF basis with imported equipment.
It is therefore recommended that a $1.0 million local cost component be in-
cluded in the proposed Bank loan of t10 millionn
Increase in Tt+. Ti mni+t
71.         A new loan to STI should embodt the Bankt's current formulation of
debt limits.  On that basis, SNI's present contractual limit of 3:1 would be
equivalent to approximately 3.3:1   It *T  'e' that SNIt's borrowjnp'
limitation 'be raised to 4:1.  The marginal increase from 3.3 to 4.0 is justi-
fied by t,he followi ng:
(ffi)  SNI's portfolio, as discussed in paras. "   _ appears sound.
Arrears on the non Government guaranteed part of SNI's :Loans
are small, and the equlty portfolio has improved consideralYj
in quality since the previous debt/equity limit was estab-
lished.
(i., i)  S,:,I! 5presen' rie' wort[h co-uLU cover losses equal  o abL ou
20% of the total loan and equity portfolio. It seems ex-
tremely unlikely that SNI would experience losses for any-
where near that arnount.
(iii)  SNI should be in a comfortable position to meet its debt
service. Collections on S,I' s foreign exchange sub-boanls
are high in relation to SNI's repayments to its creditors
because tne sub-projects using foreign exchange from
Swedish funds have a much shorter repayment period than
the 25-year maturity of the Swedish loan to 1NI. Debt ser-
vice coverage, which is quite high at 2.3 in 1970 decreases
gradually to 1.0 by 1982 when MI's indebtedness to the
Bank will have been substantially repaid leaving about $1
million outstanding.  (This calcuiation assumes that 4SMI
ceases new operations and does not contract any new bor-
rowings after 1972.)
P':volution cf Capital Structure
7?.         IF SNI's investment and lending program is carried out, and if
SI T's present share capital is not increased, its debt/equity ratio, as
defined in its proposed loan agreement with the Bank, wouild be as fo1lo7rs3

to support its borrowing program.
73.       SNI's management plans to carry out a share capital increase of
between D 1.0 and D 1.5 miiiion in 1970, and has discussed its plans with
IFC.  In view of the fact that some of the 80,000 small shareholders are no*-
likely to exercise their rights to the increase, SI would like to use thia
unsubscribecd portion of the increase, likely to amount to between D 400,000
and D 600,000 according to the size of the share capital increase, to attraeL
additional fioreign institutional shareholders. IFC is prepared to consicer
subscribing to its portion of the increase and in helping SNI attract nevr
foreign shareholders.  Annex 16 shows the projected evolution of SNI's debt/
equity ratic) with a D 1.0 to D 1.5 million share capital increase.
Proj ected Piofitability
74.      AAnnex 15 compares income projections for SNI for 1969-73 with
actual results for 1968. The projections do not take into account the poss--
bility of 3LflI obtaining some long-term deposits at 5% or 5-1/2% locally, to
replace some of the projected local currency borrowings abroad at 6-1/2%
(Sweden) ancL 7% (IBRD). Administrative expenses will increase only slightl'i,
despite the hiring of additional staff, because of savings on the foreizn
advisor's salary; they wrill decrease, however, as a percentage of total
assets from 1.9%9 in 1968 to 0.9% in 1971. SNI plans to begin in 1969 to
constitute provisions for doubtful loans.

SNI's management expects that dividends will increase gradually to 5% in

Use of Bank: Funds for Public Enterprise Lending
76.       ALS already mentioned (para. 18), SNI has amended its Policy State-
ment to alo   for some public enterprise lending li4ited to 25%4 of its out-
standing commitments.   Lending on this scale is not likely to divert SNI
frcm its main business of fiangg        the private sector, and will represen4t
only a small portion of the total financing needed by the public sector. Its

cially viable and ecUUUxicUially sounwd projects.
77.       SNi'U. pians to iimit its pubiic enterprise financing to 307%U of its
new commitments. In view of the fact that most public enterprise lending
will be for foreign exchange needs, a limit of 35% of the Bank loan proceeds
for this purpose would allow SNI to achieve its goal and is therefore recom-
mended. With respect to public projects, there should be no "free limit"
under the proposed Bank loan, so as to permit careful evaluation of SNI's
pe-rformance in processing such Drojects.
IX.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusions
78.       I^hile tourism is booming in Tunisia, industrial investments have
been maintained at D 16 million per year with about 15% of new industrial
investments being undertaken by the private sector; this proportion is ex-
pected to increase to 25% in the 1969-72 period. SNI is making an important
economic contribution to Tunisia and has developed as the leading long-term
financing institution for the private sector. These trends are reflected
in SNI's business volume which increased from D 2.0 million in 1966 to D 3.8
million in each of 1967 and 1968 with an increasing proportion of approvals
going to the tourism sector. Approvals are projected to increase to D L.6
million in 1969 and to over D 6.0 million in each of 1970 and 1971 as a
result of some limited financing of public sector enterprises. This appears
reasonable.
79.       Despite shortcomings in SNI's internal organization and its rela-
tively high turnover of staff, appraisals have been relatively good. However,
in view of its nrnionted innrease in bu.iT nehmilsi mnl           r'oeioontiniue
efforts at strengthening its staff.    Such staff strengthening is planned by
inTdal ng.AT wrsitehso. who inis uitstandig pw oberms. in office Ind
in dealing with some of SNI's outs-banding problems.

80.       SNIts loan portfolio has few arrears and its equity portfolio has
improved with the sale of many unprofitable holdings to the Government.
SNI's profits have increased from D 158,500 in 1967 to D 167,700 in 1968
representing a rate of return of 11.2% on share capital. Net profits are
expected to decrease to D 153,000 in 19659 when SNI will no longer be enjoying
a tax exemption and Government subsidy. They are projected to increase sig-
nificantly. however, to D 362.000 in 1971 and D 441,000 in 1972.
81.       Forei n resources which account for 70% of SNI's total resources
are expected to remain at about the same level. This is still high and it
isencoua       to ntthat     n addition to a share capital increase of El 1_0-
D 1.5 million, SNI is continuing its successful efforts to obtain additional
di nar r n Sn oe in  1n' sia
RMc .-=I end aqt i onS
82. *     C"TT is developin  satisfactorily and  it deserves continued financial
support from the Bank Group. SNI will have exhausted its IBRD and Swedish
resources by the end of 1969.  its business forecasts of over D 6.1 million
per year for each of 1970 and 1971 imply a resource gap of $20.5 million for
*    .t'    1 Nchw. '      equiv1er. for local e-penc1itire finfnlirig.
U,ILLs perioLdJLL of1 -WIU.L-LI p. )ULU..i1  -S1                    -___
SNI has applied for a $5 million loan from the Swedish Government, half of
which to be used for local cost financinrg.  To cover the balance of its needsf
for the next 18 months, SRI has applied for a third Bank loan of $10 million,
$1.0 million of which could be used for the financing of local expenditutes
83.       flIj would be a suitaDle borrower for a new loan of $10 million
frcm the Bamk.  Such a loan would cover SNI's resource gap for approximately
one and a half years from the beginning of 1970 on the assum-ption that:
(i) a aSedish loan of approximately $5.0 million eq-uivalent
is granted to SNI, part of which would be utilizable in
local currency; and
(ii) the use of Bank funds is allowed for public enterprise
financing up to a 35% aggregate limit of the loan, and
for local currency financing for an aggregate amount of'
$1.0 million.
If no Swedish loan is granted to SNI, the proposed loan would cover SNI's
resource gap for approximately one year while SNI's dinar lending might be
curtailed "by as much as 50%.
84.       The proposed loan to SNI should be made on the terms and condi-
tions applicable to recent Bank loans to development finance companies and
should be aDplied to the financing of the cost of goods and services
utilized by clients of SNI. SNI should be allowed to commit up to 35% of
the loan for the financing of public enterprises and up to $1.0 million
for local cost financing. It is recommended that SNI's present debt limit



of 3:1 be re-defined and set at 1:1 by excluding from equity and including
in debt those maturities oI the subordinated Government loan falling due
prior to the last maturity of any sub-loan or investment made out of the
proceeds of the Bank loans.
85.       SM]Ni:s free limit on lending with IBRD funds is at present $u100,0Lu.
In view of SMI's satisfactory portfolio and the steps it is taking towards
2urther improving its performance, an increase to $200,000 is recommended
in respect of private sector projects to be financed by the proposed loan.
Judging from SNI's experience of projects financed in 1967 and 1968, pro-
jects reviewed by the Bank would represent roughly 75% of private sector
commitments tnder the proposed Bank loan. With respect to public sector
projects, however, there should be no free limit under the present loan,
the use of which will enable evaluation of SNI's performance in processing
such projects.
