                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Project is to build a sustainable state statistical system which efficiently provides timely and accurate data for policy evaluation and
                         decision making. The Project will support the implementation of a broad-based poverty reduction strategy to attain job-creating, sustainable economic growth in Ukraine
                         by making available a steady supply of trustworthy and readily available social and economic statistics needed for policy making and monitoring purposes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is submitted following the supervision implementation visit in October, 2013 and is the last one for the DEVSTAT project which will be closed on December 31, 2013.
                         The DEVSTAT project originated from the Government of Ukraine’s (GoU) own initiative aimed at making wide ranging systemic change in the national statistical domain and
                         strengthening critical areas. In 2003, The State Statistics Service of Ukraine (SSSU) prepared a detailed proposal together with other beneficiary agencies (Ministry of Finance, the

                         Ministry of Economy and the National Bank of Ukraine) and in close cooperation with the World Bank. These proposals were based on the outcomes of the “Program of
                         Modernization of the State Statistics to 2002”. The World Bank supported the initiative of the GoU and provided a loan in the amount of USD 32 million to improve the capacity of
                         beneficiaries in producing high quality data in line with the international methodology and standards. The loan was provided under the World Bank lending program which aims to help
                         developing countries strengthen national statistical systems (STATCAP), and Ukraine was the first country which got a support through this program. The loan was approved by the
                         Board on March 25, 2004, and became effective on June 15, 2005 after ratification by the Parliament of Ukraine. The development objective of the DEVSTAT project was to build a
                         sustainable state statistical system, which efficiently provides timely and accurate data for policy decision making and evaluation.
                         The project included two types of activities: (i) development and improvement of the methodologies based on international standards and complemented by specialized training for
                         data producers; and (ii) development of the Integrated Statistical Data Processing System (ISDPS) on a pilot basis to implement the methodology and to improve business processes
                         in SSSU. The activities related to the development and improvement of methodologies on sector statistics, Government financial statistics, the balance of payment, monetary and
                         banking statistics as well as appropriate training programs were successfully completed by December 2010. A new medium-term macroeconomic forecasting model was also
                         elaborated and is being used by the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade.
                         The second part of the project’s activities was devoted to develop the Integrated Statistical Data Processing System (ISDPS) to improve capacity of the SSS in producing reliable
                         data and gradually moving from census to a sample base approach. The design of the ISDPS was completed in 2008, and the system development was initiated in 2010 (with a
                         contract closing date of December 2012). By that time, the ISDPS was developed and tested in a limited number of regions (2 out of 27 regions, and 4 out of 536 local offices) and on
                         a limited number of statistical surveys (2 out of 174).To roll out the test nationwide, Additional Financing (AF) at the amount of 10 million was provided in 2013. AF allowed SSS to
                         extend ISDPS testing to 27 local offices, to train staff involved in the ISDPS usage and to improve technical capacity of SSS through purchasing of additional equipment installed at
                         HQ and at the local level. During 2013 the project's activities are financed from two loans, i.e. original loan and AF. At the moment original loan proceeds are 99% disbursed, and AF
                         loan proceeds are committed and all contracts are under implementation. The project demonstrates good implementation progress and all activities that were planned during previou
                         s supervision visits were completed. The major ICB contract (more than 60% of AF) is under implementation and additional equipment should be delivered to all regional offices by
                         November 23 and installed in all sites by December 23, 2013. Since the delivery of equipment is underway ahead of the planned time schedule, the State Statistics Service of
                         Ukraine (SSSU) expects to meet both deadlines. Training of staff on Integrated Statistical Data Processing System (ISDPS) using is underway and expects to be completed on time
                         due to combination of long distance and face-to-face training. Therefore, all project activities will be completed on time. Taking into account good progress in project implementation
                         and the fact that remaining activities are expected to be completed on time IP rating was upgraded from MS to S. Besides, during the whole period of project implementation the
                         Client demonstrated high level of responsibility and ownership. The project had MS rating at the beginning due to delay in ratification by Verkhovna Rada (the Parliament of Ukraine).
                         At that time Verkhovna Rada was not politically structured, with no pro-government majority in it, and practically all investment operations supported by the World Bank suffered from
                         late ratification. There was another delay from lengthy procurement of a key contract on ISDPS development due to a slow process in obtaining clearance from the Bank. It took
                         almost a year to obtain the Bank’s clearance for the contract signing, which led to a project extension supported by the Bank’s management--as the Bank took sole responsibility for
                         this delay. Although IP ratings at that time were downgraded to MS to reflect problems in implementation, in both cases delays were not triggered by the Client’s performance.
                         Otherwise, the progress of the project would have been Satisfactory. Therefore, given generally good progress in project performance during the project’s life and PDO attainment S
                         rating is justified.

                         DEVSTAT project is an institutional capacity building project. In this type of operations, efficiency might be assessed through quality-oriented indicators rather than quantity based
                         ones. Therefore, PARIS21 methodology was suggested to assess capacity of statistical bodies and compliance of statistics to international standards. The methodology helped SSSU
                         to assess the progress of reform initiated by the Government in early nineties which were gradually implemented based on next strategies approved in 2008 and 2013. The latest
                         Strategy for the state statistics development till 2017 aims at further approximation to the EU standards and implementation of the centralized model of statistical data processing and
                         compilation. The high level of ownership of the SSSU and the need to comply with international standards according to obligations of Ukraine, ensure sustainability of PDO of the
                         project. The follow up project that was requested by the SSSU serves as an evidence of continued commitment and interest of the Client to continue statistical reform agenda.
