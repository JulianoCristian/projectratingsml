F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objective of the Project is to build a sustainable state statistical system
which efficiently provides timely and accurate data for policy evaluation and decision
making. The Project will support the implementation of a broad-based poverty reduction
strategy to attain job-creating, sustainable economic growth in Ukraine by making
available a steady supply of trustworthy and readily available social and economic
statistics needed for policy making and monitoring purposes.
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The Loan Agreement was amended with a new PDO that is formulated as follows. "The
objective of the Project is to build a sustainable state statistical system which efficiently
provides timely and accurate data for policy evaluation and decision making". By
introducing this change, the PDO in the Loan Agreement has been aligned with what was
stated in the original PAD. However, this change does not reflect any substantive
modifications in relation to the previous PDO stated in the Loan Agreement for the
original project.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
The State Statistical System of Ukraine (SSSU) is the system of state statistics bodies,
comprising the SSSU as the specially authorized central executive body in the field of
statistics, territorial state statistics bodies, and functional state statistics bodies which are
developers of statistical data, such as the MOF, MOE, and the NBU. Statistical activities
are conducted according to Ukraine's Law "On State Statistics" adopted in 1992, which
lays out the legal basis for statistical work. The new edition of the Law "On Introducing
Changes to the Law of Ukraine on the State Statistics" was adopted by the Parliament of
Ukraine in July 2000 and became effective at the beginning of the year 2001.
The process of transition to a market economy highlighted the need for reform of the
statistical system from one that served the needs of a centrally planned economy to one
which meets the needs of a democratic society and market economy.
Driven by the needs of central planners and decision makers at the lower levels of the
administrative system, the scope of statistical collections in the former Soviet Union was
extensive. The system was designed to collect comprehensive micro data, at frequent and
regular intervals of time (in some instances weekly, but more normally monthly,
quarterly and annually). A further feature of the system was that data were collected on a
“complete reporting basis” from all legal entities and units. In addition, data was
compiled at the small area level. Sample surveys were rare as almost all collections were
on a complete enumeration basis.
In 1993 the SSSU prepared the long-term "Concept of National Statistics Development"
and worked out "The Government Program for Transition to International System of
Accounting and Statistics". The first stage of statistical reforms was completed in 1997
and was characterized by concentration of resources in key statistical areas. During 1993-
1997 the basis for the system of national accounts and balance of payments; foreign trade
statistics, finance and banking statistics, new labor market statistics was created; some
branch statistics had been improved and statistical study of financial conditions of
enterprises and organizations was launched; Unified State Register of Enterprises and
Organizations of Ukraine was created. New classifications and data coding were
introduced; price indices were calculated in accordance with international standards; and
SSSU began to introduce the use of sampling methods.
The second stage of implementation of the program of statistical reforms (1998-2003) led
to further improvement of state statistics through a more focused program that is
responsive to the demands of all users. Implementation of the program was to ensure the
creation of a statistical system adapted to market conditions and international standards,
and its success was demonstrated by Ukraine's subscription to the SDDS.
Implementation of the first two phases was supported by the technical assistance (TA)
provided by the IMF, EUROSTAT under its TACIS program (Technical Assistance for
the Commonwealth of Independent States), OECD, and such bilateral donors as the UK,
France, Sweden etc. The World Bank provided support under its IBL for a
computerization strategy and procurement of the computer equipment for the SSSU in




                                               1
1993-98 ($9.0m). The project contributed to satisfying the most basic data processing
equipment needs at both Headquarters and regional departments.
Progress has been limited by resource availability. The Government did not have
sufficient resources, particularly for financing comprehensive organizational reform, staff
training at all levels, and introduction of the new data collection mechanisms and modern
communication and information technology. At the same time, the TA provided by other
international agencies and bilateral donors was of limited nature and concentrated
basically in upgrading the methodological standards and relevant training of the staff at
the Headquarters, as well as on the procurement of equipment on a modest scale, not
providing enough resources to embark upon a substantive data collection work, renewal
or organizational restructuring.
A further constraint was the absence of a proper system of financial and budget
management, and an integrated framework to guide the preparation of the annual data
collection plan. The annual plans represented an aggregation of user demands without
accompanying justification or explanations as to how the data were to be used by the
agencies making the demands. In the absence of a costing and charge back mechanism
users were at liberty to make demands for what was seen as a “free good”. In addition,
the existing approach did not have the requirement of priority setting or taking account of
cost considerations.
As a result, in many cases an excessive amount of information was collected. Large
amounts of the data being collected were not wholly relevant to decision making
processes in the new environment but were collected for reasons of tradition. The demand
for detailed small area data, particularly on enterprises, driven by traditional and
misplaced perceptions about the policy and decision-making role of local administrations,
was a driving factor in the explosive data gathering effort. The insistence for detailed data
by small area administrations has hampered the introduction of sampling methods.
The full coverage approach in data gathering in the face of an explosion in the number of
business units, particularly small businesses, has greatly increased the workload of SSSU.
A large proportion of these small businesses was often inactive and did not report. Those
that were active, however, did not account for a significant part of output. The effort and
resources employed were not commensurate to the amount of usable data generated.
These issues represented key constraints that need to be addressed at an early stage of
modernization if the SSSU was to be able to break away from the past and move towards
cutting back on the quantum of data currently collected, adopt sampling methods in its
data gathering and operate in a more efficient manner. The other key issues that hold
back adaptation of the state statistical system to market conditions were:
   •   inadequate structure of statistical bodies in the country which is inherited from the
       planned economy era and hampers the large-scale introduction of advanced data
       collection methods and use the benefits of the network environment provided by
       the modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT);
   •   insufficient level of interaction and coordination between the SSSU and other
       government data providing agencies which results in duplication of activities and
       general lowering of statistical standards;



                                             2
   •       insufficient skills and experience in modern management issues, particularly at
           the middle-management level;
   •       insufficient level of knowledge of international statistical standards, methods and
           practices, particularly at the regional level;
   •       lack of knowledge and experience in the use of statistical software;
   •       insufficient understanding of analytical techniques and familiarity with data at
           different levels of government.
The government has approached the World Bank to assist with the formulation and
financing of a long term comprehensive modernization strategy for the SSS. The Project
will support the third Program which would, together with ongoing efforts to improve
data quality, concentrate on the organizational changes in the system, data dissemination
issues and increase in efficiency of data production.
The Bank had a unique advantage due to its global expertise with necessary resources in
developing and guiding comprehensive, integrated, and targeted statistical capacity
building projects. The Bank also had broad knowledge about the country and its
development programs. Further, the Bank has established the STATCAP program to
support a sector-wide assistance to countries in their statistical capacity building activities
that will cover almost all aspects of institutional development, infrastructure
improvement, reorganization and human resource development.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The development objective of the project is to build a sustainable state statistical system
which efficiently provides timely and accurate data for policy evaluation and decision
making. The Project will support the implementation of a broad-based poverty reduction
strategy to attain job-creating, sustainable economic growth in Ukraine by making
available a steady supply of trustworthy and readily available social and economic
statistics needed for policy making and monitoring purposes.
The Project supports the third long term development Program of the SSSU. A
modernized SSS will help to improve economic policy making and private investment
decisions by providing pertinent, reliable, and timely data, thereby contributing to
Ukrainian economic growth. The improved availability of comprehensive sets of social,
poverty-related and labor market indicators, with regional breakdowns, will contribute to
the monitoring of policy implementation for social and poverty reduction.
This would be achieved by a comprehensive reform of the SSS in the following areas:
       •    strengthening institutional capacity to collect, process, disseminate the data and
            use it for policy analysis;
       •    improving the match between the needs of those who use the data and the work
            of those who provide it;
       •    upgrading the quality and flow of official statistical and administrative data by
            introducing the methodologies and definitions that can bring Ukraine’s
            performance in the field of statistics up to international standards.
A key indicator of performance is the availability of data conforming to international
standards. In addition, new policy relevant indicators will be available for the



                                                3
Government of Ukraine. There will be better and timely dissemination of data.
Quantifiable indicators of project outcomes include:
       •    an increase in the reliability of regional poverty indicators;
       •    an increase in trained and re-trained staff, particularly at the regional level;
       •    a decrease in survey non-response;
       •    a decrease in number of reporting forms and burden on respondents;
       •    growth of the number of visits to the SSSU website, etc.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The Loan Agreement was amended with a new PDO that is formulated as follows. "The
objective of the Project is to build a sustainable state statistical system which efficiently
provides timely and accurate data for policy evaluation and decision making". By
introducing this change, the PDO in the Loan Agreement has been aligned with what was
stated in the original PAD. However, this change does not reflect any substantive
modifications in relation to the previous PDO stated in the Loan Agreement for the
original project.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
There were four main beneficiaries that received direct support from the project:
   •       The State Statistical Services of Ukraine (SSSU) including its regional and local
           offices;
   •       The Ministry of Finance (MOF);
   •       The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MoEDT); and
   •       The National Bank of Ukraine.
The general public, government agencies and policy makers at all levels, academic
institutions, private sector, NGOs and Civil Society Organizations and mass media had
benefited from project through provision of better quality, timely and accessible
statistical data.
1.5 Original Components
Project components are:
Component A (Organizational Development and Management) aimed at streamlining the
organizational set-up of the Ukraine State Statistical System, building Institutional
Management Systems, strengthening the system of staff training and re-training,
developing improved statistical dissemination methods and a better user education
strategy, and improving relations with respondents and data providers.
Component B (Statistical Infrastructure) targeted improving the sampling frame for
household surveys, establishing the statistical register of enterprises and individual
entrepreneurs, introducing a unified classification scheme, and improving the legislative
basis for the State Statistical System.
Component C (Data Development) aimed to improve the quality and timeliness of a
number of statistical surveys and outputs including: household sample surveys; integrated


                                                  4
annual enterprise statistics; sub-annual surveys of economic activities; national accounts;

carry out the supervision and quality control of ISDPS development as well as
nationwide roll-out and expansion
Component F. Project Management.
This component supports the Project Implementation Unit established within the State
Statistics Service of Ukraine (SSSU). The costs for the annual audit will also be included
in this component.
1.7 Other significant changes
No other significant changes in the project.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry




                                               5
The project was designed as a Specific Investment Loan under the umbrella of the
STATCAP 2 Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The STATCAP program provided clear
guidance on project preparation and design, with the cornerstone being the development
of a comprehensive and integrated national action plan for statistical capacity building,
often linked to a comprehensive national statistical plan. The key element of STATCAP
is commitment to the implementation of a nationally-owned Statistical Master Plan based
on a coherent statistical development strategy. Ukraine had a Statistical Master Plan for
2003-2008, and met the eligibility criteria for STATCAP. Ukraine had included financing
for statistical development programs in the National Budget and had demonstrated
national commitment and leadership for statistical work, including a willingness to
comply with good statistical practice.
The project proposal was prepared by SSSU together with other beneficiary agencies
(Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Development and Trade and the National
Bank of Ukraine) in close cooperation with the World Bank. The technical design of the
project was based on a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the national
statistical system as provided in the Statistical Master Plan for 2003-2008 and all four
beneficiaries of the project were involved in all phases of project preparation, design and
implementation.
The project team took a comprehensive approach by combining the methodological and
IT improvements with support for organizational and management improvement. The
DEVSTAT project was designed with a realistic degree of complexity and achievable
number of project components. The project objectives were consistent with the
government’s priorities and the Bank’s strategy and goals. The implementation approach
was appropriate and innovative and took into consideration lessons learned from prior
statistical capacity building projects and best practices. Participatory processes were
adequate as all beneficiaries were committed to the project since its inception and
participated in all phases of its design, preparation, and implementation. The team
properly identified potential risks and accurate mitigation measures during the
preparation and paid specific attention to them during the implementation.
Although there was no formal quality at the entry assessment, the DEVSTAT project was
one of the pilot STATCAP projects and went through a rigorous review and discussion
process during the preparation.
2.2 Implementation
The actual implementation of the project started with one year delay due to slow progress
of the Parliament in ratification of loan agreement that was beyond the control of the
Government and the project team (both SSSU and the Bank). After ratification the
implementation was carried out as indicated in the Loan Agreements between Ukraine
and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD-47290 and
IBRD-82240) and in the Project Operational Manual.


2
  STATCAP is designed as a horizontal APL to make investments in statistical capacity easier and more
effective. It was approved by the Bank’s Board in March 2004. A STATCAP project is appraised and
prepared for approval at the regional Vice President level following normal provisions for investment
lending.


                                                 6
The SSSU was responsible for the overall Project implementation and coordination with
other project-beneficiaries who were responsible for the implementation of their
respective components of the Project. As the Project coordinator the SSSU prepared,
approved and when necessary revised the Project implementation plan and Project
Procurement Plan in close coordination with the World Bank. All relevant project
documents that required the Bank`s review and approval were prepared and submitted on
a timely basis.
The SSSU appointed a Deputy Chairman as the Project Manager who was responsible for
overall management of the Project in making managerial decisions, coordinating the PIU
activity and taking responsibility for preparation, implementation and achievement of
project objectives. Each beneficiary agency appointed authorized representatives who
were responsible for the coordination of implementation of the relevant components/sub-
components of the Project.
For day-to-day management of the project activities the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) has been established within SSSU consisting of a PIU Head, consultants for the
components of SSSU, NBU, MinFin and MoEDT, procurement specialists, FM
specialists, IT procurement specialist, translator and office manager. The PIU provided
overall support for the project implementation including preparation and submission of
relevant reports, assistance to the Borrower in preparation of bidding documents,
organization of tenders for procurement of goods and services, preparation of contracts
and coordination among main beneficiaries.
The Interagency Working Group (IAWG) was established to ensure the overall
coordination and monitoring of the project implementation and held meetings when
needed, but not less than twice a year. The IAWG is headed by the Chair of the SSSU
and includes at least two representatives from each beneficiary agency. Antimonopoly
Committee was also represented in the IAWG.
In general, the project has been implemented in accordance with the specified directions
and objectives. However, due to one year delay in ratification of loan agreement the
closing date of the project was extended by one year to December 31, 2010. The project
was restructured in 2010 and the closing date was extended to December 31, 2012 due to
delays in the signing of the contract for the development of the integrated data processing
system. An additional financing loan (IBRD-82240) for the project was approved on
November 20, 2012 to expand the Integrated Statistical Data Processing System (ISDPS)
nationwide based on the pilots implemented within the original project. The AF covered
the financing gap caused by the lack of state budget funds to complete the activities
indicated in Component E of the original DEVSTAT project. The closing date was also
extended to December 31, 2013.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
A detailed results framework matrix and necessary arrangements for results monitoring
have been included in the project document that would serve as benchmarks for progress.
The project team and the implementing agency, SSSU, have closely monitored the
project results and have taken corrective actions when needed.




                                            7
The results framework was adjusted 3 to reflect the impact of the AF on project
performance and achievement of PDO by adding two intermediate outcome indicators to
measure outcomes of the activities financed under the AF. The first indicator assessed the
technical compliance of the regional offices with the ISDPS requirements, and the second
indicator assessed the impact of the improved technical capacity on statistical data
compilation. The original intermediate outcome indicators that were not affected by the
AF did not change the target values, but the target dates were extended December 31,
2013 to capture the impact of additional financing. Intermediate output indicators that
were not relevant for the AF maintained both target values and target date of December
2012.
For the monitoring of the project the following reports were prepared and submitted on a
timely basis, which were adequate to monitor project results and outcomes:
    •    Quarterly progress reports including consolidated information on progress of the
         project and the detailed information concerning fulfillment of procurement plan;
    •    Quarterly financial management reports, which are produced in accordance with
         the formats coordinated with the World Bank;
    •    Project Progress Report for the last quarter of calendar year included consolidated
         information concerning implementation of the project for the whole year as well
         as the updated project monitoring indicators and the results of assessment of
         statistical capacity based on methodology developed by PARIS 21.
All these monitoring activities have been regularly supervised and coordinated by the
IAWG.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
The DEVSTAT project complied with all applicable Bank policies and is entirely
consistent with the relevant Operations Policy Guidelines. The Project did not involve
any safeguard policies, and at the time of appraisal rated as category C for Environmental
Assessment. It did not involve involuntary resettlement, natural habitats or forest areas.
The financial management system was run by the PIU and performed well during the
implementation. It was capable of recording all transactions and balances, and supported
the preparation of regular financial statements that were submitted to the Bank on time.
Internal control systems and procedures established by the PIU ensured the reliability of
accounting records, and safeguarding of the Project’s resources and assets.
All disbursements have been made in line with the provisions of the World Bank
Disbursement Handbook and the project disbursement letters dated August 19, 2004 and
December 25, 2012. The PIU prepared consolidated financial management reports and
submitted on time with the exception of one report for the third quarter of 2006.




3
 The original results framework and indicators have been elaborated based on the PARIS21 methodology.
The revised framework presents a comprehensive set of indicators to better assess the project
implementation progress. More details can be found at http://paris21.org/sites/default/files/scbi-final-en.pdf


                                                      8
All procurement of goods and services has been conducted in line with the provisions of
the Loan Agreements and Project Procurement Plans that were approved by the World
Bank. No procurement compliance issue was raised during the project implementation.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The DEVSTAT project addressed a number of issues and achieved its intended goals.
Most of these achievements have been institutionalized and could be sustained
(particularly results of components A to D). Although Component E had achieved its
stated goals, it is more likely that new functionalities for ISDPS will be developed and
introduced stepwise according to the needs and development of the information
environment of Ukrainian statistical system. The impact of the ISDPS on the organization
of data collection and dissemination and particularly on the division of labor between
different levels of state statistical offices should be taken into account, which would
require some changes in the organizational structure of the SSSU and other members of
the statistical system. This, in turn, could entail some changes in the statistical legislation.
The Government of Ukraine has demonstrated its commitment to the improvement of the
statistical system, however it is yet to be seen whether it can maintain the level of
development, or costs particularly for maintaining, updating and upgrading the ISDPS. It
should be clear that despite the achieved results of DEVSTAT project, building
sustainable statistical capacity takes longer time than the duration of such a project.
Further, to introduce new functionalities for the ISDPS and address issues arising from
full implementation of the system, SSSU will need significant amount of additional
funding. It is less likely that such funding will be available through regular budget
resources and external funding will be needed. Therefore, further cooperation with the
Bank and a follow-up project could help the Government fill the financing gap, and
hence could be quite beneficial for the statistical system of Ukranie.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The development objective of the project was relevant and consistent with the objectives
of the CAS (2004-2007) by improving the capacity of the statistical system that could
provide relevant and good quality statistical data on a timely basis needed for results-
based management.
Given that a reliable and trusted statistical system is crucial for a well-functioning market
economy, the objective of the project still remains relevant. The outcomes of the project
will certainly contribute to the achievement of the CPS 2012-2016 strategic objective of
improving the quality of public services, strengthening accountability to service users,
and targeted assistance to the poor and vulnerable. The modernized statistical system will
provide timely, relevant and reliable information for decision making and will address the
information asymmetry that exists between the Government and citizens, thus, improve
the accountability link.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The project has achieved its development objective of building a sustainable statistical
system that could efficiently provide timely and accurate data for policy evaluation and
evidence-based decision making. The national statistical system of Ukraine is now able to


                                               9
produce and disseminate key statistical data for decision makers in all sectors and at all
levels.
The methodological skills of the SSSU have been upgraded, and a new regulatory and
institutional framework for the national statistical system is currently in place and
operational. The organizational structure SSSU has been optimized, however this could
require additional refining after the full implementation of ISDPS. The dialogue between
SSSU and other data producing agencies as well as users and respondents has improved.
The relevant staff of SSSU and other agencies have received specific training and
improved their skills. Internationally-accepted standards and methodologies are now
being used in data production and sound and well-accepted statistical practices are used
for data collection, compilation, and validation. Users enjoy easier and timelier access to
data through SSSU website and publications. The SSSU has now a more efficient
management team trained in financial and administrative management and leadership.
With the implementation of ISDPS 4 the work of staff is automated across the board. All
of the SSSU staff have access to PCs that are linked to the corporate network. This has
helped the SSSU to improve reporting and dissemination process. The development of
ISDPS and its full implementation along with development of relevant applications that
automate business processes improved efficiency of staff timelines of data production
and dissemination.
The project has also supported the establishment of a modern Press Center (also used as a
Distance Learning Center) that made it possible to connect all 27 regional offices to the
central office for training and meetings.
Rate of user satisfaction increased along with access to data. The statistical capacity
indicator of the statistical system also improved (see for details Annex 2).
3.3 Efficiency
As stated in the PAD, the project is not amenable to a cost-benefit or economic rate of
return analysis as national statistical offices have hardly any significant cost-recovery,
apart from a small revenue generated from data publications, the financial returns from
this project will not be representative of the economic returns. Therefore, it is extremely
challenging, if not impossible, to carry out such an analysis and clearly identify the
economic impacts of a well-functioning statistical system on the country. The economic
benefits from the project derive from the following main sources:
    •   Improved efficiency of statistical operations of the SSSU, resulting in a broader
        coverage of and higher quality data that affect multiple sectors of society;




4
  The system was developed and tested using two statistical observations nation-wide (25 regions). During
guarantee period the system will be adjusted and completely prepared for country wide implementation.
Currently, the SSSU is consolidating feedbacks and comments from regional offices regarding problematic
issues. The contractor will address all issue for the nation-wide system usage of two tested observations.
Old and new systems will function in parallel during 2015 while two tested statistical observations will be
produced and compared. In case of consistency, further statistics will be produced using the new system
only.


                                                    10
    •   Better data will enhance the potential for evidence-based decision making, at
        policy, program, and project levels;
    •   The project helped to address the significant costs of missing or inaccurate data;
    •   A significant reduction in the cost of data collection through improved systems as
        well as by moving from full count censuses to sample surveys.
Examination of these on the basis of cost effectiveness clearly shows the high level of
efficiency achieved by the project.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
A reliable national statistical system is a key building block for evidence-based decision-
making in a well-functioning market economy. The improvement of the efficiency and
effectiveness of the statistical system has been achieved as evidenced by the production
and dissemination of better quality and timely data in all spheres of economic and social
statistics, particularly in national accounts, industry, transport, construction and
agricultural statistics. Training of statisticians and adoption of new techniques and
methods have improved data accuracy, timeliness and coherence. The statistical system
has become better coordinated, stronger and more dynamic. Statistical publications are
produced regularly and on time.
In terms of relevance, achievement of the PDO, and efficiency, the project performed at a
level consistent with a satisfactory rating.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development 5
The DEVSTAT project did not specifically target these social objectives, but had a
positive impact on them by improving the capacity of the national statistical system and
SSSU. For example, improvement of the demographic, social and poverty statistics sub-
component of the project has helped enhancing the efficiency of social assistance system
in Ukraine by improving the identification of target beneficiaries for social assistance and
simplifying the benefits allocation procedures. Further, gender indicators have been
incorporated in statistical observations in line with international practice.
The SSSU and other relevant agencies can now produce timely and reliable statistical
data that help improve social service delivery to the population, in particular to the poor,
in such areas as health, education and social protection. Further, providing a steady
supply of reliable and timely social and economic statistics helped the policy making and
monitoring processes.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening




5
 The issues related to poverty measurement were addressed under the Project "Social Assistance System
Modernization" implemented by the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy of Ukraine under the World Bank
Loan 4807-UA of 28.11.2005 that was ratified in February 2006.


                                                 11
In addition to above mentioned achievements, the SSSU has gone through significant
institutional change and as a result has strengthened its institutional capacity as evidenced
by the project results/outcomes listed below:
    •   Full harmonization of statistical legislation with international recommendations
        (UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, EU Code of Practices), which
        provided the basis for the institutional change of the statistical system;
    •   Modified organizational structure of the SSSU and improved management
        capabilities;
    •   Strengthened collaboration between the SSSU and other relevant government
        agencies through IAWG;
    •   A new human resource development framework and training strategy in place that
        strengthened the institutional capacity of the SSSU;
    •   Introduction of a unified system of classifications, covering all main economic
        classifications and nomenclatures in economic statistics;
    •   The transfer of knowledge on international standards and best practices of most
        advanced countries in all domain of statistics;
    •   Modernization of hardware and generalized software, especially in regional
        statistical offices on the level of oblast and rayon;
    •   Improvement of data collection, processing and storage of primary data,
        dissemination, publications, ICT supported cooperation with respondents and
        users;
    •   Implementing the system of integrated processing of statistical data and metadata;
    •   Upgrading skills and competence of staff managing the computer systems at all
        levels of the statistical system of Ukraine.
It was observed that the SSSU has sustained these achievements and is now capable to
provide technical assistance to other developing countries.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
No negative unintended outcomes were observed.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
A formal beneficiary survey has not been conducted, but a World Bank mission 6 visited
Kiev, Ukraine on June 21-30, 2011 as part of the ICR preparation process to review
implementation progress of the completed components A-D of the DEVSTAT project
and conducted interviews with beneficiaries. The list of people interviewed and the
questionnaires used are provided in Annex 5. A follow-up mission 7 visited Kiev, Ukraine
on October 7-18, 2013 for the DEVSTAT project ICR preparation.


6
  The World Bank team was comprised of Svetlana Budagovskaya (Sr. Economist & Task Team Leader of
the DEVSTAT project, ECSP3), Gulnara Febres (Sr. Operations Officer, DECDG, responsible for
preparation of the partial Implementation Completion Report (ICR) on DEVSTAT project, and Oleksiy
Balabushko (Economist, ECSP4.) The team was assisted by Tetyana Komashko (Team Assistant, ECCUA)
7
 The mission led by Mustafa Dinc (Senior Economist/Statistician, DECDG) and comprising Josef Olenski
(Consultant) visited Kiev, Ukraine on October 7-18, 2013 for the DEVSTAT project ICR preparation.
Svetlana Budagovskaya (Project TTL) joined the team in some meetings.


                                                 12
Both missions held meetings with relevant stakeholders and discussed the project results
and outcomes. In addition, the second mission visited one large regional office, Kiev City,
and a small rayon office, Kiyevo-Sviatoshynskyi rayon to observe the project results
outside of the central office.
The interviews with the beneficiaries of the DEVSTAT project showed that the results of
the project are positive and confirmed the project outputs stated in Annex 2. The
interviewed respondents consider that the project was timely and important in bringing
the statistical system of Ukraine up-to-date with the internationally accepted standards
and classifications. All of the interviewed beneficiaries of the project stated that the
project positively influenced their own professional development and skill sets that
provided them with a confidence in their own capacity to operate in a more efficient way.
There have been noticeable changes in institutional structure of the state statistical system
of Ukraine. The project helped increasing reliability, timeliness and quality of the
statistics produced in Ukraine, which, in turn, increased the trust in the statistical system.
All interviewed beneficiaries stated that the capacity of their respective agencies to
collect, process, disseminate the data had significantly improved, and they will be able to
sustain these gains in coming years. However, they also mentioned that there will be a
need for future support to address the new needs, which will more likely arise from the
full implementation of ISDPS.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low
The project had properly identified potential risks and relevant mitigation measures and
rated the overall risk as moderate at the approval. The Bank project team and the SSSU
have closely monitored the implementation process and during the AF process and
updated/upgraded the old “critical risks and possible controversial aspects” framework to
the current Operational Risk Assessment Framework (ORAF). It was observed that the
proposed mitigation measures worked well and project was successfully completed.
Given that the project has achieved all its development objectives and most of these
achievements have already been institutionalized, the risk of the sustainability of
development outcomes seems low. However, in coming years, the nationwide realization
of ISDPS functionalities will require continuing training of relevant staff and timely
maintenance and upgrading of hardware and software. Further, improvements and use of
IT infrastructure in the country opened up new opportunities for the SSSU to further
improve the ISDPS. In coming months and years, new functionalities would be necessary
to develop and add to the ISDPS in order to keep it up-to-date, which, in turn, would have
an impact on the organization of data collection and dissemination as well as the division
of labor between different levels of state statistical system. The actual implementation
and use of the system would help defining the priorities of developing new functionalities
of the ISDPS. In that sense, the ISDPS could be used as the basis for restructuring of the
national statistical system of Ukraine.
Although the Government of Ukraine has demonstrated its commitment and continuing
support to the improvement of the statistical system, in case the SSSU cannot get the




                                             13
necessary support from the Government for funding these new developments the risk
level of development outcomes could increase to moderate.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
As mentioned earlier there was no formal quality at the entry assessment of the project. It
was one of the pilot STATCAP projects that was discussed at the Board, therefore it went
through a rigorous review and discussion process during the preparation.
The Bank ensured that the project team had the appropriate skill mix. Technical aspects
of the project were well covered by the team, which was able to establish solid rapport
with the Government counterparts based on the quality of advice and information that
was being provided. Lessons from earlier operations and projects, and complementarities
with ongoing initiatives were taken into consideration and acted upon. The Bank
supported the idea of establishing the PIU within the SSSU, which was not set up as an
independent PIU. At the time, this approach was not the common practice for most Bank
projects in the country. This approach improved the institutional setup and management
capacity of the SSSU during the project’s implementation.
All the risk mitigation measures incorporated into the design were put in place in a timely
manner and the project progressed on schedule except with some delays that were
mentioned earlier. Ex-post reviews have only found minor issues during implementation,
and most recommendations for improvement have also been put in place in a timely
manner.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank provided intensive supervision and conducted timely supervision missions.
Members of the task team were highly competent, had substantive country experience,
and remained dedicated to the project as it progressed. The task team has focused
attention on key potential risks – financial management and procurement – and has
responded quickly to issues raised by the SSSU or the PIU. Overall, supervision was
rated as satisfactory.
The procurement risks were taken into account and addressed by Bank staff during the
supervision missions. The recommended corrective measures were put in place by SSSU
and procurement implementation progressed satisfactorily, although with some delays in
few contracts. Procurement risks have been mitigated through supervision, which took
place in a timely and appropriate manner. Field supervision missions including ex-post
reviews have been carried out as scheduled. Procurement specialists were very well
integrated into supervision missions and most reports covered procurement issues in a
timely and coordinated fashion. The Bank team and the SSSU have managed the
procurement process and its execution diligently.




                                            14
Comprehensive financial management supervision was conducted on a regular basis.
Project FM supervision covered all relevant areas including accounting and reporting,
internal control procedures, planning and budgeting, external audits, funds flow,
organization and staffing and sample transaction review. The responsible FM specialist
was resident in the country office and was therefore able to have regular follow up. Issues
arising from external audits/management letters and submission of FMRS have been
resolved in a timely manner.
The ISRs have been prepared with enough detail on a timely basis by the task team.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
In light of project outcomes and the quality of intensive supervision carried out during the
project, the overall Bank performance was assessed as satisfactory. The Bank’s
performance did not suffer any shortcomings throughout the duration of the project.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
From the very beginning, government ownership and commitment to the project
remained consistently strong as evidenced by the timely provision of counterpart funding,
which was provided by the government of Ukraine based on the budget requests of the
project beneficiaries. The Government has also been very supportive in issuing necessary
decrees on a timely basis that helped change the system.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The implementing agency, the SSSU, was responsive to the implementation needs of the
project and established good cooperation with the task team that was maintained
throughout the project implementation. The SSSU had a competent and knowledgeable
Project Coordinator and experienced project implementation team that were able to
successfully manage the procurement and financial management aspects of the project.
Similarly, other beneficiary agencies demonstrated strong ownership and successfully
implemented their respective components on a timely basis. They all worked in close
collaboration with SSSU and strengthened the capacity of their relevant units.
Representatives of other beneficiary agencies expressed their overall satisfaction with the
project and their willingness to carry on the partnership with the SSSU.
Given the overall achievements and results the performance of implementing agencies is
rated as satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
With the exception of a delay in ratification of Loan Agreement by the parliament, the
borrower has demonstrated strong ownership and continuing support for the successful
implementation of the project. The SSSU is planning to prepare a follow-up project that


                                            15
will ensure the compliance with international standards and best practices in sustainable
manner, which is seen as an evidence of continued commitment and interest of the
borrower to continue statistical reform agenda.
6. Lessons Learned
   •   The team took into account critical lessons learned from the earlier statistical
       capacity building operations when designing the DEVSTAT project. Following
       these lessons, the team employed a more systematic approach instead of the
       piecemeal approaches and designed the DEVSTAT project as a comprehensive
       statistical capacity improvement operation that covered broader aspects of the
       national statistical system. Another important lesson the team has taken into
       account and maintained during the implementation was that statistical capacity
       building requires integrated and coordinated support that could take a long-term
       commitment.
   •   The successful completion of the project confirmed once again the soundness of
       these earlier identified and recognized lessons in statistical capacity building
       operations. This was demonstrated by strong ownership and commitment of the
       Government and SSSU from the beginning through implementation, which helped
       successful preparation and completion of the project. Further, ownership and
       commitment by the Bank project team as evidenced by the continuity and close
       engagement was another factor that helped successful completion of the project,
       which was appreciated by the borrower and helped building and maintaining a
       relationship of trust. These are good lessons that could be utilized in future
       operations.
   •   Initially, the project procurement plan included a large number of small
       procurement packages. The project team discussed with the borrower to bundle
       similar items into one large contract and made necessary adjustments in the
       procurement plan. The project proved that this approach has been more cost
       efficient and time saving. Signing a single contract with a consortium regarding
       the TA consulting services was the right choice for such complex and
       comprehensive projects. This mechanism provided a one-stop-shop for expertise
       and technical assistance and helped the implementation of project in a coherent,
       consistent and well-sequenced manner. This is an important lesson that should be
       considered by similar Bank projects in the future.
   •   In many countries the ratification process of loan agreements by the parliament
       for the Bank funded projects could cause delays in effectiveness and
       implementation of projects. This was the case for the DEVSTAT project in
       Ukraine. This was beyond the control of the Government, SSSU and the Bank
       team at that time. Since then the process was changed. For the new projects the
       Bank project team along with the borrower should make sure that the project
       funds will be included in the budget line for the implementing agency; so it will
       not go through the ratification process. In such cases for other countries,
       identifying champions of project (statistics) within parliament and/or in key
       committees and hold talks with key members of the parliament and relevant
       committees could help the ratification process.




                                           16
   •   It has been the general experience from the previous Bank projects that
       procurement of IT equipment, particularly complex IT systems was a difficult and
       lengthy process. Due to their complex structure and limited number of
       experienced IT procurement specialists in the Bank, procurement process of IT
       related packages (design and implementation of IT systems, equipment, software
       and relevant training) is generally slower than other type of procurements. This
       appears to be the case in DEVSTAT project. There was a more than one year
       delay resulting from lengthy review and clearance process of a key contract on
       ISDPS development. The lesson that should be drawn from this experience is
       twofold. First, the Bank needs to increase the number of experienced IT
       procurement specialists. Second, in such cases, both the Bank and client team
       should work closely with relevant procurement specialists and design the
       procurement package in a way that there would be no confusion or
       misspecification in the package.
   •   Establishing the PIU within the SSSU instead of as an independent PIU helped
       improve the management capacity of the SSSU and ensured successful
       implementation of the project. This is another good lesson the project
       demonstrated and should be utilized in such operations in the future.

Two statistical products chosen for
system’s testing (piloting) assume that
ALL functionalities will be tested in order
to extend the results of this stage to other
statistical products. At the end of testing
stage the operational acceptance of system
will take place. The results of pilot test
implementation on the basis of 2x2x2 (2 x
questionnaires, 2 x oblasts and 2 x rayons
in each oblast) seem to be sufficient for
testing main functionalities of the ISDPS.
Positive realization of the pilot test
implementation means that the successful
completion of the project and DPO are
achieved and that the ISDPS is operational
for its use in Ukrainian statistics.
However, the scope of the questionnaires
in the pilot test implementation, although
sufficient for testing main functionalities
of the software and orgware, does not
cover all kinds of questionnaires, that are
used in the Ukrainian statistical system. It
is suggested, if the project is continued, in
the phase of full operational implementing
of the ISDPS, planned for 2014, to
elaborate detailed specification of
functionalities of the ISDPS for all types
of surveys, questionnaires and information
sources. To reach this objective, it is
suggested to specify the sequence of
surveys and questionnaires representing
main types of surveys, metadata and
database systems, representative for usage
situations of the state statistics, that will be
stepwise implemented to the ISDPS:
     •    one representative questionnaire
          for each class of statistical
          respondents:
     •    annual, quarterly and monthly
          survey (annual data for 3 years,
          quarterly and monthly data for 18
          month period;
     •    surveys using different forms of



                     48
    input data: paper and electronic;
•   sample survey with changing
    samples;
•   metadata base enabling dynamic
    changes and updating of
    metadata: classifications,
    definitions of terms, algorithms of
    computing output data;
•   time-series data base;
•   queries and profiles of end-users
    for friendly defining of changes
    of requirements.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
As stated in the PAD, the project is not amenable to a cost-benefit or economic rate of
return analysis as national statistical offices have hardly any significant cost-recovery,
apart from a small revenue generated from data publications, the financial returns from
this project will not be representative of the economic returns. Therefore, it is extremely
challenging, if not impossible, to carry out such an analysis and clearly identify the
economic impacts of a well-functioning statistical system on the country. The economic
benefits from the project derive from the following main sources:
   •   Improved efficiency of statistical operations of the SSSU, resulting in a broader
       coverage of and higher quality data that affect multiple sectors of society;
   •   Better data will enhance the potential for evidence-based decision making, at
       policy, program, and project levels;
   •   The project helped to address the significant costs of missing or inaccurate data;
   •   A significant reduction in the cost of data collection through improved systems as
       well as by moving from full count censuses to sample surveys.
The impact on economic development could be assessed in three ways:
   •   the value and costs of delivering current statistics and of generating new and
       upgraded information;
   •   the long-term cost effectiveness of streamlining statistical work and of efficiency
       and accuracy gains in reducing labor-intensive statistical operations; and
   •   the impact of reliable data on policy making.
It would be quite difficult to evaluate these impacts quantitatively and evaluation
methods would be highly subjective.
Given that changing policies and practices would create complex and diversified
development patterns, relevant and timely information that could help monitoring the rate
and direction of change would become an indispensable asset to public and private-sector
policy makers.
The project would have a very low overall fiscal impact. The effect on recurrent costs
resulting from the project is expected to be negligible, since the increase in recurrent
costs resulting in the possible higher maintenance costs for the newly installed ICT
equipment would be counterbalanced by the decrease in the existing high maintenance
costs of the current obsolete equipment, and by the decrease in data collection costs due
to rationalization of the data collection plans. Although this is a non-revenue generating
public sector reform project to improve statistical capacity, it should lead to considerable
cost reduction through better management and the abolition of costly and archaic
methods and processes, as well as undesirable duplication of effort. Some revenue may
eventually be generated by sales of information, statistical products and services in the
planned information centers.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
A formal beneficiary survey has not been conducted, but a World Bank mission visited
Kiev, Ukraine on June 21-30, 2011 as part of the ICR preparation process to review
implementation progress of the completed components A-D of the DEVSTAT project
and conducted interviews with beneficiaries. The list of people interviewed and the
questionnaires used are provided in Annex 5. A follow-up mission visited Kiev, Ukraine
on October 7-18, 2013 for the DEVSTAT project ICR preparation.
Both missions held meetings with relevant stakeholders and discussed the project results
and outcomes. In addition, the second mission has visited one large regional office, Kiev
City, and a small rayon office, Kiyevo-Sviatoshynskyi rayon to observe the project
results outside of the central office.
The interviews with the beneficiaries of the DEVSTAT project showed that the results of
the project are positive and confirmed the project outputs stated in Annex 2. The
interviewed respondents consider that the project was timely and important in bringing
the statistical system of Ukraine up-to-date with the internationally accepted standards
and classifications. All of the interviewed beneficiaries of the project stated that the
project positively influenced their own professional development and skill sets that
provided them with a confidence in their own capacity to operate in a more efficient way.
There have been noticeable changes in institutional structure of the state statistical system
of Ukraine. The project helped increasing reliability, timeliness and quality of the
statistics produced in Ukraine, which, in turn, increased the trust in the statistical system.
All interviewed beneficiaries stated that the capacity of their respective agencies to
collect, process, disseminate the data has significantly improved, and they will be able to
sustain these gains in coming years. However, they have also mentioned that there will be
a need for future support to address the new needs, which will more likely arise from the
full implementation of ISDPS.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
I.     Evaluation of the final result, in accordance with the agreed objectives of the
project, Development of the State Statistics System for Monitoring the Social and
Economic Transformation, including the Additional financing of the project
(hereinafter, the Project).
Rating: good (one of the main reasons for the delay in implementation of the Project was
long-time ratification of the Loan Agreement № 4729 - UA 15 July 2004 by the
Parliament of Ukraine)
The objective of the Project is the development of the sustainable state statistical system
that ensures effective and timely provision of accurate data for policy evaluation and
decision making – in general achieved, as evidenced by the work that has been performed
under the Project.
As a result of the Project, the target value indicators for monitoring the Project
implementation are achieved, and relevant information is provided in the Appendix.
Comprehensive performance indicator of statistical capacity of the state statistics bodies
of Ukraine corresponds to the specified target value and has been increased from 2.9
points to 3.5 points during the implementation of the Project.
The execution of the Project, including actions of the Additional financing, has assured
substantial positive changes in the development of the sustainable state statistical system
of Ukraine due to the strengthening of statistical infrastructure; testing and introduction
of the new methods, that meet up-to-date international statistical standards, into national
practice; upgrading of professional skills of the state statistical bodies staff related to the
introduction of new methodology and use of new software products.
Moreover, due to the Project, the software and technical infrastructure at all levels has
been fundamentally improved that allowed to increase the work productivity and
effectiveness, and enabled further introduction of the Integrated statistical data processing
system (ISDPS).
Project implementation was carried out by separate components of the Project in
accordance with the set goals and objectives. The key results of the project are the
following.
Under the implementation of the Component A (Organisational Development and
Management), in 2009, the modern press-center equipped with video conference facilities
was created. The mentioned enabled new organization of the current work of the state
statistics bodies, information dissemination, training of experts at all levels. The
availability of the press-center contributed to considerable reduction in the number of
business trips and the related costs.
To fulfill the objective on staff development, a number of English language courses for
the staff from the headquarters of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine (SSSU) were
conducted. It enhanced the capacity of the employees to work with the methodological
documents of the leading international statistical agencies. Besides, with regard to the
harmonization of national statistics with the European standards, more than 40 legal acts,
classifications and methodological documents as well as manuals of UNECE, Eurostat,



                                              58
OECD and national statistical institutes of the EU member states on various areas of
statistics were translated to be employed in everyday work.
Components B (Statistical Infrastructure) and C (Data Development) were implemented
by the State Statistics Service of Ukraine under the single contract, which covers 16 areas
of statistics, and which performance enabled the SSSU staff (at the central and regional
levels) to get acquainted with the up-to-date European practice in various areas of
statistics, develop new and update the existing techniques, test new surveys and
technologies for data collection. Execution of the measures under the Project contributed
to the realization of objectives, set by the Strategy of the State Statistics Development for
the Period till 2012, and harmonization of the national statistics with the European
statistical standards. Recommendations given by the European experts are used to further
improve the system of state statistics in Ukraine.
Activities aimed at improving the government finance statistics were accomplished by
the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. The National Bank conducted activities focused on
the improvement of the methodology for the monetary and banking statistics, balance of
payments, external debt and international investment position statistics. Experts from the
Ministry of Finance of Ukraine and the National Bank completed training to develop
skills in the relevant subject-matter area and English language. In the framework of the
Project, the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine and the National Bank procured the
equipment required to enhance their capacity to produce relevant statistics.
The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade under Component D of the Project
(Strengthening of Information Basis for Decision Making and Forecasting in the Ministry
of Economy and the European Integration) implemented measures aimed at applying new
short- and medium-term forecasting models and modernization of data presentation
methods, and data processing system used for analytical purposes. In particular, the
following items were developed:
   •   applied software, Integrated system of macroeconomic forecasting models, that
       allows to compile short and medium term forecasting of main macroeconomic
       indicators quickly and comprehensively, monitor the balance ratio between the
       main economy sectors, edit the existing econometric model equations based on
       changes in the economic structure and new development conditions;
   •   software, Information-analytical system for decision-making and forecasting, for
       automated data collection, accumulation, processing, storage and use of reliable
       economic information.
The relevant training of the Ministry staff was conducted to ensure the operation with the
developed systems.
The key component of the Project was Component E (Introduction of Modern
Information and Communication Technology), activities under which were intended to
improve the processes of statistical data collection and processing.
According to the Project objectives, a series of activities on Integrated Statistical Data
Processing System development was fulfilled. In particular:
   •   fulfilled testing of the approaches on two-level statistical data processing system
       introduction(2006);


                                             59
   •   ISPSD design taking into account the latest achievements of the Statistical
       Services of other countries was developed (2008);
   •   In order to manage the Sybase databases, the standard software by which the
       ISPSD was developed as well as the software providing the analysis and
       processing of the SPSS statistical information were purchased;
   •   During May 2010 - December 2013 the direct development, limited migration and
       ISPSD testing were fulfilled. Limited testing of the System was carried out on the
       basis of the two state statistical observations conducted in two regional offices
       and four district statistical divisions to ensure its operational acceptance. As a
       result of the works a new system was developed based on metadata. This system
       is supposed to provide data processing operation debugging for all statistical
       observations without the development of specific software for data processing.
       The developed system was deployed at the regional level to ensure the necessary
       training of personnel working with ISPSD and building the base for further
       implementation of ISPSD throughout the country.
In the frameworks of strengthening of the technical infrastructure of the state statistical
bodies of all levels, the office, printing, computer and server equipments were purchased.
Taking into account the actual lack of computer equipment at the district level and to
create basic working conditions for territorial authorities, the first procurement of
computer and server equipment was made in 2007. In addition, the local computer
network of the state statistical bodies was upgraded and expanded and centralized IT
infrastructure was created. It made possible to increase the level of computer equipment,
in particular at local and regional levels, as well as provide a basis for further ISPSD
development.
With the aim of creating the necessary technical conditions for development, testing and
further implementation of ISPSD, the SSSU purchased: additional software for Sybase
databases management at the central and regional levels to create the test environment for
ISPSD; additional hardware that meets the requirements of the installation of ISPSD and
server equipment both for initial testing purposes of ISPSD and tasks of its further
implementation. As a result, 100% equipment level of the regional statistical bodies with
computers was provided. It allows carrying out further activities on implementation of
ISPSD.
Within the framework of the additional financing of the Project, the air conditioning in
ISPSD datacenters’ server premises at the central and regional levels was upgraded to
create favorable technical conditions for further ISPSD functioning (54 units of
equipment were purchased and installed).
With the aim of creating collective networking resources for printing the source
documents from the ISPSD users’ automated workplaces, the technical environment of
the ISPSD functioning was upgraded by retrofitting the complex of technical means at
the central and regional levels with 120 laser printers.
To support the functioning of the system of processing and displaying the streaming
media (PDSM) and to ensure the learning process for the ISPSD users, more servers of
the system (PDSM) were purchased.



                                            60
To ensure the further use and work with the software products that have been purchased
and developed within the framework of the Project, the training for the state statistics
bodies’ staff was conducted to learn: SPSS software for processing and analyzing
statistical information (210 persons), Sybase software for database management (82
persons) and specialized training of the SSSU staff at central and regional level, that is to
be involved in the implementation and use of the ISPSD, ISPSD functioning (600
persons). To provide further support to the ISPSD users during its operation, the
customer support was established.
II. Evaluation of the Borrower work (responsible executive of the Project State
Statistics Service of Ukraine) at the project preparation and implementation stages
and the acquired experience that can be useful in future
Rating: good.
The implementation of the Project was carried out by State Statistics Service of Ukraine
(before 2012, the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine, the responsible executive of the
Project) in collaboration with three other beneficiaries - Ministry of Finance of Ukraine,
that is also the Borrower on the side of the Government of Ukraine, and the National
Bank of Ukraine, that are also the developers of the sectoral statistics, and the Ministry of
Economic Development and Trade, that is the key user of statistical information.
At the stage of the Project preparation, a group of consultants on the project preparation
was involved, that, together with the World Bank and all the beneficiaries of the Project,
have designed the set of the project documentation: Description of the Project Strategy
"Development of the State Statistics System for Monitoring the Social and Economic
Transformations Project", feasibility study, procurement plan, implementation plan,
Guidance on the rules and procedures of the Project management.
To ensure coordination of the Project works, the interagency working group for
coordination and monitoring of the projects has been created and maintained (Cabinet of
Ministers of Ukraine of 11 February 2004 № 75 -p with changes and amendments).
For the purpose of the Project management in the SSSU, the Project Implementation
Group was established, which provided the implementation of all Project activities,
including financial management, procurement, organization, preparation of reports,
project assessment and monitoring.
The management of the Project Responsible Executive has made every effort to ensure
the timely and effective implementation of the Project activities by monitoring the
implementation of the planned activities, coordination and solving the project technical
and managerial issues with the World Bank, coordination of the works under the World
Bank project and other international cooperation projects in the area of statistics.
If at the beginning of the project implementation due to the lack of sufficient experience
and knowledge of the World Bank rules and procedures and the rotation in the
management of the project beneficiary ministries, some delays in the implementation of
the Project activities or with payments posting were observed, then further realization
was done timely or without significant procedure problems. The Ministry of Finance of
Ukraine that is a Lendee on the side of Ukraine’s government provided the needed



                                             61
consultative support to an Executive in charge in implementation of the practical tasks
connected with the financial part of the Project management.
The experience obtained by the Executive in charge and other beneficiaries of the Project
in the part of the preparation and realization of the Project is very useful since it allowed
to receive the needed skills which have been used during implementing the procedure of
Additional financing of the Project and could be used in the future to prepare and
implement the projects financed by IFO.
III. Assessment of the World Bank work at the stage of the Project preparation and
implementation including the effectiveness of their interrelations and the experience
obtained.
Assessment: good
During the whole period of the Project preparation and implementation, the close
cooperation between the World Bank and the Lendee (the Ministry of Finance), the
Executive in charge (the SSSU) and other Project beneficiaries was established. Under
the support and during consultations with the World Bank experts, the development of all
initial Project documents was made. To prepare the Project Development of the State
Statistics System for Monitoring the Social and Economic Transformation, the Japan
government grant was received with the assistance of the World Bank.
During the Project implementation, the Project management from the part of the World
Bank, the Bank experts in purchasing, IT matters, financial management provided the
needed consultations on different issues that have had the executives in charge.
In order to assess the state of play of the Project implementation, twice a year the World
Bank launched the assessment missions which assessed the current status of the project,
coordinated actions for more effective Project implementation and defined the steps to
achieve the Project objectives. Based on the results of its missions, the World Bank
prepared and forwarded the Memos to the Lendee to be taken into account in further
work. The Project manager on the part of the World Bank made a constant monitoring
over the Project implementation through the constant feedback with the Project Executive
in charge.
If at the initial stage of the Project implementation the consideration of the selected
documents connected with the purchasing was rather long, later on the documents and all
requests from the Lendee were considered by the Bank in a timely manner. The Project
management on the part of the World Bank always tried to suggest the approaches for
more effective and efficient implementation of some or other Project actions under the
framework of the rules and procedures of the World Bank.
Also, the World Bank supported the Lendee's request to provide Additional financing for
the Project and ensured a significant support during the procedure for preparing and
coordinating the documents for the Additional financing of the project in 2012.
The constructive dialogue and openness during the cooperation helped create the team
spirit and confidence between the World Bank and the Lendee. All comments,
consultations and recommendations on the part of the World Bank experts on different
matters concerning the Project implementation, especially on issues regarding
information technologies, the Project financial and administrative management helped


                                             62
implement the Project actions and achieve the targeted objectives as well as improve the
knowledge and skills of the Lendee staff involved into the Project implementation.
IV. Plan for further development and support to the results achieved during the
Project implementation
Proceeding from the results achieved during the Project implementation and taking into
account the further tasks faced by the state statistics bodies, the SSSU prepared the draft
Action Plan aimed at further development and support to the results achieved during the
Project implementation.
The ISDPS implementation into industrial practice requires the transition of the rest of
statistical surveys into the integrated system and this is a long and labor consuming
process since it requires the development of metadata for each survey, migration of data
from the existing complexes of electronic processing into the new integrated system,
approbation, etc. The ISDPS implementation and functioning needs the realization of a
complex of activities in different statistical directions including information and
communication technologies and statistical infrastructure.
I. Further development of Information and Communication Technologies
   •   The implementation of the Integrated Statistical Data Processing System (ISDPS)
       in the regional statistics offices.
   •   Modernization of the system for collecting the state statistical reporting in
       electronic format and its integration with the ISDPS.
   •   Development of the corporate network of the state statistics bodies regarding
       involvement of district level into the ISDPS work.
   •   Confidentiality and security of data through creation of the comprehensive system
       for protection of information, corporate information and telecommunication
       system of the state statistics bodies.
   •   Expansion of uses of specially-tailored software IBM SPSS Statistics in statistical
       activity.
   •   Training of the IT experts and statisticians who work with the updated technical
       and software means.
II. Further development of Statistical infrastructure
   •   Modernization of the register of statistical units.
   •   Automation of the processes to update data from the Statistical register of
       enterprises (SRE) based on the results of the state statistical observations and
       administrative sources in order to launch observation over the demography of
       enterprises and prepare data according to annex 9 of Order 295/2008 of the
       European Parliament and EU Council of Ministers, upgrade the quality of the
       register and ensure relevant status of statistical units list for short-term surveys
       (monthly, quarterly).
   •   Improvement of the tools to design samples and its integration with the register of
       statistical units.
   •   Development of the statistical metadata system:




                                            63
          o Establishment of the unified systemized catalogue for statistical indicators
            which would be used at all stages of statistical production: starting with
            the definition of the needs of users and up to dissemination of statistical
            information as well as filling-up the metadata base of the Integrated
            Statistical Information System.
          o Creation of the standard template for meta description for statistical
            observation harmonized with the European standards.
III. Organizational development and management
   •   Modernization of the system to train and re-train the staff.
   •   Improvement of the relations with respondents and suppliers of data.
