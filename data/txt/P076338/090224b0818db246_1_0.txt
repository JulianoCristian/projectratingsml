                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Project is to build a sustainable state statistical system which efficiently provides timely and accurate data for policy evaluation and
                         decision making. The Project will support the implementation of a broad-based poverty reduction strategy to attain job-creating, sustainable economic growth in Ukraine
                         by making available a steady supply of trustworthy and readily available social and economic statistics needed for policy making and monitoring purposes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is submitted following the supervision implementation visit in June 18-21, 2012 followed by preparation and approval of the Additional Financing (AF) for the DEVSTAT
                         Project.

                         The project was restructured in December 2010 for the continued implementation of components E (introduction of Modern Information and Communication Technology) and F
                         (Project Management) by the State Statistics Service of Ukraine (SSSU). The development of the Integrated Statistical Data Processing System (ISDPS) within component E is
                         ongoing. The Government of Ukraine applied to the Bank requesting the Additional Financing to extend a number of activities related to the ISDPS. The implementation time
                         schedule was revised to accommodate for the nationwide ISDPS roll out financed under the AF.
                         At this stage the ISDPS is being piloted in two regions for two statistical surveys. Seven phases (out of nine) were developed and accepted by the SSSU.
