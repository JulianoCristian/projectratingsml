Transformation Project for Ukraine\n            was judged to be satisfactory. The Bank and borrower\n            performance were satisfactory. The risk to development\n            outcome was moderate. Several lessons were learned.\n            Statistical capacity building requires integrated and\n            coordinated support that could take a long-term commitment.\n            Ownership and commitment by the Bank project team, as\n            evidenced by the continuity and close engagement, was\n            another factor that helped successful completion of the\n            project. Initially, the project procurement plan included a\n            large number of small procurement packages. The project team\n            discussed with the borrower to bundle similar items into one\n            large contract and made necessary adjustments in the\n            procurement plan. The project proved that this approach has\n            been more cost efficient and time saving. Signing a single\n            contract with a consortium regarding the technical\n            assistance consulting services was the right choice for such\n            complex and comprehensive projects. This mechanism provided\n            a one-stop-shop for expertise and technical assistance and\n            helped the implementation to be coherent, consistent and in\n            a well-sequenced manner. The Bank project team, along with\n            the borrower, should make sure that the project funds will\n            be included in the budget line for the implementing agency\n            so it will not go through the ratification process. In such\n            cases for other countries, identifying champions of project\n            (statistics) within parliament and/or in key committees and\n            by holding talks with key members of the parliament and\n            relevant committees could help the ratification process. The\n            Bank needs to increase the number of experienced information\n            technology procurement specialists. The Bank and client team\n            should work closely with relevant procurement specialists\n            and design the procurement package in a way that to avoid\n            confusion or misspecification in the package."}, "docdt": "2014-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
