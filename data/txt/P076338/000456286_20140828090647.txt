INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Management of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine

We have audited the special financial statements with regard to the Additional Financing for the
Development of the State Statistics System for Monitoring the Social and Economic Transformation
Project {further - the Project), financed under the World Bank Loan #8224-UA for the period from
January 01, 2013 to June 04, 2014. The statements comprise:
    •       Summary of sources and use of funds for the period from January 01, 2013 to June 04,
        2014;
    •       Statement of expenditures for the period from January 01, 2013 to June 04, 2014;
    •       Statement of Special Account for the period from January 01, 2013 to June 04, 2014;
    •       Summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.

               Management's responsibility {or the Special financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these special financial
statements in accordance with regulations of the World Bank. This responsibility includes: designing,
implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error;
selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are
reasonable in the circumstances.

               Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the special financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including
the assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the special financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to
the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by
the management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the special financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.
