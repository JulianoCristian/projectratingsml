                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Project is to build a sustainable state statistical system which efficiently provides timely and accurate data for policy evaluation and
                         decision making. The Project will support the implementation of a broad-based poverty reduction strategy to attain job-creating, sustainable economic growth in Ukraine
                         by making available a steady supply of trustworthy and readily available social and economic statistics needed for policy making and monitoring purposes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is submitted following the supervision implementation visit in February-March, 2013 and preparation to the current CPPR in July, 2013.

                         The Additional Financing for the project was approved in December 2012 and became effective in February 2013 to help the SSSU in rolling out the Integrated Statistical Data

                         Processing System (ISDPS) nationwide. December 31, 2013 is a new closing date for the original project to match with the closing date established for the AF. The implementation
                         time schedule was revised during the last supervision mission to accommodate for the nationwide ISDPS roll out financed under the AF. However, pace of implementation is slower
                         than planned and most of the deadlines indicated in the procurement plan were achieved later than planned. Moreover, the processing of the ICB (more than 60% of AF) was not
                         finalized yet and it is obvious that the contract signing will not meet the July 15 deadline.

                         After receiving of AF the schedule for the ISDPS implementation was revised to incorporate development of additional functionalities. Currently 22 phases should be developed
                         (instead of 9), and 11 phases has been completed. In spite of the progress in development of the ISDPS the team propose to downgrade IP rating from S to MS because of delay in
                         the ICB implementation. Other ratings remain the same.

                         Since all other contracts under AF were concluded and currently under implementation, the Project still has a chance to be completed timely and in full scale. However, close
                         supervision is needed and it was agreed that the Client would report on the Project progress weekly in addition to regular quarterly reports required under the LA.

                         Audit report for 2012 was submitted to the Bank timely.
