                           1. Despite delays (mainly due to lengthy procurement processes and relatively low disbursement levels), key progress and results are being achieved on the ground with respect to
                         institutional strengthening and capacity building for the integrated monitoring and participatory management of biodiversity conservation in the Gulf of Gabes area.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                          Given the proximity of the March 31, 2012 closing date (less than 18 months away) and the lengthy procurement processes, the need for a strict compliance with the updated project
                         implementation schedule, an enhanced coordination, and close monitoring and supervision has been highlighted. These points are becoming increasingly critical to ensure that the
                         project achieves its stated development objectives and expected results in a satisfactory manner before its closing date.
