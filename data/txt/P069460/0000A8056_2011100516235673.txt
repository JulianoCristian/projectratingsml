                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. This updated ISR was prepared based on the results of the June 13-17, 2011 supervision mission. The project has entered its seventh year of implementation. Key progress and
                         results already achieved on the ground include: (a) establishment of a functioning institutional foundation for the integrated and participatory management of biodiversity in the Gulf of

                         Gabes (with 4 national institutions collaborating closely and 5 local development committees established and operational in the project area), (b) improvement of the scientific
                         knowledge about the various component of the terrestrial, marine and coastal biodiversity of the area through the many studies already completed or underway, (c) promotion of
                         awareness, capacity building and training of key stakeholders involved at all levels (national, regional and local), and (d) 4 management plans prepared already for 4 pilot sites with

                         2. In terms of promotion and outreach to ensure the sustainability of project results already achieved, undertaken initiatives include: (a) application process underway for the
                         inscription of the Gabes Oasis on the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites (on the indicative list since 2008 as a result of the project); (b) designation of the project pilot site northeast
                         of the Kerkennah Islands as marine protected area in line with the implementation of the 2009 law on marine and coastal protected areas; (c) agreement signed between Tunisia and
                         Italy for the environmental protection and support to national policies on climate change, with a component specific to marine protection (3.5 million euro budget out of a total 9.5
                         million euro grant), including the establishment of a management unit for the marine protected area northeast of the Kerkennah Islands and the implementation of certain activities in
                         the Kerkennah management plan (0.9 million euro); and (d) interest from the AfD to possibly finance the implementation of priority actions in the Kerkennah and Kneiss management
                         plans.

                         3. However there was only modest implementation progress since the last supervision mission of December 2010, with the accumulations of additional delays relative to the project
                         implementation schedule, agreed upon at the extension of the project closing date approved in early 2010. These additional delays are due mainly to the socio-political events and
                         the ensuing political transition that started in early 2011 in Tunisia, and to the lengthy national procurement processes resulting disbursement levels that remains relatively low (54%).
                         These progresses include the completion of a number of ongoing studies and associated contracts, the advancement of procurement processes for certain activities to be initiated, as
                         well as promotion and outreach initiatives to ensure the sustainability of project achievements.

                         4. Key activities that are still pending and experiencing additional delays include: (a) the feasibility study and initiation of works associated with the installation of artificial reefs and
                         anti-trawling blocks in an experimental site south of the Kerkennah Islands; (b) the materialization of the participatory approach; (c) the finalization of the studies on hydrodynamics
                         and water quality; and (d) the initiation of the study on the impact of fishing on biodiversity in the Gulf of Gabes.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. Keeping in the mind the approaching project closing date, the following actions were agreed upon in terms of ensuring the sustainability of project achievements: (a) preparing an
                         action plan for the implementation of main project recommendations; and (b) establishing an internal committee to ensure a proper summarization project achievements and identify a
                         communication strategy on project results, with a view to facilitating their integration within regular sector development plans.

                         2. Given the proximity of the project closing date and the lengthy procurement processes, the need for a strict compliance with the updated project implementation schedule, an
                         enhanced coordination, and close monitoring and supervision is to be highlighted. These points are becoming increasingly critical to ensure that the project achieves its stated
                         development objectives and expected results in a satisfactory manner before its closing date.
