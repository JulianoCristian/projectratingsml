B. Strategic Context
1.Sector-related Country AssistanceStrategy (CAS) goalsupported bythe project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 28791 TUN Date of latestCAS discussion: 06/03/2004
The project directly supports the Tunisia CAS, to ensurethat social andenvironmentalconcems are
properly addressed, as described inCAS Outcome 1.4, within Objective No.1. The project will contribute
to safeguarding natural resourcesincluding landandwater conservation. The project will also contribute
to increasing the benefits o f other large public sector investment programs inurbanwastewater treatment,
industrial pollution control, improvedurbanmanagement, tourism development, and fisheries.

la. Global Operational strategyh'rogram objective addressedby the project:


 The project forms part o f the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Operational Strategy for preserving
 biodiversity, specifically GEF Operational Program 2, that involves coastal, marine andfreshwater
 ecosystems and the project is also relevant to Operational Program 8.

 Operational Program2 responds to three directives from the Conference o f Parties (COP) at the
 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to the GEF. At its first meeting, COP 1set the priorities for
 the programs, which include: (i)  projects which encouragethe conservation and sustainableuse o f the



                                                      - 2 -

biological diversity o fthreatened coastal andmarineresources, and(ii) which encouragethe
                                                                                     projects
conservation o f biologicaldiversity andsustainableuse o ftheir resourcesinthe other vulnerable areas.

The COP also recommended the integrated management of marine and coastal areas, because this type
of managementprovides the most suitable~amew~rkfor tackling theproblem of the effects of human
activities on marine and coastal biological diversity and to encouragethe conservation and sustainable
use of this diversity". The Gulfo fGab& project fits directly withinthe above guidelines.

The project area i s included as a regional priority inthe Global Representative System o f MarineProtected
Areas (World Bank, 1995) becauseo f its extensive Posidonia meadows (sea grass) andassociated
biodiversity. The sea grass meadows are considered the most extensive inthe Mediterranean. The project
 is also identified inthe World Wildlife Fund(WWF) Gap Analysis (2001) as one of 13 priority areas for
biodiversity protection inthe Mediterranean.

The mainobjectives of GEF's Operational Program2 are "the conservation and sustainable use of
biological resources in coastal, marine andfreshwater ecosystems in general ". This will be
 accomplished by preserving: (a) the biological resourcesthrough conservation areas that will be set up and
 strengthenedwith focus on coastal, marine and freshwater ecosystemsintropical andtemperate zones
 which are under threat, and(b) planningfor sustainable use o fresources, with integrated objectives for
 conservation o fbiological diversity, productiveuses andsocio-economic development.

 The project is consistent with the objectives o f GEF Operational Program 2 goals andhypotheses. Also,
 Tunisia ratifiedthe maininternationalconventions andtreaties on the protection o f habitats and
 species.Theseinclude CITES (1974), UNJ3SCOWorld Heritage (1974), Ramsar Convention (1979),
 Desertification Convention (1979), Bonn Convention(1986), Convention on BiologicalDiversity (1993),
 andBemConvention (1995).

Emerging GEF priorities. The project is consistent with Pillar 1(protected areas) andPillar 2
(mainstreaming biodiversity in production). The six pilot sites willbuildcapacity andprovide valuable
lessons for managing marine protected areas. The project will also provide useful models and monitoring
tools for integratingbiodiversity issues into mainstream development, especially into decisions on coastal
zone management, urbandevelopment, tourism and fisheries.

The monitoring andevaluation o f data onkey species, including invasive alien species (note l),                  will feed
into decisions related to managingthe coastalzone. Monitoringalien specieswill provide valuable
information on pathways andpotential control mechanisms, which is important for the whole
Mediterranean basin.

Note 1: "Alien species" covers all animals and plants that do not originate inthe Gulfregion and whose introduction is due to
deliberate or unintentional actions such as natural passage through the Suez Canal (Lessepsian migration), contained and
transported by ballast water or ship hulls, or imported for fish-farmingor aquariums. These species are also defined as
"introduced," "exotic" "invasive species", and "invasive alien species".

2. Main sector issuesand Government strategy:


Several Government policies on the environment, biodiversity anddevelopment support the proposed
project. The National Strategy for the Protection o f the Environment and Sustainable Development defines
priority areas and actions to be undertaken; the National Action Planfor the Environment (NEAP) andthe
National Strategy andAction Plan for Biodiversity (1988) are the most important policy instruments



                                                               - 3 -

carried out to date. The latter, fmancially assistedby the GEF (Biodiversity EnablingActivity, through the
World Bank) involvedparticipationby universities, researchcenters, ministries, agencies andmajor
environmental NGOs.

The priorities inthe National Strategy for Biodiversity include (a) improving scientific knowledge, (b)
preventing further deterioration of genetic capital andbiodiversity, (c) improvingthe protection and
management o f crucial ecosystem, (d) integratingthe protection o fbiodiversity into sectoral strategies and
(e) strengthening institutionsandregulations. The Government is aware that to manage biodiversity inan
integrated manner, policy andsite-specific actions are required. At the policy level, the Governmentworks
onbiodiversity issuesthrough the Ministryo f Environment and SustainableDevelopment (MEDD)andthe
Ministry o f Agriculture andWater Resources(MARH). Bothministries are focusing greater institutional
attention to integrate water and natural resourcesmanagement issuesina more efficient andsustainable
manner. At the site-specific level, the Government is committed to workmg closely with communities, with
MARHhavinga decentralized administrative structure that facilitates theparticipationofbeneficiaries and
users inrural areas duringthe implementation o fprojects.

This project adopts both a participatory and an integrated sustainable management approach that
complements the ongoing Government strategy for efficient anddecentralized local investments.

3. Sector issuesto be addressedby the project and strategic choices:


The project will address the sector issues identified inthe 1988NationalBiodiversity Strategy, through a
set ofproject actions to reduce biodiversity threats andthrough ajoint program o f stakeholder and
Government staffparticipation covering the Gulfo f Gab& region. The latterproject actions will
contribute to better harmonizationo fplanningwith other investment programs andprojects, while
mitigating on-going or potential threats to biodiversity,

The project complements other projects inthe biodiversity sector, such as ProtectedArea Management,
funded by the GEF. The latter project includes three national parks, two o f which are forests andone
which includes a wetland area at Ichkeul Park, innorthem Tunisia. A close linkwill be established to
shareexperiences andalso to coordinate with other regional projects that address similar issues (see
Section D.2 for a list of projects co-fmanced with other development agencies),

The Government has adopted a national tourism strategy, which generatesmajor revenue but also
threatensbiodiversity, especially incoastal areas where hotels are concentrated. The project will contribute
to this sector strategy through several sub-components. At the sector level, a sector environmental
assessmentreportwill be prepared to evaluate the overall threats to biodiversity o f the national tourism
strategy. At the site level, a biodiversity managementplanwill be implemented for the major tourism area
inthe Jerba-Zarziszone. Inthe Kneiss Islands, the projectwill explore ways to develop sound small-scale
eco-tourism, by supporting public awarenessabout biodiversity threats, andby integrating the efforts o f
the local NGOs to improve management o ft h s pilot area.

The project will also innovate at the sector level by expanding the scope o fthe traditional land-use plans
for sensitive coastal areas implementedby the Agence de Protection et d 'Amenagement du Littoral
(APAL). The innovative approach will target both the marine and coastal resources inan integrated
manner,rather thanonly the terrestrial coastal shoreline now subject to management byMAL.

The GEFproject will also identify monitoringtechniques for replication to managethe urbanandindustrial
threats to biodiversity. For example, the complex relationship o fthe effects o fwater qualityandcurrents
will betargeted. Inthe BouGhrara lagoon, the effects o fwidening the channel under the man-made
Romancauseway will be studied through ecological andhydro-sedimentary studies. Similarly key
indicatorsfor water quality threats to the complex habitatsprovided by Posidonia (sea grass) beds will
also be identified, andmanagement measuresdesigned. Ins u m m q the project will facilitate the
integrationo f several on-going initiatives inTunisia that affect the protection o fcoastal andmarine areas.

Strategic biodiversity issues. Authorities are aware that the long-term shrinkage o fthe Posidonia
oceanica sea grassbeds is a difficult processto reverse, andwill require sustainedeffort over at least the
next 15-20years andlonger. The scientific causes o fthis long-term trend are poorly understood, bothwith
respect to ecological processes andgeographic locations. Thus, the project will upgrade baseline dataand
monitoring researchto (a) better understand the interactionbetweensea grass beds, fish reproduction,
spawning andpopulationgrowth, and(b) identify, on a pilot basis, appropriate management mechanisms to
conservethe significant areas for sea grass beds andthe associatedhighlevels o fbiodiversity.

 The project preparation studies show that the Gulfregionhasbeen degradedby (a) over-fishing and
 sea-bed trawling and(b) wastewater pollutionfrom urban (household) andindustrial (e.g.
 phospho-gypsum) sources. The urbanwastewater effluent sources are beingremediedalong the coast,
 largely through a national investment programto extend sewers andconstruct wastewater treatment plants
 (under ONAS,the agency responsible). The urbansolidwaste problem isbeingaddressedthrough an
 ambitious program to improvecollection anddisposal (through the ANPE's PRONAGDES program). The
 sources o f industrial effluent along the coast are also being remedied. One major phospo-gypsum plant has
 beenclosed inSfax. The other major productionplant inSfax already uses a dry production process, that
 avoids disposal o fliquideffluents into the Gulf. For the major phosphor-gypsum plant inthe town o f
 Gab& an on-land storage solution will be adopted to eliminate industrial effluent disposal into the Gulf.
 The technical studies are completedand the fundingis secured (with financial assistancefromthe
 European Investment Bank); the construction activities for rehabilitationo fthe plant will take place over
 the coming years.

 Since the Government is already investingheavily inbasic environmentalprotection infrastructure, and
 pollutionis only one factor inbiodiversity loss, the project will focus on a range o f issuesthat could halt
 biodiversity decline (such as coastal development, over-fishing, trawling, alien species andunprotected
 marine area).

Tunisian authorities are also aware that throughout the project area andat all levels-from     small coastal
communities to large Government institutions-strengthened management, training and awarenessactivities
are requiredto improve the conservation andsustainable use o fbiodiversity. The project will increase
collective awareness o f the need for andbenefits o fbiodiversity protection, andinstill instakeholders a
more responsible attitude--a prerequisite for managing the natural environment ina sustainable way. For
example, the project includes institutional strengthening activities: (a) training to more effectively apply
existingregulations, (b) new guidelines to improve sustainable fishingtechniques, (c) public awarenesson
over-fishmg issues, and (d) guidelines for more effective ballast water management to manage the release of
alien species.

The goal o f these broad actions is to develop better understanding andmanagement techniques that could
be applied to the entire Gulf, since an areao f this size can only be restored over many decades.

Selectionof pilot sites (see Map IBRD33784inannex). The following are the six (6) geographc pilot
sites selected for conservation of biodiversity resourcesthrough managementplans:

         (i) TheKerkennahIslands,
         (ii) KneissIslands,
         (iii)   Gab& Oasis (the westem-most coastal oasis),
         (iv)    Gulfo fBouGhrara,
         (v)     Bahiret ElBibane, and
         (vi)    A sea grass area(initial pilot site near the KerkennahIslands).

Rationale for selectionof pilot sites. The KerkennahIslands, Kneiss Islands, Gulfo f BouGhrara and
Bahiret ElBibane are well preserved interms o fmarinebiodiversity or have not yet experienced
irreversible damage. Also the KerkennahIslands are surroundedby richsea grass areas, which are
representative o f the Gulfs uniquebiodiversity.

All six sites have ahighlevelofbiodiversity ("hot spots"), withone or severalofthe following
characteristics: (a) hugebeds of Posidonia sea grass, (b) unique "banded" sea grassbeds (c) pivotal
Mediterranean ecosystems, and(d) exceptional concentrations o fbirds. By protecting these habitats,
representative examples of the Gulfs highbiodiversity value will be preserved (see Annex 11for Baseline
Biodiversity Description),

The selection o f a sea grass area is a new andunique element for biodiversity protection inTunisia, andit
will address three issues simultaneously: (a) conserving speciesandecosystemdiversity; (b) pilotinga
management concept to reach a compromise between the various stakeholders, resource uses and
biodiversity protection, and(c) monitoringecological interactions to identifybenefits from biodiversity and
 improved catches for small-scale fishing.

All six areas are vitalto biodiversity, are important for sustainable development, andare includedfor
pilotingmanagement plansthat can be replicatedelsewhere along the Tunisiancoast. Examples o f
activities for replication include eco-tourism (i.e. Bou Ghrara andthe Kneiss Islands), anda fishing
concession at Bahiret ElBibane. The management plansat the Gabbs Oasis, the Kerkennah Islands, andin
the sea grass pilot area will yieldvaluable replicationlessons onparticipatory techniques andissuesthat
needjoint actions by stakeholders and Government agencies.

Since the project is constrained by relatively short time fiasne for implementation (five years), the activities
for the pilot areas will be carried out intwo phases: (a) preparationand implementation o fbiodiversity
managementplans for the three priority sites o fthe Gulf o f Bou Ghrara, Kneiss Islands, andthe sea grass
area, and(b)preparationo fmanagement plans for Kerkennah Islands, Gabbs Oasis and Bahirat ElBibane.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:


Tunisia has a strong institutional framework for environmental protection andan extensive civil service,
that addresses all issuesrelated to planning, administrationand support for coastal andmarine issues.
Accordingly, no major institutional or policy reforms are considerednecessary. However, the institutional
diagnosis shows that considerable strengthening is necessaryto facilitate inter-agency andinter-governorate
coordinationfor accomodating the project objectives.

To be consistent with the national effort, the project will coordinate with the two protected areaprojects
already supported by the GEF @e. Protected Areas Project and MEDWETProject). Also, the project will
buildcapacity inGovernment staff who enforce regulations that protect marine andcoastalbiodiversity,
such as staff working inthe coast guardandfisheries department (MAN), as well as mainstream
biodiversity issuesinto fisheries practices through the preparationand dissemination o f a guide for
sustainablefishingtechniques. This will help the country meet its commitments to regonal and
international conventions more effectively.

At the regional level, the project will strengthen localparticipatory techniques for implementing innovative
approachesto managing biodiversity so that this can be replicatedelsewhere inthe country. Staff capacity
andinstitutional tools will also be improved throughtraining programs for various levels o f stakeholders
and decision-makers.




                                                      - 8 -

The project will be the country's first attempt to introduce procedures to protect andmanage marine and
coastal biodiversity at the regional level (across several govemorates and combined with marine areas)
basedon local participationanddevelopment planning(interms o f tourism andfisheries sectors). The
project will cover six sites inthree govemorates, andseek to coordinate the buildingo f awareness for
biodiversity values andeconomic planning on common objectives. The inter-agency andinter-govemorate
coordination activities are key institutional strengthening objectives supported by the project.

3. Benefitsand target population:
Biodiversitybenefits. The project will increasethe coastal andmarine areas already protected, further
safeguarding the species o f global or regionalvalue andreducing damage to unique ecosystems. Most
important, it will develop participatory managementplans, update information on the Gulfs biodiversity,
andcreate a databankthat will improve overallknowledge o fbiodiversity inthe WestemMediterranean
basin, particularly on alien species.
Some project sites have global importance interms o f birdlife andplant species. For example, the Bou
Ghara has significant waterfowl populations that can be protected with support from eco-tourism due to the
highconcentration ofnear-by hotelandtourist facilities. Althoughthe KneissIslandsarealready protected
as a reserve andclassified as a Specially ProtectedArea o fMediterraneanInterest (ASPIM), they do not
benefit from an active managementprogram. The project will add a fullpublic awarenessprogram and
develop additional mitigation measuresto protect the waterfowl nesting andstopping-over habitat onthe
islands. The Gabbs Oasis will have a managementplanto conserve what is the only example o f a coastal
oasis, by reducing the threats to its uniqueplant andwildlife species now pressuredby urbanization,
industrial pollution, andinappropriate cropping practices. ElBibaneand the KerkennahIslands have
exceptional marine benthic formations, unique inthe Mediterraneanandthe world. Situated inareas
already or soon to be developed, they will be preserved withthe active stakeholder participation from local
fisherman who eam their livelihood from these marine areas.

Ingeneral, largeareaso fPosidoniasea gas-the           Gulfs outstanding feature-have   shrunk severely over
the past decades due to destructive fishingpractices, andpossibly also due to urbanandindustrial
pollution. Those large expanseso fPosidonia that remain will be identified, delineated on maps andtheir
productive ecosystems will be monitored, so that the threats to biodiversity can be managed andtheir
benefits to fisheries be better identified. One Posidoniasite will be subject to a managementplanthat will
include a perimeter o f anti-trawling structures combined with artificialreefs. This will protect the marine
life withinthe management area, encourageincreasedproductivityof adjacent marine areas andeventually
improve revenues from small-scale fishing.


National, local benefits and target population. Protectingrare or native species will help maintain
Tunisia's richbiodiversity. Training for NGOsand institutions, strengthening enforcement capacity for
protection o fbiodiversity laws and regulations, andimproving regional institutional arrangements will
expand the country's capacity to preserve andmanage its natural resources. These institutional
strengthening benefits will facilitate the replication of the management plans at other sites inTunisia, thus
reducing implementationcosts andthe risks o f future failure.

At the locallevel, the project will introduce andtest mechanisms to help communities, authorities and
NGOsmanagenaturalresourcesmore efficiently. The target populations for participation inbiodiversity
management include (a) communities that exploit coastal marineresources at the various pilot
sites-mainly   small-scale fishermen, (b) f m e r s inthe Gab& oasis, (c) localNGOs active indevelopment
andenvironmental protection, (d) localprofessional organizations andauthorities, and(e) the tourism

sector (particularly inJerba-Zarzis). The mainparticipatory approach is to form a local development
committee for each o fthe six pilot sites. This will be particularly beneficial for encouraging sustainable
fisheries practices near the pilot areas o fthe Gulfo f BouGhrara andthe sea grass areanear the Kerkennah
Islands. The anticipated benefits o f carellly implemented biodiversity management are increased fish
stocks, due to the cumulative effects o freducingover-fishing, decreasingdestruction o f habitats, and
increasing the productivity o f the ecosystems (e.g. spawning o ffish). Also, the benefits associatedwith the
pilot areas are to further develop tourism -by generation o fjobs andalleviation o fpersistent poverty
levels inthe rural south.

4. Institutionaland implementation arrangements:
The agency selectedto implement the project is the Direction GLnLrale de 1'Environnement et la Qualitd
de Vie (DGEQV), part o f MEDD. DGEQV's Director General reports to the Minister ofEnvironment and
Sustainable Development. This choice was basedonthe leadership that DGEQV provides for biodiversity
policy issues, andon their coordinationexperience gained while leadingthe project preparation. Three o
ther institutions will implement other components o fthe project. They are (a) CentreInternational des
Technologies de I'Environnement (CITET), which will supervise Component 2 o fthe project involving
activities for training andcapacity building, (b) Institut Nationale des Sciences et Technologies de la Mer
(INSTM), wluch will supervise Component 3, involvingbaseline marine inventories andapplied monitoring
studies, and(c) MAL,which will supervise Component 4 involvingpreparation andimplementation o fthe
participatory management plans (See Section E.4 for a summary description o f the institutional andproject
management arrangements, anda detailed analysis inAnnex 12).

D. ProjectRationale
1. Project alternatives consideredand reasonsfor rejection:


 Duringproject design, various institutional, geographical andtechcal alternatives were considered to
 determine which would be easiest to implement andmost likely to succeed. The criteria were: (a) regional
 goals for the Gabbs regon and the financial resourcesavailable, (b) the Country Assistance Strategy
 (CAS) between Tunisia andthe World Bank, and (c) GEF fhding eligibility criteria.

 Selection of strategic focus for the project. The problemo f urbanandheavy industrial
 pollution-mainly     from large urbanareas andthe phospho-gypsum processing sector -was an important
 factor indesigningthe strategic focus for the project. Duringpreparation, these threats to biodiversity were
 considered. To reduce urbanpollution, the Government has made considerable investments inwastewater
 facilities. Currently, collectionandtreatment o fwastewater is muchhigher thaninmany neighboring
 countries. Inparticular, the Government has already heavily invested ineliminating direct industrial liquid
 effluent disposal into the Gulfof Gab&, particularly inthe town o f Sfax, by dismantlinga large
 phospho-gypsum processingplant. Itis also committed to a similar large industrialpollution control
 investment for the phospho-gypsum plant inthe town o f Gab&. The new investment will elimnate liquid
 effluents by installing a new productiontechnology that produces a dry waste by-product that can be
 stored on land. Similarly major investment efforts for solid wastes are underway by the Govemment under
 its PRONAGDESprogram that will construct new sanitary landfills inthe major urbancenters. All these
 investments for control o f urbanandindustrial pollution sources are continuing under Tunisia's Tenth
 Economic Development Plan (2002-2006).

It was therefore decided to focus the strategic actions o fthe project on indirect biodiversity threats, rather
thanondirect sourcesof pollutionthreats or onpollutioncontrol. The first strategic action o fthis GEF


                                                     -  10-

project is to focus on specific geographic areas that already have highlevels o fbiodiversity that need to be
maintained. The project will not try to adopt site-specific protectionmeasuresfor the entire Gulf, since to
rehabilitate large areas of Posidonia oceanica (sea grass) beds would take generations. Instead, this GEF
project aims to complement the considerable investments inenvironmental protection infrastructure already
constructed and on-going by the Government. Thus this first strategic focus will target site-specific direct
andindirectbiodiversity threats, whichcouldaccelerateat any time.

The second strategic focus is to addressesbroad-basedbiodiversity threats for the entire project region
through knowledge andcapacity building. The project will support information gathering on: (a) baseline
data, (b) biodiversity monitoring -so public sector managersandall stakeholders understandthe
interactions withinthe marine andcoastal ecosystems, (c) capacity building, to enforce laws and
regulations, and(d) public awarenessandparticipation about general andsite-specific issues.

Selection of pilot sites. The project preparation analysis, which covered the entire Gulfo fGab&, found
that while large areas have limitedbiodiversity uniqueness, several sites offer richbiodiversity relatively
unaffected by economic development andother threatening activities. Thus, it was decided to protect the
most exceptional sites from existing andpotentialthreats as soon as possible. The option o f rehabilitating
already degraded sites-where      major areas o fPosidonia sea grass beds have declined over decades-was
rejected, since it would take decades to regenerateandexpand them. The chosen approach is to prepare
management plans for pilot sites, which will eventually be replicated andexpanded to other sites inthe Gulf
with important global or regionalmarine andcoastalbiodiversity.

 Alternative institutional arrangements considered. The first alternative considered was creation o f a
 new institutional entity. l h s institutional arrangement was rejected because (a) the Government already
 has manyagencies with overlappingresponsibilities for marine andcoastal resources, and(b) on project
 completion, a new entity might not have enough resourcesto maintain sustainability or undertake
 replication of management plans, given the continualbudget pressures onthe Tunisianpublic service.

 The second altemative considered was to use an existing institutional entity. A total o f four existing
 agencies were evaluated: (i)  DGEQV, (ii) Directoratefor the SouthemCoastal Region(DES),
                                              Regional
 (iii) and(iv)ANPE(seeSectionE.4). Theproject'sPMUwillbeinanexistingentity(Le.
      MAL
 DGEQV)withinan existingministry(i.e. MBDD), since this offers the best optionfor sustainability. As
 noted above, the DGEQV,was chosen since it already has leadership responsibilities for biodiversity
 issues andit could buildonthe experience gained duringproject preparation. Furthermore, its mandate is
 to coordinate overall environmental strategy andpolicies, so that this alternative gives the best chance to
 replicate the project's models.

 The thirdinstitutional arrangement considered was to use contractual stafffunded by the project for the
 P M UandPOU, rather than Government funded civil service staff. This altemative was rejected becauseit
 would not be sustainable.

 The project will complement various regional programs. For example:

1.        The recently launchedREMPEC project, focused on waste andballast water from ships, will
benefit from the strategy study onmanagement o f alien species andballast water and the capacity building
to improve enforcement o fregulations to protect the marineenvironment.

2.        The MediterraneanAction Planfor the (MAP)-PAPIRAC, a coastal development program that has
already planned an important rehabilitationscheme (the Taparura project inSfax), will benefit since this
project will hrtherprotect biodiversity inthe Kneiss Islands andintroduce a management planinthe
Kerkennah Islands.

3.        The RACISPAprogram, on managingthe ASPIM andbiodiversity, will benefit fi-om the project
activities for the Kneiss Islands, which hasrecentlybeenclassified for protectionby ASPIM.

4.        The regional program Mediterranean Environment Technical Assistance Program(METAP)
initially contributedconsiderably to the creation o fMAL,.The project includes APAL as a special partner
agency, andits stafftechnical andadministrative skills will be enhanced.

5.        The Marine Protected Areas project continues to be preparedby the Governmentwith assistanceo f
UNDP as the implementing agency for GEF. The DGEQV andAPAL,are involvedinthis preparation
work, andcoordinationmeetings are regularly heldinTunisia with the two GEFimplementing agencies
(UNDP andWorld Bank), to ensurethat there will be no duplication o f activities or geographic areas.

3. Lessonslearned and reflected in the project design:


 There two on-going GEF finaflcedprojects inTunisia to protect biodiversity: (i)   WBIGEF P04831S:
 Protected Areas Management Project (GEF implementing agency: World Bank), and(ii)        Regional
 MEDWETproject :Conservation o f Wetlands andCoastal Ecosystems inthe MediterraneanRegion (GEF
 implementing agency: UNDP). Bothprojects are being carried out through the same agencies (DGEQV
 andAPAL),andbothoffer important lessonsoncoordinatingthe efforts ofthe agenciesinvolved.
 Feedback fi-om early implementationo fthese projects hasbeen built into project design, as are lessons
 from Bank efforts inmarine andcoastal biodiversity (see Assessment o f IntegratedCoastal Area
 Management Initiatives inthe Mediterranean-1988 to 1996: publishedby METAP). Once this new project
 i s effective, feedback will be sharedwith the other two projects on common issues such as indicators,
 community participation, scientific monitoringresults, andplanningfor sustainability.

Duringthe designphase, the project consideredthe GEF's post-evaluations onbiodiversity projects in
Africa along with Bank-wide evaluations on biodiversity, conservation andeco-tourism. The various
lessonsonproject design have beenincorporated: the importance o f stakeholder participation, ensuing
clarity o f objectives and components, incorporatingpast experience, identification andmanagement o f
risks, effective monitoring andevaluation. Specifically a new technique to monitor implementationprogress
is being adopted, as basedon internationalexperience. For all the six pilot areas the methodology to be
used i s basedon "Reporting Progress at Protected Area Sites -A Site Level Management Effectiveness
Tracking Tool prepared for the World BanldWorld Wildlife Alliance for Forest Conservation and
                  "
Sustainable Use, May 2003, and"Score Card to Assess ProgressinAchieving Management Effectiveness
for MarineProtectedAreas", publishedby World Bank, Revised Version-July 2004. This methodology
has beenspecifically developed as a practical tool to measure implementationprogress for this type o f

project, andis being adopted for most GEFbiodiversity projects internationally.

4. Indications of borrower and recipient commitmentand ownership:


Inrecent years, the Government defmedaikmeworktoprotect andmanagethe country's biodiversity. Its
NationalAction Planfor the Environment (1997), National Strategy and Action Plan for Biodiversity
(1998), andratification o f international andregional agreements, indicate its profound commitment. The
Government sought Bank assistanceto prepare the Gab& project in 1999 with a grant awarded from the
GEFProjectDevelopmentFund. An inter-ministerial SteeringCommitteewhichincludedstaff from
various ministries andagencies, were created at project preparation to coordinate on policy issues. The
DGEQV,with close attention from senior managementat MEDDpreparedthe project. Numerous
meetings andconstant attention (by many stakeholders) indicate Tunisia's commitment to the project.

5. Value added of Bankand Globalsupport in this project:
The Bank andGEF add value from their experience inproject design andimplementation. Further, funding
principles o f GEF allow the Govemment to rapidlylaunchactivities to protect biodiversity that mightnot
otherwise be funded as a short-term budget priority. This early funding adds support to the decentralized
participatory management plans to protect biodiversity o f global value that otherwise would not be part o f
Government priority activities. At the regional level, value will be added due to GEF fundingfor sharing o f
scientific knowledge andpromoting exchange with institutions inother countries involved insimilar
projects with global objectives.

E. Summary ProjectAnalysis (Detailed assessmentsare inthe project file, seeAnnex 8)
1. Economic(see Annex 4):
0 Costbenefit          NPV=US$ million; ERR= % (see Annex 4)
0 Costeffectiveness
   IncrementalCost
0Other(specify)
For GEFprojects an incremental cost analysis is the methodology for economic analysis (see Annex 4).

The baseline scenario for the incrementalcost analysis shows the enormous financial efforts by the
Govemment to reduce urbanand industrial sources o fpollution, andto improve conditions for the local
populationinthe govemorates inthe project area. Approximately 80% o f the population inthe three major
govemorates o f the project area live along the coastal areas. Inaddition the Government is supporting
numerous biodiversity activities within the baseline scenario, which is calculated at US$278.88 million.
The GEF scenario reflects the added cost o fthe project (US$9.81 million). The Government will co-finance
part o f the project cost (US$3.50 million), andis thus requesting a GEF grant o fUS$6.3 lmillion.

3. Technical:
The technical description o f the biodiversity resources for the project areai s fully described inAnnex 11,
as are the threats to the richbiologcalresourcesinthe Gulfo f Gab& The technical biologicaldescriptions
o fthe biodiversity resourcesat each o f the six pilot sites are also fully described.

 The Posidonia beds inthe Gulfo f Gab& are considered the most extensive inTunisia andthe
 Mediterranean, andare critical to maintainwater quality andhabitats for almost all commercial fish and
 crustacean species, as well as special marine indicator species such as turtles. There is a direct link
betweenthe presence of these beds and sustainable fish production.

 Giventhe tidal range inthe Gulf, which is almost unique inthe Mediterranean (with the exception o fthe
northern Adriatic Sea, betweenVenice andTrieste), the vertical amplitude o f the medio-littoral zone is
 exceptional, withparticular biological characteristics andhighlydiverse fauna. Around the Kerkennah
 Islands Posidonia oceanica has anunusual and extremely original appearance: strips several tens o f
 meters longby one-two meterswide weave through beds o f Cymodocea nodosa andCaulerpaprolgera,
 between0.5m- 3mdeep. Along with coral-producing areas, this is the mainbiodiversity reservoir, with
 nearly 20% o f all speciesinthe Mediterranean, i.e. a total o f several thousand, havebeen spotted near the
 KerkennahIslands.

Due to h s exceptional sea grass habitat near Kerkennah Islands, a pilot site with a surface area o f several
square kmand depthso f 5-35 meters was selected. This willbe the fmt management planimplemented
anditwill test appropriate designs, transport methods, andinstallationtechniques for 100-200
anti-trawling andartificial reef structures. These structures will form a surrounding perimeter to protect
against unsustainable fishingpractices. Inaddition, participationtechniques for local stakeholders willbe
launched early inthe project. These experiencesand lessonslearnedwill be used inthe other five pilot
sites.

4. Institutional:
The Government has severalministries andagencies involvedinthe protection o fbiodiversity and
economic development inthe coastal andmarine areas o f the Gulfo f Gab& The backgroundo f the
institutional structure is described inAnnex 12, and the sections below summarize the analysis o fthe
institutional arrangementsfor implementation.


4.1 Executing agencies:
  Four entities were evaluatedto be the executing agency as summarized below, while two others agencies:
  (i)Directorate General o f Fishing andAquaculture (DGPA) within MAW, and(ii)            Southern
  Development Office (ODS) were considered. The analysis o f these latter two agencies was not continued
  indepth, sincetheir administrative responsibilities andhumanresource capacitieswere not consistent with
  proposedproject activities.

         DGEOV (at the national level within MEDD). As this project is considered a national priority, the
         DGEQV was chosen as the leading implementing agency as the precedents it createswill be
         replicated best by a national-level entity. The DGEQV is also the focal point for GEF. The
         DGEQV has the experience andmandate to coordinate the activities o f other agencies, as well as
         interact with all stakeholders




                                                      - 15-

        DRLS (at the regional level withinMEDD). Although the DRLScoordinates activities by
         stakeholders and agencies at the regional level, it has only limited financial andprocurement
         capacity to implement the project,
        APAL (at national and rem'onallevels within MEDD). The national strategy andpolicy for the
         protection o fcoastal areas is under the leadership o fMEDDwho is also responsible for all policy
         decisions. MEDDcoordinates all the actions o f the various institutionswithin MEDDincluding
         MAL. Accordingly APALisresponsiblefor:
             management o f the coastal fringe (espacelittoral> throughstudies andthe regulations o f
             physical structures;

        0    management o fthe public marine land(DomainePublic Maritime - DPM);
        e    undertakingo f studies to protect anddevelop the potential o fnaturalzones;

        0    data collection andmonitoringo fthe status o fcoastal ecosystems.
        ANPE (at national level within MEDD). The mainrole o fthis environmental protection agency is
         to enforce all regulations against various forms o f environmental degradation, includingpollution
         control andapproving environmentalimpact assessments. ANPE does not have a specific
         institutional mandate for coastal andmarine areas, its ability to replicate the pilot areas and
         provide leadership insustainability i s limited.

The above analysis shows that bothANPE andAPAL, with their regional offices andnational mandates
have the capacity to implement the project at the regional andlocal level, andbothhave efficient project
management structures. However, only DGEQVwithin MEDDhas the clear national role to mainstream
environmental issues andcoordinate strategiesamong national agencies.
Thus, DGEQV was selectedas the implementingagencyresponsible for overall leadership, project
management andcoordination. Several partner agencies will still participateinthe project to deliver
technical andspecialized capacity, as described below.


4.2 Project management:


1.National level Project Management Unit (PMU) (located in Tunis). The central PMUwithin DGEQV,
will oversee project implementationandcoordination(for all technical, scientific andfinancial tasks). The
National Director (part-time position) andNational Coordinator (hll-time position) are staffmembers from
DGEQV andwill report to the DGEQV Director General. Also, a financial management specialist and
assistant, as well as a procurement specialist will report to the National Director. The PMUwill
coordinate all aspectso fprocurement for contracts andfinancial management with staff from MEDD
basedinTunis (see organization chart inAnnex 12). The PMUwill prepare regular progress reports (twice
a year), that will describe the project's key performance indicators andcorrective measuresneeded inthe
event o f lack o fprogresstowards the development objectives or other delays inproject components, The
technical supervision o f field investigations andanalysis o f results duringcontract implementation willbe
carriedout by specialists inthe POUas described below.

2. Regional level Project Operations Unit (POU) (located in town of Gab&). A POUinthe town of
Gabbs, will provide the technical capacity to supervise implementation o f all project activities. Itwill also
ensureparticipationof local stakeholders inpreparingmanagement plans for the six pilot sites. The POU
will be coordinated by a POUDirector (a full-timeposition), withpart-time support of a regional advisor,
Other full-time staff will be responsible for various tasks, such as the informationexchange center and


                                                      -16-

studies (Component 1), capacity buildinglpublic awareness(Component 2), marinelcoastal biodiversity
(Component 3), andbiodiversity management (Component 4). Staff will also include a GIS specialist,
financial assistant andsupport staff (see organization chart inAnnex 12).

Supervision o fproject implementationis divided into four components (as described above), witha
separateagency responsible for each: Component 1, DGEQV; Component 2, CITET; Component 3,
M S T M (Institut National des Sciences et Technologiesde la Mer) and Component 4, MAL.

3. Localparticipation. At minimum, six local development committees (local DCs) will be createdat each
pilot site. They will regularly contact local communities, groups andindividuals, andhelp develop the
integrated management plans for eachpilot area. There are also existing Goveronate levelDCs that are
regularly consulted on regional issues, andadditionalparticipatorymechanisms and techniques will be
developed to addressproject issuesas requiredduringproject implementation.


4.3 Procurement issues:
A fulldescriptionofthe procurement issuesis set out inAnnex 6, andsummarized below.

The procurement procedures described inthe operations manualandthe procurement plansubmittedto the
Bankwere reviewedandfound satisfactory. The methods ofprocurement, the timetable andthe
procurement responsibilities for eachpartner agency are clearly set out, as is coordinationbetweenthe
agencies for procurement.

Still the assessment o fthe overall procurement capacity for the project i s determined as high,due to the
highproportion ofconsultant servicescontracts to beprocured(more than60% oftotalprojectcosts), the
limitedexposure o fthe partner agencies to the Bank's consultant guidelines, andthe limitedavailability o f
procurement dedicated staff. To mitigate this hghprocurement risk, the project design includes a full time
procurement specialist at the P M U for the first two years o f the project. A detailedjob description
developed specifically for this procurement specialist at the PMUis set out inthe procedures manual. In
addition, TA support by an internationally experienced procurement specialist is plannedfor several
months at the beginning o f the project implementation.


4.4 Financial management issues:
A full description ofthe financial managementissuesis set out inAnnex 6, andsummarizedbelow.

The assessment for financial management issues, including the required support by a financial management
for the P M Uduringthe 5 years implementationperiod hasbeenreviewedby the Bank, andfound
satisfactory. A detailedjob description developed specifically for the financial management specialist at
the PMU is set out inthe procedures manual. The assessment o f the overall financial management risk for
the project is determined as low.

The assessment reviewedthe systems for accounting, intemal controls, informationand reporting, as well
as financial management organization structures andaudit arrangements at DGEQV, APAL, CITET and
INSTM. The financial management capacity at these key implementing partners are assessedas
satisfactory andpose no major risks to Bank funds. The reporting on the use o f Bank funds will be
coordinated through the PMU, andthe procedures set out basic reporting data from each agency to assure
smooth implementation. A Country Financial Accountability report has beenproduced, and the
Government systemhas been assessedinvarious Bank fmanced projects andis considered satisfactory.


                                                     -17-

Eachpartner institution has anestablished tradition o f financial managementincluding qualified staff,
accountingandreporting systems, internal controls, and annual extemal audit arrangements; also, each
implementing agency has anadequatesystem. The operations manualoutlines the working relationships
andprocedures for the institutions, including advancesfromthe special account, anddefmitions for
operating expenses and other disbursement categories. The manual also contains a formal inter-agency
Project Agreement ~'Conven~ion'~     between the four partner agenciesthat clarifies the internal Govemment
procedures for budget requests, flow o fallocated fimds andrecruitment o f staff.


5. Environmental:                            EnvironmentalCategory: B (Partial Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessmentand EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) andthe significant issuesand their treatment emerging from this analysis.
The project consists mainly o fTA activities with only a few smallstructures to be built at the three priority
sites: (i)
         a visitor reception center inthe Gulfo fBou Ghrara area, (ii)    strengthening andrehabilitationo f
small infrastructure for the Kneiss Islands, and (iii)   anti-trawling and artificial reef structures at the sea
grass area near the Kerkennab Islands. The locations anddesigns for these small structures will be
determined as part o f the preparation o fthe final biodiversity managementplans for each pilot site, andthis
will ensurethat environmental impacts are avoided.
5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?
The EnvironmentalManagement Plan(EMP) is fully presentedinAnnex 13, andthe EMP describes three
major mitigationmeasures(i)    mitigation through managementplans to avoid environmental impacts, (ii)
mitigationthroughparticipation o f stakeholders to incorporate their knowledge about local threats to
biodiversity, and (iii)
                      mitigation through environmentalmonitoring o f key indicators o f fish species, habitat,
water quality andsignificant areas o f Posidonia oceanica sea grassbeds.
5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:
                     Date o f receipt o f final draft: June 30,2004

5.4 How have stakeholdersbeenconsulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment managementplan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were usedandwhich groups were consulted?
Duringproject preparation, severalworkshops were heldwithlocalstakeholders.Biodiversitythreats and
impacts, as well as the proposedmitigationandmonitoring measureswere discussedwith the stakeholders,
andsubsequently incorporated intothe project design. Duringproject implementationextensive capacity
buildingactivities for stakeholdersare plannedunder Component 2: (a) raisingpublic awareness (b)
forming localdevelopment committees at each pilot site to participate inpreparingmanagement plans, (c)
consultingwith NGOs, (d) training project staff, (e) strengthening enforcement regulations; and(0holding
workshops to share data with stakeholders and scientists. The goal is to strengthen the participatory
approach, knowledgebase andhumanresourcesthat will sustain biodiversity inthe long-term.
5.5 What mechanismshave been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project onthe
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
The EMP for eachpilot site will be reviewed by the project staff andBank supervision missions. The key
performance indicators described inSection A2 will also be continuously monitored, as they incorporate the
environmental protectionobjectives ofthe EMP.

6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issuesrelevant to the project objectives, andspecify the project's social
development outcomes.
A key social issue is the dependenceo fthe coastalpopulationonthe resourcesthe project intends to
protect, which include fishing(small-scale artisanal andlarge-scale commercial) andtourism. Instances
may arise where local economic interests may be at odds to proposedproject activities. Another issue i s
that the population inthe southernmost part o fthe Gulfis poor, andmany depend onthe tourism industry
for their livelihoods. This may insome instancesbe problematic since the project may attempt to control
tourism to protect fragile biodiversity.

The expected social development outcome is to contribute to long-term sustainability through community
participation and through identification o finstitutional andtechnical resources neededto reverse the
biodiversity degradation. This will be done through the development o f trainingfor the beneficiaries and
through their participation inthe planninganddevelopment ofmanagement plans.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating inthe project?
Stakeholder participation(described earlier) i s vitalto ensurethat their interests are balanced with those o f
conservation and that degraded biodiversity resourcesare protected against further decline. A strategy to
promote this participationis based on two concepts: (a) stakeholdersneedto understand project objectives
andsocial development outcomes, inorder to take anactive role indecision-making, and(b) their ideasand
proposed solutions will be incorporatedinto project activities -particularly with respect to management
plans.

While the project has proposed institutional andtechnical measures, these will be tested andtailored to
local conditions at eachpilot site, with the stakeholders' input. Usingthis approach, all management plans
will be prepared withstakeholder participation. Also, stakeholders will (a) provide up-to-date information
on local conditions (e,g. fishing, production, etc.) andwill, inturn, become more aware about threats to
biodiversity; (b) enlighten those proposingmanagementmeasuresabout the measuresthe population is
willing to adopt to sustainbiodiversity resources; (c) jointly formulate the final agreeduponmanagement
mechanisms-which      may involvetemporary restrictions withrespect to the use o f resourcesao they can
secure sustainable hture benefits.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaborationwith NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
The project is basedon a participatory approach that establishescooperative relationsbetweenthe national
level PMU, regional level POU, the partner institutions (i.e. DGEQV,CITET, MAL,INSTM) andthe
beneficiaries, which include key stakeholders includingNGOs that are active incoastal andislandareas
(such as Djerba andthe Kerkennaislands). The project hastaken into account current Government
programs that deal with local development efforts (e.g. Agenda 21 inDjerba andKerkennas), social
protectionand employment programs (e.g. the 26-26 program) andother relevant donor-assisted
environmental protectionprojects that involve civil society. The goal is to define, with the stakeholders, the
best methods with which to improve management o fbiodiversity resources, to meet the project's
development objectives. The NGOsandother institutions that will be involvedwere identified and
consulted duringpreparation, and during pre-appraisal and the pre-launch stage, to create Component 2 for
trainingand capacity building.
6.4 What institutional arrangementshave been providedto ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
The participatoryapproach is critical to project success. Firstly, the PMU and POU will discuss with the


                                                      -19-

population andother stakeholders the project's goals, plans andbenefits, particularly any potential
restrictions to marineresourceson which many inthe population depend. The goal is to strengthen
communication andtrust. Secondly, local development committees will be formed for eacho f the six pilot
sites, with members selectedfrom local stakeholders, with trainingandresourcesto make them hlly
functional. Thirdly, on the groundimplementationwill involve regular visits to pilot sites tojointly identify
withthe localdevelopment committees, the managementactions neededandtheir phasing, The site visits
will also involve specific assessmento flearningneeds.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance interms o f social development outcomes?
 The key performance indicators described inSection A2 will also be continuously monitored, as they
 incorporate the participation andsocial development outcomes. The fmt key indicators are the formation,
 andsubsequenttraining for the six localdevelopment committees. Thenthe effectiveness oflocal
 participationwill be measured as part o f the overall scores for each pilot site under the "Management
 Effectiveness Tracking Tool".

7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguard policies.

 OP4.01 (see Annex 13):       The Government hasprepared an EnvironmentalManagement Plan (EMP),
 which has been disclosed to the public inTunisia and at the Bank InfoShop inWashington D.C.

 OP4.12 (see Annex 14): The Government hasprepareda ProcessFramework, whichhasbeen
 disclosed to the public inTunisia and at the Bank InfoShop inWashgton D.C. The Process Framework
 addresses the potentialrestriction o f access to resources, although the potential affect on livelihoods has
 not been determined, andwill not be ascertainedonce the management plans are prepared during
 implementation.

 OPN 11.03: At present, no issueshave beenidentified. Duringimplementation, "chance find"
 procedures will be carried out, andproject staff as well as Bank supervision missions will ensure that
 there is compliance with this policy duringpreparation o f the biodiversity managementplans.

F. Sustainabilityand Risks
1. Sustainability:


 The designo fthe project that emphasizes community participation is to ensurethat activities are sustained
 inawaythatrelatestothecommunities' concerns,andimplementedwiththeirassistance. Forexample,
the BouGhrara site is near a heavily visited tourist zone that is well knownnationally andinternationally.
 Here, the project will work withthe private sector, NGOs andGovernment agenciesto identifyhow the
 threat o f tourism can be transformed into an opportunity for developing and financially supporting
 sustainable biodiversity management.

The capacity-building activities are aimed at various levels o f staff, from "on-the-ground" field staffto
higher leveldecision-makers responsible for managing andenforcingregulations for the use o f and
protection ofbiodiversity resources. This approach, often referredto as "mainstreaming", will help
 individuals become more aware o f issuesandbecome more responsible for conserving biodiversity over the
 long-term.

 The scientific monitoring studies for biodiversity indicators are designed to develop adequatebaseline data
 to ensurelong-term use for applicationof results. For example, all monitoring data collected will be stored
 at the information exchangecenter inthe town o f Gab& The center will offer easy access to the most
 recent data and will have it available for future use. The goal is to transform the center into a permanent
 regional data center (obsewatoire) for the Gulf. Other examples o f activities designed for sustainability
 are (i) preparation o f a technical guidebook on sustainable fishingpractices, and(ii)strategy to prevent
                                                                                        a
biodiversity degradation fiom invasion o f alien species from ship ballast water,

Finally a long-term strategy for biodiversity sustainability will be preparedfor the Gulfde Gab& region
beforeproject closure. The strategy will planfor the longer termhorizono f 10-15 years, andidentify the
institutional mandates, along with the resourcesrequiredto reach a sustainable levelo feffort to protect
biodiversity resources. The strategy will consider the technical, scientific, humanand financial resources
required, andidentify the most relevant environmental and social issues. Tlus strategy will include a plan
for the next 5 year implementationperiod for the 3 pilot sites for which only management plans were
prepared (Kerkennah Islands, lagoon ElBibane and Gab& Oasis), andalso include a planfor replication of
the managementplans at other 3 pilot sites.

la. Replicability:
As described in sustainability section, the key project activities are designed to continue after project
completion. Replication can occur in the Gulf region, in Tunisia and Mediterranean region or at the
international scale.
Replicationwould involve several activities: (a) implementing management plans at the next three pilot
sites (Kerkennah Islands, Gabbs Oasis and ElBibane lagoon) for whch the Government is already
planningresources; (b) identifyingother sea grass areas inthe Gulfto be managedwiththe biodiversity
principles andmonitoring techniques pilotedduringthe project; and (c) repeating applications for the
participationmethods, scientific monitoring techniques, andproject key performance indicators.
These goals are realistic, and are inherent inthe project design that relies heavily on existing Tunisian
capacity and structures. Futurereplicationwill be done mainly by national experts and institutions that
will gain experience withproject activities during implementation. The enhancedbaseline andmonitoring
data, as well as experience gained from pilotingthe methods for participatory management, scientific data

collection andimplementation of managementplans will help Tunisian professionals replicate the activities
at lower cost thaninthe pilots. Further, the project's successes will provide incentives for other regions in
Tunisia andother countries that protectiono fbiodiversity can be replicatedandsustainablebyrelyingon
national humanresources.

  The main activitiesfor this componentare:

  (1) Project Management Unit, to be staffed by eight key full-time permanent employees from the
  Tunisian civil service; included in this activity is office equipment, equipment for the Information
  ExchangeCenter (e.g. Geographic InformationSystem (GIs), map printers, digitizingplatforms),basic
 field equipment(e,g. boat, motor, vehicles) and operating costs;

  (2) Quality assurance and control for the project activities (i.e. scientific, technical and participatory
  planningactivities); this quality assurance will be provided by short term technical assistanceexperts,
  and includesworkshops to disseminatethe interimandfinal resultsof activities;

  (3)Long-termstrategy for biodiversityconservationfor the Gulf of Gabes region; this activity includes
  two synthesis workshops to disseminate the project results to scientific and technical groups at the
  within the Project and at the national, Mediterranean and international levels; this activity will
  incorporateslessons learnedfrom other GEF projectsand will include mechanismsfor the replication
  of the Projectactivities;

  (4) Strategic EnvironmentalEvaluation (SEE) to evaluate impacts on biodiversity of the mid-to-long
  term Tourist Development Planfor the Gulf of Gabes; and

  (5) Strategy to protectbiodiversityareasfrom accidentalpetroleumand chemical spills,

  (6) Inventoriesof terrestrialflora and fauna for the projectregionfocussed on the 6 prioritysites so as
  to preparedetailed baselinedata for the management plans;

  A detailed description of all Project activities has already been prepared during Project preparation.
  Eachactivity is described in the format of a terms of reference, with clear objectives, task descriptions,
  methodology and outputs. These terms of referencewill be incorporated into an operations manual
  which will allow the PMU to quickly launch all the critical project activities within the first year of
  implementation. In addition during early implementationtraining will be provided to the PMU staff for
  both technical skills (e.g. preparation of participatory management plans; operational plans) and for
  project management skills to build implementationeffectiveness.

                                                     -

 The aim of this component is to strengthen human resourcesfor technical, scientificand participation
  issuesfor biodiversitymanagementin the Gulf of Gabes region. The componentwill consistof:

  (1) Training for local stakeholders, Project staff (both part-time and full-time), and high level
  management staff on Mediterranean and intemationalexperience in marine and coastal biodiversity
  management, and in project management skills (e.g. financial management, procurement, progress
  monitoring, impact monitoring, etc); this activity will combine both classroom training and on-the-job
 training to ensure an efficient Project launch and an efficient implementation; the goal is to ensure a
 strong team approach across the stakeholders and the various Tunisian institutions to enhance the
  Projectobjectives;

 (2) Design and implementation of a public awareness program for the target communities, local
 stakeholder groups and the general public concerned by the Project; this activity will include
 experiencefrom the otheron-going GEF projectsin Tunisia;

  (3) Training and capacity building program to strengthen enforcement of biodiversity protection in
  marine and coastal regulations; this activity is targeted at the staff from the agencies working in
 day-to-day enforcement of existing regulations for sectors such as fisheries, solid waste, small and
  large ports, customs, coastalandwetlands protection,internationaltreaties, etc.

  (4) Socio-economicsurveys of the target populationsand other stakeholdergroups; and

  (5) Participatory tools and mechanisms: this activity will identify and prepare implementation
  mechanismsto incorporateparticipationinto the biodiversitymanagement plans.

ProjectComponent3 :Baseline data acquisitionandappliedbiodiversity monitoring.     - US$1.20 million

 The aim of this componentis to updateor acquiretechnical and scientific data requiredas basic inputs
 for the biodiversity management plans (see Component 4 below), and then to carry out monitoringof
  key impact indicators. The activities of this componentincludethe followingstudies and inventories:

  (1) Hydrodynamic and water quality studies for the Gulf of Gabes in general, and focussed on the
 Jerba-Zarzisarea in particular;

  (2) Inventoryand monitoring of marine and lagoon species of regional and global interest; this will be
  carried out in parallelwith the implementationof the management plans;

  (3) Inventoryand monitoringof alien speciesand their distributionwithin the Gulf;

  (4) Regional management strategyto addressballastwater and alien species; and

  (5) Biodiversity impacts caused by the fishing fleet, including monitoring of impacts within and
  adjacentto the sea grassareas and recommended changesto fishing practices.

                                  Annex 4 IncrementalCost Analysis
       TUNISIA: Gulf of Gabes Marineand CoastalResourcesProtectionProject
Background
The coastal zone o f Tunisia is extremely richinterms o f species andhabitats, andthis is particularly true
o f the Gulf o f Gab& region. However for several decades this region has experienced three major direct
threats to biodiversity:
        e    industrial pollution, andespecially the discharge o fphospho-gypsum effluents into the Gulf,
        e    fisheries over-exploitation, particularly the use o f fishingequipment that impacts sea grass
             beds anda general decline o fharvests for near-shore fisheries,
        e    urbanandtourism development; although this is a highvalue economic benefit for the
             country, the development o f infrastructure along the coast has already upset the fragile
             balance o fthis zone.

The Tunisian Government has already made enormous financial efforts to reduce urban and industrial
 sources o f pollution to a reasonable level. The fact that nearly 80% o f the population in the three
 Governorates inthe project area is concentrated along the coastal strip indicates that even greater pressure
will bebrought to bear onnaturalresources inthe future.

 Conflicts o f use between users are likely to grow in the near future due to the progressive shrinking o f
 usable resources. This may exacerbate the falling incomes o f the coastal population who rely on marine
 resources for their livelihoods. Thus, sites o f exceptional biodiversity that are still barely affected today
 could quickly be degradedinthe coming years.

 The aim o fthis project is to address the indirect biodiversity threats by settingup sustainablemanagement
 methods for marine and coastal resources. The goal o f the management plan is to introduce methods in
pilot areas that protect global biodiversity, andat the same time contribute to the incomes of localpeople.


BaselineScenario

Within the 10thNational Plan of Tunisia for Economic and Social Development (2002-2006), the major
environmental protection investments are categorized withm municipal infi-astructure.              The overall
investment planis US$36.3 billion, as summarizedbelow:

         This Project will act as a catalyst for all levels of decision-makers to invest in additional incremental
         activities for biodiversity protection. The 6 management sites will demonstrate that the management o f
         biodiversity can be sustainable and contribute to long-term revenues for the communities concerned. The
         project is organized around four (4) components:
            0    Institutional strengthening, strategic planninganddissemination

GEFScenario

The alternative proposed for GEF hndingis basedon and developed from this baseline scenario. The GEF
scenario involves the sustainabledevelopment protection andmanagemento f 6 pilot sites that are unique to
the Mediterranean interms o f the habitats and species. This will improve scientific knowledge o f the Gulf
o f Gab& increasing scientific knowledge to improve management and monitoring o f ecosystem health. It
will also involve the setting up o f a management and documentation center that will provide essential
information for understanding the biodiversity environment andmanagementmeasures necessary to ensure
sustainable development o f the coastal ecosystem environment. By mapping and monitoring critical
ecosystems and species (e.g. seagrass inventories, mapping and monitoring), the Project will provide
essential information on ecosystem health and identify management o f interventions necessary to ensure
sustainable development inthe coastal zone. This project will pilot ways to mainstream biodiversity issues
into development sectors (e.g. tourism) in which the Government invests heavily but for whch
sustainability benefits are still largely unknown.

Throughout the Project area and at all levels ranging fi-omsmall coastal communities to large Government
institutions, the GEF scenario involves specific trainingand awareness activities aimed at improving the
conservation and sustainable use o f biodiversity. The GEF will increase collective awareness o f the need
for andbenefits from biodiversity protection and instill instakeholders a more responsible attitude, which is
a prerequisite for sustainable management o f the natural environment.

The total cost o f the GEF scenario is estimated at US$ 288.69 million, as set out inthe table below. The
difference between t h s baseline scenario (US$ 278.88 million) and the GEF scenario represents the
additional cost o f the project, i.e. US$9.81 million.

The Government would co-finance part o f the additional cost (US$ 3.50 million), and is thus requesting a
GEFgrant of(US$6.3lmillion).

         TUNISIA: Gulf of Gabes Marineand Coastal ResourcesProtectionProject

Procurement
 1. Guidelines
 Procurement for the proposedproject will be carried out inaccordancewith the World Bank "Guidelines:
 Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" May 2004, and "Guidelines: Selection and
 Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers", May 2004, and the provisions stipulated inthe
 Grant Agreement. National Competitive Bidding(NCB) will be carried out withprocedures acceptableto
 IBRDwhich allow: (a) an explicit statement to bidders of the evaluation andaward criteria; (b) national
 advertising with public bid opening; (c) sufficient time for bidders to submit bids (a minimum o f thirty
 days); (d) no preference margin to domestic contractors; (e) foreign bidders to participate in NCB ifthey
 so wish; and   (0contract award to bemade to the qualifiedbidder whose offer is substantially responsive
 and lowest evaluated. The methods to be used for the procurement under this project, and the estimated
 amounts for each method, are summarizedinTable A. The threshold contract values for the use o f each
 methodare fixed in
 Table B.

 Overall, the Tunisian procurement legislation for goods andworks is inline with the Bank's guidelines and
 reflects  adequate capacity o f implementing agencies to handle procurement, and adequate control
 organizations inthe country. However, substantial divergencies exist inthe procedures for the selection
 andemployment of consultantswhich, following local legislation, are basedon open competitive bidding.
 Under the project, Tunisian implementing agencies would apply the Bank's procedures.

 2. NCBProvisions and Conditionalities

        contract and provisions for bidders to protest.

These provisions are also specified inSchedule 3 o fthe GrantAgreement.

3. Project Management

DGEQV of MEDDwould be the principal agency responsible for overall coordination of procurement
under the project andfor the procurement o f goods and services required under Component 1,Institutional
 Strengthening.    However, the partner agencies, CITET, INSTM and MAL, will through signed
 conventions be responsible for the procurement o f works, goods and services covered under the
 convention. These agencies have limited experience inimplementing Bank-supported projects and a very
 limited complement o f staff dedicated to procurement, often combined with administrative and financial
 functions, The PMUo f DGEQV will include a procurement specialist, full time for the first two years o f
 the project, supported by international TA for about five months to coordinate and assist the partner
 agencies inthe preparationo fbiddingdocuments andrequests for proposals for consultants' services.

 4. Assessment of DGEQV and partners' capacity to implementprocurement activities

 An assessment o f the procurement capacity o f DGEQV and the three participating agencies, CITET,
 INSTM andMAL,was carried out duringpre-appraisal, and is filed inthe project documents. The result
 of the analysis indicate an overall HIGH procurement risk, gwen the high proportion o f consultants'
 services to be procured (about US$5.0 million, or more than 60% o f total project costs), the limited
 exposure o f these agencies to the Bank's consultants guidelines and the limited availability o fprocurement
 dedicated staff.   In addition to the procurement specialist and the TA mentioned above, the project
 includes trainingon procurement in Bank assistedproject as part o f the overall trainingprogram already
 plannedfor project staffunder Component 2 o fthe project.

 5. CivilWorks

 Civil works to be financed under the project will cover mainly the constructionandinstallation o f artificial
 reefs, underwater structures to prevent dragnet fishing, and the construction o f simple buildings like
 visitors' centers and observatories. These contracts are expected to add up to an aggregate o f US$ 1.48
 million equivalent. All Civil works contracts will be awarded on the basis o f National Competitive
 Bidding(NCB) procedures, subject to the provisions listedinpara 2 above, andthe use ofsamplebidding
 documents acceptable to the Bank.

 6. Goods

 The project would finance vehicles, office equipment, computers, miscellaneous equipment for the
 implementing units and for baseline data acquisition and applied biodiversity monitoring. The total value



                                                   -43 -

of goods i s estimated at US$0.40 million equivalent. NCB may be used for contracts estimated to cost
US$30,000 or more, while National or International shopping based on price quotations obtained from a
minimumofthree suppliers canbeusedfor small quantities ofgoods, providedthat the value ofthe goods
does not exceed US$30,000 and the aggregate amount does not exceed US$200,000.                   Proprietary
sofbare and satellite imagery may be procured on a Direct Contracting (single source) basis in an
aggregate amount not exceeding US$lOO,OOO equivalent.

7. Services

Services will consist o f approximately US$5.0 million o f studies, technical assistance and training.
Training is estimated at approximately US$1.2 million, and the remaining US$3.8 million equivalent
consist of national and intemational consultants. Consultants' Services with an estimated contract amount
exceeding US$200,000 will be advertised inthe UnitedNations Development Business and inat least one
national paper, seeking expressions o f interest. For such contracts the Bank's Standard Request for
Proposals (SRP) will be used ,and the selection o f consultants will be addressed through competition
among qualified short-listed firms in which the selection will be based on Quality and Cost Based
Selection (QCBS). Inthe case o f assignments to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent, the short list o f
consultants may comprise entirely national consultants if a sufficient number o f qualified firms are
available at competitive costs. However, if foreign firms express interest, they will not be excluded. The
selection method will bebasedon quality andcost (QCBS) for all contracts above US$200,000 equivalent
for firms. The selection methods for contracts estimated to cost more than US$lOO,OOO, but less than
US$200,000 equivalent will be either Quality Based Selection (QBS) or based on Consultants'
Qualifications. Below these thresholds, andwith the exception o f the employment o f consultants through
single source for reasons critical to the project, the selection method may be on the basis o f Consultants'
Qualifications. Individualconsultants will be selectedandemployed inaccordancewithparagraphs 5.1 to
5.4 o f the Guidelines. The need for Sole Source contracts is not anticipated but, ifjustified, they will be
awarded inaccordance with the provisions o fparagraphs 3.9,3.10,3.11,3.12       and3.13 ofthe Guidelines.
A particular case of Sole Source contract is planned in relation to items (3) and (4) o f Component 4      -
Inventories and mapping o f the marine plant cover and the establishment o f a Monitoring network for
grass beds. The studies will require the use o f sonar equipment, not available in Tunisia to private
operators because o f its strategic applications, and DGEQV has recommended to contract the study to
INSTM, because of its unique and exceptional qualifications, pursuant to Paragraph 1.11 (c) o f the
Guidelines.


National ConsultantsShortlisting Ceiling: until further notice the ceiling for the National Consultants
Shortlist will remain at US$200,000.

A project Operational Manual has beenprepared and it includes procurement and financial procedures, as
well a detailed procurement planfor the fist eighteen months' activities agreed at appraisal.

1. Summary ofthe FinancialManagementAssessment

1.1 Overall financialmanagement riskassessmentandconclusion

The overall financial management risk is considered low in this project based on the appraisal mission.
Two partner institutions (CITET and APAL) have prior Bank project implementation experience. The
financial management assessment undertaken during the appraisal mission covered the DirectionG6ndrale
de 1'Environnement et de la Qualit6 de la Vie (DGEQV) and its three partner institutions (MAL,CITET
andINSTM). Eachinstitutionhas a well established tradition of financial management including: qualified
fmancial management staff, accounting and reporting, intemal control, and annual extemal audit
arrangements in place. Overall each partner agency has an adequate system. The coordination for the
fmancial management aspects is described in a project procedures manual that has been submitted and
commented by the Bank.          The procedures manual sets out the financial reporting requirements, a
inter-agency agreement (convention) that describes the financial management responsibilities and staffing
at each agency, anda detailedjob description for the fmancial management specialist assigned to the PMU.


1.2 Country issues.

A C0unb-y Financial Accountability (CFA) report was completed in June 2004 for Tunisia. The
Government system was assessed based on the performance o f various Bank projects, and the overall
system is considered satisfactory with good standards. The public sector group o f MNA-PREM, has
reviewed the overall budget management performance o f the public sector in Tunisia and found it to be,
except for the budget formulation, also o f good standards. The budget formulation i s considered outdated
and in need o f reform. The project will basically rely on existing financial management and accounting
systems o f MEDDandthe partners institutions. The PMUwill consolidate the project financial information
andwill be responsible for the submission o fregular reports to the Bank.

1.3 RiskAnalysis: Overalla low project financial management risk.

As stated above the risk is considered low in this project for various reasons. Firstly, MEDD as the
institution in charge o f the overall project coordination has satisfactorily implemented other Bank projects
(although with a different coordination unit). Secondly, there is a low level o f inherent risk based on the
country's strong institutions and also on the good performance o f Tunisia with the Bank's portfolio in
general. Thirdly and most importantly, based on the Bank assessment o f the partner agencies, the capacity
level is found to be o f good standards and quality. The only perceived risk lies in the coordination efforts
required by the newly created P M U at MEDD. As the project is implemented by four institutions, the
project needs a strong leadership and coordination from the new PMU at MEDDto ensure that all project
information and reporting are consolidated at their level. The respective responsibilities and roles o f each
agency have been clearly set in the procedures manual, and this will ensure smooth implementation and
timely project information.

Audit reports of the Bank projects in Tunisia are issued annually and, in general, on time and do not
include any major issue. There are no other risks to flag.

1.4 Financial management: Plannedorganization structure, accounting, and internalcontrol.

For public sector projects with external financing sources, the accounting is maintained in two parallel
systems o f cash-basis accounting. ADEB i s a computerized accounting system for the public expenditures
reflecting the Tunisianshare of the budget, andSIADE(Systthe Informatis; d'Aide h la Dette Extkrieure:
InfomationSystem for Foreign Debt) is a computerized accounting system for all the foreign expenditures
fundedby foreign funding. The latter aims at maintainingseparateaccounting records for the foreign debt
management and for donors reporting requirements. The system i s centralized but operated at the level of
individual ministries, i.e. MARH(data entry and maintenance). Accounting records are entered into one or
the other o f the systems once the payment takes place basedon a set o f well defined procedures.

Two agencies of the agencies (DGEQV and INSTM) are public administrative agencies with financial
management and accounting procedures as described above. The other two agencies (CITET and APAL)
are state-owned enterprises (~tab~issementPublique h Caracdre Non-Administra~~EPNA) who have
                                                                                         -
internal control systems that are reliable. CITET inparticular has a well designed cost accounting system.
The two EPNA agencies are also subject to a well established national level central control (contrcile
d'ktat), that is designed and implemented in accordance with the applicable legislation. The CFA has
assessedthis national level system andconcluded that it is reliable.

For international grants, accounting records are kept in the SIADE system and maintained by the various
implementing agencies where payments also take place. Payments are prepared at the finance departments
once the documentation is received from technical departments with their clearance for payment.
Accounting documentation is then reviewed again at the respective finance departments to ensure
compliance, accuracy and full supporting documentation. Payment orders are then prepared and submitted
for approval to the Director General at each implementing institution. These are then sent to the Central
Bank o fTunisia (BCT), where the special account (SA) is maintainedfor payments. The BCT reviews the
supporting documentation, the eligibility o f expenditures per the procedures and legal agreement then
proceedswith the payment when everyhng is considered satisfactory.

Grant proceeds will be disbursed fiom the Bank into a special account at the BCT, anddisbursements are
made based on payment orders received from the disbursement unit. Information on payments from the
grant proceeds will be centralized at the PMU where monthly reconciliation o f the SA are made. The
special account is monitored and managed by the Central Bank. Replenishments into the SA are made
based on traditional disbursement methods, and are prepared and sent to the Bank by the BCT. These
arrangementsrepresentthe standardprocedure with most projects inTunisia.

1.5 Budgeting and budgetary control.

The budgeting process starts annually in January, and includes budgets for the Bank-financed projects.
The budget is approved as o f December 31 of each year. All expenditures during the year are committed
andpaidfor only ifthey are included inthe approved budget. Strict budgetary control is inplace through
the computerized public sector budgetary system. Once implementation of an activity is complete, this is
reviewed and clearedby the technical departmentso f the implementing agency for payment. Payment takes
place in two parts:   (1)part financedby the Government ofTunisia is processed by the Finance Department
(direction des u~aires~nanciers)each partner agency, and charged to the agency's own budget, (ii)
                                    at                                                                part
financed by the grant is processed by the partner agency through a payment order to the BCT for payment
from the SA.

1.6 Reportingandinformationsystem.

As stated earlier, for project accounting records, the two public sector accounting softwares, ADEB and
SIADE, are used to maintain the accounting records o f the Government's co-financing contribution to the
project and the national debt financing respectively. These are used to make daily on-line data entries. In
addition, each individual agency has its own software applications to generate its information andreporting
needsto monitor its expenditures, commitments anddisbursements.

The procedures manual sets out that Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR) are required and should be
prepared and submitted to the Bank at least on a quarterly basis in the first year o f the project, and
thereafter semi-annually. The FMR shouldinclude:
(i)      A statemento fsourcesanduseso f funds for the periodandcumulatively including the project
accounts balances;
(ii)     A statementon the useo fh d sbycomponents andcategory o fexpenditures.

2. Audit Arrangements
2.1 Generalaudit arrangements

For the public sector implementedBank projects inTunisia, the annual audit is performedby the Contrcile
G&n&ruldes Finances (CGF), an entity o f the Ministdre des Finances (Ministry o f Finance). The same
entity will be auditing the GEF project. Auditors review mainly the work o f the four partner agencies,
includingDGEQVandBCT's records o f SA and replenishment requests. The audit should cover all aspects
o f the project and all sources o f project revenues and expenditures. It should cover all the components o f
the project at all levels o f project implementation. Coverage should include the audit o f the financial
transactions and an assessment o f the financial management system including the intemal controls and an
opinion on these. It should be carried out in accordance with acceptable auditing standards. Terms o f
reference o f the audit should be reviewedby the Bank. The annual audit report will be submittedno later
than6 months followingthe endo fthe fiscal year beingaudited.

As a public sector implemented project, it will also be subject to the audit by the Cour des comptes based
on documentation received from MEDDandthe implementing agencies. The CFA has reviewed the overall
framework o f internal andexternal audits, and concluded that they have highperformance standards.

2.2 Flow of funds-Government counterpartfunds.

The payments will be made directly through the Govemment's ownbudget system andwill be paid directly
fi-om each o f the budgets o f the four partner agencies following their existing intemal control systems and
procedures. Payments will be made directly from the Government's Treasury system. Counterpart funding
is expected to be released on time as expenditures are incurred and payments are made through the
Treasury system. Smooth counterpart funding for the activities o f the project is expected, as this has
always beenthe case for most projects inTunisia.

3. DisbursementArrangements
The proceeds o f the grant would be disbursed inaccordancewith the traditional disbursement procedures o f
the Bank and will be used to finance project activities through the disbursement procedures currently in
use: i.e. withdrawal applications for direct payment, for special commitments andlor reimbursed
accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation or using Statement o f Expenditures (SOEs) in
accordance with the procedures described in the Disbursement Letter and the Bank's "Disbursement
Manual". The PMU and the Project Partner Institutions (DGEQV, CITET, INSTM and APAL) will be


                                                     - 50 -

responsible for submitting the appropriate supporting documentation for services rendered or activities
implemented to the Central Bank o f Tunisia (CBT) so that payments can be made from the special account
opened for that purpose, or to submit applications for direct payment to the Bank. Incase payments are to
be made from the special account, the PMU and the Project partner institutions (DGEQV, CITET, INSTM
and MAL)are required to send to CBT payment orders for services rendered or activities implemented
with supporting documentation. The CBT reviews the documentation receivedto ensure their compliance
with the terms of the grant agreement and relevant project documentation as well as the eligibility o f the
expenditures being incurred, then proceeds with the payment, if these expenditures are deemed eligible.
The CBT monitors the level of the Special Account (SA), and prepares and submits withdrawal
applications to the Bank for replenishment o f the SA. Under existing disbursement procedures, the P M U
will be also permitted to submit withdrawal applications for direct payment accompanied by the necessary
supporting documentation. As projectedbyBank'sstandarddisbursement profiles, disbursements would be
completed four months after project closure.

3.1      Special Account (SA).

To facilitate disbursement o f eligible expenditures the Government will open and establish at the Central
Bank of Tunisia (borrower's Central Bank) a special account in US$ to cover grant's share of eligble
project expenditures. The special account will be managed by CBT. The authorized allocation o f the
special account would be the equivalent o f US$ 1,000,000 covering an estimated 4 months` o f eligible
expenditures financed by the grant. Initially the authorized allocation will be limited to US$ 600,000 until
cumulative disbursement under the Grant reach a level equivalent to US$ 1.5 million, The recipient will
also open and maintain inDinars for, respectively, CITET andAPAL an Advance Account to be used by
each of the two partner institutions for the purposes o f financing works, goods, services and incremental
expenditures under the project to be carried out by CITET and APAL. The recipient will withdraw fiom
the special account and deposit into each Advance Account sufficient funds to enable the partner
institutions to pay for project activities they are responsible for, provided that at no time the amounts held
inthe said Advance Accounts shall exceed the equivalent o f US$ 200,000 for CITET andUS$ 5000 for
MAL. CBT will responsible for submitting monthly replenishment applications with appropriate
supporting documentation for expenditures incurred, for retaining these documents and make them
available for review by Bank supervision missions and project auditors. The replenishment applications
will be prepared on the basis o f information providedby the PMU. To the extent possible, all o f grant's
share of expenditures should be paid through the special account. The supporting documentation will
include reconciled bank statements & other documents as may be required. The SA will be audited
annually by the ContrGZe gknkrule desfinances - CGF. The BCT team in charge of the Bank's special
accounts for the Bank's portfolio in Tunisia is familiar with the Bank's disbursement and procurement
rules and procedures, and its performance is considered satisfactory.          In order to allow the project's
activiites to start in a timely manner, the Bank will approve retroactive financing amounting to US$
100,000.00 for project activities that will take place before effectiveness but after January 1,2005.

3.2      Use of Statement of Expenditure (SOEs).

All applications to withdraw proceeds from the Grant will be fully documented, except for : (i)
expenditures o f contkacts with an estimated value equivalent to US$ 100,000 or less for goods ;ii)US$
100,000 equivalent or less for consulting firms, and (iii) 50,000 or less for individual consultants and
                                                            US$
incremental expenditures which may be claimed on the basis o f certified Statements of Expenditures
(SOEs). Documentation supporting expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retained by the CBT and
will be available for review when requested by Bank supervision missions and project auditors. All
disbursements will be subject to the conditions o f the Grant Agreement and the procedures defined inthe

Disbursement Letter.

3.3 Financialmanagementsupervisionplan.

Two financial management supervision missions per year are recommended, gwen the low risk this project
represents. The supervision mission will review in addition to desk work on audits, FMRs and other
matters. There will be also opportunities to visit with the project andreview financial management aspects,
ifneeded, duringother country focusedfinancialmanagementactivities astheytakeplace.

1.0      Study Region

For the purposes ofthis project, a project regionwas defined to involve the following:

    (a) The Goveronates o f Sfax, Gab&, MCdenine, andMahdia (southern part);

    (b) All districts (de2egations)adjacent to marine areas, from Chebba district inMahdiaGovernorate to
    BenGuerdane district (at the border with Libya) inthe south (almost all are covered by formal landuse
    plansandseparate socio-economic baseline datahasbeencompliedfor these districts);

    (c) All littoral formations (e.g. sablikas, beaches, lagoons, dunes and wetlands) and coastal ecosystems
    (e.g. oasis, oueds andparticular vegetation communities);

    (d) Public marine land(Domaine PublicMaritime -DPM),which is generally definedas the high-water
    markplusthe borderingsanddunesandthe wetland areasdirectly connectedto the sea. Inaddition the
    DPMalso includesadjacentsensitive ecologicalareas. Inecologically sensitive areas, this zone extends
    farther inland; the DPM is legally defined andmapped indetail;

    (e) The marine study areais delineated by Ras Kaboudia (Cape Kaboudia) inthe north, inthe south by
    the border with Libya, and inthe east, bythe isobath minus 50 meters (also called depth o f 50 meters).
    This depth, locatedabout 100kmfrom the town o f Gabbs and 60 kmfrom the towns o f Sfax and
    Zarzis, was chosen because (i)is the practical limit o f littoralinfluences, (ii) documents are
                                      it                                             most
    only available up to depths o f40 meters and (iii)   the major biodiversity formation o f sea grass
    (Posidonia)does not exist below 40 meters.

2.0      Background to biodiversity sector issues: The marine environment

Sea grass beds (Posidonia oceanica), the most characteristic and important marine ecosystem inthe
Mediterranean, are endangeredby several threats. They are criticalto maintain water quality and habitats
for almost all commercial fish andcrustacean species, as well as marine flagship species such as turtles.
There is a direct linkbetween the presenceo f these beds andsustainable fishproduction.

The Posidonia beds inthe Gulfo f Gab& are considered the most extensive inthe Mediterranean. Most of
the benthic communities inthe Mediterranean are present inthe Gulf; some o fwhich are exceptionally
valuable interms o f biodiversity, bothfor Tunisia and the Mediterranean as a whole. Given the tidal range
inthe Gulf,which isalmost unique inthe Mediterranean (with the exception ofthe northernAdnatic Sea,
between Venice and Trieste), the vertical amplitude o f the meho-littoral zone is exceptional, with
particular biological characteristics andhighlydiverse fauna.

The infra-littoral zone startsjust below the average sea level anddrops to the lower limit o f the Posidonia
oceanica sea grass beds, at depthsbetween 20m-40m, depending on the transparency o f the water. With
respect to biodiversity, this is the richest zone. Onhard substrates, the most noteworthy infi-a-littoral
populations in the Gulf are Cystoseira sch@neri forests, found on the KerkennahMedenine. Inthe
Mediterranean, these populations are extremely rare. Vast meadows o f Caulerpaprolifera have been



                                                     - 59 -

found on loose substratesandonbeds o f deadPosidonia oceanic inthe Gulfo f Gab&           They are
spawning grounds andnurseries for numerous exploited species. In 1992, only a few shallow stations
remained where C.prolfera were still present, no doubt because o fturbidity andsiltation. Recent
observations confirmthis decline.

Fishspeciesinthe Gulfo fGab& present warm-water affinitieswhich distinguish them fiomthose inthe
GulfofTunis andthe country's northcoast. They include various lessepsianspecies (those that havecome
to the Mediterraneanfrom the Red Sea via the Suez Canal). Severaltropical African species characteristic
o f the Senegalesecoast are also found inthe Gulf.

Around the Kerkennah Islands, the Posidoniaoceanicahas anunusual andextremely original appearance:
Strips several tens o fmeters longby one-two meters wide weave through beds o f Cymodoceanodosa and
Caulerpaprolfera, between0.5m- 3m deep. P. oceanzcameadows are considered the most important
ecosystem inthe Mediterranean. Along with coral-producing areas, this is the mainbiodiversity reservoir,
withnearly 20% of all species inthe Mediterranean, i.e. a total of severalthousand, have beenspotted near
the Kerkennah Islands. The sea grass beds are spawning grounds andnurseries for numerous species,
includingfishthat are o f economic interest. Thus, protectingthe Posidoniabeds is vital for conserving
biodiversity inthe Mediterranean andisjustified for economic reasons (i.e. commercial fishing).

Some noteworthy species inTunisia are listed inthe Annexes to the Barcelona Convention andor the Bern
Convention. Many are quite valuable interms o fnaturalbiodiversity, including sponges, mollusks (pen
shells, cowries), crustaceans (large sea lobsters), diademe sea urchins, sea horses andmarine turtles
(loggerhead turtles, leatherback turtles andgreenturtles), whose survival can only be guaranteed iftheir
breedinggrounds are protected.

The project covers several zones. These include areas that were identifiedas especially sensitive, such as
the Kerkennah Islands andKneiss Islands nature reserve, which provide habitats for species or populations
such as Posidonia oceanica sea grass beds (Jerba-Zarzis sector), Cymodoceanodosa sea grass beds (
Bahiret ElBibane) (also calledElBibane lagoon) and~eogonioZit~onbrassica-forida reefs (Baluret El
Bibane). The reefs, consisting of Neogoniolithon brassica-forida, at Bahiret ElBibane, are a unique
formation inthe Mediterranean. Thus, they have great value interms o f natural habitat and are extremely
fragile. Their destruction would be irreversible. Nothing is known o ftheir fate since the last visual
observations recorded in 1992.Given its highbiodiversity, Bahiret ElBibane must be protected. The
KerkennahIslands also contain a diverse range o f uniquenatural habitats o fregional and international
significance, are very sensitive to biodiversity threats andwarrant special protection.

3.0      Backgroundto biodiversity sector issues: The terrestrial environment

A survey by ornithologists inMarch2000 insouthem Tunisia foundmore than 140species, mostly near
the lagoons, sebkhas andoases, which are important sites for trans-Saharanmigratingbirds andwintering
species. According to Wetlands Intemational, nearly 7,000 pink flamingos were counted inJanuary 1999
around Jerbaisland, particularly towards Bou Ghrara. A census o f water fowl inJanuary 2000 by the
Tunisian Ornithology Group revealed an even larger population o fpink flamingos, with 5,215 counted
around Jerba andmore than 20,000 inBou Ghrara lagoon.

The threatenedplant and animal speciesProsopisstephanian (a legume), was classified as a top priority
for Government protection. This plant, which attains its most westerly limit inTunisia, has only a single
station inthe Gabes Oasis and is threatened with extinction due to urbanpressure. The second priority is
the low steppe plant(several varieties) that is over-grazed by pasturinganimals and must be conserved.


                                                     - 60 -

Some birdspecies around the edge o fthe project areaalready receive special attention, since they are on
the IUCNRedList o f threatenedspecies.These include the marbled duck ( ~ a ~ a r o n e tangustirostri),
                                                                                               t a
falcon (Falco naumanni),pallid harrier (Circus mucrourus, soon to be threatened) andAudouin's gull (
Lams audouini, which is lessthreatened, since conservation programs are underway inother parts o fthe
world).

Landsites noteworthy for their biodiversity include: (a) Gab& Oasis (the westem-most coastaloasis), (b)
Bou Ghrara lagoon (which hosts waders andyoung flamingos), (c) Kneiss Islands, which are o f extreme
ornithological value, almost unique inthe Mediterranean interms o f their tidal range andconcentration o f
waders, gulls and stems, among the highest inthe area, (d) Bahiret ElBibane (which hosts various birds)
and the Thyna salt flats, a major area for cormorants (more than a thousand inMarch 2000), herons,
egrets, spoonbills, waders (more than2,000 avocets), gulls andstems (including a group o f Caspian
stems), This area is already officially protected.

4.0      Main threats to biodiversity

The three mainthreats to marine andcoastal biodiversity inthe Gulfare (i) andtourism
                                                                               urban
development concentrated along the coast, (ii)    water pollutionfrom industrial, urbanand ship sources, and
 (iii) andover-fishing.TheseoccursystematicallyalongtherestoftheTunisiancoastandother
     fisheries
Mediterraneancountries.

4.1      Urban and tourism development concentrated along the coast. Of the 40 districts (delegations)
intheproject area, 23 arecoastal or insular andcontain72% oftheproject area's populationof 1,138,000.
The project area includes about 20% o fthe country's industrial plants. Tourism, the industry earning the
most foreign currency, has 200 hotels, withover 52,000 beds, accountingfor 27% o f the country's
overnight capacity. However, the hotelbeds are unevenly distributed, withover 80% located inthe
Jerba-Zarzis area. Thus, urban, industrial andtourism infrastructurehas severely pressured the coastal
environment and its biodiversity. As the Government recognizesthese intense development pressures, it
hasplannedandregulated development inthis part o f the coast for many years. It created the Agence de
Protection du Littoral (APAL)anddevised urbanmaster plans(SDAA) for Gab& and Sfax. Inaddition,
APAL has developedplans for sensitive biodiversity areas, six o fwhich were prepared for the Gulfcoastal
region, andwhich are integrated into the urbanlanduse planningsystem. However despite these measures,
coastal development pressurescontinue to overrun many very richbiodiversity sites, such as illustratedby
the current status o f Gab& Oasis.

4.2      Water pollutionfrom industrial, urban and ship sources. Pollution from economic development
is one of the main reasons for the loss of marinebiodiversity inthe Gulf, Industrialpollutionmainly
involves discharges ffom large-scale phosphate productionplants concentrated inSfax and Gabbs. In
Gab&, the phosphor-gypsum plant emits untreated liquidand solid discharges into the sea at Gab& that are
acidic and have a heavy load o fphospho-gypsum (about 600-650 tonshour) and other pollutants
(cadmium, fluorine). Since the plants opened in 1972, the total phospho-gypsum discharged into the Gulf
of Gab& is estimated at 90 milliontons. Suchpollutants have damaged the coastal marineecosystems,
causing a severe recession o f sea grass areas (i.e. loss intotal productive area), particularly by Posidonia
oceanica sea grass.

 Urbanpollution, which for manyyears contributedto the progressive eutrophicationofthe Gulf, is now
 controlled due to the Government's sustained investments duringthe 8th and 9thPlans for urban
 wastewater collection andtreatment. These efforts will continue duringthe 10thPlan. Thus, 70%-80% o f
 urbanwastewater from the coastal zone is treated before beingdwhargedinto the GulfofGabbs.


                                                      -61 -

However, urbansolidwaste is disposed o f at sites that are only semi-controlled or uncontrolled(also called
"dumps"). In2001, there were 55 disposal sites, capable o f absorbingjust 40% o f the waste produced.
This causedcoastal pollution, andthe Gulfo f Gabbs areawas no exception. Thus, the Government
prioritizedthe buildingo f modem sanitary landfillsinthe 10thPlanunder the PRONAGDES Program.

Pollutionfrom ports andships still damagesmucho f the marine environment. Ballast water is also a main
mechanismfor introducing alien species, which threaten marine andcoastal biodiversity. The area's four
commercial ports generateabout 100,800 tonslyear of liquidwaste, o fwhich 36,000 contain hydrocarbons
and2,560 solidwaste. Also, itwas estimated that inthe fishingports, potential sources ofliquidwaste
containing hydrocarbons are equal to or even greater thanthose inthe commercialports, since the
proportion o f usedoil is twice that incommercialharbors. The fishingboats do not treat liquideffluent
(particularly that which contains hydrocarbons), and discharge it directly into the sea. La Skhira terminal
is the only one inthe project areawith specific installations to treat ballast water polluted by
hydrocarbons. Itreceives mainly very large internationalships. Moreover, no reception installationexist
inthe project areato treat water usedto wash tanks inshipsthat carry chemicals. A MEDAproject for
equipment to handle waste, ballast water andtank washing water inthe Mediterranean, particularly in
Tunisia, was recently started (the first meeting o f the Steering Committee was inMalta inMay 2002).
The project will evaluate the treatment needsinvarious countries basedon the quantities produced andthe
capacities o f existing installations. An earlier project, PollutionManagement inthe South-West
Mediterranean(1993-1999) for the three Maghreb countries, managedby the World Bank and financed
partlybyUS$20million GEF funds, is now completed, addressedsome ofthese issues.Howeverno
significant facilities were constructed inthe project area, andno emergency procedures manual for
accidental spills o f chemicals or petroleum has beenprepared for the project area.

4.3      Fisheries and over-fishing. Fishing i s botha main cause o fenvironmentaldeterioration anda
victim o f the degraded conditions. The sector accounts for 8% ofTunisia's agricultural production, or 1%
ofGDP, andprovides regular income for 60,000 fishermen, 30,000 ofwhom operate inthe GulfofGabbs.

Studies o f fish resourcescarried out from 1998 onwards by the INSTM revealed (a) over-exploitation o f
almost all species, (b) a drop inproduction from the Gulfo fGabbs over the past decade relativeto
national production, and(c) a drop invalue andquantity duringthe same periodinthe share from coastal
fisheries relative to the overall Gulfharvest.

The reduced harvest, which affects small-scale coastal fisheries, is due to unsustainable fishingpractices
such as (a) usingnon-selective or prohibited fishingequipment, (b) operatingbottomtrawls inareas
reserved for coastal fishing, which degrade natural habitats andjeopardize the equitable distribution o f
resources, and (c) catchng immature specimens ofcertain types offish outside the legal fishng season,
threatening their survival. Large areas o fPosidonia sea grass andthus the entire biodiversity associated
with themhave been destroyed, particularly by the bottom trawls.

4.4      Other threats to biodiversity. More indirect forces ruinor significantly diminishthe results o f
Government efforts to protect the environment. For example, alien species' with strongly invasive
characteristics represent a potentialthreat to the original biodiversity andalso threaten the overall balance
o fthe coast andrelatedobjectives o f integrated development, such as public health (toxic tides, for
example), fishingandseaside tourism. Thus, knowledge about these species mustbe improved, along with
measuresto control them. To this end, the project includes aninventory andmonitoring program for alien
species anda strategy for managingballast water.

Other threats to marine biodiversity are (a) an inadequateinstitutional framework andexperience to
establish andmanage protected areas, (b) lack o f informationabout the environment and biodiversity inthe
Gulfo fGab& (neededto devise further actions) and(c) insufficient involvemento fstakeholders in
understandingandimplementing necessarymeasures. Since direct threats to biodiversity degradation are
reasonably well controlled (Le. major urbanand industrialpoint sources o fpollutionas described inthe
diagnostic reportprepared duringproject preparation), the project will concentrate on indirect threats to
ensure that actions are implementedinthe shortest possible time to protect biodiversity and sustain
development inthe Gulfo f Gab& coastal area.

deliberateor unintentional actionssuch as natural passagethroughthe Suez Canal (Lessepsianmigration), containedand

Several ministries andinstitutionshave a positive effect on biodiversity andmarine resources, while others,
focused on economic development inthe coastalarea have not mainstreamed environmental protection into
their priorities, andare inadvertentlythreatening biodiversity resources. The ministries concerned with
biodiversity are:


    0    Ministry of Environment andSustainableDevelopment (MEDD),which includes several agencies
    relevant to the project, (i)
                              Direction Ge'nkralede I'Environnement et la Qualite' de Vie (DGEQV), (ii)
    APAL is responsible for coastal land-usemanagement(including permitting) withina narrow strip
    between the low water tide line andthe upper water line referredto as the maritime public land(
    Domaine Publique Maritime-DPM). Inthis narrow coastal band, APAL is responsible to control all
    construction anddevelopment activities, includingplanningfor sensitive biodiversity areas; (iii)

    International Center for Technology andthe Environment o f Tunis (CITET) is specialized intraining
    and capacity strengthening for environment and sustainabledevelopment, andis responsible for public
    awarenesson environmental issuesand strengthening capacity for implementing entities to adopt new
    technologies; (iv) the Regional EnvironmentDirectorate for the Southern Coastal Region (DRLS); and
    (v) AgenceNationale de Protection de 1'Environnement( W E ) whichenforces environmental
    regulations, reviews environmentalimpact reports, carries out environmental monitoring andsupervises
    solid waste management activities.
    0    Ministryo fAgriculture andWater Resources(MARH) includesthe DirectorateGeneralofFishing
    Aquaculture (DGPA) which is responsible for data collections andregulations on marine fishing
    activities.
    0    Outside the Government sector, other organizations such as professional federations andscientific
    bodies are also involvedinthe protectiono fmarineandcoastal resources.

The ministries concerned with economic development are:


    0    MinistryofTourism which is responsible for planninganddevelopingtourismareas, which
    includes specialized agencies such as AFT and ONTT
    0    Ministryo fPublic Works, Housingand LandUsePlanning(MEHAT) which includes the

2.0      Selection of the Executing Agency

 Four entities were evaluatedto be the executing agency: (a) the nationallevelDGEQVwithinMEDD, (b)
 the RegionalEnvironmentalDirectorate for the Southern CoastalRegion(DRLS), part ofMEDD(c)
 APAL,and(d) ANPE. Two other agencies, the Directorate GeneralofFishingandAquaculture (DGPA),
 part o f MARH,andthe Southern Development Office (ODs) were considered. The analysis o fthese latter
 two agencieswas not continued indepth, since their administrative responsibilities andhumanresource
 capacities were not consistent withproposedproject activities.

 The four agencies subject to detailed analysis were evaluated onthe basis of:

(a)      Replication and sustainability. Potentialfor replicating the project experience so as to ensure
lastingresults inthe Gulf.
(b)      Role. Pertinence inrelationto project objectives andactivities.
(c)      Leadership and partnerships. Ability to coordinate with other agencies' efforts, develop
partnerships with target groups andruna new integrated management organization.
(d)      Available resources.Those available at the regionallevel andpossibility o fredeploying them for
the project.
(e)      Efficient management. Ability to control procurement andfinancial management. Resources
available to sign contracts speedily.


         DGEOV(at the nationallevelwithin MEDD). As the mainnationalunitresponsible for
         environmentalissuesandstrategies, the DGEQV coordinates andsupervises activities o fother
         agencies, as well as interacts with all stakeholders. It has experience coordinating international
         projects with external bi-lateral andmulti-national agencies, andhas gained experience during
         implementationo fproject preparation activities. The Gulfo f Gabbs project is considered a national
         level project, andthe precedents it createswill be replicated best by a national-level entity.

         DRLS (at the repional level within MEDD). As the main contact for regional andlocal
         stakeholders, DRLS can coordinate andsupervise activities by other stakeholders and
         environmental agenciesat the regional level. However, the DRLS has limited financial and
         procurement capacity to implement the project, andwould require considerable strengthening.
         MAL(at nationalandregionallevelswithinMEDD). Thenationalstrategyandpolicyforthe
         protectionof coastal areas is under the leadership o f MEDDwho is also responsible for all policy
         decisions. MEDDcoordinates all the actions o f the various institutions within MEDDincluding
         APAL. Accordingly APAL isresponsible for:

        0    management o fthe coastal fringe (espace littoral) through studies andthe regulations o f

      ANPE (at nationallevelwithin MEDD). Themainrole ofthis environmental protectionagency
      is to protect enforce all regulations against forms o f environmental degradation, including
      pollution control andapproving environmental impacts assessments. ANPE gained experience ina
      previous coastal management project, the Sfax Coastal Development Plan (UNEPIMAP), from
      1994-1998. Like APAL, ANPE has flexible administrative arrangements for managing
      procurement and funds. Itremains part of MEDD, but as it does not have a specific institutional
      mandate for coastal andmarine areas, its ability to replicate the pilot areas andprovide leadership
      insustainability islimited.
The above analysis shows that bothANPE andAPAL,withtheir regional offices andnational
mandateshave the capacity to implement the project at the regional andlocal level, andbothhave
efiicient project management structures. However, only DGEQV within MEDDhas the clear national
role to mainstream environmental issuesandcoordinate strategiesamong national agencies.
Thus, DGEQVwas selected as the implementingagencyresponsible for overall leadership, project
management andcoordination. Several partner agencieswill still participate inthe project to deliver
technical andspecialized capacity, as described below.


3.0 Project Implementation Arrangements (see organization charts below)

3.1 National Steering Committee. The steering committee will have primary oversight at the national
level, andbe chaired by the Ministero f MEDD(or his named representative). Itwill include
representatives o f (a) MEDD     - APAL, DGEQV,      ANPE, D E S , CITET and the GEF FocalPoint, (b)

Transport, (e) M S T M withinthe Ministry o f Scientific ResearchandTechnology andCapacity
Development (MSTDC), (0Ministryo f Interior andLocal Development, (g) MEHAT; (h) M M ; and
(i)memberoftheprofessionfiomtheTunisiaUnionforAgricultureandFishing(UTAP).The
    a
Steering Committee will meet twice a year to ensurethat project activities are consistent with ongoing
or plannedstrategies, actions andaims o f other sectors.

3.2 Project Agreement MonitoringCommittee. The m o n i t o ~committee will meet regularly
                                                                       g
(approximately every three months andas requiredon an ad hoc basis) to resolve technical, financial
andprocurement issuesandcoordinate those ofcommoninterest to eachpartner agency. The
MonitoringCommittee consists o f five members (National Project Director, andthe Directors General
(or his namedrepresentative) ofthe four major implementationpartners         - DGEQV,   CITET, M S T M
andAPAL). TheNational ProjectDirector will chair the meetings andbe responsible for preparingand
distributingthe minutes ofmeetings.

3.3 NationalLevelProject Management Unit@MU)(located inTunis). The central.PMUwithin
DGEQV, will oversee project implementationandcoordination(for all technical, scientific and
financial tasks). The NationalDirector (part-time position) andNational Coordinator (full-time
position) are staff members from DGEQV and will report to the DGEQVDirector General. Also, a
financial managementspecialist andassistant, as well as a procurement specialist will report to the
National Director. The PMUwill coordinate all aspects o f procurement for contracts andfinancial
managementwith staff from MEDDbased inTunis (see organizationchart inAnnex 12). The PMU
will prepareregular progress reports (twice a year), that will describe the project's key performance
indicators andcorrective measures neededinthe event o f lack o fprogress towards the development
objective or other delays inproject components. The technical supervision o f field investigations and
analysis ofresults during contract implementationwill be carried out by specialists inthe POU as

described below.

3.4 Regional Level Project OperationsUnit(POU) (located intown of Gab&). A POUinthe town
o f Gabbs, will provide the technical capacity to supervise implementationo f all project activities. Itwill
also ensureparticipationo f local stakeholdersinpreparingmanagement plans for the six pilot sites. The
POUwill be coordinated by a POUDirector (a full-time position), withpart-time support a regional
advisor. Other full-time staffwill be responsible for various tasks, such as the information exchange
center andstudies (Component l),    capacity buildinglpublic awareness(Component 2), marinelcoastal
biodiversity (Component 3), andbiodiversity management (Component 4). Staffwill include a GIs
specialist, financial assistant andsupport staff (see organizationchart inAnnex 12).

Supervision o fproject implementationis divided into four components (as described above), with a
separateagency responsible for each: Component 1,DGEQV,Component 2, CITET; Component 3,
INSTMandComponent 4, APAL
3.5 Local Participation. At mini"six local development committees (local DCs) will be createdat
eachpilot site. They will regularly contact local communities, groups andindividuals andhelp develop
the integrated managementplans for eachpilot area, There are also existing Goveronate levelDCs that
are regularly consulted onregional issues, andadditionalparticipatory mechanisms andtechniques will
be developed to address project issuesas required duringproject implementation.

3.0      Project Location

The project will cover the full Gulfo f Gab& area, with attention focused on 6 areas that will benefit from
biodiversity management plans, including a sea grass pilot area, The six pilot areas are: (i)   a sea grass
pilot areanear the Kerkennah Islands, (ii)    Kneiss Islands, (iii) o f Bou Ghrara, (iv) KerkennahIslands,
                                                                 Gulf
(v) ElBibane lagoon, and (vi) Gab& Oasis. The preparation and implementationo fmanagement planswill
be undertakenfor the first three sites listedwithin the project activities. Only management planswill be
prepared for the last three pilot sites within the Project, andthe Government will implement those plans
sites under its own financed progrm.

4.0      Applicable Social and Environmental Policies

Underthe WorldBank's social and environmental safeguardpolicies, this Project is classified as
Environmental Category B for Operational Policy 4.01 (OP4.01). Under Category B, the potential impacts
are limitedand usually confined to site-specific locations for whch mitigationmeasures canbe readily
designed.

Giventhe nature ofthe proposed Project components, some activities may cause loss o fassetsto a few
people (e.g., less than 200 people), or restrict access that causes adverse impacts on livelihoods. Under


                                                       - 69 -

such circumstances, social mitigation measures would be requiredinorder to conformwiththe Bank's
policy on InvoluntaryResettlement OP4.12. For such cases a Resettlement Policy Framework has
prepared as a separate document.

5.0      Key Potential Impacts


Potential Direct Impacts: This project is composedo f mainly o f studies, technical assistanceactivities and
purchasing o f small equipment items. A few small scale physical structures will be constructed to assist in
the biodiversity protection at the three priority sites chosen for implementationo fthe management plans.
The proposed physical structures consist of: (i)visitor receptionbuildingfor the Gulfo f BouGhrara
                                                   a
area, (ii)strengthening andrehabilitation o f smallinfrastructure for the Kneiss Islands, and(iii)
anti-trawlingstructures andor artificial reef structures at the perimeter o fthe sea grass pilot areato be
located near the Kerkennah Islands. Environmentalmitigationmeasureswill be incorporated into choice
for the final site locations andfinal designs for these physical structures. Inaddition complementary
mitigationmeasures structures will be detailed duringthe preparation o f the biodiversity management plans
for eachpilot area to ensure minimal environmental impacts.


PotentialIndirectImvacts: Although the direct impacts o fproject activities are minimal,the key external
threats andimpacts to biodiversity have also been carefully taken into account inthe designo f the project.
Inparticular, the impacts ofindustrialandurbanwater effluentsonbiodiversityhavebeenreviewedduring
the site selection process for the 6 pilot areas for which biodiversity managementplans will be prepared.
Based on the existing information, the indirect impacts to the 6 biodiversity sites from degraded water
quality generally inthe Gulfo f Gabbs (due primarilyto industrial andurbaneffluents) i s also considered to
be minimal. The proposed biodiversity pilot sites are over 30-40 kmdistance from a major effluent source
at the phospho-gypsum plant at Gab&

Furthermore duringthe project implementation, the phospho-gypsum plant at Gabbsis scheduled for a full
renovationo f its productionprocessthat will eliminate industrial liquideffluents into the Gulfo f Gabbs.
Secondly two major urbanwastewater plants are becoming operational on Djerba Islandwhich greatly
reduce the existing urbaneffluent impacts inthe Gulfo f Bou Ghrara. The project also includes mitigation
measures inComponent 2 that will monitor that water quality threats to biodiversity so that indicators are
identified andmid-andlong-term trends inwater quality impacts are established.

6.0      EMPActions :ProposedMitigationMeasures, MonitoringandCapacity Building


Mitigation through Management Plans: The maindirect physical impacts o f this project are relatedto a
few small scale physical structures will be constructed inthree pilot management areas: (i)      a visitor
reception buildingfor the Gulf of Bou Ghrara area, (ii)     observationplatforms for the Kneiss Islands area,
and (iii) anti-trawling structures andor artificial reef structures at the perimeter o f the sea grass pilot area
to be located near the KerkennahIslands. Environmental mitigationmeasureswill be incorporated into
choice for the final site locations andfinal designs for these physical structures. Inaddition complementary
mitigation measuresstructures will be detailed duringthe preparation o f the biodiversity management plans
for eachpilot areato ensureminimal environmental impacts. Also issuesrelated to physical cultural
propertywill be reviewed and any potentiallocations will be appropriately screenedto assure the absence
of significant cultural property, so as to conform to World Bank policy OPN 11.03.

Mitigation through Participation: The initial studies identified as key stakeholders those whose sources o f


                                                       - 70 -

income are from tourism, fisheries (i.e. traditional as well as commercial fishing), artisan industries, and
other local industries. Participationi s seen as one o f the essentialbuildingblocks to ensure the protection
of degraded biodiversity resources, and balance the interests of long-term biodiversity conservation with
other investments. Initial steps towards the formulation o f a participatory strategy are based on two key
concepts: (a) that the stakeholders must understand the Project objectives and social development
outcomes and in order to take an active part in the decision-making process, and; (b) that their ideas,
approaches and solutions must be taken seriously and incorporated into the design o f the Project, and in
particular into the design o fmanagementplans.

The participationmechanisms will be validated and tailored to the specific social realities o f each o f the
pilot sitesjointly with the stakeholders. With this approach, nomanagementplans or other measures will
be implementedwithout the appropriate consultation andparticipation of the key stakeholders. The target
populations will participateto: (i)  act as sourceso f up to date information on the localconditions
(fishing, production, etc) whichwill also serve as aninitialmechanism ofraisingawarenessabout threats
to biodiversity; (ii)react to proposals for management inorder to learnwhat measuresthe populationi s
willing to enact towards aresponsible andsustainablemanagemento fthe biodiversity resources; (iii)
jointly formulate the final agreedmechanisms necessaryto ensureprotection o f ecosystembiodiversity.
Includedinthe participation will be measuresto addresspossible temporary restriction to resourcesused
bythe population.

Throughout the Gab& region and at all levels ranging from small coastal communities to large
Government institutions, the Project involves specific management, training and awareness activities
aimed at improving the conservation andsustainable use o fbiodiversity. The Project will increase
collective awarenessofthe needfor andbenefits from biodiversity protection andinstill instakeholders a
more responsible attitude, which is a prerequisite for sustainable management o fthe natural environment.

Mitigationthrough EnvironmentalMonitoring;: It isrecognized that there i s a longterm shrinkage o f the
Posidoniu oceanicasea grass beds, that will be difficult to reverse withinahumantimescale (60-80
years). This shrinkage is due several factors whose extent and degree o f influence i s poorly understood.
Some o f the shrinkage i s due to longtermnatural environmentaltrends and phenomena that are poorly
understood; some shnkage i s due to draggingon the sea beds o f fishing equipment; and some shrinkage
i s due to general pollutionpressureswhose effects are poorly understood, bothinterms o fbasic
ecologicalprocessesand interms o f geographic locations. The Projectwill undertake a program o f
upgradingthe baseline data (socio-economic and environmental), and extensive applied environmental
monitoringresearchwill be carried inComponent 3. The overall goal o f Component 3 i s to significantly
improve the scientific understanding o f the basic ecological interactions inmarine and coastal systems
withinthe Gulfof Gab& region. The work inComponent 3 will includes mappingo f sea grassbeds,
investigations on distributiono f fish species (e.g. species o f global interest, regional interest and alien
species) and an overview o fthe effects o f fishingpressureson biodiversity and improved fishingpractices
to protectbiodiversity. There will be a focus to identify key indicators o fbiodiversity, inparticular for the
pilot areas at the sea grass area andat the Gulfof Bou Ghrara. The indicators will be based on the key
interactions betweensea grass beds, fish reproduction, spawning, andwater quality and fishpopulation
growth so as to develop scientifically basedmanagement mechanisms for biodiversity conservation.

Capacitv Building: An extensive capacity buildingprogramwill be undertaken within the project under
Component 2, for all project stakeholders, as for example :public awareness for the general population;
participationmechanismssharedwith local development comrnittees; consultations with NGOs; training
for Project staff; strengthening o f enforcement o fregulations; and workshops to share and to integrate all
data with stakeholdersand scientists. The goal of this large capacity buildingeffort i s to strengthen the
participative approach for the Project, and to strengthen the knowledge base andhuman resources who
will then support the longterm sustainability o fbiodiversity inthe Gulf o fGab& region.

     Additional Annex 14: Process Frameworkfor Community Participation(OP4.12)
         TUNISIA: Gulf of Gabes Marineand CoastalResourcesProtectionProject

I.Summaryofprojectobjectives

The maindevelopment objective o fthe Project is:


      e  Establish a functional integrated monitoring and participatory management system for the project
      areato manage biodiversity degradation inthe Gulfo fGab& region.

The project has four (4) components:
1.       Strengthening, at the regional andlocal levels, o fthe logical framework for the effective protection
andmanagement o fthe marine andcoastalbiodiversity ofthe Gulf;
2.       Strengthening of humancapacities at all levels o f decision-making, through appropriate training
andoutreach to localpopulations, Government officials, and scientists, andthrough the establishment ofa
participatory approach inthe pilot sites where managementplansanda program o f applied researchare to
be implemented;
3.       Acquisition o fknowledge anddata on the Gulfo f Gabbs, andparticularly on the selectedpilot
sites, inorder to arrive at a precise defintion o f the technical andscientific foundations o fthe proposed
management programs, result objectives and monitoring indicators;
4.       Preparation of biodiversity management plans for the six (6) selected zones (ie., the Marine
Protected Area (MPA), the Gulfo fBou Ghrara, the ElBibane lagoon, the Kneiss islands, the Kerkennah
islands, andthe Gab& oasis) owing to their importance interms o f global biodiversity, along with
implementationo fpilot plans infour priority sites, includingthe MPA. This implementation is basedon a
participatory approach involving all relevant communities or interest groups.


11.Target Population and Benefits

11.1.Target population

The target population includes: communities that exploit coastal marine resources at the various sites
chosen, comprising first    and foremost fishermen, farmers in the Gab& oasis, local NGOs active in the
development and environmental protection sector, local professional organizations, local authorities, and
the tourism andhotel sector (particularly inthe Jerba-Zarzis area).

Detailed analysis o f the project's target population was carried out duringthe preparation phase. The aims
o f this analysis were (a) to identify potential beneficiaries or actors in those parts o f the Gulf o f Gab&
affected by project activities; (b) to identify positive as well as negative impacts that the integrated
management program could have on the parties involved; (c) to lay the foundations for a community
participation strategy to be followed during project implementation, as well as for other socioeconomic
studies deemednecessaryfor project monitoring andevaluation.


II.2. Global and regional benefits

It is important to emphasize that the project will benefit from conservation andor management measures
concerning the marine and coastal environment o f the Mediterranean region, while at the same time
enhancing their overall efficacy.


                                                      - 74 -

The project will help expand areas that are actually protected incoastal andmarine zones. It will improve
andenhancethe protection o fspecies ofglobal or regionalimportance, andwill reduce the trendtoward the
degradation o f unique ecosystems. It will develop practical models to guide the implementation o f
participatory management of biodiversity in other parts o f the region. It will update information and data
pertaining to biodiversity inthe Gulfo f Gab& andwill establish a store o f scientific data on the Gulfthat
will enhanceoverall knowledge o fbiodiversity inthe western Mediterraneanbasin.

Sites such as BouGhrara andthe Kneiss islands are o f global importance interms o fbirdlife. The Kneiss
islands have already been declared a reserve andwere recently designated as a Specially Protected Area o f
Mediterranean Interest (SPAMI). The Bou Ghrara site has great potential for economic exploitation o f its
biodiversity owing to the heavy concentration o f tourism operations on its periphery. The Gab& oasis site
is exceptionally important at the regional level, being the only example o f a coastal oasis environment.
Seriously threatened by urbanization, industry, and inappropriate farming practices, this oasis could
quickly lose all its biodiversity value and agricultural production capacities. The preparation o f its
management plan is an essential first step inthe sustainable protection o f plant varieties that are unique in
the region andcurrently threatenedwith extinction.

The areao f ElBibane and the Kerkennahislands is home to exceptional benthic formations that are unique
inthe Mediterraneanand, insome cases, inthe world. As theseareasarelocatedinsectorsthat are already
or will inthe medium-term be subjectedto pressurefrom coastal development ingeneral andto hotel-based
tourism inparticular, it is important to anticipate the degradation o f the environment in order to preserve
their exceptional biodiversity while at the same time respecting the imperatives o f local economic
development. The preparation o f management plans proposed in the context o f this project is a fust step
toward attainingthese long-term objectives.

The project may also strengthen a number of current programs launched at the regional level, just as it may
benefit from the contributions o f these projects inthe implementationo f certainactivities.

11.3. National and local benefits

More generally, the huge beds o f Posidonia sea grass that are a special feature o f the Gulf o f Gabbs have
shrunk sigruficantly over the past several decades due to heavy industrial pollution and destructive fishing
practices. Today, it is necessary to preserve areas inwhich this sea grass is still in good condition, so that
the highly productive ecosystems that depend on it can be rehabilitated and the Gulfs fish stocks
replenished, The establishment o f fishing reserves characterized by anti-trawling structures and artificial
reefs will simultaneously preserve marine biodiversity, promote the restocking o f coastal waters, and
eventually improve revenues from small-scale coastal fishing.

The protection of rare or endemic species will help maintain the richness o f Tunisia's biodiversity,
Improvement o f the legal andregulatory framework, training for the institutions andNGOs concerned, and
institutional arrangements developed at the regional level will all help to enhance the country's overall
capacity to protect and manage its natural resources. The management models and funding mechanisms
adopted for the protected areas will be easily replicable inthe other parts o f the country, thus reducingboth
implementationcosts and the risks o f failure.

At the local level, the project will implement and test mechanisms enabling local communities, local
authorities and NGOs to manage their natural resources efficiently and sustainably and increase their
incomes, thereby reducing the poverty that still persists in rural areas inthe south. The project will help

improve management o f small-scale coastal fishing by encouraging the reproduction o f fish species andthe
restocking o f coastal waters through the creation o f fishing reserves and the promotion o f
environmentally-friendly small-scale fishingtechmques andselective catches.

declines in productive resources, or loss o f revenues to persons due to restriction o f access to resources
upon which these persons depend; relocation o f persons to environments where there is increased
competition for resources or where their techniques o f production are less effective; where the social or
community networks are weakened as a result o f restriction o f access to resources or relocation, land
acquisition, etc.).

Inthese cases the Bank's policy OP4.12 requires the preparation of a framework that (1) defines the
impacts and the measures to mitigate impacts; (2) the compensation measures in those cases where the
affected persons suffer a decrease in their assets due to restriction o f access to the resources; (3) the
measures to ensure community participation; and (4) the preparation o f a plan, acceptable to the Bank,
outlining the specific measures to be taken to assist the affected persons and the plan to implement these
measures. The plancan take the form o f a management plan for the affected persons andresources.

The Gulf o f Gabbs Marine and Coastal Protection Project has been designed insuch a manner that at this
time there is no component or activity that would involve the acquisition o f landnor the loss o f revenue or
economic resources. Consequently, there should be no land acquisition nor involuntary resettlement within
the project.


IV. Processframework for community consultation and participation

Steps in the development of a participatory strategy:            The participatory strategy consists of: (a)
identifying and counting people who might be affected by the project; (b) defining eligibility criteria for
people affected by the project; (c) developing criteria for the identification of vulnerable groups; (d)
developing the process o f consultation and dialogue; and (e) proposing an approach for involving local
people inproject implementation.
IV.1. Community outreach and mobilization

For eachzone inhabited by people or communities that could be affected, the project will establish
appropriate mechanisms inthe form o f teams responsible for implementing the provisions o f the process
framework by drawing up actions plansthat will include:


a)       Dissemination o f information, mobilization o f stakeholders, andthe creationandtraining o f Local
Development Committees (LDCs).

b)       Collectionandanalysis o f data on the specific ways inwhich resources are used andtheir social
impacts;

c)       Formulation of a managementplan incollaboration with the LDCs;

IV.2. Creation of LocalDevelopment Committees (LDCs) and selectionof Project Management Unit
(`MU) representatives

Inorder to ensurecommunity participation, the projectwill createLocalDevelopment Committees (LDCs)
as needed (e,g., a PMU for each pilot site and thematic PMUs - primarily for fishing,) All population
groups affected will be able to participate inthese committees and will appoint certain o f their members to
represent them. Modalities will be developed to ensure that the interests o f women, in particular, are
representedinthese committees.

For each zone, an interdisciplinary technical team composedo f various specialists will be available to
ensure that project interventions are beingcarried out andthat the populationis participating intheir
implementation. Dependingon the situation, the team will include a sociologist/anthropologist,a
community development specialist, andspecialists ineducation andenvironmentaloutreach. Training o f
the staff o fthe PMU, andsupport for the implementationo f the requiredstudies andsurveys to be
performed, as well as for community organization activities, will be the responsibility o fthe executing
agency for the project.

                             AdditionalAnnex 15: Social Assessment
         TUNISIA: Gulf of Gabes Marineand Coastal Resources Protection Project

                                       SocialAssessment Summary


Duringproject preparation, a social assessmentwas conducted that includedvisits to three ofthe proposed
pilot sites Serkennah, Gabbs andBouGhrara). This social assessment is intendedas a preliminary
investigationo f the social foundations andmodalitiesneededfor participation andawarenessbuildingfor
biodiversity protection, andimprovement o f livingconditions for the people inthe project area. Duringthe
social assessment, extensive interviews and focus groups were heldwith the primary stakeholders, which
includes managers o f tourist hotels inthe Gabbs area, localindustries (e.g. primarypolluters insome
instances), fishermen (e.g. bothlarge-scale industrial and small-scale artisanal), andother smaller local
industries. This annex summarizes the findings, conclusions andrecommendations o fthe social
assessment.

One o fthe crucial elements identifiedinthe social assessment is the articulationbetweenthe local
population andits elected officials: e,g. the localDevelopment Committees (Comitks de Dkveloppement),
the project's management staff, andthe administrative structure at the govemorate level. There are major
issuesthat require the interventiono fthe Government at the govemorate level. One major issue is the
responsibility for sewerageandgypsumpollution, becauseit is clear this issue can only be resolved at the
state-wide level, andlocal communities andNGO's cannot do muchto intervene, inspite o ftheir awareness
o fthe problem. Similarly, inthe Governorate o f Medenine, the crucial issue is the impact o fthe tourism
industryalongthe coast offrom the town ofGabbsto the Dejrba-BouGhrararegon. This zone provides
one quarter o fthe total tourist availability inthe country, its impacts on the coastal zone also require
intervention from the nationallevelwith hotel industrialists andthe individually affected communities inthe
region.

Inotherwords, theneedfor participation, requires alevelofintegrationnotjust atthelocalcommunity
level, but at the higher levels o f Government andlarge financial stakeholders.

Participationo f the localpopulationo fbeneficiaries is an approach which has proven to be one o f the
essentialbuildingblocks to ensure the protection o f degradedbiodiversity resources andto balance the
interests o f long-termbiodiversity conservation. The social assessment focuses on the populations'
perceptions about the key causes o f environmental degradation as well as the current practices and
behavior, andthe specific local actions required to protect marine andcoastal resources, The social
assessment also investigated the attitudes andconditions as well as readiness o f the populationto
participate inthe proposedproject.

The social assessment, inaddition to identifyingthe groups that would be potentially most affected by the
project (both positively andnegatively), also outlined the initial steps required to develop a truly
participatory strategy. The strategy i s based on the concept that the stakeholders mustunderstand the
project objectives and social development outcomes, so they can take an active part inthe decision-making
process; and that their ideas, approaches andsolutions are taken seriously and incorporatedinto the design
of the project - inparticular into the design o f the biodiversity management plans.

The findings of the social assessment show that there is unanimity among the stakeholders on the need to
protect the environmental resourcesagainst the key factors o fbiodiversity loss: illegal trawling especially

bysea-bottom scrapingboats, over-fishing, sewagepollution, gypsumpollution, andover-construction by
the tourism industry. They argue that the challenge is to protect the marine resourceswhile at the same time
adding value to the existing resourcesthrough better management. The strong responseonthe part o f the
population andthe NGOs is that there is an urgency for the Government to establish protectiveprograms
andto act quickly. Among the stakeholdersparticipating inthe focus groups itbecame clear that the
problemis not a lack of will to assist incarrying out conservation programs, andto raise awarenessby
attending awarenessand training sessions; but rather the needfor the project managementjointly with
Government andcommunities to get the biodiversity managementplans establishedquickly.

Training andeducation for participation ina project such as this requires not only the explanationo fthe
project's rationale andobjectives. Participation also needsto draw onthe awarenesscurrently held among
manystakeholders aboutthe key lossesto maritime resourcesandto biodiversity, andknowledge about
site-specific vulnerable areas such as BouGhrara. The key issuesinclude not only illegal fishing practices,
butthe haphazarddevelopment o ftourism onthe coastline, particularlyinDjerbaandother project issues.

Beneficiaries expressed, nevertheless, a certain levelo f skepticism with the objective that localpopulations
themselves would be associatedina technicalproject from its inception. Upto now, the existing
organizations (existing development committees, other NGOs andGovernment institutions) have weak
capacity andare organized inanad-hoc fashion. They cannot see how they are going to be integrated
collectively into the project activities. The creation o fthe local development committees inGabbs,
Kerkennah and BouGhrarawill demonstrate to the population not only that it is possible for these legal
institutions to be createdandrecognized by Government, but also that it is urgent to generalize this
approach to the rest o fthe project zone.

Recommendations
1.       Due to the weak localcapacity and skepticism about effective participation, the social assessment
recommends that the plans for education, trainingandparticipation be among the first activities inthe
project inorder to avoid missing the opportunities for participation, andlack o fpopular support later,
2.       The social assessmentrecommends that the project make use o fthe resource people that are
already familiar with the project to assist inthe preparation of the initial trainingandeducation programs.
This will gain time since they are experienced with the pilot sites, as well as the stakeholders and
institutions.
3.       The training requiredfor participation shouldavoid as much as possible a formal classroom
environment, suggestinginstead that they follow traditional community meetings where anybody can have
their say and pose questions. Most effective are small focus groups that together debate andreach
consensuson a range o f activities andresponsibilities.
4.       Technical and formal training can come later, the first activity i s to ensure awareness o f the project
objectives and outcomes. For this issue, the role o f the local development committees to buildawareness
for the participatory outcomes is critical. The membership o fthe local development committees should
include local community leaders, freely elected community members, representatives o f active NGOs, other
local stakeholders(e.g. tourism, industry), andmembers from Government agencies. The Government
representativeswould serve as the critical interface between the local communities andhigher institutional
levels.
5.       The monitoring andevaluation of socio-economic impacts would largelybe linkedto the number of
sessionsand numberof participants inawareness andtraining programs, andthe translation o f community
concerns into the managementplans. Still the local development committees will also be able to do
participatory monitoring and evaluation on the changesinquantity andquality of fishing, changes in
revenues of the fishing community, number ofjobs createdand revenues from the eco-tourism sites under
implementation (BouGhrara, Kneiss Islands, andthe sea grass area).

The determinationo fwhether the project's management plansmay require some limitation o f access to
sources o f livelihoodof the beneficiary population cannotbe made at this time. Nonetheless it requires that
all stakeholdersas well as the implementing agenciesandGovernment, be well informedabout the Bank's
Policy OP 4.12 andits requirements onmaintaining livelihoods, andreporting on any changes to
livellhoods. To ensure that the project will be implemented inaccordance to the Bank's policy a
Resettlement Policy Framework hasbeenpreparedby the Government, andfound as acceptableto the
Bank.Inaddition, as the managementplans formulated, they shouldtake into considerationthe
requirements o f OP 4.12 to minimizeany adverse impacts and provide compensation, ifappropriate, This
mustbe done at anearly stagejointly withinitialparticipationsessionsthat explainthe specific planned
actions for eachpilot site. This i s a process o f education, notjust givingout information that may be
unfamiliar andmisinterpreted, butit is a critical stepinensuring effectiveparticipationinthe management
plans.
