satisfactory project\n            outcomes, a highly likely sustainability, and high\n            institutional development impacts, in addition to\n            satisfactory performances, both by the Bank and Borrower.\n            Lessons concerning project design, suggest community\n            forestry as an effective instrument for sustainable rural\n            development, namely, this model encompassed the development\n            of social capital (based on traditional forms of\n            governance), a minimum base of natural capital (forest\n            resources with commercial value), and, the development of\n            technical and administrative capacity (human capital) of the\n            producers. Hence, a regional vision on the use of natural\n            resources should be fostered, seeking to achieve an economic\n            scale, through greater integration of productive chains.\n            However, the development of community forestry have not been\n            linear, and the cause of structural limitation to access to\n            markets, and lay natural capital, needs to be addressed, so\n            as to access investment funds. While project design was not\n            focused on communities engaged in land conflicts, (rather\n            excluding significant numbers of communities, and depriving\n            such communities from incentives to find a way out of\n            conflict), the opposing decision however, could create a gap\n            between communities engaged in conflict, and those that are\n            not. Moreover, the project did not directly benefit the\n            people living in, or near communities, that are not members,\n            nor own the resources, or share in the decisions, neither in\n            the form of employment and enhanced public services. This\n            issue also raises questions about exacerbating gaps between\n            richer and poorer, and leaving significant numbers of poor\n            behind in the development process. Likewise, the project\n            design did not directly assist women, or help them achieve\n            an active role in community decision making. Project\n            implementation lessons strongly support the frequent\n            interventions of promoters, and technical support in forums,\n            and other regional fora in community assemblies, including\n            individual efforts to disseminate, and analyze options on\n            performance of productive initiatives, which provided\n            invaluable benefits in community strengthening. The\n            viability of the community forestry enterprises, depend on\n            their capacity to compete in global markets. However, the\n            experience with private and parastatal companies has led to\n            many communities with an understandable reluctance to engage\n            in partnerships with the private sector. Hopefully, as\n            communities strengthen their capacity for governance and\n            technical skills, it will be possible to overcome this fear\n            and establish linkages to private sector strategies, and to\n            establish commercial alliances with productive agents,\n            allowing access to new local, and regional markets."}, "docdt": "2004-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
