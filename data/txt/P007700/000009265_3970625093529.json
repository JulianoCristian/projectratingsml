the Government's redefined natural resource\n            management strategy. Specific objectives are to: (1) improve\n            natural resource management and conservation by community\n            and ejido forestry resource owners; and (2) increase the\n            range of forestry-based income generating options available\n            to them. The project will have four components: (1)To assist\n            Oaxaca's communities and ejidos (land grants for legal\n            use and enjoyment that, prior to 1992 constitutional\n            reforms, were state-owned and could not be sold) by\n            financing activities, assistance, and training to prepare\n            and update management plans for timber extraction; to\n            prepare conservation plans for forested areas; to integrate\n            resource management and forestry research; to develop\n            silvicultural skills, and control fire and insects; to\n            understand boundary conflict issues; to access credit,\n            markets, and technologies; to increase the efficiency of\n            forestry activities and enterprises, and to improve business\n            and management, especially financial management skills. (2)\n            To strengthen the capacity of Oaxaca's private service\n            providers to assist communities and ejidos, and finance\n            consultants and equipment needed to review and strengthen\n            the government's certification and evaluation program\n            for private sector providers. (3) To promote non-timber\n            forest products in the six priority states with pine-oak\n            forest by financing studies, grants, salaries, consultants,\n            equipment, materials, and publications. (4) providing\n            finance to strengthen state forestry institutions in five\n            priority states with pine-oak forest."}, "docdt": "1997-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
