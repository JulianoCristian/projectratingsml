Description         The proposed poverty reduction support operation (PRSC-4) i s the
                    first in a series o f five annual operations supporting the
                    implementation o f Tanzania's National Strategy for Growth and
                    Reduction o f Poverty (MKUKUTA). It covers six focus areas.
                    These are the three clusters o f the MKUKUTA @e., growth and the
                    reduction o f income poverty, improvements o f quality o f life and
                    social    well    being,   and     governance    and   accountability),
                    macroeconomic       stability,   resource    allocation  and    budget
                    consistency, and public financial management.
Benefits            The proposed operation would support the government to pursue its
                    policy objectives laid out inthe MKUKUTAby providingfinancing
                    for the execution o f the government's FY07 budget. It would also
                    provide the incentives to implement key economic, social and
                    institutional reforms to strengthen the overall performance o f the
                    economy and contribute to poverty alleviation. Over the period
                    2005-2010, it i s expected that the reform program under the series
                    o f five annual PRSCs (PRSC-4 - PRSC-8) would help the
                    government to sustain growth o f around 6-8 percent annually, which
                    i s projected to result in a significant reduction in poverty. It would
                    also help the government in making progress toward reaching the
                    MDGs, namely, increase school enrollment and literacy rates,
                    reduce child and maternal mortality, increase access to safe water,
                    and strengthen the sustainability o f development efforts.

                   PRSC-4 funds i s determined by the budget process, there i s a risk
                   that resource allocation and use i s not fully consistent with the
                   MKUKUTA. However, government has adopted an open and
                   participativebudget process including an annual PERprocess which
                   helps to align and monitor resource allocation and its consistency
                   with the MKUKUTA. (iv) The CFAA and the CPAR identified

                   in this area in recent years and put Tanzania among the best
                   performers in Africa. (v) Capacity for program implementation and
                   service delivery at both the central and district level i s weak;
                   however, inkey areas programs are inplace to strengthen capacity.

                                     I. INTRODUCTION

1,       The proposed poverty reduction support operation (PRSC-4) would be the first in a series
o f the five annual operations supporting the implementation o f Tanzania's National Strategy for
Growth and Reduction o f Poverty (MKUKUTA)inthe amount o fUS$200 million.

2.       PRSC-3, which was approved by the World Bank's (Bank) Board on September 8, 2005,
concluded the first series o f three PRSCs supporting the implementation o f Tanzania's first PRSP.
Following the preparation o f a new PRSP - the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction o f
Poverty (NSGRP or MKUKUTA in Kiswahili), a new framework for budget support has been
developed under the leadership o f government with fourteen participating donors. It comprises o f a
new Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), a new Partnership Framework Memorandum for
General Budget Support for the implementation o f MKUKUTA, and a streamlined review process.
The design o f the framework aims to support domestic accountability, further reduce transaction
costs (especially for the government) and encourage the development and use o f Tanzania's own
systems rather than setting up and usingparallel donor systems.

                                  11.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSINTANZANIA
3,       PoliticalTransition. The rulingCCMparty won presidential and parliamentary elections
in Tanzania in December 2005 and Zanzibar in October 2005. The new President, Mr. Jakaya
Kikwete, who served as Minister o f Foreign Affairs in President Mkapa's government, won about
80 percent o f the vote and C C M won 206 o f 232 elected Parliamentary seats. InZanzibar, C C M
won the elections by a narrow margin, providing President Karume with a second term.

4.       Economic Growth. Tanzania's economy grew by 6.7 percent in2004 and a projected 6.9
percent in 2005. Miningand construction continued to be the fastest growing sectors, with growth
rates o f 15.6 and 11 percent in 2004, respectively.       However, o f particular importance to
Tanzania's poverty reduction efforts i s the fact that the agriculture sector grew by 6 percent in
2004.    Agriculture contributes about 46 percent o f Tanzania's GDP and about 81 percent o f
Tanzania's poor households derive their livelihoods from agriculture and are thus directly affected
by faster growth inthe sector. The sustainedhighgrowth inthe manufacturing sector, averaging 7
percent during the past five years, i s a positive indicator o f structural transformation and
diversification o f the economy. A severe drought that resulted in food and power shortages i s
likely to result in lower than originally projected growth in agricultural and manufacturing sector
production inFY06

5.       Investment. Since 2002, investment has been growing at a higher rate than GDP, leading
to an increase inthe investment to GDP ratio from 17 percent in 2001 to 21 percent in2004. Both
the public and the private investment to GDP ratio increased by two percentage points, reaching
7.7 and 13.2 percent in2004, respectively. Inaddition, there i s also evidence at the firm and sector


                                                  1

level that the productivity o f investment has gone up as a result o f the structural reforms
implemented during the past decade.         Foreign direct investment (FDI) continues to play an
important role in Tanzania, with an estimated inflow o f US$ 495 million in 2004/05. Most o f the
FDIgoes into the miningsector, but manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, the financial sector, and
trade are also benefiting from FDIinflows.

6.       The 2005 PEFARreport suggests that a significant part o f public investmentis devoted to
enhancing the social and administrative infrastructure, while expenditure on the economic
infrastructure accounts only for about one fourth o f government's development spending.
Increasing investment inTanzania's economic infrastructure, especially the transport infrastructure
with an emphasis on rural roads, and the electricity supply is critical for sustaining Tanzania's
economic growth.      Government i s preparing a medium-term Power Sector Strategy which i s
expected to be shared with stakeholders before the end o f FY06. Reforms o f the legal and policy
framework, strengthening the regulatory institutions, and improving the investment allocation
process for the infrastructure sector are critical to ensure that increased infrastructure spending
yields the desired benefits.

7.       Trade. Tanzania's exports o f goods more than doubled between 2000 and 2004. Most o f
this increase is due to rising exports of gold, which were estimated at US$ 629.5 million in2004,
while traditional exports increased at a much slower pace and stood at US$ 293.3 in 2004.
Tourism i s another major source o f foreign exchange for Tanzania. While revenue from tourism
between 2000 and 2004 was stagnant, a significant increase in tourism receipts i s projected for
2005. Since imports o f goods and services were also rising, the current account deficit (excluding
grants) increased from 9.7 percent o f GDP in2000 to 10.9 percent in2004.

8.       Regional Integration. The East African Community (EAC), consisting o f Tanzania,
Kenya, and Uganda was founded in 1999. Its objectives for regional integration are broad based,
covering trade, investments and industrial development; monetary and fiscal affairs; infrastructure
and services; human resources, science and technology; agriculture and food security; environment
and natural resources management; tourism and wildlife management; and health, social and
cultural activities. Other areas o f co-operation include free movement o f factors o f production;
and co-operation in political matters, including defense, security, foreign affairs, legal and judicial
affairs.

9.       On January 1, 2005, the EAC Customs Union (CU) was formed, and Tanzania - together
with Kenya and Uganda - has implemented the EAC common external tariff which has three
bands of 0, 10 and 25 percent. In the context o f C U implementation, Tanzania eliminated all
remaining suspended duties. The CU will be phased inover a five year period, and duringthis time
Tanzania will continue to charge tariffs on about 900 selected imports from Kenya; these
temporary tariffs have a top rate o f 25 percent and will be gradually reduced to 0 over five years.

 10.     Fiscal Policy. Total central government expenditures increased from 22 percent o f GDP
in 2003/04 to 25.7 percent o f GDP in 2004/05. This increase was made possible by improved
domestic revenue performance, which increased from 13.0 percent o f GDP to 13.6 percent, and
increased borrowing, both from domestic and concessional external sources. 2004/05 was the first
year with significant domestic borrowing (amounting to 1.1percent o f GDP), after several years o f
negative domestic borrowing. The increases in oil prices has resulted in higher cost o f energy
production and sharply increased transfer payments by the Treasury to power generating
companies, This has highlighted the urgency o f energy sector reforms to ensure a reliable supply



                                                  2

o f energy to Tanzania's economy and to avert risks to fiscal sustainability arising from escalating
transfers to the power sector.

11.      Tanzania's Public Expenditure Review (PER) process, which has been in place since
1998, provides a platform for open dialogue with stakeholders on fiscal policy and expenditure
prioritization and i s one of the central underpinnings o f general budget support to Tanzania. The
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review i s an integral part o f the PER process,
providing an annual external assessment o f fiscal management and performance. In addition, the
PERprocess also supports the budget process, inareas such as enhancing the flows o finformation
on external finance, supporting the budget review process at the sectoral level, and mainstreaming
cross cutting issues such as gender or the environment. At present, government i s reorganizing the
PER process to ensure consistency with the MKUKUTA and its objectives and to achieve better
integration o f the budget process with sectoral review processes. Inline with the greater focus o f
the MKUKUTA on growth and infrastructure, these issues are a main focus o f the FY06 PER
process.

12.      Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Developments. Relative rapid growth o f the
money supply by 25.5 percent during 2004/05 was consistent with continued low inflation, which
fell to 4.1 percent in the same year, despite a significant increase in the price o f oil. Growth o f
credit to the private sector slowed down to 26 percent in 2004/05 compared to 47 percent in
2003/04. This i s likely to be related to the increase in the Treasury bill interest rate from 7.7
percent in 2003/05 to 10.4 percent. A significant development in the financial sector was the
conclusion of the first phase o f the divestiture o f the National Microfinance Bank (NMB) with the
sale of 49 percent o f its shares to a strategic investor. NMB i s the only bank in Tanzania with a
countrywide branch network and its divestiture i s expected to improve access to credit in rural
areas.

13.      The primary challenge for monetary policy is the management o f large aid inflows and
their potential impact on the exchange rate, interest rates, and the rate o f inflation. Sterilization o f
these aid inflows through the issuing o f Treasury bills by the Bank o f Tanzania has contributed to
the recent increase in interest rates with its potential negative impact on private sector investment.
However, since highrates o f monetary growth have been consistent with a low and declining rate
of inflation, the Bank o f Tanzania i s considering reducing the degree o f sterilization while closely
monitoring the rate o f inflation.

14.      Overall Assessment of Macro-economic Management.                      Tanzania continues to
implement sound macro-economic policies, which provide a conducive environment for making
progress towards the MKUKUTA objectives of high growth and reduced poverty. The primary
challenge for fiscal management i s to further enhance the quality and efficiency o f public
expenditures and ensure that efforts to strengthen Tanzania's absorptive capacity keep pace with
increases in government spending.        Tanzania's high aid dependency makes it vulnerable to
fluctuations in aid flows. It i s important that the structure o f Tanzania's expenditure remains
flexible enough to be able to accommodate changes in the resource envelope without creating
macro-economic distortions. Power sector reforms which would reduce the fiscal drain originating
from that sector are critical to ensure continued fiscal sustainability o f the government program.
Monetary policy has been successful in sustaining l o w inflation. Financial deepening o f the
economy and structural reforms that will strengthen the international competitiveness o f the
economy are critical to mitigate potential negative impacts o f large aid inflows on macro-economic
stability and on Tanzania's internationalcompetitiveness.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
15.          Economic reforms undertaken during the past decade provide a strong basis for continued
economic growth and there i s a strong commitment by the authorities to sustaining macro-
economic stability. Tanzania's MKUKUTA targets growth rates o f 6-8 percent and policy based
projections undertaken for the forthcoming CEM suggest that such growth rates are ambitious but
indeedachievable. These growth rates would also be consistent with halvingpoverty by 2015.

16.          Inadditionto preserving and deepeningreformachievements inthe areas o fprudent fiscal
and monetary policy, liberalized markets, an open economy, and a clearer definition o f the role o f
the private and the pubic sector, achieving sustained high growth will also require a scaling up o f
investment in infrastructure and enhanced access to capital by the private sector. In the medium
term, raising the number o f Tanzanians with post-primary education, strengthening incentives for
innovation and adoption o f new technologies, improving the institutions for steering Tanzania's
growth agenda, and continued progress in fighting corruption will be essential for sustained high
growth.

17.          Outlookfor 2006 - 2008. Tanzania's economy i s projected to grow by 6.9-7.5 percent
over the medium term. Insupport o f this target, investment i s expected to grow by 1.6 percent o f
GDP inresponse to ongoing reforms o f the business environment and the financial sector, as well
as sustained macroeconomic stability. The agriculture sector i s projected to grow by 5.2-6.0
percent over the medium term. The government's strategy to facilitate agricultural growth includes
(i) reformofcropboards;(ii) reformoflocalgovernmenttaxation;and(iii)
    the                                            the                                              improvements
in rural infrastructure. Inflation is expected to stay at 4.0 percent over the medium term. The
revenue effort i s expected to increase from 13.6 to 16.2 percent over the medium term period due


                                                                4

to improved tax administration, expanded tax base, rationalization o f tax laws and regulations, and
sustained macroeconomic stability. Export earnings are expected to increase from US$ 1.5 billion
to US$ 2.2 billion over the medium term due to increased export o f non-traditional commodities
and gold. Imports are also expected to increase from US$ 2.6 billion to US$ 3.7 billion over the
medium term.

18.      The main vulnerability o f Tanzania's economy arises from its aid dependence, with more
than 40 percent o f the government budget financed from foreign aid. With the ongoing shift from
project to general budget support, vulnerability increases, especially as recurrent expenditures are
being financed through general budget support.         However, the authorities and development
partners have put in place mechanisms that aim to reduce this vulnerability. This includes the
careful and successful management o f the macro-economic impact o f large inflows, to minimize a
negative impact on Tanzania's international competitiveness. In addition, the evolution of the
modalities for general budget support (provided by a group o f 14 donors) aims at reducing
fluctuations in general budget support from year to year, increasing the predictability of budget
support by aiming at firm commitments six months before the start o f the fiscal year, and front
loadingbudget support, to allow better management o f annual expenditure plans within Tanzania's
cashbudget system.

19.      Terms o f trade shocks pose another risk,especially for exports o f agricultural commodities
and manufactures. While the magnitude o f these exports i s small compared to aid inflows and
exports of gold, they are nonetheless critical for the dynamic development o f the economy and
impact directly on Tanzania's poverty reduction efforts. About 50 percent o f Tanzania's exports
are gold. However, as the linkages o f the gold sector with the rest o f the economy are extremely
limited, changes inthe price o f gold are unlikely to have a major impact on the economy.

20.      Weather-related shocks are another source o f vulnerability.        In particular, recurrent
droughts have a severe effect on agriculture, food security, and the power supply. In FY06,
Tanzania had to issue an appeal for international food aid and experienced a severe power crisis
with extended power rationing. These droughts exacerbate structural weaknesses in the power
sector, which need to be urgently addressed if the negative impact o f weather related shocks on
economic activity, particularly in the manufacturing sector, i s to be reduced in the future. In
consultation with the World Bank, government i s currently preparing a financial recovery plan for
TANESCO and a medium term Power Sector Strategy, both o f which are expected to be in place
before the end o f FY06.

21.      Scaling up ofaid. Estimates of the cost o f implementing Tanzania's MKUKUTA and o f
achieving the MDGs typically suggest that additional resources would be required. Analytic work
on absorptive constraints and the macro-economic impact o f increased aid highlightsthat scaled up
infrastructure investment and structural reforms that reduce the cost o f doing business in Tanzania
will be important to offset any negative effect aid inflows could have on the real exchange rate and
Tanzania's international competitiveness. Addressing absorptive constraints, especially the
capacity of the public sector to manage significantly increased levels o f expenditure, but also
human resource shortages at the operational level such as in the health sector, will need to receive
increased attention ifhigher levels o f aid are to achieve the desired impact. Finally, strengthening
the "budget challenge" process through enhancing the capacities o f the Ministry o f Finance,
Parliament, and civil society will be important to strengthen the links between the MKUKUTA
and the budget.

22.     Debt sustuinubiZity. After receiving HPC debt relief in2001, Tanzania's NPV o f debt-to-
export ratio had declined to about 130. The most recent debt sustainability analysis prepared by
Fund and Bank staff shows that this debt indicator has fallen to 118 in 2004. However, this
favorable development o f debt indicators depends critically on sustained economic growth and
enhanced export performance.            Tanzania's external debt position was assessed as being
sustainable, with moderate risk. Reliefunder the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative will contribute
to a further significant improvement o f Tanzania's debt indicators.'       Russia has announced its
intention to cancel bilateral debt and Spain i s expanding its debt relief to cover 100 percent o f
debt.

23.      In addition, progress in securing debt relief from non-Paris Club creditors is critical to
ensure the continued sustainability o f Tanzania's debt. Negotiations have been concluded with
eight creditors (Kuwait, India, Bulgaria, China, Hungary, Libya, Slovak Republic, and Czech
Republic). Negotiations are underway with two creditors (Iran, and United Arab Emirates) and
negotiations are pending with seven other non-Paris Club creditors.

POVERTYAND INEQUALITY
24.      Update on Income Poverty. Income poverty i s mostly a rural phenomenon and 87 percent
o f the poor live in rural areas. Given the lack o f recent data on income poverty, we use poverty
simulations to project the likely trajectory o f rural poverty since the last householdbudget survey
in2000/01, Changes inrural poverty are explainedby three phenomena: ruralper capita income
growth, changes in the distribution o f rural income and rural-urban migration. Rural income
growth i s proxied by agricultural growth in the monetary and non-monetary sectors. This proxy i s
not ideal, but as income poverty data are collected infrequently the best that i s readily available.
Only about 60 percent o f rural income i s earned in agriculture. And, as growth i s determined in
constant prices, it does not account for potential changes interms o f trade.

25,      Figure 1, panel 1presents agricultural growth since 1991. After a period o f erratic growth
inthe 1990s where agricultural growth frequently droppedbelow the rate ofpopulation growth of
2.9 percent (the horizontal line inthe graph), agricultural growth was consistently above the rate o f
population since 1999 and reached its highest level o f 6 percent in 2004. Panel 2 presents
projected rural poverty incidence, determined by projecting rural per capita consumption forward
and backward usingthe 2000/01 HBS, the agricultural growth rate and a population growth rate o f
2.9 percent per annum. The projections suggest that ever since agricultural growth exceeded per
capita income growth, rural poverty has been on the decline.

26.      The poverty projections come with uncertainties. There are uncertainties about the
accuracy o f the agricultural growth data, about the rate o f population growth, about whether
agricultural growth i s a good proxy for changes inrural household consumption and about changes
inthe income distribution. Uncertainlyabout the true level ofruralincomepoverty is illustratedin
two ways in the projections. In projecting backward, the 1992 rural poverty incidence (of 40.8
percent according to the HBS) was suggested to be 42.8 percent. By projecting forward, a
projection was carried out whereby rural consumption growth was 1percentage point less than the
official estimates o f agricultural GDP growth. It shows that rather than a decline from 38.6 percent
in 2001 to 33.8 percent in 2004, a much lower decline o f 36.1 percent in 2004 may be realistic.
And this does not yet take into account changes inincome inequality. The population growth rate

2005 andby the Bank'sBoardonMarch28,2006.

used for these simulations i s 2.9 percent, the national average recorded between the census in 1991
and 2001. However, the UN estimates that population growth has slowed down to 2.4 percent,
which would imply that the per capita growth rates and the impact on poverty may be higher than
projected inthese simulations.

27.            The lack o f reliable data on the current status o f rural and urban poverty and the
uncertainty attached to the above poverty simulations highlights the need to collect information on
income poverty and other poverty indicators with higher frequency. Staff therefore supports the
proposals for a national panel data set and a continuous HBS which will contribute to providing
national MKUKUTA indicators on an annual basis and regional estimates every three to four
years.

28.             Updateon non-income poverty. Invarious non-income aspects o f well-being, progress has
been recorded, particularly in health and education. Net primary school enrollment increased from
57 percent in 2000 to 95 percent in 2005. Life expectancy increased from 44 years in 1978 to 49
years in 1988 to 54 years for males and 56 years for females in 2002. Infant mortality dropped
from 115 per 1000 in 1988 to 68 per 1000 in 2004. The fraction o f chronically undernourished or
stunted children declined from 44 percent in 1999 to 38 percent in 2004. Other indicators recorded
less progress. Maternal mortality which was 529 per 100,000 births in 1996 did not change, nor
has fertility (at an average o f 5.7). The proportion o f the population with access to piped or
protected water as their main source o f drinking water remains very low, especially inrural areas
where -depending on the source 46 percent (census) to 56 percent (HBS) has access.

29.             Update on inequaZity. National data on income poverty hide inequalities that exist within
Tanzania. The 2000/01 HBS has shown that rural poverty incidence could be as l o w as 28 percent
(in Southern Highlands) and as highas 45 percent (inCentralregion). Rural-urban differences are
even more striking, as poverty in Dar es Salaam (18 percent) i s about a third o f that in the Central
region. The poverty map presented in Figure 2 shows that if one looks at lower levels o f
disaggregation --districts, even larger inequalities appear. At district level it is not uncommon to



                                                                                       7

find districts with poverty incidence exceeding 50 percent but also districts where rural poverty is
less than 20 percent. The poverty density map shows a similar pattern: there are numerous regions
with very low poverty density (less than 6 per km2) but also areas whether the density i s more than
10- fold higher.

30.      Inequalities not only occur with respect to the income dimensions o f poverty. The 2002
Census reveals how under 5 child mortality varies from a low o f 58 per 1000 in Arusha to four
times as much (217 per 1000) in Mbeya. Likewise, HIV prevalence varies from 2 percent in
Kigoma to 13.5 percent in Mbeya. Complete vaccination coverage varies from 37 percent in
Tabora to 90 percent inMorogoro. The fraction o f underweight children varies from 15 percent in
Mbeya to more than double that, 32 percent, in Tanga. At district level differences are even more
pronounced. Access to clean water varies from 7 percent in Sikonge to 99 percent inArusha MC.
Net enrollment rates vary from 97 percent inNgorongoro to 71 percent inMbulu.

3 1.    Implications. A number o f implications may be drawn from this update on poverty. First,
robust rural income growth i s required to ensure progress on poverty reduction. Next, at the
current rates o f rural income growth, it i s not evident whether Tanzania i s on a path o f sustained
poverty reduction. The projections suggest that poverty reduction inrural areas may be substantial
(in the optimistic scenario), but allow for the possibility that poverty reduction is minimal -
especially if agricultural growth overstates consumption growth in rural households and/or if
inequality i s worsening in rural areas. This uncertainty will remain unresolved unti1,results o f the
next HBS become available (preliminary results are expected for December 2007). Finally,
regional inequalities are high. Irrespective o f progress made in reducing national poverty
prevalence, inequalities between urban and rural areas and within rural areas deserve attention.
The observed inequalities in poverty incidence are in part a reflection o f differential opportunities
in the past. Many existing inequalities, and especially those in access to services, determine
opportunities for the next generation. With high inequality in access to services those born inthe
 `wrong' part o f the county are exposed to a substantially lower probability o f survival. And those
that do survive have a considerably larger probability o f ending up poor as they are more likely to
bemalnourished, unhealthy and uneducated.

                         111.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

32.      The National Strategy for Growth and Reduction o f Poverty, lmown as the MKUKUTA
(Mkakati wa Kukuza Uchumi na Kupunguza Umaskini Tanzania) was completed in June 2005 for
implementation over the period 2005-2010. It i s the successor to Tanzania's Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper. The MKUKUTA i s informed by Tanzania's vision 2025 and committed to the
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It has an increased focus on growth
and governance, and i s an instrument for mobilizing efforts and resources towards targeted poverty
reduction outcomes.

33.      The development o f the MKUKUTA started with the launch o f the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Review in October 2003, and resulted in the publication o f a new strategy in June 2005.
Consultations were undertaken within government and through nation wide consultations with
Parliament, civil society, faith based groups, private sector, districts and villages, and development
partners.   The process had three phases. In the first, over eighty stakeholders made detailed
submissions; the Association o f Local Authorities o f Tanzania led consultations in 42 districts and
168 villages; 500,000 questionnaires were distributed; and members o f Parliament were involved
through Parliamentary committees and seminars. After these, the first MKUKUTA draft was
prepared and sent to stakeholders for comments. After these consultations a second draft was
presented during Poverty Policy Week 2004 for comments. These were used to prepare the final
draft which was approved by Cabinet in February 2005.

34.      MKUKUTA is based on the principles o f national ownership, political commitment to
democratization and human rights, maintenance o f macroeconomic and structural reforms,
building on sector strategies and cross-sectoral collaboration, building local partnerships for
citizens to engage in policy dialogue, harmonization o f aid, equity and sharing o f benefits,
sustainable development, strengthening o f macroeconomic links and decentralization, and
mainstreamingcross-cutting issues.

35.      The strategy identifies three clusters o f broad outcomes: (i)growth and reduction o f
income poverty; (ii)improvement o f quality o f life and social well being, and (iii)good
governance. Each cluster has a set o f goals and targets. To achieve each target, interventions and
actions are identified. Annex 2 provides a summary o f MKUKUTA goals and targets in each o f
the three clusters.

Cluster I:Growth andReductionof Poverty
36.      This cluster is guided by the broad outcome o f achieving and sustaining broad based and
equitable growth. The reduction o f income poverty i s estimated to require sustained high GDP
growth o f at least 6-8 percent per annum over the next decade. T o achieve this, the focus o f the
MKUKUTA is on scaling up investments towards modernizing small, medium, and large scale
agricultural enterprises, promoting o f f farm activities including small and medium size enterprises
with emphasis on agro-processing, and promotingmore sustainable use o fnaturalresources for the
benefit o f poor communities.       The strategy gives attention to trade, services and markets,
infrastructure, and the creation o f a conducive environment to attract private investment. Support
to the fast growing sectors, tourism and mining, will be geared towards promotion o f employment.
The existing safeguards to protect the environment fkom degradation will be strengthened. The
cluster also aims at contributing to the quality o f life by ensuring reliable and sustainable energy
supplies.




                                                   9

Cluster 11:Quality of Lifeand Social Well-Being
37.      The quality o flife and social well beingcluster puts emphasis on outcomes that can reduce
vulnerability, and ensure access to quality services. Improving efficiency in the delivery o f social
services i s therefore given a special focus. Attention will be paid to the promotion o f a clean and
healthy environment and the sustainable use o f natural resources. The disparities between rich and
poor, persons with disabilities, across age groups, between urban and rural citizens in access and
use of social services will be minimized. The cluster has two broad outcomes: improved quality
o f life and social well being, with a focus on the poorest and vulnerable groups and reduced
inequalities across regions, income, age, gender, and disability.

Cluster111:GovernanceandAccountability
38.      In the governance and accountability cluster, the MKUKUTA focuses on four broad
outcomes: good governance and the rule o f law, accountability o f leaders and public servants to
the people, deepening democracy, political and social tolerance and cultivating and sustaining
peace, political stability, national unity and social cohesion. The cluster i s the bedrock for the first
and second clusters. For broad-based growth and improvement o f quality o f life and social well
being to take place, good governance has to prevail.           The focus on governance centers on
economic structures and use of public resources, natural resources, personal security, tolerance and
inclusion, and participation in decision making. Human rights and a fair justice system and war
against corruption are key elements in this cluster.         The cluster aims for effective public
administration so that systems o f government are managed openly and inthe interests o f the people
they serve.

           IV.      BANK SUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINKTO CAS
39.      The current Country Assistance Strategy for Tanzania was approved by the Bank's Board
on June 15, 2000. It sets out the framework for the Bank's support and focuses on facilitating
higher growth, reducing poverty, and undertaking institutional reforms to improve governance.
Government i s leading the preparation o f a Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) which i s currently
being finalized and which will be the coordinating framework for the Bank's and other
development partner's support to the implementation o f the MKUKUTA.

40.      The proposed PRSC i s consistent with the CAS which proposed focus o f lending and non-
lending in four areas o f strategic importance:

     0   Private sector and infrastructure development, so support the government's objective o f
         making the private sector the engine o f growth.

     0   Sustainable rural development, to improve the livelihood o f the majority o f the poor, who
         live inrural areas.

     0   Improved social infrastructure, to improve social indicators and enhance access to

41,      The CAS foresaw quick-disbursing policy-based lending operations in support o f overall
and sector reforms, and a shift to budget support contingent on sufficient progress in the areas o f

public expenditure management and governance. Based on these provisions in the CAS, the Bank
launched its PRSC support in 2003. The World Bank strategy foresaw a gradual increase in the
amount of World Bank resources provided inthe form o f PRSC support from the initial amount o f
US$ 132 million for PRSC-1 inFY04 to US$ 200 million for PRSC-4 inFY07.2 IDA debt relief
under the enhanced H P C initiative as well as under the MDRI facility are projected to amount
initially to about US$lOO million, but increase subsequently reflecting Tanzania's debt profile.

42.      The overall positive experience and substantive results achieved inrecent years support a
continuation of PRSC support. The draft o f the JAS prepared by government also draws on this
positive experience and envisages general budget support as a comer stone o f external support to
the implementation of the MKUKUTA. The transition from sectoral to general budget support
requires continued attention to sectoral concerns.      These relate to procurement and financial
management and are being addressed through the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
work, but some require greater attention. This includes enhancing the timeliness o f budget
releases, and strengthening the capacity for internal financial management and procurement to
prevent delays inthe implementationo f sector programs.

COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS
43.      The proposed credit i s provided in the context o f a common framework and joint review
process supported by a group o f fourteen donors3, providing for consistency o f policy dialogue and
reduction o f transaction cost. The GBS group i s currently chaired by Sweden. The responsibility
for the representation o f the group in high level dialogue with government, lies with the "Troika
plus", which consists o f the current chair, the past chair, and the incoming chair as well as the
World Bank. Responsibility for internal decision making lies with the "Heads o f Cooperation
Group", which includes the Heads o f all participating agencies. A "Coordination Group," which
consists o f representatives o f the "Troika plus" at the technical level as well as representatives of
key thematic groups on MKUKUTA monitoring, public expenditure, and governance, i s
responsible for leading the technical work o f the GBS group and for ensuring the linkages to other
processes in Tanzania. There are six technical working groups covering the six areas o f the PAF,
five  of which are chaired by bilateral donors. The working group on public expenditures i s chaired
bythe WorldBank. Finally, the GBS group is supportedby a permanent GBS secretariat.

44.       For FY07, the total commitments made by GBS donors (excluding PRSC-4 support)
amount to US$ 427 million. For FY08 and 2008/09, indicative commitments (excluding PRSC
support) amount to US$399 million and 43 1million, re~pectively.~(Annex 4)

45.       Within the new GBS framework, the IMF's PRGF and regular assessments o f Tanzania's
macro-economic performance serve as the main input for dialogue and assessments on policies
related to macroeconomic stability, thus avoiding multiple donor assessments in this area and
ensuring consistency o f policy dialogue.

46.      The current portfolio includes support for infrastructure (roads and energy), private sector
development, agriculture, community based development, financial sector, local government, and
public sector reform, education, health, HIV/AIDS, water, and environment. An Accountability,
Transparency andIntegrity Project i s expected to be presentedto the Board during FY06.

47.      The Bank's CAS seeks to exploit the comparative advantages and potential synergies of
the use o f various aid modalities, ranging from general budget support to specific investment
credits.  The forthcoming JAS i s expected to review the effectiveness o f the current aid
architecture and set out a framework for the use o f various aid modalities that would maximize aid
effectiveness.

48.      With respect to the achievements o f Tanzania's growth objectives, investment project
support in the areas o f roads and transport, energy, and water play an important role in supporting
the government's infrastructure investment program, while the PRSC supports the strengthening o f
the legal and regulatory environment for the effectiveness o f public infrastructure investments and
private sector participation. The PER process and analytic work such as the CEM and poverty
assessment play an important role in providing advice on strategic priorities and appropriate
government processes for the expansion o f infrastructure.

49.      The recently approved private sector competitiveness project and the privatization and
private sector development project support institutional reforms and capacity building to help
government realize its vision o f a private sector led economy.         PRSC support i s aimed at
leveraging these reforms and supporting complementary reform efforts in the area o f economic
growth, including the pursuito f continuedmacro-economic stability.

50.      Inthe social sectors, support is provided inthe context o f sector development programs in
health and secondary education. The Bank's project support has played an important role in
supporting institutional reforms in these sectors which provide the foundation for switching from
sector to general budget support.

51.      The Bank also supports a significant number o f environmental and natural resource
management projects. The Forest Conservation and Management project seeks to establish
institutional reforms for sustainable governance in the forest sector and promotes participatory
forest management. Similarly, the Marine and Coastal Environmental Management Project seeks
to establish policy and institutional reforms for sound governance o f offshore and nearshore
fishery resources and promotes collaborative fishery management programs and the setting up o f a
marine protected areas network. The proposed Agriculture Sector Development Project seeks to
promote sustainable agriculture, sustainable land and water management. The proposed Lake
Victoria Environmental Management Project 2 seeks to promote sustainable governance and
environmental management in the Lake Victoria and its surroundings. The support the PRSC-4
provides to government complements these sectoral programs by buildingthe capacity in the key
environmental agencies to monitor and screen investments, to reduce adverse effects and enhance
positive effects associated with sectoral policies and programs.

52.      The Bank's support to community based initiatives i s embedded in various projects such
as the Tanzania Social Action Fund, in the Participatory Agriculture Development Project, the
Forest Conservation and Management Project, the Marine Environment Project, and the
HIV/AIDS project. The bottom up approach supported by these projects complements the top-
down approach inherent in general budget support.

53.      Finally, the Bank also supports several public sector reform projects including the public
service reform project, the tax administration project, and the Local Government Support project
which provide technical assistance for the implementation o f reforms supported by the PRSC.

RESULTSOFPRSC-1TO PRSC-3
54.      The implementation o f Tanzania's first PRS was supported by a series o f three annual
PRSCs' during the period FY04-FY06.          Prior to that, Tanzania's reform program had been
supported by a structural adjustment credit6 (SAC, 1996-1998), and a Programmatic Structural
Adjustment Credit' (PASC 1, 2000-2004).         A Joint Evaluation o f General Budget Support to
Tanzania (JEBS)8was commissioned by government and the 14 budget support donors. It covers
the period 1995-2004 and assesses the impact o f budget support at five levels, ie., inputsby GBS
donors, immediate effects, outputs, outcomes, and impacts.

55.      Inthis section we review the impact o fthe financial support andrelatedpolicy dialogue of
the Bank's PRSC support in three areas, Le., macro-economic performance, public expenditures
and service delivery, and policy reforms in areas targeted by the PRSC. Since PRSC support has
been provided jointly with budget support by a group o f 13 other donors and in parallel to
development assistance through other modalities, the results discussed below are not exclusively
attributable to the Bank's PRSC support.

56.      Macro-economic impact.        General budget support has played an important role in
supporting government's efforts to maintain macro-economic stability while increasing public
expenditure to enhance access to social services and to invest in public infrastructure. In
particular, the availability o f general budget support has reduced the pressure to finance the
implementation o f the PRS through measures that could have jeopardized macro-economic
stability such as increased domestic or external non-concessional borrowing. Efforts by all
development partners to enhance the predictability o f budget support and to minimize year to year
fluctuations have also contributedto macro-economic stability.

57.      PRSC resources did not only support the implementation o f structural reforms and a
scaling up o f growth enhancing expenditures, but also exerted important demand side effects
which contributed to the acceleration in economic growth, which averaged 6.4 percent over the
period 2003-2005.     In this context it is important to highlight that prudent macro-economic
management and structural reforms carried out by government have allowed the economy to react
to the increase inaggregate demand with an expansion in domestic output and not with an increase
ininflation.

58.      General budget support and tax resources are close substitutes and there thus i s a danger
that increased budget support leads to a drop in revenue effort by the authorities. However, in
Tanzania government sustained its efforts to improve tax administration and the revenue to GDP
ratio actually increased from 12.1 percent in 2002/03 to 13.6 percent in 2004/05 through the
successful implementation o f a tax modernization program and tax policy measures such as the
new income tax act and measures to reduce and control tax exemptions.

59.      A significant share o f budget support tends to be spent on non-tradable goods and there is
thus concern that it may lead to an appreciation o f the real exchange rate and thus to a weakening
o f competitiveness o f the economy. This was not the case in Tanzania. IMF calculations o f
Tanzania's real effective exchange rate suggest that during the period under review, the real
effective exchange rate actually depreciated by about 35 percent betweenFY03 and FY06. This i s
partly the result of government's efforts to prevent an appreciation o f the exchange rate through
the accumulation o f international reserves which increased from US$ 1,670 million in FY03 to
US$ 2,137 in FY05. During the same period, the current account deficit (incl. current transfers)
widened from US$245.7 million to US$629.9 million.

60.      Impact on Public Expenditure and Service Delivey. PRSC fundingplayed an important
role in supporting increases in priority sector spending. Preliminary figures for 2004/05 suggest
that spending on education, health, water, roads, agricultural research and extension, the judiciary,
and HIV/AIDS has reached 14.6 percent in GDP compared to 10.2 percent in 2002/03. These
increases in public expenditure funded a significant expansion o f public service delivery. Most
notable among these are the increases in gross enrollment ratios over this period from 98 in 2002
to 110percent in 2005 for primary education, and from 9.7 percent in2002 to 15.9 percent in2005
for the four year lower secondary cycle. In the health sector, improvements in allocative and
technical efficiency and the greater availability o f financing at the district level also translated into
enhanced service delivery through increased availability o f drugs and other inputs at health
facilities. This contributed to the increase inutilization o f health facilities between 2002 and 2004
by 79 percent for out-patient visits and 95 percent for in-patients. Inthe road sector, the length o f
the road network under routine maintenance increased from 12405km in 2002 to 15015 km in
2004. Improvements in service delivery resulted in improved health and education outcomes, as
discussed inparagraph 28.

61.      Despite these achievements, the JEBS notes that the "challenge function" in the budget
process remains weak, mainly for political but also for more technical reasons. In addition, the
expected improvements in intra-government incentives and democratic accountability are not yet
apparent. However, the JEBS also notes that the scope for change in these respects has been
limited by the fact that 80 percent o f development spending i s still funded by donor projects. The
MKUKUTAtries to address these issues by emphasizing greater outcome orientation. This is also
carried over into reforms o f the budget process, including the development o f the strategic budget

allocation system and efforts to integrate more closely the MTEF and the public sector
management system, inorder to set appropriate incentives for greater efficiency and to enhance the
linkbetweenbudgetaryallocations and sectoralperformance.

of the budget with the agriculture sector development program.          Reforms in the sector have
contributed to the acceleration inagriculture sector growth which reached 6 percent in2004.

64.      Private Sector Development. Significant achievements in this area include the
rationalization o f the business licensing regime, including the abolition o f licensing fees for small
enterprises and the removal o f annual licensing requirements. A revised labor legislation i s
another important element o f the refoms undertaken as part o f Tanzania's efforts to improve the
functioning o f factor and product markets. Concrete outcomes in this area include an increase in
private sector investment from 11.4 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 13.2 percent in 2004, sustained
high levels o f foreign direct investment, which reached US$495 in 2004/05, and a broad based
acceleration in economic growth which since 2002 has been more than eight percent for the
manufacturing sector and above 11percent for the construction sector. Related to this, commercial
bank credit to the private sector grew by more than 30 percent every year since 2002/03.

65.      Macro Stabilitv. PRSC support focused on strengthening o f debt management and the
reform o f local government taxation including the approval and implementation o f the Loans,
Grants, and Guarantees Act and rationalization o f local taxes which were reduced to a clearly
defined list o f allowed revenue sources.

66.       Governance - Improve the performance o f the public sector. The focus o f PRSC support
in this area was on the implementation of the Public Sector Reform Program and achievements
including the development o f annual plans and performance budgets and service delivery surveys.
Based on these, government published the first "State o f the Public Service" reportg. The report
shows that citizens are increasingly satisfied with a number o f key public services (like primary
education) and that the economy i s perceived to be well managed. However, it also indicates that
levels o f dissatisfaction are still alarmingly high. Around 25 percent o f all clients are dissatisfied
with central government services and 50-75 percent with local government services.              Service
delivery i s still bureaucratic and there i s not much improvement in terms o f the timeliness o f
service delivery.

67.       Progress was also made with the implementation o f the mediumterm pay reformpolicy by
raising and decompressing real wages in the public sector. Pay increases were in the range o f 12-
 16percent, annually.

68.       Governance - Minimize resource leakages and strengthen accountabiliw. Among the key
reforms carried out in this area, the approval o f new procurement legislation and its
implementation are particularly noteworthy. The launching o f the Public Financial Management
Reform Program has been another important achievement and provides the basis for the well
coordinated deepening o f financial management reforms. The strengthening o f the Prevention o f
Corruption Bureau and the implementation o f Anti-comption strategies by MDAs are important
steps, although the revision o f anti-corruption legislation proceeded slower than expected and i s
now only expected to be completed by October 2006. Nonetheless, the impact o f these reforms

has been considerable. These improvements have been recognized in the 2004 HIPC assessment
with Tanzania being rated as one of two African countries meeting the largest number o f HIPC
benchmarks (11out 16, up from 8 in 2001). The governance indicators compiled by Kaufmann et
a1.l' suggest a significant improvement in Tanzania's ability to control corruption, moving from
the 15 percentile rank to the 36 percentile rank.

69.     Environment.        The major achievements include the passing o f the new National
Environmental Management Act, 2004, and the establishment o f an appropriate institutional
framework, which provides the basis for improved environmental management in the future. Other
achievements include completion o f analytical studies on (a) poverty and environment; (b) growth
and environment links; (c) Strategic Environmental Assessment o f PRSC; and (d) Public
Environmental Expenditure Review. The studies and their findings led to increased awareness o f
the linkages within the relevant institutions and initiation o f policy dialogue between the Vice
President's Office and relevant sectoral ministries having the mandate for natural resources
management. While capacity building for environmental management and sustainable natural
resources management remain challenges, several development partners and the Bank are
providing support to the key government institutions to address these priorities. There are ongoing
discussions regarding the potential for a Sector Wide Approach for environmental management
with an annual environmental review process in support o f implementing the National
Environmental Management Act.

70.     Povertv Monitoring; and Evaluation. The first series o f PRSCs supported a strengthening
of capacities for poverty monitoring and evaluation. Overall, the outputs generated by the poverty
monitoring system are substantial.            In addition to the annual PRS progress reports and the
preparation o f the MKUKUTA, Tanzania also prepared three Poverty and Human Development
Reports which provide an indepth assessment o f poverty inTanzania. The annual "Poverty Policy
Week" organized by the Vice President's Office has become an important forum for the dialogue
on progress in poverty reduction and related analytic work. Relatively less progress has been
made in strengthening Tanzania's routine data system, which will require sustained attention. An
additional challenge for government i s to ensure that the outputs o f the MKUKUTA monitoring
system are taken into account in the policy making process. The greater focus o f the new GBS
framework on the quality o f sector review processes i s intended to strengthen and support these
feedback mechanisms.

LESSONSLEARNED
71.     The preparation o f the new GBS fkamework involved a detailedreview by government and
development partners o f the experience with the previous Poverty Reduction Budget Support
arrangement, which covered PRSC-1 - PRSC-3,                   Government and development partners also
commissioned a Joint Evaluation o f budget support to Tanzania, which added an outside
perspective to the review process. A number o f important lessons emerged fkom these reviews,
which directly influenced the design o f the new GBS arrangement.

72.     Government ownership o f the reform agenda i s the single most important factor
determining the success o f reforms. The performance assessment fkamework has proven useful for
the monitoring o f reforms, but linking disbursement decisions to specific actions has been a two
edged sword. While in some cases this has helped to accelerate the pace o f reaching a specific

milestone, in other instances the accelerated pace may have reduced the time available to build
ownership and consensus among a broadrange o f stakeholders.

73.     The second critical factor has been capacity for the implementation o f reforms. It has
proven difficult to exactly determine ex ante capacity requirements and availability which has
sometimes led to slower than anticipated implementation o f reforms, even in cases where there
was apparent government ownership and commitment.

74.     Difficulties in predicting the time needed to develop genuine domestic ownership for
reforms as well as the capacity constraints have led to a situation, where a detailed performance
assessment framework has over time not fully captured the pace and direction o f reforms. Insome
areas, significant progress has been made on issues not reflected in the PAF, but which were
nonetheless critical to achievingthe targeted results.

75.     The detailed PAF underpinning the first three PRSCs has also led to a focus on whether
actions contained in the PAF have been completed or not, with relatively less dialogue on results
and limited flexibility to acknowledge changingpriorities or strategies.

76.     Budget support has enhanced the scope for domestic accountability by putting donor
resources under the same budget process as domestic resources. However, the policy dialogue
related to the PAF was by some considered to reduce the scope for domestic accountability, as it
was primarily a dialogue between government and a group o f donors, with little direct input from
other stakeholders.

77.     Related to this i s also the issue that the PRBS framework hadno direct linkages to existing
sectoral processes, which in the best case led to duplication o f dialogue and monitoring, but also
carried the risk o f conflicting policy messages.

78.     The above lessons suggested a monitoring framework that i s less prescriptive and which
does not try to micro manage government's reform agenda. They also underline the importance o f
linking PRSC support more strongly to domestic processes as a means to support government
accountability to local stakeholders. This point has also been highlighted by several pieces o f
analytic work discussed inthe next section.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
79.      The PRSC rests on a wide program o f analytic work carried out by government, local and
international academic and research institutes and NGOs, and various donors and the Bank. This
section highlights five areas o f analytic work that have helped inform the redesign of the General
Budget Support Facility for Tanzania, i.e., (i)the political economy o f reform, (ii)     drivers o f
growth and poverty reduction, (iii)     natural resource management, (iv) fiduciary issues, and (v)
capacity development.

80.     Political Economy of Reform.         Work in this area aimed at a better understanding o f
factors that facilitate or hinder reforms in Tanzania and included a study on the "Drivers o f
Change" and a "Political Economy" study supported by the Tanzanian Governance Working
Group (GWG). The "Political Economy" report points to the comprehensive crosscuttingreforms
that government has embarked on and acknowledge that such profound changes will take time to
bear major results. It also highlights a positive context within which these reforms are being
implemented including a strong executive.           However, this needs to be counterbalanced by
enhancing the capacity o f the other branches o f government, the legislative and the judiciary. At


                                                    18

present, the popular voice inthe public policy arena including inParliament, local government and
civil society is rather weak. Policy making i s top down and i s influenced by donors, investors, and
technocrats. The report also concludes that bureaucratic will plays a strong role in implementing
policy reforms and possibly less so the political will. However, it i s unlikely that major reforms
could be implemented in the absence o f the latter. Inorder to establish a balance, more attention
should be paid to non-state and popular institutions which perform oversight functions in the
governance process.

81.      The "Drivers of Change" study concludes that in practice it i s domestic political factors
which exert a dominant influence over policy with a relatively smaller role o f donors. However,
its reaches similar conclusions and makes comparable recommendations also aiming at further
strengthening domestic accountability processes, including strengthening Parliament and its
Committees, more effective dissemination o f information at the national and local level, continued
decentralization, and strengthening and formalizing the rules controlling Presidentialpowers, so as
to safeguard the independence o f the judiciary and the civil service and clarify the role o f District
Commissioners in relation to Local Government Authorities, and opening up space for new voices
inParliament andLocal Government.

82.      Drivers of Growth and Poverty Reduction. A study on "Sustaining and Sharing Growth"
carried out by the World Bank in cooperation with the Ministry for Planning, Economy, and
Empowerment, and the third "Poverty and Human Development Report" preparedby the Research
and Analysis Working Group provide in depth analysis and recommendations related to growth
and poverty reduction in support o f the implementation o f Tanzania's MKUKUTA. The studies
underline the need to focus on rural development and raising agricultural productivity as the most
direct means to reduce poverty in Tanzania. Poor infrastructure, especially the very limited
network o f all-year passable rural roads to facilitate market access and an unreliable power supply
inurban areas, are the main constraints to faster growth. Furthermore they highlight the need for
improved governance o f Tanzania's Natural Resources, to ensure their sustainable exploitation and
that benefits are shared widely with the Tanzanian population.             Another important issue
highlighted by these studies i s the need to enhance productivity, innovation, and technological
change as a key driver o f structural change in Tanzania. The studies also suggest measures to
facilitate the contribution o f the poor to economic growth, including measures to reduce
vulnerability and risk. The World Bank also prepared a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, which
provided recommendations for enhancing Tanzania's export competitiveness. The Investment
Climate Assessment carried out in 2003 i s being followed up with an rural investment climate
assessment with a focus on micro and small enterprises inrural areas.

83,      Natural Resource Management.            In an effort to mainstream the environmental
sustainability dimension into the PRSC process, the Bank has supported the analysis o f linkages
between key macro and structural reforms policies and the environment. This analysis identifies
measures at both national and local government levels to reduce poverty and enhance
environmental sustainability o f policy reforms. The analysis concluded that environment and
poverty are linked in three major ways: (a)poverty reduction programs should not damage the
resource base and the environment o f which poor depend for their livelihoods (b) improving
environmental conditions can help to reduce poverty and promote sustainable pro-poor growth;
and (c) mitigating measures may be necessary as part o f policy dialogue.

84.      The analysis o f linkages between growth and environment revealed that (a) under-pricing
of resources not allowing capture o f resource rents; (b) weak environmental governance systems;
and (c) limitedknowledge o f stocks, their values and changes over time are serious constraints to


                                                   19

achieving sustainability o f natural resources based growth. Tanzania's portfolio of agriculture,
forestry, fisheries (both marine and freshwater) assess these issues indepth and specific policy and
institutional reforms are under development to address priority issues.

85.      Fiduciary Work. In the context o f Tanzania's government led, participatory Public
Expenditure Review process, a wide variety o f analytical activities are carried out every year. This
includes the Bank-led preparation o f the annual Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
Report (PEFAR), whose findings have been presented during the PER Consultative Meeting in
M a y 2005. The PEFAR combines analytic work that was previously carried out inthe context o f
the annual PER external evaluation and the Country Fiduciary Accountability Assessment.              A
CPAR was completed in 2003 and implementation o f reforms has been monitored under the
PRSC. In FY06, the PEFAR will include an update o f the CPAR with a detailed review o f the
procurement reforms undertaken to date.        Technical assistance for the implementation o f the
recommendations o f the PEFAR and the CPAR i s being provided through a Public Finance
Management Reform Program, while policy dialogue takes place in the context o f the PEFARand
GBS program.

86.      Public expenditure tracking surveys (PETS) have become an important instrument to
diagnose weaknesses in Tanzania's public expenditure management system. The latest PETS"
was carried out in 2004 and focused on the primary education development program. It reported
relatively high discrepancies between central level disbursements and inflows reported by schools,
amounting to 46 percent o f the capitation grants and 15 percent o f the development grants,
Subsequent audits o f the Primary Education Program carried out by Deloitte in 2004 and 2005
express a qualified   opinion due to a large number o f procedural irregularities, highlighting the
need to improve bank reconciliation, open and maintain asset and imprest registers, have better
documentation supporting school construction and procurement contracts, have better file
organization, improve the frequency o f internal audit, and ensure that proper codes are entered in
accounting records etc. at both the national and local level. However, the audit reports do not
quote a single instance o f willful misuse or misappropriation and noted improvements in audit
opinions in 2005. Improvements in financial management practices in Local Councils are also
evident inthe latest audit report on Local Councils issued by the Auditor General for 2004/05.

87.      The fiduciary work focusing on government's financial and procurement systems was
complemented by several studies on accountability from the perspective o f Members o f Parliament
and from the grassroots level.I2 The study by Mmari and Sundet based on interviews with
Members o f Parliament suggests that Parliament largely exercises informal influence on the budget
although it has demonstrated the ability to influence some budget allocations. MPs are assessedby
voters on their ability to provide tangible resources. Also, although MPs believe that donors wield
immense influence, the landmark budget decisions examined indicate that the Executive has the
greatest influence over the budget.

88.       Capacity Constraints. Analytic work has also started to take a closer look at capacity
issues which are recognized as a serious constraint to the implementation o f Tanzania's
MKUKUTA. The health sector has carried out several studies on human resources, as it is
particularly hard hit by a shortage o f medical staff which i s aggravated by international demand for
health professionals, low remuneration relative to other professions, and HIV/AIDS. The Public
Sector Reform Programand the Local Government ReformProgram also include analytic work on
capacity issues that underpin measures to strengthen capacity.        The focus o f these programs i s
specifically to enhance the performance o f the public service through enhancing its capacity for
improved service delivery. As reforms eliminate policy induced distortions to growth and poverty
reduction, capacity issues become increasingly the binding constraint to service delivery,
especially in the context o f a potential scaling up o f aid. Additional work in this area would thus
be warranted and as part o f the preparation o f Tanzania's JAS, a task force under the leadership o f
PO-PSM i s preparing an issues paper on capacity development to guide work inthis area.


                       V.       THE PROPOSEDTANZANIA PRSC-4

OPERATION DESCRIPTION
89.       The proposed poverty reduction support operation (PRSC-4) i s the first in a series o f five
annual operations supporting the implementation o f the National Strategy for Growth and
Reduction o f Poverty. Duringthe Annual Review held in October 2005 - under the leadership o f
government and with the participation o f 14 GBS donors - the new GBS framework in support o f
Tanzania's MKUKUTA was finalized.              The framework includes a Partnership Framework
Memorandum (PFM), a Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), as well as an agreed Joint
Review Process.

90.       The PFM (Annex 3) spells out the objectives and underlying principles for the provision
of general budget support to Tanzania as well as the 'responsibilities o f government and
development partners. It defines the GBS facility as a five-year program to support the
implementation of Tanzania's MKUKUTA. The principles set out in the PFM seek to
operationalize various international commitments, including the Monterrey Consensus on
Financing for Development (2002), the Rome Declaration on Aid Harmonization (2003), the
Marrakech Memorandum on Managing for Results (2004), the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness (2005) and the Tanzania Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) aiming at providing more
scope for government ownership, better alignment and integration o f donor support with
government priorities and systems, and more predictability o f donor support.

91.       The new PAF (Annex 3), discussed in more detail below, differs significantly from the
previous one. It covers six focus areas. These are the three clusters o f the MKUKUTA (ie.,
growth and the reduction o f income poverty, improvements o f quality of life and social well being,
and governance and accountability), macroeconomic stability, resource allocation and budget
consistency, and public financial management. In line with the government objective o f a more
strategic, focused and streamlined PAF that i s supportive of the outcome orientation o f the
MKUKUTA and o f domestic processes, it focuses primarily on defining a small number o f
indicators that would allow an assessment o f overall progress and the definition of local processes,
that would provide the forum for in depth policy dialogue on which the GBS facility would draw.
Inaddition to the reference to sectoral and thematic review processes and results indicators, the
PAF also includes a small number o f specific actions to monitor progress in areas where no
sufficiently mature processes for regular dialogue exist as yet.

  Box 1. Tanzania's New PerformanceAssessment Framework andthe GoodPractice Principlesfor
                                                  Conditionality


InSeptember 2005, the Development Committee endorsed 5 good practice principles for conditionality. The
new Tanzanian performance assessment framework represents a practical example o f their application.

Reinforce country ownership. The program supported by the Bank's PRSC builds on the 2005-2010
MKUKUTA that was prepared in a participatory process by government. The Bank has actively supported
and encouraged the government in this process. Moreover, analytic work undertaken by the Bank in
collaboration with government and other donors and domestic stakeholders has informed the process o f
redesigning the government's framework for budget support, including work o n the political economy o f
reforms, growth, and fiduciary issues.

Agree up-front with government and financial partners on a coordinated accountability framework.
The performance assessment framework (PAF) for general budget support has been developed under
government leadership. Under a memorandum o f understanding signed by all budget support donors and the
government, it constitutes the single and coherent framework for evaluating progress, setting out results
indicators, selected policy actions, and review processes.

Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances.
The PAF and the underlying MKUKUTA represent country circumstances and preferences. Government
leadership in setting up the review process for the PAF also resulted in a review cycle that reflects the
country's own cycles - such as sector reviews, public expenditure reviews and budget preparation cycles -
and timing o f financing needs. Detail and size o f the PAF are a representation o f the country's circumstances
interms o fcapacity andmaturityofdialogue, includinginthe sectors.

Choose only actions criticalfor achievingresults as conditions for disbursements.The new PAF focuses
on a few critical actions, outcomes o f sectoral reviews, and outcome indicators to measure progress under the
program. It thus avoids the inclusion o f a host o f actions as benchmarks that was perceived as burdensomeby
government and donors and made the previous PAF heavily focused on inputs.The Bank relies on the PAF to
identify a few actions and sector reviews as critical for measuring progress. The inclusion o f outcome
indicators in the PAF and their link with the MKUKUTA outcome indicators and monitoring framework
ensures a close monitoring o f results under the revised PAF.

Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support,The PAF review cycle is closely aligned withthe budget cycle. The annual review inOctober allows
donors to make fm financing decisions for the following fiscal year (beginning in July) before budget
allocations are set. It thus allows for a high level o f short-term predictability. Harmonized reviews also reduce
the transaction costs for the government (i.e., by reducing the number o f separate mission). The Bank i s hlly
respecting the new review calendar. Based o n the Bank's evaluation o f progress under the PAF, financing
decisions are made based on performance and announced sufficiently early to avoid disruptions in budget
implementation.




92.      The GBS review process consists o f one joint GBS Annual Review typically held in
October, in alignment with Tanzania's budget process. Figure 3 shows the integration o f the GBS
Annual Review with other review processes and the budget preparation process. Sectoral and
thematic reviews are expected to precede the GBS Annual Review. Once a credible MKUKUTA
Cluster review process has been established, it i s expected that the individual reviews will feed
into it, which in turn will feed into the GBS Annual Review. However, for the time being, the
sector and thematic reviews feed directly into the GBS Annual Review, which provides two inputs


                                                          22

to the budget guidelinesprocess. First, it provides feedback from GBS donors on strategic issues
for consideration in the budget guidelines process. Second, it provides a firm commitment o f the
amount o f GBS for the next fiscal year to allow government to prepare its budget within a
relatively stable and firmexternal financing framework.

Benefits

93.      The proposed operation would support the government to pursue its policy objectives laid
out in the MKUKUTA by providing financing for the government's FY07 budget. It would also
provide the incentives to implement key economic, social and institutional reformto strengthen the

2010, it i s expected that the reform program under the series o f five annual PRSCs (PRSC-4 -
overall performance o f the economy and contribute to poverty alleviation. Over the period 2006-

PRSC-8) would help the government sustain highrates o f economic growth in the range o f 6 - 8
percent annually, which are projected to translate into a significant reduction o f poverty incidence.
It would also help the government in making progress toward reaching the MDGs, namely,
increase school enrollment and literacy rates, reduce child and maternal mortality, increase access
to safe water, and strengthen the sustainability o f development efforts.


New PerformanceAssessmentFrameworkfor PRSC-4 - 8

94.      Background. Inthe 2004 annual review o f the PRBSPRSC it was decided to start work
on a new PAF and a redesign o f the PRBS. The process was guided by a set o f objectives
formulated by government:

         Ensure better coherence with national policy as described inthe MKUKUTA;

         Reduce transaction costs for government and development partners;

         Draw on government's own processes to ensure transparency and accountability to
         domestic stakeholders;
         Increase government ownership, by avoiding the use o f conditionality as policy leverage
         and instead focus on due process (budget formulation, execution and reporting and
         auditing);
         Have a common approach for all budget support Development Partners including the PAF,
         review times, shared analysis and assessment, shared commitment to provide foreign
         assistance commitments prior to the start o f the fiscal year and to fkontload the support;

         Establish a PAF with simpler and fewer actions that are outcome oriented;




                                                  23

         Establish a structure o f tranches that i s responsive to overall performance rather than
         focusing on conditionality and specific actions; and
         Facilitate a transfer from sector financing to GBS by linking sector dialogue with the
         general GBS dialogue.
95.      A task force with representatives from government and development partners and headed
by the Commissioner for Policy and Analysis (Ministry o f Finance) met regularly since December
2004 to produce a draft PAF based on agreed principles and regular feedback from government
and development partners and agreed guidelines. A final draft was presented prior to the Annual
Review 2005 (AR05). One o f the tasks for each Thematic Group during AR05 was to facilitate
sector/cluster discussion and refinement o f the outcome indicators.

96.      Overall Purpose of the PAF Matrix.         The Performance Assessment Framework i s a
framework for annual dialogue on government's and development partners' (DP) performance in
achieving the targets set out in the MKUKUTA, and for development partners to ensure that the

the framework o f the PAF, the Bank retains flexibility to select - in consultation with government
GBS funds are spent in a responsible manner. As i s the case for other participating donors, within

and other GBS donors - specific benchmarks and form an independent judgment as to whether
significant progress has been made. However, all involved parties encourage minimizing such
differences which, if left unchecked, would undermine efficiency objectives and predictability o f
resource flows. The PAF consists o f outcome indicators, underlying processes, and temporary
actions whose role and purpose i s described inthe followingparagraphs.

97.      Outcome indicators. The overall purpose o f the outcome indicators i s to serve as a basis
for an overall assessment o f performance on macroeconomic stability, poverty reduction and
public expenditure and financial management.         The PAF indicators will be a subset o f the
MKUKUTA indicators. Since the MKUKUTA indicators are only expected to be finalized during
the first half o f 2006, the PAF indicators will be adjusted in line with related MKUKUTA
indicators inorder to avoid deviatingbenchmarks and/or duplicating processes.

98.      The following criteria have been suggested for outcome indicators:
           Consistency with the MKUKUTApolicy matrix;
           Reflection o f a MKUKUTA outcome or goal;
           Be o f a quantitative nature;
           Have baseline information available;
           Bemeasuredon an annualbasis;
           Have annual targets;
           Be Specific, Measurable, Attributable, Realistic and Targeted (SMART);
           Draw upon good quality data, that i s precise, reliable, timely, integer and valid;
           Give a good indication o f overall progress inthe cluster; and
           Are Consistent with cluster plans.


99.      Underlying Processes. The purpose o f the identification o f underlying processes i s to
establish a clear link between the GBS as a funding mechanism and these processes as the forum
for dialogue and assessment o f government's performance in the sectors covered by the
PAFNKUKUTA, using existing national processes. The underlying processes are therefore
complementary to the outcome indicators.




                                                  24

100.    For the MKUKUTA Clusters (section 1,2 and 3 in the PAF), the main underlying process
will be the MKUKUTA review. Until this process is in place, sector reviews will be the main
source o f information on government's performance in the clusters. The following definition o f a
"satisfactory sector reviews" has been agreedbetween development partners and government:

     1. Reviews are conducted regularly as input to the budget preparation process and in line
        with the MKUKUTAMonitoring Plan;
    2. Review processes involve a wide range o f stakeholders under the leadership o f the
        government;
    3.   The main purpose of reviews i s to establish relevant developments, and assess
        performance against agreed results and targets;
    4. Information and analysis for the Annual Review will be drawn primarily from the
        MKUKUTA monitoring system in particular the MKUKUTA Annual Implementation
        Report and other reviews process outlined inthe PAF; and
    5. The review shows good progress against agreed targets and results.

101.    The GBS assessment will deal in priority with those sectors which have put in place the
necessary conditions for reviews to take place, and be based on an agreed timetable as to which
sector reviews will be identified for GBS assessment in the coming period. Interim
measures/indicators will be needed for sectors not currently coveredby adequate review processes,
with the intention that such reviews should be developed as soon as possible. Duringthe annual
review 2005 there was agreement so far on the need for reviews inWater, Health, Infrastructure,
Education and Agriculture.

102.     Temporary ProcessActions. This column serves two purposes:

     1) Still outstanding issues from the midyear review 2005/old PAF
     2) A limited number o f actions in areas where underlying processes are not yet in place,
        including suggestions on how to establish credible underlying processes.

103.    Once an outstanding issue has been resolvedor an underlying process been established the
corresponding action inthe column would be removed.

OVERVIEW OF POLICY AREAS
104.    The Performance Assessment Framework covers the three main clusters o f the
MKUKUTA, i.e., growth and reduction of income poverty, improvements o f quality of life and
social well being, and governance and accountability. In addition, the PAF also covers macro
economic stability, resource allocation and budget consistency, and public financial management,
which are recognized inthe MKUKUTA as critical areas for its successful implementation. Table
4 provides an overview o f the specific MKUKUTA goals supported in each o f the six areas as
well as the underlyingstrategic frameworks and processes and reform priorities.

SUMMARY OF QUANTITATIVETARGETS
105.     Table 5 summarizes the quantitative results targeted in the individual areas o f the
PAF. These indicators will be reviewed and adjusted once the MKUKUTA indicators are
available to ensure fill alignment. Most o f the processes on which the GBS framework
draws have well developed results frameworks, which provide a more complete assessment
of progress made inindividual areas. The indicators contained inthe PAF serve as a guide
to the overall assessment, which, however, will also need to be informed by the more
detailed assessments at the sector level.

DESCRIPTIONOFPOLICY AREAS
106.     This section provides some background on each area as well as an outline o f the
government strategy as presented inthe MKUKUTA. This i s followed by a discussion o f progress
under PRSC-4, processes for dialogue and assessment in each area, as well as monitoring
indicators, W e also highlight specific actions which are included in the PAF inthose areas, where
mature sector review process are not yet in place. It i s envisaged that government will develop
adequate review processes in all areas. This would allow the GBS instrument to rely entirely on
these processes for the assessment o f progress.
MKUKUTA Implementation:Custer 1 GrowthandReductionof IncomePoverty
                                              -
Background.

Reduction o f poverty requires sustained high growth rate o f GDP o f at least 6 - 8 percent per
107.     The MKUKUTA aims at achieving and sustaining broad-based and equitable growth.

annum over the next decade. In this regard, focus will be on scaling up investments towards
modemising small, medium and large-scale agriculture for increased productivity and profitability,
promoting off-farm activities, including small and medium size enterprises with particular
emphasis on agro-processing. The strategy also gives particular attention to trade, services and
marketing infrastructure, and creating a conducive environment to attract private investment.
Support to the fast growing sectors like tourism and mining will be scaled up and geared towards
promotion o f employment and appropriate labour relations. The existing safeguards will be
strengthened to protect the environment from undue depletion caused by such activities. The
MKUKUTAlists six specific goals for this Cluster:

     0   Ensuringsound economic management.
     0   Promoting sustainable and broad-based growth.
     0   Improving food availability and accessibility.
     0   Reducingincome poverty o fbothmen and women inrural areas.
     0   Reducingincome poverty o fbothmen and women inurban areas.
     0   Provision o freliable and affordable energy to consumers.

Reform Strategy.

 108.    Reforms supported and monitored under PRSC-4 focus primarily on private sector
 development and rural development, in continuation o f reform efforts supported by previous
 PRSCs.     A key strategy for sustaining high economic growth i s improving the business
 environment through the Business Environment Strengthening in Tanzania (BEST) program,
 which has now been under implementation for more than a year. A central element o f these
reforms i s the improvement o f the business licensing regime, which according to "Doing Business
 in2006" is the most cumbersome worldwide. The objective is to move from arevenue generating
 licensing regime to a self financing registration regime. Initial reforms in 2004/05 eliminated
 annual licensing requirements and made obtaining a business license for small businesses free o f
 cost. The reforms now aim at broader reforms o f the licensing regime including a new Business
 Activities Registration Act and reform o f the sectoral legislation that also contains licensing
 requirements.

 109.    Government i s also reforming factor markets for land and labour. Labour legislation
 reform i s being carried out in two Phases. Phase Ifocused on reforming legislation related to
 employment relations, collective labor relations, dispute resolution, and labor market institutions



                                                 29

and has been completed. Phase 2 focuses on the revision o f legislation related to occupational
safety and health, workers compensatiodsocial security, and employment promotion. Inparallel
to the legislative changes, government i s also reforming labour market institutions.

110.     Rural and agricultural development are guided by Tanzania's rural and agricultural
development strategies, with implementation o f the Agriculture Sector Development Strategy
(ASDS) through the Agriculture Sector Development Programme (ASDP). K e y reforms supported
by the PRSC include the alignment of public expenditure in the agriculture sector with the
priorities set out in the ASDP and the reform o f crop boards with the aim of improving Tanzania's
competitiveness inthe respective crops. Another important area o f reformrelates to improving the
security o f land rights to increase on-farm investment.         After changes to the Land Acts,
government has developed a strategic plan for the implementation o f the Land and Village Land
Act, which prioritizes the implementation o f the Acts, including land surveys and titling o f land.
These reform efforts are supported in urban areas by the "Property and business formalization
program" which was launched in October 2004 and which provides a broader framework for
converting "dead capital'' such as untitled land into economic assets.

111.     Improving economic infrastructure, especially transport and power, i s another focus area
of the MKUKUTA, underpinned by recent analytic work such as the C E M and the ICA. Initial
structural reforms such as the establishment o f TANROADS as an executive agency with
responsibility for trunk roads, the operation o f TANESCO through a management contract, and the
establishment o f legislation for a strengthened, multisectoral regulatory framework have provided
the basis for scaling up infrastructure expenditure. The next steps in the reform process are the
revision o f the Roads Act and the Electricity Act to clarify institutional responsibilities in these
sectors and making the regulatory agencies fully operational. Inaddition, government also plans to
commission an infrastructure expenditure review, which would help to ensure that expenditures
are properly prioritized and that there i s an appropriate balance betweenrecurrent and maintenance
cost.

Progress under PRSC-4

112.     Private Sector Development. Tanzania continued with reforms o f the business licensing
regime. A BusinessActivities Registrationbill was submittedto Parliamentand read for the
first time inParliamenton 27`hJuly, 2005.13 It has now been widely distributed for stakeholder
comments.      The bill i s a significant attempt to facilitate business entry by streamlining and
simplifying start-up procedures for businesses and eliminates the multiplicity o f regional and
national licenses by introducing a single registration certificate. It also eliminates the necessity to
renew licenses on an annual basis as well as activity specific fee schedules.           In addition, it
provides for the creation o f a universal national business data base o f registered businesses. It i s
expected that a number o f weaknesses o f the bill will be addressed in the course o f stakeholder
consultations prior to the second reading in Parliament.         The operationalization o f the new
companies act was achieved in March 2006, filling major gaps such as insolvency procedures,
accounting reporting requirements, corporate Governance, etc which lays the foundation for
reducing the cost o f doing business inTanzania.

113.     Progress was also made inthe preparation o f the Private Sector Development Strategy and
an inception report has been submitted and discussed by a special task force under the leadership
o f the Ministry o f Planning, Economy, and Empowerment (MPEE). Delays have occurred in the


l3 Prior action


                                                   30

submission o f the Phase IIlabour legislation (covering occupational safety and health, workers
compensatiodsocial security, and employment promotion). The delays are a result o f capacity
constraints, while government remains committed to these reforms. The next step in the process i s
the review o f the Social Security Bill by the Labour Social Economic Commission prior to the
submission to Parliament. Capacity constraints have also held up the development o f an M&E
system for BEST, the SME policy, and the private sector development strategy. The TORSfor the
development of the M&E system have been revised to incorporate benchmarks o f the Regulatory
Compliance Cost Survey and work started inDecember 2005.

114.     Rural Development. A Cabinet decision on the reform of crop boards taken in June 2005
identified the key elements o f the reform agenda: (i) abolish the levy which financed the running
costs o f the boards, to be replaced with budget financing; (ii) the crop development funds;
                                                                 abolish
(iii)improve the quality of extension; and (iv) undertake further analysis on some specific
elements o f reform such as review of one license rule in coffee industry. Subsequently, a draft
Action Plan detailing the steps for the implementation of the Cabinet decision was developed by
the government and was circulatedto a broader set o f stakeholders on October 12, 2005. To date,
as part of the implementationof the action plangovernment has issued a Ministerialcircular
for crop boards to stop charging levieslcess as of July lst, 2006.14 In addition, the circular
establishes that licenses will only have to be issued once and that no license fee shall be charged,
that crop boards shall be responsible for regulatory functions and that the crop boards prepare
strategic plans which provide a detailed account o f the crop boards' functions, manning levels, and
financial requirements.     With regard to the participation o f crop boards in crop promotion
functions, these are to be shared with the private sector and thus appropriate boundaries in
executing these functions as well as an appropriate institutional framework for executing these
functions and the mechanism for their financing and accountability have to be agreed by
stakeholders. Finally, the circular also stops the charging o f crop levy for crop development funds.
In case stakeholders agree that crop development funds should continue or be established, they
will have to agree on financing, management and accountability issues. Ministerial orders to
remove the blind auction, to discontinue the input voucher programme, and to open up coffee
cherry buying to those who invest in common pulperies will also be issued. Subsequent
amendments to at least two Crop Board Acts are planned to be submitted to Parliamentby October
2006.

 115.    There has been slow progress in aligning the budgets o f the Agriculture Sector Lead
Ministries with the Agriculture sector development priorities. Further analytical work to guide
future allocations to input subsidies, the agricultural input trust fund, and the strategic grain
reserve (SGR) are being initiated, together with a more general agricultural sector public
expenditure review.

 116.    Implementation of the Strategic Planfor the Implementationof the LandAct andthe
Village Land Act (SPILL) started in May 2005.15 During2004/5 11,693 farms were surveyed
with the issue o f 537 Certificates of Customary Rights o f Occupancy (CCRO) and duringthe first
half of FY06 another 378 CCROs were issued. The current target for the 2005/6 financial year i s
to survey 2,500 individual farms, with the issuance o f 834 CCRO. These activities constitute
pilots which already were successful in: (i)  training district land officials and Village Councils to
demarcate village boundaries and issue Village Land Certificates (VLCs); (ii)training district
officials and village land committees to demarcate boundaries o f individually held land (without

                                                    to
VLCs. Production of VLCs and CCROs was not the primary objective o f the pilot but mainly a
spin-off from the piloting. As application for CCROs i s voluntary, the number o f CCROs issued i s
a proxy for implementation of the pilot, and not as an outcome against which success o f the pilot
should be measured. The pilot, initially contained in Mbozi district, was so successful that it i s
already being scaled up inat least 3 more districtsh addition, there has been further dissemination
of the strategic plan to villages, districts, and regions.

Mechanismsfor Dialogue and Assessment
117.    Existing processes for dialogue and assessment under this cluster are fragmented and
incomplete. However, the Ministry o f Planning, Economy and Empowerment i s developing a
coordinated approach around the growth theme. Among the existing processes are the PER macro
group, the Parastatal Reform Commission Programme review, and the Tax Modernization
Programme review. The key process that government intends to develop in this area refers to the
development of a dialogue on a growth strategy. Other important processes for dialogue and
assessment that government i s committed to develop includes an infrastructure review
(encompassing the roads, energy, and communication and transport sectors), an agriculture sector
review, a BEST programme review, and a Second Generation Financial Sector Reforms
Programme review. Each of these reviews i s intended to further guide the budget process and
contribute to an overall assessment o fperformance within the cluster.

Monitorable Actions under PRSC-5
118.     Since adequate review processes have yet to be developed in this area, the PRSC will for
the time being continue to monitor progress inthe implementation o f key reforms. Government i s
committed to (a) put in place the agreed sector review processes, (b) amend the Civil Procedure
Code (CPC); (c) consider private sector views prior to submitting the Business Activities
Registration (BAR) Bill for the second reading and reform the Regulatory Licensing Regime;
submit to Parliament the (d) draft Roads Act and (e) the draft Electricity Act, make EWURA
(Energy, Water, and utility Regulatory Authority) and SUMATRA (Surface & Marine Transport
Regulatory Authority) fully operational and staffed; (f) amend legislation for at least two crops
Boards; (g) land surveys and issuance o f CCROs; (h) and formulate a government position on the
SGR, Input Trust Fund and Input subsidies based on the recommendations o f studies on these
issues to be commissioned by government.

MKUKUTAImplementation:Custer 2 -QualityofLife andSocial WellBeing

Background

120.      The government recognizes the central role o f social service sectors in achieving the
goal o f improving the quality o f life and social well-being. Efforts have been made to increase
expenditure on pro-poor social services, but reaching the NSGRP objectives will require
significantly increased levels o f funding. The NSGRP puts emphasis on the desired outcomes that


                                                    32

can effectively reduce vulnerability. Greater attention will be paid to equity and quality issues in
the delivery o f social services recognizing the role of LGAs as the primary providers of services at
the local level. The disparities between the rich and poor, across age groups and between urban
and rural citizens in access to and use o f social services will be minimized. The strategy on the
non-income side of the poverty reduction strategy will be guided by the following goals:

        Ensuringequitable access to qualityprimary and secondary education for boys and girls,
        universal literacy among women and men and, expansion and quality improvement o f
        higher, technical and vocational education;

        Improved survival, health and well-being of all children and women and of especially
        vulnerable groups;

        Increased access to clean, affordable and safe water, sanitation, decent shelter and a safe
        and sustainable environment and thereby, reduced vulnerability from environmental risk;

        Adequate social protection and rightso f the vulnerable and needy groups with basic needs
        and services; and

        Effective systems to ensure universal access to quality and affordable public services.

Reform Strategy.

121,       Education. Government developed an Education Sector Development Program (ESDP)
framework in 2000 to guide the development and implementation of sub-sector programs. The
first sub-sector program developed under the ESDP was the Primary Education Development
Program (PEDP) launched in 2001. This program has been successful in improving primary
education. Initially, the PEDP implementation focus was on expanding enrolment, classroom
construction, teacher engagement and deployment. In 2004, the government launched the
Secondary Education Development Programme (SEDP). The objective i s primarily to increase
enrolment of boys and girls in secondary education including expanding opportunities for children
from poor families and children with disabilities. The key issues going forward inthe primary and
secondary sub-sector programs are:

   (1)  Improve the teaching and learning environments at all levels. Inparticular, more emphasis
        will be given to improving the quality o f pre-service training o f teachers; establishing and
        strengthening systems for in-service training; better management and supply o f teaching
        and learning materials; and system-wide management improvements. Incentives are
        introduced to address problems o f motivation and deployment o f teachers to hardship or
        remote areas;
   (ii)Promoteeffectiveinvolvementofschoolcommitteesandteachersinqualityassuranceand
        monitoring. Government will continue to provide grants to primary and secondary schools
        to enhance quality through availability o f learning materials, teacher's continuous
        development through seminars and related training, development and maintenance o f
        school facilities;
   (iii)Revisethecurricula, theassessmentsandexaminations, andtheschoolinspectionsystem
        to better support development o f creative and skill-based learning that i s o f use to school
        leavers in securing their livelihoods;




                                                  33

         Address school health issues in particular focusing on HIV/AIDS. Since children are
         sexually active at an early age, measures are taken to control the spread o f HIV/AIDS
         through the education system;
         Institute specific interventions to increase girls' retention and performance during their
         final years o f primary education and throughout secondary education. Measures include
         increasedhiringo f female teachers;
         Maintain free access to primary education and reduce fees in non-boarding community
         secondary schools, and expand scholarships for secondary education to ensure increased
         access of children from poor households and orphans; and
         Support non-formal education for increasing adult literacy especially among rural women
         and strengthening the cultural and ethical dimensions o f lifelong education.

         Reforms o f the science, technology and higher education sector in Tanzania are being
prepared. The Ministry o f Science, Technology and Higher Education (MSTHE) has developed
Sub-Master Plans (2003-20 18) and these contain interventions that encompass policy, legal and
regulatory changes, including the rationalization o f the sector.       Legislation to establish the
institutional structure and the management of the sector has been developed and passed after
extensive preparation and consultation. These have established institutions, structures and systems
appropriate for a modem technical and higher education system as well as for science and
technology development that can expand and serve Tanzania`s needs for many years to come, The
government o f Tanzania has now requested development partners to support the preparation o f a
national science, technology, higher and technical education sub-sector program and has asked the
World Bank to lead this work.         Support i s needed to translate government's plans and draft
programs into a costed and implementable five-year reformprogram.

123.     Health. The stated vision o f health policy in Tanzania i s "to improve the health and well
being of all Tanzanians, with a focus on those at risk, and to encourage the health system to be
more responsive to the needs o f the people. Inorder to achieve this vision the health sector will
facilitate the provision o f equitable, quality and affordable basic health services, which are gender
sensitive and sustainable, delivered for the achievement o f improved health status". The
government will therefore improve the use o f financial, human and technical resources in the
health sector to target the needs o f under-served populations. A critical assessment o f the human
resource development strategy in the health sector i s being carried out with a view to identifying
effective strategies to address severe constraints to human resources inhealth (HRH).The strategic
plan for the health sector 2003 - 2008 will be implementedfully.

 124.    The sector will continue to support Health Sector Reforms -- which emphasises the
devolution o f decision making powers to the Councils, address HRH, promote public-private mix
inhealth care delivery (such as through contracts with faith-based service providers, accreditation
of private providers under the National Health Insurance Fundand the bednet voucher scheme). In
the new fiscal year, it will introduce Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) for improved
treatment of malaria; and expand complimentary financing strategies e.g., National Health
Insurance Fund(NHIF)and community health financing (CHF). With regard to HIV and AIDS and
related morbidity, the government will implement the following specific measures:

     0      Targeted interventionsto slow down the rate o f new infections and protect the estimated
            90 percent HIV free people in the community; provide full and equitable access to
            treatment for STIs; ensure broader, systematic and affordable access to family planning




                                                   34

          services, in particular to condoms; promote and expand equitable access to VCT
          services; and ensure safe bloodtransfusion and universal precautions;

    0     Scale up proven non-ARV interventions, for example TB prevention and treatment, and
          treatment o f opportunistic infections inpeople living with HIV and AIDS;

    0     Investigate and promote equitable, sustainable and cost-effective access to ARVs, with
          an emphasis on ARV prevention o f mother to child transmission (PMTCT+) through a
          rights based approach that includes the well being o f the mother; and make certain that
          rolling out the treatment plan i s done in a well-coordinated and well-costed national
          plan;

    0     Link community-based initiatives to facilitate the continuity of care framework so as to
          provide long-term care and management o f chronic conditions such as HIV and AIDS,
          tuberculosis, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases; and

    0     Identify and integrate specific measures (e.g. access to family planning services,
          improved maternal health care) to address gender inequalities and address the increasing
          HNinfectionamongwomen.
125.    Continued prioritisation o f policy and actions remains essential to all poverty reduction
and national development efforts. These include: financing to reduce HIV transmission and its
impact on the welfare o f those affected, with a special focus on girls, young women, the aged,
young children, orphans and persons with disabilities who increasingly face the impact o f HIV and
AIDS.

126.    Water and Sanitation. Adequate sanitation and sustainable access to safe and clean water
and shelter play a critical role in supporting livelihoods and ensuring health. There are disparities
in access to water between urban and rural areas, across regions and even within districts.
Measures that will be pursued include expanding and maintain existing protected-water sources,
properly maintaining sanitation facilities and ensuring facilities at public institutions are adequate
and meet government guidelines.

127.    Environment. Poor people rely heavily on natural resources (land, forests and water) and
are most vulnerable to external shocks and environmental risks, including drought and floods. It i s
important to check over-exploitation o f natural resources and environmental degradation. The
government will reduce vulnerability to environmental risk through checking soil erosion and
deforestation and reducing environmental pollution. Strategies will be put in place to mitigate
effects o f natural disasters, halt desertification and promote water conservation practices.
Sustainable use of natural resources through community-based natural resource management and
enhanced district level planning will be pursued. A number o f projects in Tanzania's portfolio
including the Tanzania Forest Conversation Management Project, the Marine and Coastal
Environment Management Project, the Participatory Agriculture Development Project, and the
proposed Agriculture Sector Development Project support government's interventions to promote
community-based natural resources management and enhanced district level planning to reduce
vulnerability to environmental risk. The support to the Vice President's Office and to National
Environment Management Council under PRSC4 will continue to buildcapacity for environmental
assessments, strategic environmental assessments and sectoral environmental assessments to
identify impacts such as soil erosion, deforestation and pollution o f freshwater and marine
ecosystems and to identify mitigating measures.

128.     Social Protection. Growing numbers o f children are vulnerable to the shocks and stresses
occasioned by poor living conditions, malnutrition and illhealth. The effects o f HIV and A I D S
and gender discrimination are particularly challenging to the prospects o f girls. HIV and AIDS
orphans, youths and old people, particularly women, and people living with disabilities constitute
vulnerable groups for whom extreme poverty i s often compounded by exclusion and
discrimination. Children and women are most vulnerable to the multiple effects o f poverty,
particularly in rural areas. Food insecurity, limited access to health and education and a heavy
workload increase women's vulnerability to poverty.

129.     A range of specific measures will be identifiedand implemented.A comprehensive policy
on vulnerability and social protection will be developed and enforced. The objectives o f the policy
include: to harmonise the implementation o f programmes; to increase the scale o f the most cost -
effective programmes and to improve joint monitoring and evaluation o f progress. Specific
measures will be implemented to assist in protecting those most vulnerable from falling deeper
into poverty, including: measures to ensure children are protected from exploitation, abuse, and
violence; to promote access to quality social services, credit and to transfers and pensions; to
increase the scale o f effective micro and area-based schemes, social insurance and social
assistance programmes. Support will be provided to HIV and AIDS-affected households headed
by children and other orphans, the aged and young women. Simultaneous interventions will be
implemented to reduce stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS. To
ensure that all interventions are sustained and meet the priority needs o f the poorest, communities
will be fully involved in designing and in effectively instituting appropriate social protection
measures at that level. Likewise, the capacity o f local authorities will be strengthened to facilitate
the identification o f vulnerable persons and provide them with appropriate support.

130.     Effective systems to ensure universal access to quality and affordable public services.
Functioning and well-equipped public facilities (schools, health facilities, availability o f clean and
safe water, etc), including adequate, motivated and competent human resources, are a prerequisite
to improving the quality o f life and for promoting the well being o f all Tanzanians. This calls for
increasedprovision o f essential infrastructure, planned and serviced human settlements and skilled
personnel. There i s also a need to forge effective partnerships between the government, LGAs,
CSOs and the private sector.

 131,    The government will increase absolute resources for basic public services and ensure that
a basic infrastructure in terms o f facilities, equipment and materials, well-trained, competent and
motivated human resource, referral structures, and a network o f passable roads and railways are in
place. The strategy will also ensure that health facilities are improved and are accessible and drugs
are made available throughout the year. The government will forge partnerships with all other
stakeholders in the provision o f quality social services, including CSOs, the private sector and
faith based organisations (FBOs).

Progressunder PRSC-4.

 132.    Progress assessed in this area under PRSC-4 includes the outcomes o f the health sector
review as well as issues in the areas o f poverty monitoring and environment. Education, water,
and social protection will be fully integrated into the PRSC framework starting with PRSC-5.

 133.    Health. The 6th Annual Joint Health Sector Review was concluded successfully in
April 2005, with over 200 participants from government, donor agencies, civil society and




                                                   36

NGOS.'~Judged by the agreed milestones, performance over the previous year was mixed. The
advent of the Joint Rehabilitation Fund, the successful integration o f health into the MKUKUTA,
the scaling up of AIDS care and treatment and a substantial budget increase (FY2004/5) were all
registered as achievements. However, little progress was made intackling the human resources for
health (HRH) crisis. The Development Partners, in particular the Bank, have agreed to work
closely with the government on defining effective HRHstrategies inFY06.

134.     The Joint Review, the State o f Health report, and the updated health sector performance
profile point to improvements in health service delivery between 2000 and 2005. Most
importantly, the Demographic and Health Survey o f 2004/5 evidenced a dramatic drop in infant
and under five mortality (of 31 percent and 24 percent respectively).       However, there was no
commensurate improvement in the area o f maternal and reproductive health as maternal mortality,
fertility and contraceptive prevalence all remained unchanged. Inresponse, budget allocations for
contraceptives and emergency obstetric care are being closely monitored by partners.

135.     Environment. The National Environmental Management Act, 2004 entered into force in
July 2005, and regulations on EL4and environmental audit have beenpublishedinthe government
gazette in late 2005. Guidelines on mainstreaming environment into sector and local government
planning and budgets are being prepared for finalisation by the end o f the FY06. Draft standards
for water quality, waste water discharge, air quality and emissions limits have been developed; and
consultations are underway. Work on drafting noise, radiation and soil standards i s on-going. The
government continues to work on other regulations, standards, and ethics, as well as the building
of the institutional and human resources capacities for environmental management.               An
implementation and capacity building plan for the National Environmental Management Act i s
under preparation and will be finalised by the end o f FY06. This plan will include financing
arrangements including the development o f a sector wide approach with an annual environment
review process. This will be under the guidance from the Environment Working Group chaired by
the Vice President's Office, which has members from the National Environmental Management
Council, relevant line agencies, CSOs and development partners. Inputsto the first annual review
will be the state o f environment report, the second PER o f the environment, and other relevant
sector reviews (e.g., health and forestry).

136.     Poverty monitoring. Annual implementation reports o f MKUKUTA will include and draw
together information on changes in poverty emerging from the monitoring systems. Their main
purpose i s to track progress towards the MKUKUTA objectives and to suggest subsequent policy
actions and activities and inform budget decisions and MTEF adjustments. It will be produced
through a consultative process based on various inputs including: the Poverty and Human
Development Report, the Economic Survey, Public Expenditure Reviews and sector reviews. Key
processes that will underpinthe preparation o f these implementationreports include:

     0   Revision of the Poverty Monitoring Master Plan. The new MKUKUTA Monitoring
         Master Plan reflects the broader approach o f MKUKUTA to monitor both poverty
         reduction and economic growth. The objective o f the revised Monitoring System i s to
         champion a national integrated approach to monitoring and evaluation utilizing the
         MKUKUTA as the guiding medium-term framework. This includes comprehensive
         outcome-focused monitoring which builds on lessons from the original Poverty
         Monitoring System. It also includes the consolidation and aggregation o f outputs from
         MDA (Ministries, Departments and Agencies) and LGA (Local Government Authority)

        based on their Strategic Plans (SPs), Annual Performance Reports and Medium Term
        Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs). The system sets out to assess changes during the
        implementation period o f the MKUKUTA (2005-2010) and whether there i s effective
        achievement o f MKUKUTA goals and objectives. It seeks to reveal reasons for successes
        and failures inorder to inform corrective action and improvements;

    0   Agreement on MKUKUTA indicators. The Vice President's Office is coordinating the
        process for agreeing indicators and setting targets for MKUKUTAin conjunction with the
        relevant sector ministriesand other stakeholders; and

    0   Improved data production. Monitoring MKUKUTA and policy and planning processes
        require data that i s relevant, high quality and timely. To meet this challenge the National
        Bureau o f Statistics and Zanzibar's Office o f the Chief Government Statistician are
        preparing a statistical master plan to improve the quality o f data production across the
        whole statistics system, including routine administrative data.

Mechanismsfor Dialogue and Assessment.

137.    Education.   The government i s establishing an annual education sector review, which
covers the education sector as a whole including its sub-sectors. The first education sector review
took place in February 2006 and a review report i s being prepared. The review assesses overall
performance o f the sector and the effectiveness of public expenditure outlays: by reviewing policy
choices, budgeting, resource allocation, implementation and progress. The review also seeks to
enhance transparency and accountability in the sector, by providing a chance for stakeholders to
see how decisions have been made, monitor progress and contribute ideas. Among the objectives
of the review are:

    0   Provide a deeper understanding o f the critical linkages betweenthe various sub-sectors;
    0   Focus on the problems o f financing the sector as a whole;
    0   Discuss how all stakeholders can contribute to effective policy dialogue with government;
    0   Provide inputs that will guide the development o f Strategic Plans for the next financial
        year;
    0   Discuss how progress inthe sector can be more effectively monitored.

138.    Health sector. The health sector review process i s well established and has improved
continually since the first review in 1999. It reviews the implementation of the Health Sector
Strategic Plan and makes commitments on issues for the coming year (Annex 11). Within the
existinghealth sector review, 22 performance indicators are assessed every year, with a further 11
reviewed at longer intervals. The review held in April 2006 highlighted the following issues and
challenges:

    0   Closer engagement i s needed with the Ministry o f Finance within the sector review
        process. This i s highlighted in the report which notes that payroll expenditure i s not
        keeping up with Other Charges, and that central government expenditure i s expanding
        much faster than local government. Even these increases are not sufficient to cover the
        requirements o f the health sector. The resource gap i s expanding with the need to purchase
        more expensive pharmaceuticals for malaria, HIV and TB, the deterioration o f health
        infrastructure and the demand for increased salaries for medical professionals. At the
        same time, due to large commitments o f external earmarked financing (notably from the



                                                  38

        Global Fund and United States) flexible, discretionary resources are increasingly
        constrained;

    e   Development o f a strong performance monitoring system i s a priority particularly with
        respect to facility-based routine data, and building improved links with the MKUKUTA
        Monitoring System; and

    e   Lessons can be learned from previous health sector review processes to improve
        subsequent reviews.
139.    HIV/AIDS mational Multisectoral Framework. NMSF). A Joint H N / A I D S Programme
Review i s held biannually to take stock o f progress made in implementing the National
Multisectoral Strategic Framework (NMSF) by all sectors involved including TACAIDS, and
make recommendations for future actions. The second review took place on March 15 - 16, 2006
and a report i s under preparation. Specific objectives o f the review include:

    e   Receive and analyze the mid- term evaluation report o f the NMSF implementation which
        includes the extent o f implementation o f the strategic objectives as stipulated in the
        NMSF;

    e   Receive and review reports fiom the key technical areas;

    0   Review and discuss progress, constraints and resource mobilization including finance and
        set milestones for the next year; and

    e   Identify and agree on main priorities and a minimumnumber o f milestones for the coming
        period before impact evaluation o f the NMSF.


140.    Water sector. A sector SWAP i s currently under preparation and ajoint sector review will
serve as the apex sector dialogue and assessment forum. The first joint water sector review i s
scheduled to take place inSeptember 2006.

141.    Prior to the first sector review, and as a key input to the process o f preparing for a
satisfactory review, a Water SWAP Consultative Meeting will be held during the first half o f
FY06. It will convene relevant stakeholders to finalise the core components o f the SWAP and to
agree the content and inputs to the first Joint Water Sector Review. The design o f a performance
assessment framework and the information and data systems required to support sound sector
performance assessment will be a key agenda item.

142.    Environment. Government intends to develop a sector wide approach with an annual
environment review process to support the implementation o f the Environment Management Act.
This will be under guidance from the Environment Working Group chaired by the Vice President's
Office, which has members from the National Environmental Management Council, relevant line
agencies, CSOs and Development Partners. Inputs to the first annual review will be the state o f
environment report, the second PER o f the environment, and other relevant sector reviews (e.g.
health and forestry).

Monitorable Actions under PRSC-5

143.    It is expected that the sector review processes envisaged for 2006 will have taken place by
the time of the Annual Review for PRSC-5 scheduled for October 2006.            Table 6 shows the
schedule o f the main sector reviews under the MKUKUTA Cluster 2 for 2006. The assessment o f



                                                 39

these reviews will feed into the overall GBS assessment. With the shift o f bank funding for the
education, health, and water sectors from sector specific instruments to general budget support, the
outcome o f these reviews will be critical for the continuation and level o f Bank support through
PRSC-5.    W h i l e the health sector review i s well established, the education and water sector
reviews are being held for the first time in 2006. Experience from Tanzania's health sector review
and from other countries suggest that it typically takes several years for these reviews to mature
and to provide a fully satisfactory forum for dialogue and assessment. A central objective o f the
GBS i s thus to ensure that these reviews do take place and improve over time as government
develops adequate capacity for these sector reviews.

MKUKUTAImplementation:Custer3 GovernanceandAccountability
                                               -
Background

 146.   The GBS performance assessment framework and policy dialogue focuses on two o f the
seven goals defined inthe MKUKUTA for this cluster. These are

        Equitable allocation o f public resources with corruption effectively addressed; and


                                                  40

    0   Effective public service fi-amework in place to provide foundation for service delivery
         improvements and poverty reduction.
147.    Tanzania has already made significant progress in both areas. Equitable allocation of
public resources has been addressed through reforms o f the budget process and the PRSP process.
Measures to reduce corruption included (i)reducing opportunities for corruption through
liberalization o f the economy and reforms o f the regulatory and tax regime, (ii)  systemic reforms
of the public financial management and procurement system, (iii)      strengthening o f institutions that
carry out anti-corruption activities such as the Prevention o f Corruption Bureau, and (iv)
comprehensive public sector reforms which includes strengthening the incentives for performance
and integrity. Various indicators o f corruption and governance suggest that these measures have
indeed had an impact and reduced the level o f corruption.               Nonetheless, despite recent
improvements, these indicators also suggest that levels o f corruption are still high which calls for
the continuation and scaling up o f efforts to effectively fight corruption.

148.     In order to deepen the anti-corruption efforts and to scale up efforts to effectively fight
corruption, the authorities are making a concerted effort to establish an appropriate anti-money
laundering (AML) system with the support o f the U.S.A., including the creation o f a financial
intelligence unit and the preparation o f new AML legislation. Establishing such a system will
enhance Tanzania's anti-corruption measures. An effective AML regime will ensure that it i s not
only the underlying offence o f corruption that i s dealt with, but also that corrupt practices can be
monitored and actions taken through systems that track the proceeds o f the corrupt actions,
Denying perpetrators o f corruption the financial rewards and eventual recovery o f the proceeds o f
corruption i s an effective disincentive to combating corruption.

 149.    Tanzania has been implementing a public service reform program since the early 1990s.
The first phase focussed primarily on adjusting the size o f the public service and controlling the
wage bill, while the second phase, which i s currently underway, tries to enhance public sector
performance through the institutionalization o f a performance management system and improved
incentives through increased and decompressed wages and a Selected Accelerated Salary
Enhancement scheme.         Public sector reforms also extend to the local authorities. A Local
Government Reform Program i s currently under implementation supporting Tanzania's
decentralization policy by strengthening the capacity o f local authorities. Fiscal decentralization
through the introduction o f a formula base transfer system and a local government development
grant system is an important component o f Tanzania's public sector reforms.

Reform Strategy

 150.    Eauitable allocation o f public resources with corruption effectively addressed. This goal
has two operational targets:

     (i)Public resources are allocated, accessible and used inan equitable, accountable and
         transparent manner; and
     (ii)Institute effective regulations and mechanisms regarding petty and grand corruption.

 151,    Towards the first target, strategies will include built-inequity and participation principles
 inthe PERs, and ensuring access and use ofnaturalresources with clear emphasis on the needs of
the poor. Effective mechanisms are needed to make people aware o f official government policies
regarding public financing and official charges as well as their entitlements through civic
 education and dissemination of information. Systems and institutions o f accountability, ethics and



                                                   41

transparency of government and non-government officials, including political parties will be
strengthened. Adequate supervision o f Local Government Authorities (LGAs) for accounting,
financial reporting and auditing functions will be strengthened. Also, public involvement in the
preparation, formulation and monitoring o f the MKUKUTA and budgets will be deepened,
including capacity development for improvedroutine data systems.

152.     All transfer mechanisms to LGAs,including villages and hamlets (mtaa) for recurrent and
development funding, will be harmonised with the formula-based recurrent grant and Local
Government Capital Development Grant systems to provide a single national process that
emphasizes equity, transparency and accountability, and rewards performance improvement.

153.     The second operational target focuses on petty and grand corruption. The strategies will
include strengthening existing institutions and mechanisms (e.g. the Prevention o f Corruption
Bureau) to operate independently and take effective and swift action as well as enforcement o f the
National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan (NACSAP). LGAs and MDAs will undertake
concrete actions to develop capacity for managing resources, reduce and monitor corruption within
their respective sectors. Also, measures will be taken to deepen engagement o f media and civil
society in policy processes and to protect and promote the independence o f the media. The
government and other key actors will provide information on the budget allocations, disbursements
and uses o f funds at district, ward and village level.

154.     Effective public service framework in place to provide foundation for service deliverv
improvements and PovertV reduction. Two operational targets have been identified. The first i s to
ensure the administrative systems o f government are managed transparently and inthe interests o f
the people they serve; the second i s to institutionalise and implement decentralisation by
devolution so as to enhance public ownership o f the poverty reduction process. Strategies will
include strengthening the Public Service Reform Programme with particular attention to
transparent recruitment based on merit, ethics, skills and ability, institutional rules and incentives,
institutional management, cost effectiveness, and customer service and responsiveness. Regular
assessments o f service deliveryklient satisfaction will be carried out to monitor quality o f public
services. To that effect, actions will be taken to develop, implement and monitor feedback on
Client Service Charters and end-user surveys in each sector; as well as to promote public-private-
NGOs partnership inthe provision o f services. Hiringqualified personnel inkey sectors who are
trained, motivated, equitably deployed and supervised i s critical. This calls also for the need to
increase and rationalize remunerationo f civil servants in order to fairly compensate workers and to
reduce corruption. The government policy o f decentralisation by devolution will continue to be
implemented through the LGRP. This entails devolution o f increasing responsibilities for service
delivery to LGAs, including village and mtaa that have to be empowered and their capacity built to
carry out their roles as set out inthe Policy Paper on Local Government Reform (1998).

Progress under PRSC-4

 155,    Equitable allocation o f public resources with corruption effectively addressed. The Good
Governance Coordination unit in the Vice President's Office continued with the preparation o f
Quarterly Reports on the implementation o f Tanzania's anti conuption strategy. However, there i s
need to strengthen follow up to these reports. Government also continued its efforts to strengthen
capacities to combat corruption in Tanzania.           This includes a strengthening o f the Good
Governance Coordination Unit and o f the Prevention o f Corruption Bureau. The presentation to
Parliament o f new anti-corruption legislation has been delayed. The new deadline for this i s now
November 2006, given that the parliamentary sessions following the national elections are


                                                   42

expected to be devoted to the reconstitution o f Parliament and the budget session. However, the
L a w Reform Commission has consulted widely, reviewed the Anti Corruption Law, and submitted
i t s report to the Minister for subsequent action.

156.      Effective public service framework in place to provide foundation for service delivew
improvements and poverty reduction. Government has completed service delivery surveys and
posted the results on its website. Dissemination o f a popular version in Englishand Kiswahili for
the general public i s inprogress. Government has also disseminated its State o f the Public Service
Report which discusses candidly the progress in improving the performance o f the public service
for better service delivery. Government has also published a revised Code o f Ethics and all MDAs
have been instructed to form Ethics Committees. The development o f a complaints handling
mechanism i s inprogress.

157.      Government continued with the implementation of its Medium Term Pay policy,
which aims at increasing and decompressingpublic sector salaries." InFY06, public service
salaries increased by 8.34 percent for the lowest paid, while salaries in other grades increased on
average by 12.5 percent. Actual salaries have remained in a band o f 84-86 percent o f the levels
targeted in the Medium Term Pay Policy. Another element o f pay reform i s the review and
rationalization o f the allowance regime. A study on the subject was completedbut the results were
inconclusive. The government hasset up a Task force which has started in February 2006 to
carry out a comprehensive review of the allowance regime.'* As an immediate task, it was
asked to look into the possibility o f increasing the FY07 personal emoluments budget by reducing
the allocation o f the major allowances in Other Charges, particularly per diem, extra duty,
honoraria, and expenditure on fuel and vehicle maintenance.

Mechanismsfor Dialogue and Assessment

 158.     The main programs for public sector reform, including the Public Sector Reform Program
and the Local Government Reform program are well established with adequate structures for
dialogue and regular reporting and assessments o f progress. PSRP i s monitored and reported on
through two joint government/development partner mechanisms, the Public Sector Working Group
and the Joint Implementation Program Review Committee. The government prepares quarterly
and annual reports on PSRP implementation progress which are submitted for confirmation and
comment by the JIPRC.             The government and development partners commissions jointly
independent mid term reviews o f PSRP and the reports are considered by the JIPRC. The most
recent review was undertaken in April, 2005.         The reports are all publicly available on the
President's Office-Public Service Management's website.

 159.     A review process for the implementation o f the National Anti-Conuption Strategy and on
corruption related issues i s yet to be developed. However, government does prepare quarterly
implementation reports that are being discussed by top level management ingovernment and there
i s also a commitment for regular dialogue at senior level through the Development Cooperation
Forum, Inaddition, Government has been implementing a Legal Sector Reform Program (LSRP).
Development partners have agreed to support the government inimplementing the LSRP through a
pooled fundingmodality. The LSRP i s another crosscuttingreform that The government seeks to
implement to complement the other key crosscutting reforms.

160.     Government i s committed to the continued implementationo f the PSRP and LGRP and the
findings o f the review o f these processes will feed into the overall GBS assessment. Inaddition,
government has committed to two specific actions. The first i s the submission o f revised anti-

Macroeconomic Stability

162.     Background.     The MKUKUTA identifies sound macro-economic management as a
condition for achieving sustainedhighgrowth and to generate rational responses to market signals.
Tanzania has sustained macroeconomic stability for almost a decade now. The PRBS program
monitored progress in strengthening debt management and Tanzania's tax system and significant
progress has been made in both areas. Tanzania benefits from a PRGF arrangement, which was
approved by the IMF's Board on August 16,2003 and i s expected to end by August 15,2006. An
important challenge for Tanzania's economic management are large aid inflows, which have the
potential o f generating adverse impacts on inflation, the exchange rate and the interest rate. This
requires close monitoring by the authorities and sterilization policies that react flexibly to
movements inthese variables.

163.     Reform Strategy. At the core o f Tanzania's macro-economic stability are prudent fiscal
policy with tight limits on net domestic financing and a monetary policy whose main objective i s
to maintain low inflation.

164.     Progress under PRSC-4. As discussed in the section on recent economic developments,
macro-economic performance o f Tanzania remains satisfactory. Specific to the GBS, government
finalized and approved the work plan for the implementation o f the National Debt Strategy,
prepared an updated Debt Sustainability Analysis, and issued a circular to all MDAs forwarding
the Loans, Guarantees, and Grants Act and its Regulations. In addition, government also made
progress in the development o f a strategy for the reform o f a Local Government Revenue strategy
by completing a report that reviews the current system and proposes options for reforms. The
report has been submitted to the PER Working Group and the Steering Committee for the Public
Service Reform, awaiting comments and final government decision.

165.     Mechanisms for Dialogue and Assessment.            The primary process for dialogue and
assessment o f policies related to macroeconomic stability i s the IMF's PRGF arrangement and
Article lV supervision. To link the IMF assessments to the GBS and to local processes, there i s




                                                  44

agreement to discuss the IMF assessment in the meeting o f the PER Macro group, which i s to be
convened at least quarterly by government.

166.     Monitorable Actions under PRSC-5. There are no specific monitorable actions specified
in the PAF, since macro economic management is beingmonitored by the IMF. A positive IMF
assessment i s thus important for budget support decisions, but disbursements will not be directly
linkedto the IMF assessment

ResourceAllocationandBudgetConsistency

168.     Background. The MKUKUTA introduced important changes as to how expenditure
allocations are aligned with the strategy. PRS-1 worked with clearly defined priority sectors,
which benefited from priority in resource allocation and were protected from expenditure cuts in
the course o f budget execution. While this approach was fairly easy to implement and monitor, it
had several drawbacks. First, the priority sector approach weakened the link between sector
performance and budget allocation, as the priority sector where virtually guaranteed that their
share in total expenditure would be increased, regardless o f performance. Second, the focus on
priority sectors did not provide enough consideration o f the contribution o f non-priority sectors to
the achievement o f PRS-1 objectives. For this reason, the MKUKUTA introduced an outcome
based approach where all expenditure proposals are evaluated with regard to their potential
contribution to MKUKUTAobjectives.

169.     Reform Strategy. To implement the outcome based approach, government is pursuing
several reforms. The first i s the introduction o f the Strategic Budget Allocation System (SBAS),
which links expenditure allocations to outcomes. Second, government i s seeking to better align
sector strategies to the MKUKUTA and harmonize the performance management approach
implemented by the President's Office - Public Sector Management and the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework used by the Ministry o f Finance.           A particular challenge poses the
ongoing fiscal decentralization which i s intended to move expenditure responsibilities and related
finances to local governments. Government i s planning to roll out the SBAS system to the regions
starting with the FY07 budget, which will allow a better linkage o f local government authorities'
allocations to the MKUKUTA. Finally, government continues to pursue reforms that aim at
enhancing participation o f and accountability to domestic stakeholders.

170.     Progress under PRSC-4.        The budget for FY06 was prepared using the SBAS, with
aggregation o f expenditures at the Cluster level. Budget allocations for FY06 were assessed as
being broadly in line with the MKUKUTA, with 54 percent of total expenditures directly
related to the achievement of MKUKUTA objective^.'^
expenditures, 48 percent are related to Cluster I- growth and reduction o f income poverty, 44 to
                                                                      Of the MKUKUTA related

Cluster II- quality o f life and social wellbeing, and 8 percent to Cluster III- Accountability and
Governance.

171.     Budget execution was broadly consistent with the approved budget.*' Revenue
collection exceeded budgeted revenue by 2 percent in FY05, primarily due to higher income and
fuel tax collection. Expenditures continued to be controlled by the cash budget system. Recurrent
expenditures were 97 percent o f budgeted expenditure and the main economic categories showed
only minor deviations. However, at the vote level, the average deviation o f recurrent expenditure
in FY05 was 20.4 percent, which is a slight improvement over the preceding years, when
deviations were 23 and 21 percent. A main source o f these deviations i s that a contingency for the
allocation o f salary adjustments i s maintained at the Ministry o f Finance and only reallocated in
the course o f the fiscal year.

172.     An evaluation workshop o f the FY06 MTEF budget process was carried out and various
recommendations were tabled with the aim o f improving the budget preparation process. A task
force was formed to harmonize the MKUKUTA, strategic plans o f the MDAs and the MTEF.This
will involve: revising the sector programs to be consistent with the MKUKUTA; linking the
MTEFtargets with that o fthe MKUKUTA (inthe SBAS). Inaddition, the MTEFis to become the
point o f reference for institutional and national planning models in next year's cycle. This will
reduce confusion and ensure coherence in aligning various processed initiatives. A consolidated
MTEFprocess is also expectedto enhance the budget challenge function.

173.     Slower than expected progress occurred with respect to better integration o f personnel
expenditures into the budget process and improved consolidated reporting on local government
expenditures. In October 2005, the expenditure report for the first half o f the financial year to
December 2004 was only about 80 percent completed whilst the revenues report has already been
circulated. There i s currently a programme for capacity buildingin financial management at LGAs
and the centre. Concerning the integration o f personnel expenditures into the budget guidelines,
initial discussions indicated that it i s not feasible to establish man hours embedded in each o f the
MKUKUTAtargets whereas this has beenpossible for expenditure on goods and services (OC). It
has been proposed that during the review o f macro economic performance, the medium term pay
policy should be reviewed together with personnel emoluments and employment levels o f MDAs
and their budgetary implications. Related to this, a study was commissioned to establish the
significance  o f allowances and to advise on the possibility o f incorporating them into the Pay
Reform Programme. However, there i s a need to look into the composition o f allowances so as to
identify the allowances that are linked to service delivery.

174.     Mechanisms for Dialogue and Assessment. Tanzania has sustained a government led,
participatory annual PER process since 1997. This process provides inputs and feedback to
government's budgetary policy and also provides support to improvements at all three levels o f
public expenditure management, i.e., overall fiscal discipline, strategic resource allocation, and
operational efficiency. An important element o f the PER process i s the "external evaluation'' led
by the World Bank, which provides an annual assessment o f budgetary policies and institutions.
The findings o f the external evaluation are discussed in the PER Working Group as well as at the
annual consultative P E W T E F meeting, which i s attended by a large number o f domestic
stakeholders, including Members o f Parliament, and representatives o f MDAs, NGOs, academic
and research institutions, and the private sector.

175.     Monitorable Actions under PRSC-5. There are two broad actions that will be closely
monitored under the PRSC and which are critical to the successful implementation o f the
MKUKUTA and to the achievement o f the targeted results. The approved budget has to be

broadly in line with policy objectives (MKUKUTA, sector policies) and the expenditure outturn
has to be consistent with the approved budget.

176.    Monitoring indicators. Average deviation o f budget outturn as a percentage o f budget

PublicFinancialManagement

177.    Background. The 2005 PEFAR noted the large improvements made inthe performance
of the Public Financial Management (PFM) system. The recommendations o f the 2001 CFAA
have been implemented or are in the process o f being implemented. These improvements have
been recognized in the 2004 HIPC assessment with Tanzania being rated as one o f two African
countries meeting the largest number o f HIPC benchmarks (11out 16, up from 8 in2001).

178.    The largest improvements have been inthe budget executionprocess, with the successful
implementation and roll out o f the Epicor IFMS system. This system has now been rolled out to
almost all the MDA's and to 32 Local Governments, with a vastly improved classification system,
predictability of resources, cash management and information flows. There has also been
significant improvement o f controls over non tax revenues. The Annual Financial Statement i s
produced within a few months o f the end o fthe year.

179.    However despite these improvements, substantial challenges remain. Some o f the key ones
are:

    0   Poor accountability o f resource use. Tanzania has a largely ineffective internal audit
        system, an external audit organization that has weak capacity and unfamiliarity with
        computerized audit procedures or techniques, and a legislature that has not debated the last
        five reports of the Public Accounts Committee. Large leakages continue to take place
        through the procurement process although steps have been taken to establish a new
        procurement regulator.

    0   The IFMS system still needs to be improved and integrated within government. The CAG
        has noted that for around three percent o f budgetary transactions there was incomplete or
        no documentary evidence to support the authenticity o f the expenditure incurred; the IFMS
        system still needs to be interfaced on the revenue side with the TRA computerized system
        and with the M O F for the budget formulation module.

    0   At the local government level, there are no standardized expenditure reporting formats and
        LGA expenditure or budget outturnreports are still not available.

    0   Despite improved collaboration between the mainland and Zanzibar, the accounting
        system i s still manual in Zanzibar with continuing weaknesses on budget formulation and
        budget execution.

    8   Improvements in the implementation o f the PFMRP program (supported through basket
        funding by several donors) have been slow due to weak technical capacity and insufficient
        co-ordination.

    0   Predictability o f aid and use o f country systems remain areas o f concern. Only around 66
        percent o f foreign aid i s channeled through the exchequer system, despite Tanzania being
        a champion for donors o f the harmonizationagenda.




                                                  47

          The PEFAR rated Tanzania using the revised and improved PEFA indicator set. This
          assessment showed that on 29 indicators Tanzania was rated A (best practice) on 14
          percent, B on 34 percent, C on 41 percent and D on 10 percent.

180.      A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) carried out in 2003 undertook a
diagnostic review o f public procurement systems in Tanzania, including: the legislative
framework; the performance o f regulatory functions; the enforcement regime; the capacity of
public sector institutions to conduct procurement; and the effects o f corruption on procurement.
CPAR recommendations include: (a) separating the operational and regulatory functions o f the
Central Tender Board and transforming the Central Tender Board into a regulatory authority
responsible for procurement policy and monitoring o f public procurement; (b) fully decentralizing
procurement operations to MDAs; (c) establishing a new cadre o f procurement specialists and a
system of certification for the same; (d) restructuring the composition o f the District Tender
Boards to exclude councilors; (e) abolishing the Government Stores and introducing framework
contracts for common items that will be managed by a slim government agency; (0 abolishing the
Materials Management Board and establishing a new Procurement Professionals Body; (g)
publishinga weekly Procurement Journal where all procurement opportunities will be advertised;
(h) establishing a whistle-blowing mechanismto curb corruption inprocurement; and (i)                replacing
the system o f pre-shipment inspection by destination inspection.

181.      Reform strategy. The CFAA, PEFARand the CPAR have identified key actions that need
to be taken forward over the short and medium term.                  Government has developed the Public
Financial Management Reform Program(PFMRP)2',which serves as a coordinating framework for
financial management reforms and associated technical assistance. It sets out a methodology to
mitigate fiduciary risk and strengthen the country's financial accountability framework. The main
output targets of the revised PFMRP have been sequenced to reflect the logical progression from
macroeconomic forecasting through revenue mobilization and resource allocation to expenditure
management and oversight. It recognizes the need to address constraints to improve P F M across
government and will take forward existing public financial management reform initiatives and
address outstanding weaknesses.

182.      The government's vision o f the future for Local Government Authorities (LGAs) i s well
articulated in the reform agenda, which i s being implemented through Local Government Reform
Programme (LGRP). The LGRP includes activities on financial management reforms. The
functions, funding, reporting requirements, and other mandates o f LGAs are clearly stated in the
various laws and regulations. Inevitably the process o f change i s slow as the concept of local
participation i s still inits formative stages inTanzania.

Progress under PRSC-4
183.      Financial accounting; and reporting.         Progress has been made in integrating revenue
collected by the Tanzania Revenue Authority into the IFMS, including the establishment of a
wireless radio link between the Tanzania Revenue Authority and the Office o f the Accountant
General inNovember 2005.




21 The original PFMRP hadbeendeveloped in  2000 as aconceptby SIDA but it was not yet completelydevelopedand
only partially funded by SIDA.However, MoF was keen to use the existingframework to avoid duplicationwith ongoing
efforts. The CFAA actionplanwas therefore used as abasis to revise andimprove the PFMRPrather than develop a
completely newprogram.

184.     External audit. 22 o f the positions in the NAO that should be filled by suitably qualified
CPAs are so filled, allowing NAO to meet its target o f 15 percent by November 2005. There has
also been progress in developing the capacity of the NAO to carry out audits through the
IFMS.'* For the revenue audit, computers have been installed and staff trained. On the revenue
side, installation o f computers and training o f staff i s expected to b e completed by M a y 2006,
following the completion o f the audit exercise for FY05. The N A O i s also expected to move from
a transactions audit approach to a more riskbased and systemapproach.

185,     The CAG was to submit the audit report for fiscal year ending 30 June 2004 to Parliament
during the June/July 2005 budget session, but due to ongoing reforms and restructuring o f the
NAO the report was submitted to Parliament only inFebruary 2006, the first Parliamentary session
after the elections. However, the audit report for fiscal year ending 30 June 2005 was completed
inApril 2006, representing significantprogress compared to previous years. The finalization and
signing o f the "Penalties and Surcharge Regulations" on June 1, 2005 provides now the basis for
sanctioning civil servants for financial mismanagement.


                Box 2. Tanzania'sPublicFinance(SurchargeandPenalties)Regulations

With a view to improve accountability and compliance with Public Financial Management laws and
regulations, Tanzania has put inplace some pioneering regulations. These are the Public Finance (Surcharge
and Penalties) Regulations that have been issued under the Public Finance Act, 2001, and came into effect on
lst 2005.
    July

These state that every Accounting Officer shall be personallv and pecunarilv responsible and accountable for
the collection and receipts o f all revenues and for all disbursements o f expenditures in his vote and shall be
answerable to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). The officer will continue to be liable even if he has
ceased to hold that office.

Under these regulations, the Minister has been authorized to impose surcharges and penalties and these
powers can be delegated to the Paymaster General and Accounting Officer. A schedule prescribes detailed
penalties for misdemeanors such as purchase of goods, services and consultants without proper authorization,
failure to retire imprests in time, sharing passwords without authorization, retaining funds beyond the
prescribed period, opening bank accounts without AG's approval, not complying with subsidiary legislation
etc.



186.     Procurement. Tremendous progress has been made in the last year towards reforming the
procurement system to ensure that the government obtains better value for its financial resources.
The most critical achievement was the enactment o f the new Public Procurement Act, on May 1,
2005, which abolished the Central Tender Board, fully decentralized the procurement function to
MDAs and established a procurement oversight body, the Public Procurement Regulatory
Authority (PPRA). Since its enactment, the PPR4 has put priority on the dissemination o f the new
Act and the associated Regulations through several workshops and seminars. The government has
appointed the Board o f Directors o f PPRA and its Chief Executive Officer. The organization
structure of the PPRA has been approved. The MOF has also authorized PPRA to
commence the recruitment process in accordancewith the approved structure.                      23  PPR4will
have recruited about 36 people by next fiscal year and adequate office space for this staff has been
made available. In addition, the government has fully operationalized the Public Procurement

Appeals Authority (PPAA) by appointing board members, setting up a permanent office for it and
issuing the Public Procurement Appeals Rules which sets up the procedure to be used by the
Appeals Authority inhandling complaints. With the operationalization o f the PPAA, Tanzania has
now one o f the most comprehensive and robust complaints review mechanism inthe world.

187.     The most important function o f PPRA i s to monitor and ensure that MDAs comply with
the Public Procurement Act as described in the Procurement Regulations. PPRA will monitor
compliance through regular procurement audits as mandated by the Act. The Public Finance Act
of 2001 also mandates the National Audit Office (NAO) to carry out procurement audits through
value for money audits. The two institutions have met to discuss how to ensure that their work i s
complementary and duplication i s avoided. A joint committee will be established to work out the
cooperation modalities for carrying out procurement audits and to agree on an appropriate audit
strategy that will spell out the roles and responsibilities o f each institution

188.     Since PPRA's very limited capacities were focussed appropriately on the above activities,
delays have occurred in the establishment o f the procurement cadre in the public service and o f
organization structures and staffing levels o f Procurement Management Units (PMUs). An inter-
ministerial task force i s now expected to submit its recommendations to P S M by April 2006.
Review and approval of the recommendations i s expected to take another three months and it i s
expected that by June 2006, the procurement cadre, and organization structures/staffing levels o f
PMUs will have been approved.

189.     Mechanismsfor Dialogue and Assessment. The annual PEFARreport i s the primary tool
for the assessment o f progress in this area, as its findings are discussed by a broad range o f
stakeholders in the context o f the PER Working Group as well as the annual PER consultative
meeting. At the operational level, the PFMRP provides the underlying process for dialogue and
periodic review with an appropriately developed results framework, with monitoring indicators for
each component at the output level.

190.     Monitorable Actions under PRSC-5. Overall progress will be assessed through the
PEFAR and PFMRPprocesses. Inaddition, government is committed to fully reflect audit reform
priorities in the PFMRP and to contract a consulting firm to establish a system for monitoring and
checking compliance with the new procurement system.

SUMMARY ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL PROGRESS

192.     The Annual Review held inOctober 2005 was the first to be conducted after it was agreed
to establish a new Performance Assessment Framework (PAF). The review concluded that there
has been reasonably satisfactory overall progress.          The following main issues o f particular
importance for the budget support emerged from the review:




                                                  50

          Tanzania's sustained reforms have generated strong macroeconomic performance, and
          the overall macroeconomic developments in the country are favorable and supportive o f
          poverty reduction and improved domestic revenue mobilization.

          Continued good growth performance will rely on the consistent implementation of the
          government's reformagenda inprivate sector and agricultural development under the
          MKUKUTACluster 1. Importantreforms are being implementedinthis area butthe
          review notes that there i s need for continued efforts on reforms that remove bottlenecks
          to growthinthe economy, inparticular within agriculture policy, energy and roads.

          Cluster 2 of the MKUKUTA deals with the key service delivery sectors and monitoring
          o f poverty. The GBS review notes that the important sector review processes, which are
          meant to inform all stakeholders on the progress made in the implementation o f sectoral
          strategies, are at different stages (health and HIV/AIDS-sector being well advanced,
          education sector being currently developed and water sector review not yet established).
          The GBS review stressed the importance o f linking these reviews through a Cluster
          framework that relates all interventions meant for achieving the Cluster Objectives,
          to the planning and budget processes at sector and macro level. On the basis o f recent
          reviews and studies, it appears that rural poverty remains a primary challenge even
          though projectionstend to suggest a decline inrural poverty.

          The review o f MKUKUTA Cluster 3 of Governance and Accountability noted the
          progress made since the Mid Year Review inMarcWApril 2005. It underlined the need
          for the dialogue between development partners and the government on accountable
          governance and anti-corruption to be regular and focused on matters o f substance. The
          review led to an agreement on a renewed effort in the dialogue, and reiterated the need
          to keep the momentum in the area o f corruption legislation reform and in the area o f
          public sector pay reform including employment allowances.
          The review finds very positive developments in the new budget system (the Strategic
          Budget Allocation System - SBAS) linkingresource allocation to MKUKUTA,thereby
          addressing previous weaknesses in this area. The policy - resource linkage has been a
          concern in earlier reviews o f the PRBS. In the context o f fiscal decentralization, the
          review underlined the importance o f producing annual consolidated expenditure reports
          from local Government Authorities (LGAs) that would enable an analysis o f
          overall expenditure pattern inrelation to targets inthe MKUKUTA.

          The review reports on progress on some issues within the public financial management
          area and a solid underlying process in the form o f the PEFAR. This review noted with
          concern, as did the MYR, that the FY04 National Audit Report has not yet been
          presented to the Parliament within 9 months as stated inthe Public Finance Act (2001).


Review of progress against PRSC-4 triggers and prior actions

193.    PRSC-4 marks the transition to a new performance assessment framework, which i s
closely aligned with the MKUKUTA. This entails substantive changes with regard to focus and
the role of indicators, specific policy actions, and underlying processes. In addition, the GBS
process has adopted a new assessment and commitment cycle, which i s expected to reduce
transaction costs and provide more timely inputs to the government's budget process. These




                                                  51

changes are reflected in the conversion o f triggers into prior actions for PRSC-4 as discussed
below.

194.    Overall, satisfactory progress has been made inthe completion o f triggers and eight o f the
ten triggers for PRSC-4, have been satisfactorily completed and have been converted into prior
actions with minor adjustments. The two triggers referring to the establishment of a procurement
cadre and an organization structure and staffing levels for procurement management units had to
be revised to reflect the actual work priorities o f the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority
(PPRA), which after its recent establishment in April 2005 has been preoccupied with providing
operational guidance to the procuring entities and dealing with procurement complaints. These
demands on the time o f the PPRA had been underestimated by government and these actions are
now expected to be completed by June 2006. However, overall progress in operationalizing the
new procurement system i s satisfactory. The prior action for PRSC-4 inthe area o f procurement i s
now the approval o f an organization structure for PPRA and the allocation o f adequate budgetary
resources by the Ministry o f Finance.

195.    UntilPRSC-3, the review process consisted of an Annual Review in October and a Mid-
year Review inMarcWApril. The cut-off date for the Bank's financing decision was typically the
mid-year review, when prior actions were expected to be completed, followed by negotiations and
Board presentation o f the PRSC. The new GBS framework has as its central decision point the
Annual Review in October, with a commitment o f development partners to make firm financing
decisions within six weeks o f the issuing o f the final Annual Review report. This implies that the
expected completion date for prior actions i s now October. Inmoving to this new time-table, the
trigger on budget execution which initially covered the entire FY05 and the first half o f FY06 has
been adjusted to cover only FY05, while budget execution duringthe entire FY06 will be a trigger
for PRSC-5.

196.    Inorder to enhance the specificity of triggers, those relating to progress inthe reform of
crop boards and the implementation o f the Strategic Plan for the Implementation o f the Land and
Village Land Acts have been amended to include specific benchmarks.

197.    Another adjustment refers to the inclusion o f sector issues inthe new PAF framework and
the shifting project financing to the PRSC in specific sectors. Specifically, starting with PRSC-4
Bank financial support to health through the existing Adaptable Program Loan (which disburses
through the sector basket) will begin to be allocated to the PRSC instrument, based on targets
defined within the APL - commensurate increase in health's budget allocation under the PRSC,
improvements inprocurement and monitoring o f progress in waste management -- and dialogue at
the sector level. As agreed with partners engaged inthe sector, a satisfactory annual sector review
for health i s thus a prior action for PRSC-4 and each subsequent PRSC. PRSC-5 will also cover
education and water, with the relevant satisfactory sector reviews as additional triggers for PRSC-
5. In this context, it will be important to protect progress made in the context o f the sector
programs regarding levels o f sector financing as well as procurement and environmental
safeguards. This inclusion o f sectors in the PRSC also justifies the increase in the amount o f
PRSC support.

Completed. The Draft ActionPlanfor crop boardreforms has beendeveloped by the government and was
circulated to development partners on October 12,2005. The Action Plan details steps to implement the
recent Cabinet decisions on crop boardreforms which were to: (i)      abolish the levy which financed the
runningcosts o f the boards, to be replacedwithbudget financing; (ii) the crop development funds,
                                                                         abolish
(iii) thequalityofextension;and(iv)undertakemheranalysisonsomespecificelementsof
     improve
reform such as review o f one license rule incoffee industry.As part o f the implementation o f the action
plan, government has issued a Ministerial circular for crop boards to stop charging leviedcess as o f July lst,
2006. Inaddition, the circular establishes that licenses will only have to be issued once and that no license
fee shall be charged, that crop boards shall be responsible for regulatory f i c t i o n s and that the crop boards
prepare strategic plans which provide a detailed account o f the crop boards' functions, manning levels, and
financial requirements. With regard to the participation o f crop boards incrop promotion functions, these
are to be shared with the private sector and thus appropriate boundaries inexecuting these functions as well
as an appropriate institutional framework for executing these functions and the mechanism for their
financing and accountability have to be agreed by stakeholders. Finally, the circular also stops the charging
of crop levy for crop development funds. Incase stakeholders agree that crop development f i d s should
continue or be established, they will have to agree on financing, management and accountability issues.
Ministerial orders to remove the blind auction, to discontinue the input voucher programme, and to open up
coffee cherry buyingto those who invest incommon pulperies will also be issued. Subsequent amendments
to at least two Crop BoardActs are planned to be submitted to Parliament by October 2006.

Progressinthe implementationof the strategicplanfor operationalizingthe Land Act and Village
Land Act, includingissuingof 400 Certificates of Customary Rights of Occupancyduring first halfof
FY06.
Completed. During2004/5 11,693 farms were surveyed with the issue o f 537 Certificates o f Customary
Rights o f Occupancy (CCRO). The target for the 2005/6 financial year i s to survey 2,500 individual farms,
withthe issuance o f 834 CCROs. Duringthe first halfo fFY06,378 CCROshave beenissued. While the
actual number o f 378 CCROs issued i s lower than the 400 CCROs that were expected to be issued, the
underachievement inissuing CCROs didnot affect the success o f the pilot. Infact the pilot, initially
contained inMbozi district, was so successful that it is already being scaledup inat least 3 more districts.
The key elements which were piloted successfully were: (i) district landofficials and Village
                                                                training
Councils to demarcate village boundaries and issue Village Land Certificates (VLCs); (ii)          training district
officials and village land committees to demarcate boundaries o f individually held land (without detailed
surveys) and issue CCROs; and (iii) publicise the potential benefits o f CCROs and VLCs. Inaddition
                                        to
there has been further dissemination o f the strategic plan to villages, districts, and regions.

businesses and eliminates the multiplicity o f regional and national licenses by introducing a single
registration certificate. It also eliminates the necessity to renew licenses o n an annual basis as well as
activity specific fee schedules. Inaddition, it provides for the creation o f a universal national business data
base o f registeredbusinesses. It i s expected that a number o f weaknesses o f the billwill be addressed inthe
Course of stakeholder consultationsprior to the second reading inparliament.

Completed. The budget for FY06 reflects the priorities set inthe MKUKUTA withprogress in
implementing the strategic budget allocation system, which i s government's tool to ensure that sector
expenditures are aligned with the desired outcomes inthe MKUKUTA.
Expenditure outturn for FY05 consistentwith approvedbudget
Completed. InFY05, expenditures inthe priority sectors remainedprotectedand actual spending exceeded
the budgeted amounts, accounting for 55.1 percent o f total expenditure (compared to 44.2 percent inFY04).
A broader measure o fbudget consistency are the deviations betweenbudgeted amounts and actual
expenditure at the vote level. InFY05, this deviation amounted to an average o f 20.4 percent compared to
23 percent inthe preceding year.
NationalAudit Office staff has beentrained, andprocurementandinstallationof computer

audit and connectivity with the IFMS is being established. Inaddition to ongoing capacity building efforts,
staff training by the Accountant General's Office on the IFMS will be completed by April/May 2006
allowing future audit through IFMS.

Completed. The organization structure o f the PPRA has beenapproved. The MOFhas also authorized
PPRA to commence the recruitment process inaccordance with the approved structure and allocated
adequate space to PPRA. PPRA will have recruited about 36 people by next fiscal year.
Pay enhancementconsistent with the approvedbudget for FY06,and the overall thrust of the pay
reform.
Completed. Public service salaries increased by 8.34% for the lowest paid, while salaries inother grades
increased on average by 12.5% duringFY06.
Process agreedto reformthe publicsector allowancesregime, based on the recommendationsof
ongoingreview.
Completed. The government has set up a Task force which has started inFebruary 2006 to carry out a
comprehensive review o f the allowance regime. As an immediate task, it was asked to look into the
possibility o f increasing the FY07 personal emoluments budget by reducing the allocation o f the major
allowances inOther Charges, particularly per diem, extra duty, honoraria, and expenditure o n fuel and
vehicle maintenance.
Satisfactoryhealthsector review.
Completed. The review was held inApril 2005. The review was heldinApril 2005. Judged by the agreed
milestones, performance over the previous year was mixed. The advent o f the Joint Rehabilitation Fund, the
successful integration o f health into the MKUKUTA, the scaling up o f AIDS care and treatment and a
substantial budget increase (FY2004/5) were all registered as achievements. However, little progress was
made in tackling the human resources for health (HRH) crisis. The Development Partners, inparticular the
Bank, have agreed to work closely with the government on defining effective HRHstrategies inFY06.

The Joint Review, the State o f Healthreport, andthe updated health sector performance profile point to
improvements inhealth service delivery between 2000 and 2005. Most importantly, the Demographic and
Health Survey o f 200415 evidenced a dramatic drop ininfant and under five mortality (of 31and 24 percent,
respectively). However, there was no commensurate improvement inthe area o f maternal and reproductive
health as maternal mortality, fertility and contraceptive prevalence all remainedunchanged. Inresponse,
budget allocations for contraceptives and emergency obstetric care are being closely monitored by partners.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGAND EVALUATION
200.    Monitoring arrangements. Tanzania has established a comprehensive monitoring system,
which covers outcome, output, process, and input indicators. This system comprises three
interrelated tiers. The MKUKUTA monitoring system focuses on the measurement o f impact,
outcomes, and proxy indicators. Sector programs, such as those for education and health, focus on
the tracking o f output indicators with adequate monitoring mechanisms in place. The PER-MTEF
processes focus on inputs,with an emphasis on budget allocation and budget execution. Inorder to
strengthen domestic accountability, the PRSC supports regular reporting to the public in all areas
coveredby the PRSC.

201.    Inthe context of the PRSC and the MKUKUTA, outcome, output, and input indicators
provide direct information on the status o f poverty in all its dimensions. Monitoring o f these
indicators i s based on a broad range o f surveys and administrative data systems identified in the
MKUKUTA monitoring master plan. The Poverty and Human Development Report (PHDR),
which i s published bi-annually, consolidates poverty measures from various sources, and provide
analysis of poverty trends and underlying factors. Sector reviews are key monitoring mechanisms
for outputs at the sectoral level, and the PRGF reviews and the quarterly macro-financial
developments report will be the key sources for the assessment o f the macroeconomic situation.
Progress inpublic expenditure management covering both improvements in systems and enhanced
allocative and operational efficiency inthe use o f inputs will be tracked by the annual PEFARs.

202.    An additional dimension o f the monitoring framework covers the government-donor
relationship in monitoring progress on PRSC objectives, such as enhanced local ownership o f the
development process, participation by all stakeholders, and efficiency o f aid delivery mechanisms.
This dimension will be reviewedinthe context o fthejoint annual reviews o fthe JAS and through
a mid-term and final assessment o f the performance o f government and development partners in
implementing the JAS in line with JAS indicators, targets, and actions. These assessments will be
carried out by an Independent MonitoringGroup.

203.    Supervision and subsequent PRSCs. Supervision and preparation o f the subsequent
credits and grants will take place in close collaboration with other donors and be consistent with
the MKUKUTAreview mechanism. For most o f the program areas, supervision and dialogue will
be carried out on a continuous basis inthe context o f sectoral or thematic programs. This includes
the PER process, the PFMRP, the PSRP, the ASDP, the BEST program and sectoral programs. A
joint GBS review will be conducted annually for an overall assessment o fprogress made ineach o f
the program areas. In addition, the achievement o f PRSC targets will be assessed annually in the
context o f the MKUKUTA review that will document the progress made in the MKUKUTA
implementation and analyze the outcomes o f reforms. The reform program sets out clear
quantitative and qualitative benchmarks for the implementation period o f the MKUKUTA. The
PRSC targets are fully consistent with the MKUKUTA. Given satisfactory progress, Tanzania's
reform program will be supported through subsequent PRSCs under the programmatic lending
framework, subject to the approval o f the Board o f Executive Directors.

FIDUCIARYASPECTS
204.    Foreign exchange. The safeguards assessment o f the Bank o f Tanzania (BOT),which was
completed by the IMF on December 5, 2003, found that, while the bank had a relatively strong
internal control environment, some vulnerabilities existed, notably in the external audit and
financial reporting areas. Inorder to mitigate these vulnerabilities, staff recommended that the



                                                 57

BOTshould: (i) annual external audits that are conducted inaccordance with International
                  contract
Standards on Auditing (ISA); (ii)   adopt International Accounting Standards (IAS) as the financial
reporting framework; (iii)  establish a formal process o f reconciling accounting data to the program
data reported to the Fund; (iv) publish the full audited financial statements on a timely basis,
within five monthso f the financial year's end; and (v) adopt an audit charter for the internal audit
function to strengthen audit methodologies and procedures. The FY04 financial statements were
audited by a local auditor, TAC, using ISA standards, though TAC i s not itself fully ISA
compliant and the statements were publishedwith a brief delay. To ensure full ISA and I A S
compliance inthe audit o f the FY05 financial statements, the authorities have selected Deloitte and
Touche, Johannesburg to conduct a joint audit with the TAC. The BOTwill hold a new three year
external I S N I A S compliant audit tender by early September covering the FY06 and FYO8. The
BOTboard has adopted IAS as its financialreporting framework, and areconciliation process was
recently adopted.

205,     Budget resources. In depth assessment o f Tanzania's public financial management and
procurement systems have been carried out through a CFAA in 2001 and a CPAR in 2003 as well
as in the context o f the annual Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability reports (PEFAR).
The "Public Expenditure Management Country Assessment and Action Plan (AAP)- Tanzania"
prepared in2004 concluded that over the last three years Tanzania has made significant progress in
the P E M reform process and that Tanzania meets 11 of the 16 benchmarks, which places
Tanzania's PEMamong the best performing in Sub-Saharan Africa.

206.     The assessment also identifiedareas where progress is yet to be made. The coverage
of fiscal reports continues to be limitedto the central government. Fiscal reporting needs to cover
the GFS definition o f the general government sector, Le., including both central, and local
governments, as well as all government operations whether or not they are funded through the
budget. External audit has not been sufficiently strengthened and delays in the submission of
external audit reports still persist. The ongoing work on internal audit needs to be continued to
make it effective. The procurement system does not meet the benchmark due to weak enforcement
and limited accountability in the current system. Also, a Fiduciary Risk Assessment Report issued
bythe Department for InternationalDevelopment(U.K.) inMay 2004 concludedthat: "The overall
problems however remain those o f a weak fiduciary contract between citizens and the state,
inadequate domestic revenue collection, limited delivery o f public goods, inadequate monitoring,
inefficient capacity, non-compliance, lack o f enforcement, and inadequate oversight". The PRSC
contains a strong focus on government's efforts to address residual weaknesses in the areas
of internal and external audit as well as procurement. A Public Finance Management Reform
Program i s in place to ensure sustained improvements in Tanzania's public expenditure
management system.

DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITING
207.     Borrower and credit amount. The borrower is the UnitedRepublic o f Tanzania. A single-
tranche credit o f SDR 140 million (US$200 million equivalent) would be made available upon
credit effectiveness, anticipated for July 2006. The closing date o f the operation would be June
30,2007. It i s envisaged that there will be four further single-tranche, annual PRSCs to support the
implementationo f the MKUKUTA induringthe period FY08 - FY11.

208.     Disbursement, reporting, and auditing arrangements. The proposed credit will follow
the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy credits. Credit proceeds will be
disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the development policy program and not tied to



                                                   58

any specific purchases or be subject to procurement requirements. Once the credit i s approved by
the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds o f the credit will be deposited at the request o f the
Borrower by IDA in an account designated by the Borrower at the Bank o f Tanzania and which
forms part o f the country's official foreign exchange reserves. The Borrower shall ensure that upon
the deposit o f the Credit into said account, an equivalent amount i s credited inlocal currency to an
account that i s available to finance budgeted expenditures. The Borrower will provide a written
confirmation   to the Bank when the amount has been credited to an account that i s available to
finance budgeted expenditures. If the proceeds o f the credit are used for ineligible purposes as
defined in the Development Credit Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to promptly upon
notice from IDA, refund an amount equal to the amount o f said payment to IDA. Amounts
refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration o f this credit will be
the responsibility o f the Ministryo f Finance.

209.    The following arrangements support the requirements related to fiduciary assurance:

    0   Foreign reserve account. The Government will acknowledge receipt to IDA o f the money
        into the foreign reserve account and the crediting o f this amount in local currency to the
        Tanzania Government Consolidated Fund Account.            While no external audit will be
        required, it i s expected that the confirmation o f receipt will be countersigned by the
        Accountant General and the Controller and Auditor General.

    0   Public (government) accounts. The Controller and Auditor General i s required by law to
        produce hisher annual report to Parliament on the public accounts within nine months o f
        the financial year-end. IDA will have access to those reports.

    0   Bank ofTanzania.     The annual entity financial statements o f the Bank o f Tanzania, audited
        in accordance with international auditing standards as promulgated by the International
        Federationo f Accountants, are publicly available.
ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS
210.    The PRSC contributes to the financing o f the implementation o f Tanzania's MKUKUTA
across all three MKUKUTA clusters, but the policy dialogue focuses primarily on institutional
reforms in selected areas. This section thus discusses (a) the likely environmental effects o f the
actions monitored under the PRSC performance assessment framework and (b) the overall capacity
of government to monitor and mitigate environmental effects o fbudgetary expenditure.

211,    With respect to the policy reforms contained in the Performance Assessment Framework
and supported by the operation, and given the potential negative environmental implications o f
policy reforms and their implementation, several measures are taken to ensure that any negative
environmental effects o f the various activities will be properly addressed by the government o f
Tanzania in collaboration with its development partners. Among the policies supported by the
operation that may raise concerns from an environmental perspective i s the rehabilitation o f
 15,000 km o f roads by 2010. The implementing agency for road works on mainroads in Tanzania,
TANROADS, has established procedures for the environmental impact assessment o f its road
works. The preparation o f EL4 and EMP i s mandatory for all upgrading works. An environmental
unit at TANROADS reviews such EIA (normally done by external consultants) and monitors the
implementation o f the EMP. Only very l o w impact road works are done on rural roads by the
local governments. The supervising agency at PMORALG needs to build up some EA capacity to
advise the LG accordingly. Inthe rural sector, another area o f potential environmental and natural
resource concerns, supported country policies will promote a more sustainable use o f natural
resources and minimize waste. The implementation o f the crop board reform actions i s unlikely to



                                                  59

have significant adverse environmental effect. The crop board reform action plan o f October 2005
focuses on improving the legal and regulatory framework for coffee, cotton and other traditional
export crops. The actions include abolishing levies and fees, increased accountability to
stakeholders, greater transparency and elimination o f rent seelung behavior, rationalization o f
licensing fees, and discontinuance o f some input subsidy programs (e.g. the input voucher
program). Crop board reforms are purely institutional reforms to improve marketing and access to
markets and any increased levels o f activity resulting from crop board reforms are being monitored
under the country's framework for managing environmental risks, as outlined below. The Land
Act and the Village Land Act will enhance land tenure and security and promote community based
land and natural resources management. These reforms should yield positive environmental effects
in sustainable land and water management. Increased agro-processing is not likely to have
significant  environmental or natural resource effects and will be subjected to government
environmental management policies the Bank considers adequate to reduce any risks o f significant
effects.

212.     In analyzing potential effects of supported country policies on the environment and the
government's environmentalmanagement capacity inthe roads and rural sector, the Bank relies on
a variety o f analytic work undertaken over the past years. These include a Strategic Environmental
Assessment under previous PRSCs and analytic work underpinning environmental aspects o f
investment projects, including Bank projects in the roads, water, and energy sector. In addition,
the Bank supported studies on the interactionbetween poverty and environment as well as growth
and environment.

213.     As sectoral support for health, water, and education is being shifted from specific sectoral
operations to the PRSC, the PRSC draws on the environmental management systems that
government has established with the support o f these projects. PRSC-4 now explicitly includes
support for the health sector and as such continues to support and monitor government's medical
waste management.

214.     Inaddition to the assessment ofpotential effects ofpolicy actions directly supported by
the PRSC, the PRSC also supports government inits efforts to monitor and mitigate environmental
effects o f public expenditures, financed from domestic resources and general budget support
provided under the GBS framework.           The implementation o f the National Environmental
Management Act will strengthen in-country capacity for screening, monitoring investments for
positive and negative environmental effects and the ability at national and district level for
identifying mitigation measures for reducing effects. The Act i s very comprehensive and has
specific provisions for EA, SEA as well as conflict resolution and administrative processes for
pollution charges according to the `polluter pays' principle. The Vice President's Office and the
National Environmental Management Council have been supporting the development and
implementation o f various sector-specific guidelines for EA (initially inroads and agriculture), and
have more recently pursued procedures for strategic and sectoral environmental assessment to
permit mitigation o f any adverse environmental effects while taking advantage o f potential
synergies betweenpoverty reduction and environmental protection efforts.

PARTICIPATORY ASPECTS
215.     The PRSC i s grounded invarious participatory processes which are critical in defining the
reform agenda and monitoring its implementation. The reform agenda supported by the PRSC
derives from Tanzania's MKUKUTA, which has been developed througha consultative process in
which government sought inputs and feedback from a wide array o f stakeholders representing all



                                                 60

levels o f society and all regions o f Tanzania. Similarly, Tanzania's MKUKUTA monitoring
system also i s open to inputsfrom inside and outside government.

216.    Aside from the MKUKUTA, the government of Tanzania carries out wide ranging
consultations on most policy reforms and many o f the policy areas covered by the PRSC are
underpinned by sectoral or thematic processes that are open to stakeholders from civil society,
NGOs, academic and research institutes, the private sector, and the donor community. This
includes the PER process as a regular forum for dialogue on public expenditure, financial, and
macro-economic management, the Investor Round Table and the Tanzania National Business
Council for government -private sector dialogue, and the environment working group. Inaddition,
Tanzania has also put inplace a process for an independent monitoring o f the government - donor
relationship, which also covers the PRSC.

217,    The design o f the GBS framework seeks to encourage the further development of
participatory review processes inall areas, which would then provide the main inputsto the overall
GBS assessment.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
218.    PRSC-4 supports the implementation o f Tanzania's MKUKUTA and there are two closely
interrelated and overlapping sets o f risks. The first set concerns risks that are related to the design
of the GBS process in Tanzania and the effective utilization of PRSC resources towards the
achievement o f the MKUKUTA objectives, including the reliance on the domestic budget process,
the transition to sector review processes, weak domestic accountability, and fiduciary risks.
Subsequently, we discuss the more general risks that may interfere with the successful
implementation of the MKUKUTA.

    e   Reliance on domestic budget process. The utilization o f PRSC resources i s determined
        by the domestic budget process with the possibility that resource allocation is influenced
        by other factors than the pursuit of the MKUKUTA objectives. The principal mitigating
        measure derives from strengthening the role o f domestic stakeholders in budget
        formulation and budget review. Government's continued commitment to an open and
        participatory PER and budget process i s an important and well established tool to support
        and monitor consistency o f budget formulation and execution with the MKUKUTA. It i s
        worth noting that due to fungibilityo f resources, the allocative risk also exists for other aid
        modalities and the PRSC i s explicitly designed to address this risk.

    e   Transition to sector review processes. An important innovation o f the proposed PRSC
        program i s the shift from a detailed policy matrix with annual monitorable actions to
        greater reliance on sector reviews as the primary fora for dialogue and assessment.
        Experience from Tanzania's health sector review and from other countries suggests that it
        typically takes several years for these reviews to mature and to provide a fully satisfactory
        forum for dialogue and assessment. A central objective o f the GBS i s thus to ensure that
        these reviews do take place and improve over time as government develops adequate
        capacity for these sector reviews.

    e   W e a k domestic accountability. One o f the objectives o f the redesigned GBS framework
        i s to use domestic processes for the assessment o f progress and dialogue. This i s intended
        to foster domestic accountability. However, as some o f the analytic work has shown, these
        processes are still weak, partly because o f weak capacity o f civil society organizations,



                                                   61

NGOs, and the private sector to participate in these processes. In addition, recently there
have also been instances where government restricted the opportunities for an NGO to
express its views and criticism regarding government's education policies.       The GBS
development partners will closely monitor the openness and quality o f domestic processes
that feed into the GBS. In addition, further analytic work on domestic accountability
processes at the sectoral level i s envisaged.

Fiduciary risks. Both the CFAA and the CPAR identify significant fiduciary risks. In
recent years, government has implemented measures to reduce fiduciary risks, including
the approval and application o f new public finance and procurement acts, the full
operationalizaton o f the Integrated Financial Management System, and strengthening o f
the National Audit Office. The PFMRP and actions monitored by the PRSC are designed
to address wealaesses ingovernment's financial management and procurement systems.

Vulnerability of Tanzania's growth.              Tanzania's growth performance remains
vulnerable to external shocks which are exacerbated by domestic structural weaknesses.
At present, Tanzania suffers from food shortages and a severe energy crises, which is the
result of high oil prices, a severe drought which resulted in the loss o f hydropower
generating capacity, and delayed structural reforms and investments in the energy sector.
The GBS supports the strengthening o f the legal and regulatory framework for the power
sector as well as appropriate public expenditure measures to deal with the short term
effects o f the power crisis and to facilitate investments that would reduce vulnerability in
the future. The PER process also provides the forum for dialogue on managing other
aspects o f the drought, such as the need for food assistance to avoid famine in affected
areas. Other areas o f vulnerability to external shocks include tourism, which has been
become a leading source o f foreign exchange and which could be affected by
developments in the international security situation, agriculture which remains the main
source o f income and employment for Tanzania and exposed to climatic shocks, and terms
of trade, especially with regard to the prices o f the leading export commodities including
gold, coffee, tea, and fish, and import commodities, especially oil.

Aid-dependence. Tanzania's dependence on external aid, which is about 12 percent o f
GDP and finances almost half o f its budget, makes the country extremely vulnerable to
changes in donor sentiment. The potential impact o f cutbacks ingeneral budget support i s
likely to be larger than that related to traditional project support for two reasons. First,
general budget support financed about one third o f Tanzania recurrent government
expenditures in FY05 and cutbacks on recurrent expenditures would have an immediate
impact on service delivery. Second, a cutback inproject support typically only affects new
commitments, while disbursement o f existing projects typically continue. With respect to
general budget support, disbursements are directly subject to change at donor's discretion.
The PFM underlying the PRSC recognizes these risks and contains a general commitment
by all participating donors that, in case budget support is to be reduced, this should be
done in a gradual manner. The Tanzania Assistance.Strategy also recognizes the need to
design aid modalities with a view towards minimizing the scope for abrupt changes.
However, there i s also a clear recognition that the authorities need to maintain an
appropriate environment for sustaining relatively highlevels o f aid.

Decentralization. Another risk for the achievement o f MKUKUTA objectives arises fkom
the ongoing decentralization process, which shifts responsibility for key poverty reducing
programs in education, health, the water sector, and agriculture to the districts. The local


                                           62

        government reform program focuses on strengthening the capacity o f local authorities. As
        a result, there have been significant improvement in accountability processes at the local
        level and about 50 percent o f local authorities now meet basic accountability standards,
        compared to an estimated 10 percent only a few years ago. The PRSC also supports
        actions to strengthen the watchdog role o f beneficiaries at the community level through
        disclosure o f the flow o f resources to various activities at the grassroots level and
        expenditure tracking o f financial flows from the central government through the annual
        PERs.

    e   Capacity constraints. Although systems and capacities at the central level are generally
        stronger than at the local level, limited human resources capacity to implement and
        manage the PRSC reform agenda at the center represents another risk in the Tanzanian
        context, especially in the areas o f public expenditure management, procurement, and
        financial management. To mitigate these risks, the proposed PRSC focuses appropriately
        on the strengthening o f oversight arrangements. A large number o f capacity-building
        efforts are in place. Most reformprograms have capacity-building components embedded,
        including the PFMRP, the local government reform program, and the public sector reform
        programs. Similarly, sector programs and projects typically also contain capacity building
        components. The challenge for Tanzania i s to enhance the effectiveness of capacity-
        building efforts by shifting from supply-driven to demand-driven efforts and address
        capacity buildingin a holistic way, in which the incentive structure, education system, and
        specific capacity-building efforts are organized in a mutually reinforcing manner. Analytic
        work to address these issues i s planned. Inthe medium term, it i s expected that the shift
        from project to budget support by the Bank and other donors will release staff who are
        currently tied up in project management to play a greater role in overall public sector
        management.

219.    To ensure that such risks do not derail the implementation o f the MKUKUTA and PRSC,
appropriate monitoring instruments have been put inplace. The government's annual MKUKUTA
implementationreports, which build on the MKUKUTA monitoring system, and a well-established
annual PER mechanism, provide open and transparent arrangements for monitoring outcomes and
fiduciary risks. Moreover, the annual nature o f the PRSC provides a framework for appraising
risks identified inthe PEFAR and agreeing on necessary corrective actions.

Dear Ms.O'Connor,


                    RE: LETTEROF DEVELOPMENT POLICY

1,       On behalf of the Government o f the United Republic o f Tanzania (Government), I
hereby write to request for the approval o f the fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC 4) o f US$ 200 million (SDR equivalent).       This credit will enhance the smooth
implementation of the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction o f Poverty (NSGRP or
MKUKUTA) and Zanzibar's Poverty Reduction Plan (ZPRP). The credit will also
facilitate the continued implementation o f reforms including: the private sector and rural
development; macroeconomic stability; public financial management; public service
reform, governance and environmental sustainability.

I. BACKGROUNDANDRECENTDEVELOPMENTS


A.      MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

2.      Tanzania has sustained a strong macroeconomic performance characterized by
strong Growth Domestic Product (GDP) growth and low inflation. Fiscal discipline and
prudent monetary policy have played major roles in the Government's strategy for
achieving macroeconomic stability. Preliminary estimates show that the economy
performed well in the year 2005, with a GDP growth o f around 7 percent compared with
6.7 percent in 2004. The sectors that are estimated to have grown strongly duringthe year
include, trade and tourism, manufacturing, mining and construction, which together
contributed about 40 percent o f GDP. It i s noteworthy that the drought experienced during
the last quarter o f2005 has adversely affected food productionandhydropower generation.
This, coupled with the persistent increase in oil prices throughout 2005, exerted upward
pressure on inflation. After having successfully kept the inflation rate close to 4 percent, it
began inching upward, from 4.2 percent in June 2005 to the annual inflation rate o f 5.0
percent at end-December 2005. Official andprivate inflows, together with HighlyIndebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief, resultedin an increase in gross official reserves to US$
2.4 billion at end-December 2005, the equivalent o f 5 % months o f next year's imports o f
goods and non-factor services. In the same period, the nominal exchange rate o f the
shillingto the U.S.dollar depreciated from an average of Tsh 1,117 in the last quarter o f
2004/05 to Tsh 1,161 in the second quarter o f 2005/06. Tanzania expects to benefit
substantially fiom debt cancellation under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already finalized its assistance under this
initiative. InJanuary 2006, the IMF cancelled Tanzania's debt to the IMF inthe amount o f
US$336 million. The Government i s putting in place the best mechanism o f using these
hnds for the benefit o f the Tanzanian people. The Government has also continued
negotiations with the remaining bilateral creditors on prospective debt relief.


B.       PROGRESSINTHE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL
         STRATEGY FOR GROWTH AND REDUCTIONOF POVERTY (NSGRP)

3.       The Government will continue to implement the policy direction charted in the
NSGRP, which aims at attaining broad-based economic growth o f at least 6-8 percent
annually over the medium term with a view to attaining the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). The NSGRP's emphasis on shared economic growth translates into
particular attention to stimulating private sector investment, developing infrastructure,
buildinghuman capacity and a competitive economy. The Government intends to continue
to gear its economic policies to the three clusters o f outcomes delineated in NSGRP,
namely: growth and reduction o f income poverty; improved quality o f life and social well-
being; and good governance and accountability. A complete matrix o f indicators that would
allow measurement of progress towards the goals in the three cluster areas i s being
prepared through broad based stakeholder consultations. In parallel, the Government,
together with development partners, i s working on (i)costing the MDGs, and (ii)       putting



                                             66

together multi-year costed programmes for infrastructure and other priority areas. When
completed, these building blocks should allow to fully operationalize the NSGRP and
become part of a road map for scaling up o f aid and measuring success. The Government
reaffirms its commitment to ensure strong performance o f domestic revenues over the
medium term so as to gradually reduce Tanzania's aid dependence. To this end, caution
will be exercised in the implementation o f Special Economic Zones (SEZ) legislation,
particularly regardingpossible revenueloss implications.


C.       BUDGET SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S
         OWN REFORMPROCESSES

4.       The Government reaffirms that General Budget Support (GBS) i s the preferred aid
delivery modality for official development assistance in Tanzania, as it is an instrument
that fully complies with the country's legal framework, i.e. the Constitution o f the URT,
Chapter 7, Articles 135 and 136, which require that all revenuedfinances must be
deposited in the Government's Consolidated Fund and appropriated by the Act o f
Parliament, as well as the Public Finance Act 2001 part II, on control and management o f
public finance, stating that the Parliament should maintain control over public money and
the Minister for Finance should provide full and transparent accounts to Parliament for the
use o f resources and public moneys.

5.       GBS enhances national planning and implementation systems, country ownership,
transparency as well as a shifiing o f Government accountability from donors to its citizens.
It enables the Government to account for received external finance to domestic
stakeholders and to more easily monitor and evaluate the performance o f external
assistance insupporting national development and poverty reduction efforts.

6.       The Policy Assessment Framework (PAF) matrix had been commonly used to
assess Government's progress in various reform agenda under the PRS Icycle. With the
adoption o f NSGRP, a new PAF has been prepared which aligns the GBS review within
the existing fordprocesses with the aim o f minimizing transaction costs and strengthening
these fordprocesses.

REFORM PROGRAMME UNDER THE PAF 2005/06 -2006/07


7.       The Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) i s a framework for the annual
dialogue on the Government and Development Partners' (DP) performance in achieving
the targets set out in the MKUKUTA, and for DPs to ensure that the General Budget
Support (GBS) funds are spent in a responsible manner. Inthe 2004 annual review o f the
PRBSPRSC it was decided to start work on a new PAF and a redesign o f the PRBS. Our
objectives for the new GBS fi-amework are as follows:

     0   ensure better coherence with national policy as described inthe MKUKUTA;
     0   reduce transaction costs for GOTandDevelopment Partners;



                                             67

    0   draw on GoT's own processes to ensure transparency and accountability to
        domestic stakeholders;
     0  increase GOTownership, by avoiding the use o f conditionality as policy leverage
        and instead focus on due process (budget formulation, execution and reporting and
        auditing);
     e  have a common approach for all budget support Development Partners including
        the PAF, review times, shared analysis and assessment, shared commitment to
        provide foreign assistance commitments prior to the start o f the fiscal year and to
        frontload the support;
     0  establish a PAF with simpler and fewer actions that are outcome oriented;
     0  establish a structure of tranches that i s responsive to overall performance rather
        than focusing on conditionality and specific actions; and
     0  facilitate a transfer from sector financing to GBS by drawing in sector dialogue
        into the general GBS dialogue but with caution not to delve into sector detail due
        to highassociated transaction costs.

8.     The PAF consists o f outcome indicators, underlying processes, and temporary
                                                            . ~-
actions whose role and purpose i s described inthe following paragraphs.

9.     The general purpose o f the outcome indicators is to serve as a basis for an overall
assessment o f performance on macroeconomic stability, poverty reduction and public
expenditure and financial management.         The PAF indicators will be a subset o f the
MKUKUTA indicators. Since the MKUKUTA indicators are only expected to be finalized
during the first half o f 2006, the PAF indicators will be adjusted in line with related
MKUKUTA indicators in order to avoid deviating benchmarks and/or duplicating
processes.

10.    The purpose o f the identification o f underlyingprocesses is to establish a clear link
between the GBS as a funding mechanism and these processes as the forum for dialogue
and assessment o f Government's         performance in the sectors covered by the
PAF/MKUKUTA, using existing national processes. The underlying processes are
therefore complementary to the outcome indicators. For the MKUKUTA Clusters (section
1, 2 and 3 inthe PAF), the mainunderlying process will be the MKUKUTA review. Until
this process is in place, sector reviews will be the main source o f information on GoT's
performance in the clusters. The following definition of a "satisfactory sector reviews" has
beenagreedbetweenDPsand GOT:
    1. Reviews are conducted regularly as input to the budget preparation process and in
       line with the MKUKUTA MonitoringPlan;
    2. Review processes involve a wide range o f stakeholders under the leadership o f the
       Government;
    3. The main purpose o f reviews i s to establish relevant developments, and assess
       performance against agreed results andtargets;




                                              68

   4. Information and analysis for the Annual Review will be drawn primarily from the
         M K U K U T A monitoring    system in particular       the  MKUKUTA Annual
         Implementation Report and other reviews process outlined inthe PAF; and
    5. The review shows good progress against agreed targets and results.



A.       IMPROVED INVESTMENT AND BUSINESSENVIRONMENT


11.       The Government has made substantial progress in improving the investment and
business environment.The specific PRSC 4 prior action inthis regardwas as follows:

         Draft Billon BusinessActivitiesRegistrationSubmittedto Parliament

12.      This prior action was completed. The Billwas submitted to Parliament and read for
the first  time on July, 27th 2005. It has now been widely distributed for stakeholders'
comments. The Bill i s a significant step forward in reforming start-up procedures for
businesses and eliminates the multiplicityo fregional and national licenses by introducing a
single registration certificate. It also eliminates the necessity to renew licenses on an
annual basis as well as activity specific fee schedules. In addition, it provides for the
creation of a universal national business data base o f registered businesses. It is expected
that a number o f weaknesses o f the Bill will be addressed in the course o f stakeholders'
consultations prior to the second reading inparliament.

B.       AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT

13.      The Government has continued to reform the agriculture sector to ensure increased
contribution to economic development as well as poverty reduction. The following was the
PRSC 4 prior action:

         Progress in the implementation of the Action Plan for the Rationalization of
         Roles, Functions, Financing and Accountability of Crop Boards, consistent
         with the Agriculture Sector Development Strategy (ASDS), including issuing
         of ministerialcircularfor Crop Boardsto cease chargingleviedcess.

14,      The Government developed a Draft Action Plan for crop board reforms and
circulated to stakeholders in October 2005. The final Action Plan articulates the steps to
implement the recent Cabinet decisions on crop board reforms which include:

         (i)    abolishing the levy which financed the running costs o f the boards, to be
                replaced with budget financing;
         (ii)   abolishing the crop development funds,
         (iii)  improving the quality o f extension services; and
         (iv)   undertaking further analysis on some specific elements o f reform such as
                reviewing o f the one license rule incoffee industry.


                                              69

15.     To date, as part o f the implementation o f the action plan, Government has issued a
Ministerial circular for crop boards to stop charging leviedcess as o f July lst, 2006. In
addition, the circular establishes that licenses will only have to be issued once and that no
license fee shall be charged, that crop boards shall be responsible for regulatory functions
and that the crop boards prepare strategic plans which provide a detailed account o f the
corp boards' functions, manning levels, and financial requirements. With regard to the
participation of crop boards in crop promotion functions, these are to be shared with the
private sector and thus appropriate boundaries in executing these functions as well as an
appropriate institutional framework for executing these functions and the mechanism for
their financing and accountability have to be agreed by stakeholders, including farmers.
Finally, the circular also stops the charging of crop levy for crop development funds. In
case stakeholders agree that crop development funds should continue or be established,
they will have to agree on financing, management and accountability issues. Ministerial
orders to remove the blind auction, to discontinue the input voucher programme, and to
open up coffee cherry buyingto those who invest incommon pulperies, will also be issued.
Subsequent amendments to at least two Crop Board Acts are planned to be submitted to
Parliament by October 2006.

16.     An industry development levy on the export o f raw cashew nuts is currently
collected by the Cashewnut Board o f Tanzania to promote domestic processing o f cashew
nuts. Government will ensure that this levy will not be used to finance activities o f the
Cashew Board of Tanzania and, by October 2006, effect a transfer o f the responsibility for
the collection o fthis levyfrom the Cashewnut BoardofTanzania to an appropriate agent to
be identified by the Ministry o f Finance. In addition, Government will also review as to
whether the industrydevelopment levy is the best way to encourage domestic processingo f
cashew nuts.

17.     Ministerial orders to remove the blind auction, to discontinue the input voucher
programme, and to open up coffee cherry buyingto those who invest incommon pulperies
are envisaged and subsequent amendments to at least two Crop Board Acts are planned to
be submittedto Parliament byOctober 2006.

 18.    Incognisance ofthe needto promote rural development, the Government commits
to foster tenure security. Inthis regard, progress has been made inpreparing a prioritised
strategic plan and a corresponding program to strengthen the administrative capacity for
implementation o f the Land Act (No. 4, 1999) and the Village Land Act (No. 5, 1999). The
following prior action has been completed.

        Progress in the implementation of the strategic plan for operationalizing the
        Land Act and Village Land Act, including issuing of at least 400 certificates of
        customary rights during the six months of FY of 2005/06.

 19.    During2004/05 financial year, 11,693 farms were surveyed and 537 were issued
Certificates of Customary Rights o f Occupancy (CCRO). The current target for the



                                               70

2005/06 financial year i s to survey 2,500 individual farms, with the issuance o f 834 CCRO.
Duringthe first half of the financial year 2005/06, 158 Certificates o fVillage Land (CVLs)
and 378 CCRO have beenissued. While the actual number o f 378 CCROs issuedis lower
than the 400 CCROs that were expected to be issued, the underachievement in issuing
CCROs did not affect the success o f the pilot. Infact the pilot, initially contained inMbozi
district, was so successful that it i s already being scaled up in at least 3 more districts. The
key elements which were piloted successhlly were: (i)        training district land officials and
Village Councils to demarcate village boundaries and issue Village Land Certificates
(VLCs); (ii) training district officials and village land committees to demarcate boundaries
o f individually held land (without detailed surveys) and issue CCROs; and                 (iii)to
publicise the potential benefits o f CCROs and VLCs. Production o f VLCs and CCROs
was not the primary objective o f the pilot but mainly a spin-off from the piloting. As
application for CCROs i s voluntary, the number o f CCROs issued should be seen as a
proxy for implementation o f the pilot, and not as an outcome against which success o f the
pilot should be measured. Inaddition there has been further dissemination o f the strategic
planto villages, districts, andregions.

20.      Rural roads continue to be part of the Government's reform programme. Efforts are
underway to strengthen the capacity at district level to manage road rehabilitation and
maintenance. A consultant has been commissioned to prepare the inventory and
classification of the roads under the Local Government Authorities (which year). This work
i s scheduled for completion in June 2006. The proposed Road Act and the accompanying
Schedules will be ready for distribution to stakeholders in April 2006 and a Bill will be
tabled to Parliament for first reading in November 2006. It is projected that the proposed
RoadAct will be submittedfor parliamentary approval by April 2007.

C.       MACROECONOMIC STABILITY

21.      The Government continues to emphasize fiscal and debt sustainability as key areas
of economic reforms. Economic performance during 2006 i s expected to be affectedby the
impact o f drought on agriculture and the availability o f hydro-electric power. While the
extent o f the impact i s not yet filly known the provisional estimates suggest that the real
GDP growth rate for 2006 i s likely to be below 7.2 percent previously projected. These
estimates assume normal rainfall during the long rains season and expeditious introduction
of measures inthe power sector to address the deficit o f hydropower generation inorder to
limit the adverse effect o felectricity supply shortfalls on industry andmanufacturing.

D.       IMPROVEMENT IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DELIVERY OF PUBLIC
         SERVICES

22.      The Government is committed to ensuring effectiveness in the delivery o f public
services, To this end, a number o f reforms have been made in this area with the view to
improve delivery o f services. The following i s a summary o f budget execution for 2004/05
and the status inthe implementation o f the recent developments inthe budget formulation.
The improvements inthis process benefited from the feedback obtained through the lessons



                                                71

learnt by the key players during implementation. These experiences have formed the basis
for some modifications to improving the linkages betweenbothbudget formulation and its
execution.


23.     Budget execution for 2004/05 was broadly in line with estimates though deviation
of expenditure outturn from budget was experienced. The significant part o f the deviation
emanated from reallocations for PE enhancements. The Government is addressing this
problem by ensuring that starting 2006/07 PE budgets are fully provided for under the
respective vote. These will include provisions for existing pay levels, salary adjustments,
promotions and new recruitments.       The 2004105 expenditures in the priority sectors
remained protected and actual expenditure stood at 55.1 percent o f total expenditure
compared to 44.2 percent in 2003104. Thus the following PRSC 4 prior action has been
achieved:


        Budget execution for 2004/05 in line with approved budget and with
        MKUKUTA implementation, consistently reported as per identified budget
        codes for budgetactivitiesrelatedto MKUKUTA goals andstrategies.


24.     The followingPRSC 4 prior action has also been achieved:


        Approvedbudget2005/06 in linewith MKUKUTA implementation,
        delineatingbudgetcodes for budgetactivitiesrelatedto MKUKUTA goals and
        strategies.


25.     The budget for 2005/06 reflects the priorities set in the NSGRP with progress in
implementing the strategic budget allocation system (SBAS). SBAS is a government tool
for ensuringthat sector expenditures are aligned with the desired outcomes inthe NSGRP.


26.     Other PAF actions include the following:


27.     Proper costing of cross cutting outcomes/targets: The Government is
undertaking the exercise to cost the NSGRP and to date a consultant has conducted a pilot
study and the sample MDAs have already provided their inputs.It is expected that costing
o f the NSGRP will be a key input in the dialogue regarding the contribution o f the public
sector to the implementationo f the NSGRP.


28.     Rationalisation of MDAs strategic plans and NSGRP: This exercise is in its
advanced stage. A draft Planning and BudgetingManual was prepared and circulated to the
Ministries and Regions. All MDAs will be taken through the manual during MTEF
training. This manual aligns M K U K U T A with institutional strategic plans and Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). It also emphasises that the MTEF is to become


                                             72

                                                                                                I




the point o f reference for institutional and national planning models in next year's cycle,
This will reduce confision and ensure coherence inaligning various processes/initiatives.

29.     Sectoral linkages and collaboration: Various sectors will be linked through the
newly agreed clusters using the PER process. These clusters are: Growth and reduction o f
income poverty, Improvement of quality o f life and social well being, Governance,
Financial management and accountability, and Macroeconomic stability. This will provide
the vehicle through which various activities will be implemented. The 2006/07 budget
process will benefit from the inputs from the existing sector studies. However, starting in
2007/08, output from the PERprocess under the cluster approach will feed into the budget
process, The revised PER calendar ensures that one annual process i s completed intime to
form the basis o f a well informed budget. This will also strengthen the related budget
dialogue, It is to be noted that some cross cutting issues may still be coordinated outside
the 5 clusters' collaboration framework.


30.     Ensuring that the Strategic Budget Allocation System (SBAS) as a tool for
allocation and analysis of resources is integrated with EPICOWIFMS: During the
2005/06 budget the output from SBAS was usedas inputs for the Enhanced MTEF Model.
All MDAs prepared their budgets in SBAS which were eventually exported to general
ledger for implementation. The facility i s also being developed to allow the download o f
budget data from EPICOR back into SBAS for analysis. Inaddition, further customization
of SBAS has beencarried out to address the identifiedgaps inits functionality.


3 1.    Incorporation of PE into SBAS/Budget Guidelines: The budget for 2006/07 has
incorporated PE into SBAS. Thus allocations were made at vote level since it was not
feasible to establishmanhours embeddedineach o f the targetdcluster strategies.

32.     Budget monitoring and reporting to be consistent with the NSGRP: The efforts
are underway to prepare reports on the N S G W expenditure. These reports will also feed in
the preparationo fNSGRP progress reports.


33.     Linking of the LGAs allocations to the NSGRP: The regions have been brought
on board and their allocations are based on NSGRP starting 2006/07. Incognisance o f the
recently adopted formulae for allocating resources to LGAs, budget guidelines for 2006/07
- 2008/09 have issued their ceilings as block grants. Once these are subjected to the
formulae, they will then be inputted into the Planning and Reporting database (PlanRep) at
LGA's level and linked with NSGW. The data will then be exported to SBAS and
eventually to Epicor/IFMS. Thus 2006/07 budgets for LGAs will be consistent with
NSGW.

E.      IMPROVED PERFORMANCEOF THE PUBLIC SECTORAND THE
        OVERALL INCENTIVE ENVIRONMENT

34.     The Government had made substantial progress in the area o f Public Service
Reform Programme (PSRP) with the aim o f improving public service delivery so as to
contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. The reform strategy has continued
to focus on attracting and retaining better qualified staff and strengthening human resource
capacity in order to sustain the overall Government reform programmes. This will be
achieved through the Government's long-term plan o f capacity building as well as pay
reform which is performance orientated. The PRSC 4 prior action below has been
implemented.

        Pay enhancement consistent with the approved budget for FY06, and the
        overallthrust of the pay reform.


35.     Salary adjustments were made for 2005/06. Public service salaries increased by
8.34% for the lowest paid, while salaries in other grades increased on average by 12.5%
during 2005/06. A thorough review o f the medium term pay policy has been proposed.
This will focus on the consistency in implementingthe Medium Term Policy inrelation to
the employment levels for each MDA and their budgetaryimplications. This will ensure a
well informed criterion for budget decision.


36.     In the efforts to rationalise public sector allowances, the following PRSC 4 prior
action has been hlfilled:


        Process agreed to reform the public sector allowances regime, based on the
        recommendationsof ongoing review


37.     The Government has set up a Task Force to address the issue o f public sector
allowances. The Task Force i s composed o f senior officers form the Ministry o f Finance,
President's Office Public Service Management and Prime Minister's Office-Regional
Administration and Local Government. The Task Force i s undertaking a comprehensive
review of the allowances regime within the public service including the relevant policies,
regulation and rules and proposing measures to rationalise them which include possible
review o f regulations and rules currently in place. The immediate output from this task
force would be to enhance 2006/07 PE budget by rationalising allowances particularly the
per diems; extra duty; honoraria and expenditure on he1 and vehicle maintenance.          In
addition, work is going on under the PEFAR exercise that is likely to complement the work
o fthe task force.

F.       MINIMISATION           OF       RESOURCE          LEAKAGES          AND        THE
         STRENGTHENING OFACCOUNTABILITY

     (i)PublicFinancialManagement

38.      The Government has made substantial progress in establishing a Public
Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA). This went hand in hand with the
decentralisation of Central Tender Board functions. The organization structure o f PPRA
was completed and approved in February 2006. This paved the way to approving the
recruitment process and thus recruitment process will commence in April with the
intention to employ staff starting July 2006. To ensure efficient and effective
implementation of PPRA finctions,     adequateresources have beenprovided during2005/06
and sufficient resources will be reflected in the 2006/07 budget for this purpose. In this
regard, the following PRSC 4 prior action has been completed.


         The organization structure of the PPRA has been approved and additional budgetary
         resources have been allocated to PPRA.


39.      Progress has been made in ensuring that the National Audit Office (NAO) has
suitably qualified staff. An important objective o f the NAO i s to develop appropriate
capacity to carry out computer based audits o f the IFMS system. With regard to the audit
o f revenue collected through the Tanzania Revenue Authority, staff has been trained, and
procurement and installation o f computer equipment at the National Audit Office have
been completed. The N A O has also continued with its staff training program to strengthen
audit capacity. With regardto the audit o f Government expenditures, computers have been
procured. Installation and staff training will take place in April and May o f 2006, after the
completion of the audit of the accounts for 2004/05. This i s expected to facilitate the
transition to an audit through IFMSinthe near future. To this end, the PRSC 4 prior action
below has been achieved.


         National Audit Office staff trained, and procurement and installation of
         computer equipment at the National Audit Office completed, allowing audit
         throughIFMSinfuture periods


     (ii) Reductionof corruption

40.      The Government has continued to address the issue o f corruption in an effort to
minimise resource leakages and strengthen accountability. The approval by cabinet of the
Anti-Corruption bill which was expected by end-April 2006 has been delayed by the
prolonged period o f the change o f Government. Nevertheless, the Government pursued
vigorously its anticorruption agenda with declarations against corruption becoming a
common feature o f political statements, commencement o f preparations for the second



                                              75

cycle o f the National Anti Corruption Strategy and Action Plan (NACSAP 11).MDAs are
already in the process o f preparing Anti Corruption Plans for the new NACSAP. With
Bank and other donor support the Government i s also scaling up its effort to implement its
comprehensive legal sector reform program. In addition, Government plans to build the
capacity o f oversight and watchdog institutions as part o f its effort to increase the demand
for accountability and therefore act as a deterrent for corruption.

    (iii)ImprovementsinAidmanagement

41.     The new General Budget Support (GBS) framework foresees an Annual Review in
October, with a commitment o f development partners to make firm financing decisions
within two months o fthe Annual Review. This implies that the expected completion date
for prior actions i s now October. With the elimination o f the mid-yearreview, there i s also
no longer the option o f adjustingtriggers mid-course duringthe Annual Review.

42.     The Government in liaison with Development Partners, through PER process,
compiled the external resources commitments and projections for 2006/07 - 2008/09
MTEFperiod. The consolidated data on projects and basket funds were circulated to sector
ministries for review. These were then submittedto the Budget Guidelines Committee for
the preparations o f 2006/07 - 2008/09 Budget Guidelines.           The guidelines have been
issued as working documents.

G.      ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

43.     The Government       continues to reform the           environmental policies. The
Environmental Management Act, 2004 (EMA) entered into force in July 2005, and
regulations on Environment Impact Assessment and environmental audit were put inplace
end 2005. Guidelines on mainstreaming environment into sector and local government
planning and budgets are being finalised. An implementation and capacity building plan
for EMA, as part o f the implementation o f MKUKUTA, are also being finalised. This plan
includes financing arrangements including the development o f a sector wide approach with
an annual environment review process. This will be under guidance from the Environment
Working Group and the inputs to the first annual review will be the state o f environment
report andthe second PERo fthe environment.

H.      SECTORREVIEWS

44.     The health sector review process is well established and has improved continually
since the first review in 1999. It reviews the implementation o f the Health Sector Strategic
Plan and makes commitments on issues for the coming year. Within the existing health
sector review, 22 performance indicators are assessed every year, with a further 11
reviewedat longer intervals.

        Carried out a satisfactory Health Sector Review




                                              76

45.    The 6th Annual Joint Health Sector Review was concluded successfully in April
2005, with over 200 participants from Government, donor agencies, civil society and
NGOs. Judged by the agreed milestones, performance over the previous year was mixed.
The advent o f the Joint Rehabilitation Fund, the successful integration o f health into the
MKUKUTA, the scaling up of AIDS care and treatment and a substantial budget increase
(FY2004/5) were all registered as achievements. However, little progress was made in
tackling the human resources for health (HRH) crisis. The Development Partners, in
particular the Bank, have agreed to work closely with the Government on definingeffective
HRHstrategies inFY05/06.

46.     The Joint Review, the State o f Health report, and the updated health sector
performance profile point to improvements in health service delivery between 2000 and
2005. Most importantly, the Demographic and Health Survey o f 2004/5 evidenced a
dramatic drop in infant and under five mortality (of 31 percent and 24 percent
respectively). However, there was no commensurate improvement inthe area o f maternal
and reproductive health as maternal mortality, fertility and contraceptive prevalence all
remained unchanged. In response, budget allocations for contraceptives and emergency
obstetric care are beingclosely monitoredby partners.

47.     Inaddition, the reviewhighlightedthe following issues andchallenges:

    0   Closer engagement i s needed with the Ministryo f Finance within the sector review
        process. This i s highlightedinthe report which notes that payroll expenditure i s not
        keeping up with Other Charges, and that central government expenditure is
        expanding much faster than local government.          Even these increases are not
        sufficient to cover the requirements o f the health sector. The resource gap i s
        expandingwith the need to purchase more expensive pharmaceuticals for malaria,
        HIVand TB, the deterioration ofhealthinfrastructure andthe demand for increased
        salaries for medical professionals. At the same time, due to large commitments o f
        external earmarked financing (notably from the Global Fund and United States)
        flexible, discretionary resources are increasingly constrained;

    0   Development of a strong performance monitoring system is a priority particularly
        with respect to facility-based routine data, and building improved links with the
        Poverty Monitoring System; and

    0   Lessons can be learned from previous health sector review processes to improve
        subsequent reviews.

CONCLUSION


49.    The Government is committed to continue to implement sound policies to sustain
good performance and reform achievements realised. The Government reaffirms its
commitment inimplementation o fNSGRP, which sets economic growth, social well being
of Tanzanians, good governance and accountability as the pillars o f the country's
development agenda.       The Government underscores the need for continuation o f
appropriate monetary and fiscal policies, combined with key structural reforms which are
essential to achieving NSGRP goals. The remarkable achievements in implementing the
policy actions laid in the new PAF for PRSC 4 prior actions and other policy actions in
PAF for the coming year will continue to guide Government inpolicy reforms. It i s against
this background that the Government is requesting the International Development
Association to approve US$ 200 millionto support Government's efforts in sustaining and
continuing to implement the reforms.

                                        Preamble:

Whereas.., the Government o fthe UnitedRepublic ofTanzania (hereinafter referredto as
"the Government") has adopted the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction o fPoverty
(MKUKUTA), datedxx February2005;

Whereas...the Government, inorder to implement the MKUKUTA, is requestingexternal
contributions to the national budget from its Development Partners (DPs), to be provided
through the General Budget Support (GBS) mechanism; and

Whereas... the Government has recommended GBS as the preferred aid delivery
modality;

Whereas... the DPs and the Government wishto act inaccordance with commitments they
have made in the Monterrey Consensus on Financing for Development (2002), the Rome
Declaration on Aid Harmonisation (2003), the Marrakech Memorandum on Managing for
R.esults (2004), the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005) - commitments that will
be reflected inthe Tanzania Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS),

Therefore, inthis spirit of partnership aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing
poverty, implementing the reform agenda, and sustaining the development gains in
Tanzania, the Government (represented by the Ministry o f Finance, MoF) and DPs
signatory to this document (GBS Partners), have reachedthe following understanding:



                                        Objectives:

ANNEX 11. MAINFINDINGSAND BENCHMARKSOFHEALTHSECTORREVIEW

MainFindings

The 6th Annual Joint Health Sector Review was concluded successfully at Kunduchi Beach hotel,
between 4th and 6thApril 2005. It was preceded by a Technical preparatory meeting, held at Belinda
Hotel. This year's was the largest review yet, with over 200 participants. As well as government and
donor representatives, the meetingwas attended by a variety o f civil society and NGO representatives.
The Honourable Minister o f Health opened the meeting.

Judged by the milestones, performance over the last year has been mixed. The advent o f the Joint
Rehabilitation Fund, the successful integration of Health into MKUKUTA, the scaling up o f AIDS
Care and Treatment and a steep budget increase (FY2004/5) were all registered as achievements.
However, little if any progress was achieved in tackling the Human Resources crisis. The meeting
resolvedto address the issue with renewed commitment and urgency.

A good deal o f quantitative data was presented at the meeting, including the State o f Health report,
the updated health sector performance profile, and the ten-district study. Inmost respects these reports
point to improvement in health service delivery between 2000 and 2003. The major areas o f concern
were maternal health services and child malnutrition - neither o f which seem to have made any
improvement over the last 2 decades. Weaknesses in the routine information system mean that data
for 2004 i s still patchy.

Public Private Partnership was the theme o f the technical review this year. The clearest message
emerging in plenary was the need to replace the current government subsidy to faith-based providers
by a service agreement, linked to outputs. Another resonating theme was the need to expand the
opportunity for NGOs (including FBOs) to participate in health planning and management at district
level. More generally, there was a commitment by both public and private stakeholders to deepen
their collaboration. The recommendations o f the Technical Review extended well beyond these two
themes, However, lack o f time in plenary precluded reaching consensus on most of the
recommendations inthe report.

A good start has been made with the rehabilitation o f district health infrastructure. This is expected to
accelerate in the year ahead. Participants called for a holistic approach towards prioritisation and
effective monitoring o f implementation.

The Honourable Minister called for a new approach and renewed urgency in tackling the human
resources crisis. The challenges and the priorities are clear enough. But the shared commitment of
MOF, PO-PSM, PORALG and MOH will be needed in order to move forward. A cabinet paper was
seen as one way to secure thisjoint commitment.

The financing situation for Health has improved markedly. The PERdemonstrates a 33% nominal rise
inhealthbudgetbetween 2003/4 and this budgetyear. FY2005/6 will witness a further steep increase,
This good news is tempered by the fact that payroll expenditure is not keeping up with "other
charges", and central government expenditure i s expanding much faster than local government. Even
these increases are not sufficient to cover the requirements o f the health sector. A 167 billion resource
gap was documented by the MOH. New financial commitments continue to come on stream, often
initiated by short-term donor funding. Moreover, a substantial portion o f new money coming into the
sector i s tightly earmarked. Flexible, discretionary resources remain highly constrained and tough
choices on resource allocation will have to be made. Detailed discussion o f health financing in
general, and user charges / CHF in particular, was deferred to the Health Financing Workshop due in
early May.

  IMFExecutiveBoardCompletesFifthReviewUnderTanzania'sPRGFArrangement
                          andApprovesUS$4.1 MillionDisbursement

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fifth
review o f Tanzania's economic performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press Release No. 03/127.) The completion o f the
review enables a further release o f an amount equivalent to SDR 2.8 million (about US$4.1
million) under the arrangement, and will bringthe total disbursements under the program to
the equivalent o f SDR 16.8 million (about US$24.4 million.)

Following the Executive Board's discussion on Tanzania's economic performance, Mr.
Agustin Carstens, DeputyManagingDirector andActing Chair, stated:
"The Tanzanian authorities deserve credit for sustaining strong economic performance
through market-oriented policies within an appropriate macroeconomic framework. Despite
recent successes, Tanzania will need to maintain sound policies and steadily pursue key
structural reforms and capacity building for many years to remove key impediments to broad-
based growth and achieve lasting inroads against poverty. Sustained reform efforts will be
needed to stimulate private-sector led growth, particularly in such areas as infrastructure,
energy, governance, and the business environment.

"The authorities' strong efforts to maintain prudent economic policies are commendable,
particularly inlight o f the challenges posedby the impact o fthe drought on agricultural output
and energy production. Inthis context, it will be critical to resolve the energy supply issues
without unduly burdening public finances, while, at the same time, developing a sound
financial recovery plan to address the finances of TANESCO and a Power Sector Strategy to
address power generation over the mediumterm.

"In response to the drought, a more accommodative policy stance is warranted, including a
higher net domestic financing of the budget and a modest upward adjustment in money
growth, to avoid crowding out private sector credit to productive sectors. Nevertheless, the
authorities will closely monitor prices for signs o f emerging inflationary pressures and the
Bank of Tanzania will continue to use its full range o f tools, including heavier reliance on
foreign exchange sales and better management of government deposits in commercial banks,
to help better distribute the impact o f sterilization efforts on interest and exchange rates.

"The authorities' ongoing efforts to mobilize further domestic resources are critical to provide
resources for key development programs and to reduce the dependence on foreign aid. Inthis
regard, it will be important to deepen the tax and customs administration reform efforts to
help support government policy objectives. The extent o f tax incentives for Special Economic
Zones and the potential for revenueloss are worrisome and addressing structural impediments
to private sector growth would be a more effective and less costly way o f attracting private
sector investment. The effectiveness o f government spending will be enhanced by better
linking the goals o f MKUKUTA, Tanzania's new five-year PRSP, to the budget process and
the Medium-Tern ExpenditureFramework.

"The Fund commends the authorities' decision to ensure that the MDRIrelief from the Fund
i s channeled to addressing pressingsocial and growth-critical economic challenges, especially
those emanating from the drought, and without affecting domestic liquidity. In this regard, it
will be important to ensure that the use o fthese resources is subject to all regular procurement
and financial management rules and is incorporatedinthe budget, beginning in2006/07.

"The authorities' interest in a successor program in the context o f a PSI i s a logical
development in light o f Tanzania's position as a mature stabilizer," Mr. Carstens said. The
PRGF i s the IMF'sconcessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supportedprograms
are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process
involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP). This i s intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural and social policies
to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate o f 0.5 percent
and are repayable over 10years with a 5 %-year grace period on principal payments.
