Lessons first\n            outline that in an institutional environment of weak\n            interagency, operational collaboration, low motivation,\n            displacement of resources, inadequate technical, and program\n            management capacity, a single project with multiple\n            implementing agencies, and varied components, should be\n            avoided: the cost of inter-agency conflicts, outweighs the\n            expected benefits from inter-agency coordination. As an\n            indication, placement of a single Special Account with a\n            coordinating agency, impeded the progress of implementation,\n            and provided grounds for interagency conflicts, affecting\n            the flow of funds, and approval of expenditures. It is\n            suggested significant benefits can be derived by addressing\n            financial management issues at appraisal, to ensure\n            accountability, disbursement arrangements, and procedures\n            that facilitate project implementation. Furthermore, the\n            design of operational subprojects was not linked with\n            institutional objectives, hence, outputs were restricted to\n            physical targets, Instead, the project's technical\n            assistance, which will not have a sustainable impact, should\n            have been included in the institutional building process,\n            with responsibility over subproject line-agency operations.\n            Other lessons address capacity building issues, compliance\n            with the Bank's operational directives, delayed\n            procurement of civil works, goods, and services, and,\n            identification of appropriate community participation, and\n            involvement among community sub-groups."}, "docdt": "2000-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
