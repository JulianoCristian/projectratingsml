The project will\n            strengthen Balochistan's institutions involved with\n            environmental protection and natural resource use so they\n            are better able to undertake their responsibilities;\n            strengthen local communities and involve them in the design\n            and implementation of natural resources development and\n            management; improve provincial natural resources use\n            policies so that natural resources are used in an efficient\n            and sustainable manner; publicize environmental issues; and\n            implement high priority operations and pilot programs to\n            rehabilitate and develop damaged natural resources. The\n            pilot programs are designed according to the objectives and\n            strategies of Pakistan's National Conservation\n            Strategy. They will allow policy formulators to monitor the\n            effects of current policies and, if necessary, develop or\n            change them over time. The project will also provide\n            training to upgrade staff's skills, technical\n            assistance to help with project implementation, and funds to\n            prepare future natural resource management projects."}, "docdt": "1994-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
