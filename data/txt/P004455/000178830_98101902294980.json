achieving self-sufficiency in rice, increasing\n            incomes of poor farmers, and providing for better regional\n            balance in the Philippines' development effort at a\n            capital cost of $3,000 per benefited farm family. The\n            project will increase yields and farm incomes on about\n            80,900 ha in Southern Luzon, the Western Visayas and in\n            Mindanao by providing better water control and improved\n            drainage. Rice production will increase from about 234,000\n            tons of paddy at present to an estimated 516,000 tons at\n            full development in 1988. Approximately 45,000 farm families\n            and 11,500 landless laborers' families, a total of\n            about 316,000 people, most of who are below the poverty\n            line, will benefit directly from increased production and\n            subsequent employment. In Mindanao, it will provide for a\n            control program in four schistosomiasis affected irrigation\n            systems. The main risk concerns the availability at the\n            right levels and at right time of the entire package of\n            agricultural supporting services. The project provides\n            measures to minimize this risk. An additional possible risk\n            will be failure to properly maintain the irrigation\n            facilities. The project also provides measures to minimize\n            this risk."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
