PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This Project Completion Report (PCR) and Overview reviews
implementation of the National Irrigation Systems Improvement Project: II
for which Loan 1526-PH was approved on February 28, 1978. The Loan was
closed on July 13, 1987, and the undisbursed balance of US$16.3 million was
cancelled.
The PCR Evaluation Summary, Overview and Basic Data Sheet dated August
22, 1988, were prepared by ASTAG. They are based on a review of the
Appraisal Report (No. 1785b-PH) dated February 14, 1978, the President's
Raport (No. 2225-PH) of February 14, 1978, the Credit Agreement of March
15, 1978, and the PCR of June 1987 prepared by the National Irrigation
Administration in the Philippines. In addition, Bank supervision mission
reports, correspondence with the Borrower and internal memoranda on
project-related matters have been consulted.

PHILIPPIIIS
NATIONAL IRRMIQTION SY3TV S ItP"OVYRKUT PROJECT II
(Loan 1526-PH)
Evaluation Su ary
Obiectives
The National Irrigation Systems lmprovement Project II was an
effort by the Government of the Philippines to improve the socio-
economic conditions of about 56,500 families dependent on about 26
irrigation systems located in Regions 4, 5, 6, 19, 10, 11 and 12,
through: rehabilitation, upgrading and expansion of these systems;
reduction of the risk of schistosomiasis for about 140,000 people in
the endemic areas; and strengthening NIA's O&M and monitoring
capability. The project also aimed at initiating studies for future
irrigation development in the Philippines.
Implementation
Loan 1526-PH for US$65 million became effective on June 12,
1978. It comprised the entire foreign exchange component (46Z) of the
total project cost of US$140 million. The appraisal mission expected
disbursements to be completed by December 31, 1984, a year after the
scheduled completion of project works. However, implementation took
about 3-1/2 years longer. Delays were due to: frequent severe weather
conditions including several typhoons; delays in finalizing
engineering designs and completing preconstruction works; land
acouisition problems; equipment and vehicle supply problems; slow
contractual procedures; inadequate and delayed funding; the need to
continue uninterrupted water supplies to existing paddy lands during
construction in many areas; some desien changes; non-cooperation by
farmers in respect of on-farm facilities in some areas; peace and
order problems; and management difficulties arising from the wide
geographic disperaion of individual systems and difficult access to
some work sites.
The Loan was formally extended by 2 years to December 31,
1986, but construction continued into CY 1987 and was completed in all
major respects by June 1987.  With the exception of the delay
project completion, implementation has been satisfactory in spire of
several difficulties, and the project's objectives have largely been
realized.



Results
At c-apletion the project hae rehabilitated, upgraded and
expanded the 26 irrigation systems to serve 76,300 ha. This
represented 94S of appraisal targets. Necessary buildings, service
facilities, equipment and vehicles and spare parts needed to
strengthen NIA's O&M capability were provided; an agricultural input-
output monitoring system was introduced; the prevalence of
schi2tosomiasis in the endemic areas within the project was
s;v.stantially reduced from 222 at appraisal, in 1977 to 2.3Z in 1986,
with similar significant reductions in snail populations, and
infection rates in these areas. Feasibility studies for four possible
irrigation projects, including the detailed engineering for the
headworks of one of them were completed.
Ttae PCR has adopted somewhat overly optimistic projections of
cropping intensity and crop yields, on the basis of vhich it has
arrived at an ERR of 372. If this is adjusted to be in line with the
more realistic assumptions, the ERR is likely to be closer to about
222, which compares well with the appraisal projection of 232.
Disburseomnts and Costs
The project started off with disbursements in line with
appraisal projections, but the rate dropped to about 452 by mid-1981,
due mainly to the difficult financial situation in the country. In
view cif otherwise satisfactory performance, the Loan Closing Date was
extended by two years. as mentioned earlier, to December 31, 1986.
However, disbursements continued into CY 1987, against expenditures
for works in respect of which commitments had been made prior to the
Closing Date. US$48.7 million, of the original Loan amount of US$65
million, was utilized. The balance of US$16.3 million was cancelled
on July 14, 1987.
The final project cost in US dollar terms amounted to US
$80.7 1llion (Pesos 996.8 million), about 582 of the appraisal
estimate of US$140 million (Pesos 1,036 million) mainly due to the
devaluation of Philippine currency. In local currency terms, however,
the actual project cost amounts to 962 of the corresponding appraisal
figure.



Lesson* Learned
Project design and flexibility was generally appropriate to
the circumstances. However, appraisal could have taken a more
realistic view of some factors which *i8ht hamper implementation, such
as: speed and efficiency of Government procedures; frequent difficult
weather conditions; the geographic spread of project works; contractor
problems; peace and order problems; funding difficulties; acquisition
problems; delays in finalizing designs; etc.
EZecution of project works through Small Package Contracts
involving beneficiaries has demonstrated how farmer involvement of
this nature opens the way for improving understanding and cooperation
betweAn the impl_menting agency/Government and the beneficiaries.



PHILIPPIIIK
HATIbRAL IRRIGUION SYSTUIS IRPROVIZU? PROJlC? II
(Loan 1526-PH)
Overview
General
1.       This overview is based on the Project Completion Report (PCR) of
the National Irrigation Systems Improvement Project II (NISIP II) prepared
by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA), the implementing agency of
the Government of the Philippines (GOP), and ths Bank's Appraisal Report,
President's Report, Loan Agreement, supervision mission reports and
relevant information in the project files. The PCR reflects the findings
and opinions of Government officials closely associated with the project
and, in general, presents an objective view of project implementation,
performance and impact.
The Proiect
2.       Proiect Objectives. NISIP II was an effort by GOP to: (i) increase
production on about 74,000 ha of paddyland and 6,900 ha of sugarland
directly benefitting about 45,000 families of farmers and 11,500 families
of landless laborers, (comprising about 316,000 people) through
rehabilitation, upgrading and expansion of existing irrigation and road
infrastructure; (ii) reduco the risk of schistosomiasis for about 140,000
people in portions of the project area where the disease was endemLct (iii)
strengthen NIA's C:eration and Maintenace (O&K) and agricultural input-
output monitoring capability; and (iv) initiate studies for future
?rojects.  The proj;ct would accelerate socioeconomic development through
increased farmer incomes, generating additional farm and agriculture-
related employment opportunities, and improved farm-to-market access in the
project area, and would help meet Government's objectives of increased food
production and more balanced regional development.
3.       Irrigation Develovment. This component provided for
rehabilitation and upgrading of 26 existing irrigation systems situated in
Southern Luzon (Regions 4 and 5) Western Visayas (Region 6) infrastructure
and Mlindanao (Regions 9 to 12) serving 53,700 ha (46,800 ha paddy and 6,900
ha sugarcane), and construction of irrigation infrastructure and related
roads infrastructure to expand this area by a further 27,200 ha for paddy.
4.       Schistosomiasis Program. This program aimed at improving drainage
facilities serving about 22,000 ha of area affected by schistosomiasis in
Mindanao, providing personnel and supplies to enhance the SchistosemLasis
Control and Research Service's (SCRS's) capability to implement relevant
portions of this component. providing a health education program based on



-Yii-
schools and health centers in the affected areas, establishing a
diagnostic/treatment program for about 35,000 cases, and providing vehicles
and equipment.
5.       Other Components.  Other components included strengthening NIA's
O&M capability in the project area through the provision of buildings for
offices, stores, workshops, laboratories, quarters. etc. and O&M equipment;
introducing an agricultural input-output monitoring program of selected
systems; and initiating feasibility studies for about three new irrigation
projects.
Project Cost and Financing
6.       The total estimated cost of the project was US$140 million.  Bank
Loan No. 1526-PH for US$65 million, representing the entire foreign
exchange component (46Z of total cost), was signed on March 15, 1978.
Government was to finance the balance. In order to ensure continuous and
timely funding the setting up of a special fund, which would be replenished
each month to the level required to fund the next two month's operations,
was made a condition of loan effectiveness.
Imlementation
7.       The Loan was signed by the Executive Directors on March 15, 1978,
and became effective on June 12, 1978. At appraisal, disbursements were
expected to be completed by December 31, 1984, one year after the scheduled
completion of project works. However, implementation took about three and
a half years longer than envisaged. The main factors responsible for the
delay include the followings frequent adverse weather conditions including
typhoons; delays in finalizing engineering iesi8ns and completing
preconstruction works; land acquisition problems; delayed arrival of
equipment and vehicles for force account works; slow contractual
procedures; the difficult financial situation in the country which resulted
in delayed and inadequitte funding; the project mainly covered existing
paddy land which was under regular planting, necessitating continued supply
of water at most work sites during construction; design changes of
individual works during or just before construction ; non-cooperation of
farmers in some areas in respect of on-farm facilities; additional repairs
necessitated by typhoons and floods; peace and order problems in some
areas; and the geographic dispersion of individual systems and difficult
access to some which made overall management quite difficult (PCR Section
7.03).



-viii-
8.       All work relating to the irrigation portion of the project,
including the civil works of the schirtosomiasis control program werp
carried out by NIA, while the health aspects of the schistosomiasis program
were carried out by the Department of Health (DOH).
9.       The Loan Closing Date was formally extended for 2 years to
December 31, 1986, but construction continued into 1987 and was completed
in all majcr respects, with the exception of sime minor works, by June
1987. The final disbursement was made on July 13, 1987 and the undisbursed
balance of US $16.3 million was cancelled. Considering the difficulties
encountered during implementation and the nature of the project.
implementation performance has been satisfactory.
10.      Irrigation Development.  A total area of about 75,300 ha (of which
about 63,700 ha is rehabilitation area and 12,600 ha new/extension area)
was developed under the 26 irrigation systems included in the project at
appraisal. Within this area, 2,400 ha is under sugarcane and 1,380 ha
under cocoa and banana. The total area developed is about 941 of the
appraisal target. The rehabilitation area is about 1192, the new/extension
area about 46S, and the area under sugarcane about 39Z of appraisal
estimates.
11.      During detailed field investigations it was found that some of the
areas classified as new land were actually existing irrigation areas which
required rehabilitation, hence the increase by about 10,000 ha of the area
rehabilitated. The overall decrease of about 6Z (4,600 ha) in the total
area envisaged is not a major deviation and was due to the follomwing
different causes which affected different project sites to varying degrees:
inadequate water supply; conversion of arable land to residential and
commercial use. reluctance of some coconut and sugarcane farmers to come
under the project; reclassification of portions as communal irrigation
land; inappropriate topography; peace and order problems; and effects of
construction by the Department of Publlc Works which affected a small
portion one system. (PCR Section 3.03.1) The decrease in the sugarcane
area to 2,400 ha, from the anticipated 6,900 ha, is due to conversion to
paddy and other crops such as banana, cocoa, etc.
12.      O&M Support.  Support for strengthening NIAs O&M capability
included the construction and renovation of all necessary buildings
(offices, infirmaries, stores, equipment sheds, workshops, watermaster's
stations, etc.); provision of service facilities (water supply, power
supply, etc.); and other facilities such as perimeter fences for official
premises; drying floors, etc. All requirements of equipment, vehicles and
spare parts were also satisfactorily procured under the project, with about
702 of this procurement being through ICB (PCR Sections 3.03.3, 3.03.4).



13.      Input-Output Monitoring Programs (IOMP).  This program which was
first introduced in the Upper Pampanga River Integrated Irrigation System
(UPRIIS) with financial assistance from Loan 1227-PH, was extended under
the project to cover NISIP II and its forerunner NISIP I, (Loan 1414-PH).
The program was implemented reasonably well and served to establish
required benchmark data and monitor the flow and build-up of farm inputs
before and during each cropping season, providing warnings of any likely
shortfalls. It also served to monitor the magnitude and recipients of
benefits. The information made available through IOMP has facilitated
evaluation of development under the project. However, although it
identified anticipated shortfalls in inputs, remedial action seldom
resulted due to lack of response by the relevant agriculture and credit
agencies and lack of inter-agency coordination (PCR Section 3.03.5).
14.      Schistosomiasis Program.  Drainage in the endemic areas was
improved through rehabilitation and construction of about 89km of main and
secondary drains with service roads. in addition to the irrigation canals
and related irrigation system drainages in the area. To minimize human
contact with infected water in these areas, about 70 foot- bridges were
provided across these drainages in addition to larger bridges on all
service roads. The project also provided necessary office buildings,
supplies, materials, drugs and chemicals required (PCR Section 3.03.72).
15.      The health-related aspects of the component were carried out by
SCRS. Activities included diagnosis, treatment, health education and snail
control. Initial reports indicated general disinterest and lack of faith
in the program on the part of the population in these areas. However, the
education program was effective in creating public awareness of the nature,
methods of prevention and control of the disease. As a result, the program
became a comuuunity involvement and people actively cooperated in submission
of stools for examination and the use of sanitary facilities increased.
The snail density, snail infection rate and incidence of the disease in the
areas has considerably decreased. The PCR records a decrease of 44? in
snail density, 59Z in snail infection rate and 69Z in the prevalence rate
of the disease (from 7.52 in 1980 to 2.32 in 1986) between 1980 and 1986.
The appraisal report records an average prevalence rate of 222 with a high
of 35Z in Salug (1977). The corresponding rate in Salug for 1985 was
14.3?. Other factors might also have contributed towards these results,
but the achievements are very encouraging (PCR Section 3.03.7.2).
16.      Studies and Training. - With assistance from foreign consultants
NIA prepared feasibility studies for 4 projects: (a) Balog-Balog
Multipurpose; (b) Lower Agro Multipurpose; (c) Casecnan Transbasin
Diversion; and (d) Jalaur River Multipurpose. The detailed engineering for



Balog-Balog dam and appurtenant structures was also completed.  Further
ma,'or construction has, however, been deferred due to the difficult
economic situation in the country and the near rice self-sufficiency that
has been achieved (PCR Section 3.03.6).
17.      Force Accouat and Contract Work.  Recognizing NM's well developed
force account capability, and in view of the nature of the uroject,
appraisal providea for execution of 65 of project civil works through
force account and the remainder through contracts in accordance with
Government procedures. Contract work was executed through Major Contracts
(over Pesos 750,000), Local Minor Contracts (Pesos 100,000 to 750,000), and
Small Package Contracts (under Pesos 100,000). Contract performance was
generally satisfactory although some extensions of time had to be granted
for acceptable reasons, and some Local Minor Contracts were terminated due
to contractor problems and executed by MIA force account. Based on the
evaluation conducted by the PCR team it has been found that a total of 762
of the civil works were performed through force account. The possibility
that the 652 limit set at appraisal would be exceeded was not noticed
during implementation, due apparently to the inclusion of some Small
Package Contract work under force account in the reports submitted by some
Regional Offices during implementation (PCR Sections 6.02 and 6.03).
18.      Disbursements and Costs.  Disbursements were close to, and even
exceeded appraisal estilfates during the early stage of the project through
mid-1981, mainly due to equipment procuremeut during these years of
implementation. Thereafter, funding for the rest of the project works was
adversely affected by the very difficult financial situation in the
country, and coupled with other causes (paragraph 7) delayed
implementation, reducing disbursements to about 452 of appraisal estimates.
In view of otherwise satisfactory performance, the Loan Closing Date was
extended by two years from December 31, 1984 to December 31, 1986, to
permit project completion. US$48.7 million, out of the original Loan
amount of US$65.0 million, was utilized by the close of the Loan. The
balance of US$16.3 million was cancelled on July 14, 1987 (PCR Section
9.01).
19.      The final project cost in US dollar terms amounted to US$80.7
million (Pesos 996.8 million), about 582 of the appraisal estimate of
US$140 million (Pesos 1,036 million) mainly due to the devaluation of the
Philippine currency ta an average weighted rate of 12.34 pesos to the
dollar over the implementation period, as against the appraisal exchange
rate of 7.4 (592 of actual).  At the actual weighted rate of exchange of
12.34 the appraisal cost amounts to US$84 million. Other factors that
contributed to the low cost include modification of civil works,
particularly some large drainage works in Mindanao, to more practical
standards; lower O&M and construction costs through the use of farmer



groups in labour contracts; a slight reduction of the overall area
developed. and inclusion of rehabilitationa areas in place of new irrigation
development envisaged at appraisal. In peso terms the project cost
amounted to Pesos 996.8 million, 96Z of the appraisal cost (PCR Sections
8.02 and 8.04).
l pact
20.      The major objectives of the project were met by providing improved
irrigation, drainage, road and O&M facilities to serve 76,300 ha of
irrigated land; strengthening NIA' monitoring capability; reducing the
prevalence of schistosomiasis in the affected project areas; and finalizing
feasibility studies for four possible future projects.
21.      The most significant features of the project's impact are
increased paddy production (as well as some sugarcane, banana, cocoa, etc.)
as a result of improved irrigation and O&M, improved transportation through
the provision of access and service roads, more farm and agriculture
related job opportunities, reduced incidence of schistosomiasis, and
consequently increased beneficiary incomes. The process of project
implementation has also contributed towards strengthening NIA's project
management and implementation capability (PCR Section 14.01).
22.      The economic re-evaluation of the project presented in the PCR
follows appraisal methodology. However, it adopts somewhat over-optimistic
levels of crop yields -- wet season irrigated paddy 5.5 tonslha, dry season
irrigated paddy 6.0 tons/ha and irrigated sugarcane 85.0 tons/ha as against
appraisal forecasts of 4.0, 4.0 and 76.0 respectively, and a cropping
intensity of 187S at full development as against 168Z anticipated at
appraisal. On the basis of these assumptions the PCR estimates an ERR of
37Z. If this figure is adiusted to be in line with the more realistic
appraisal assumptions, the ZRR is closer to about 22Z, which compares well
with the appraisal projection of 232. The level of benefits actually
realized would however depend upon the manner in which the irrigation
systems are operated and maintained.  Although OEM has been less than
adequate, it is much better than in most other Asian countries, and
Government has stepped up its efforts to improve this aspect with support
under the recently approved Irrigation Operations Support Project (Loan
2948-PH). (PCR Sections 11.02 and 11.03)
Bank Performance
23.      The PCR notes that the project supported Government's efforts to
increase food production, accelerate socioeconomic development and promote
a more balanced distribution of regional development. The PCR also credits



-xii-
the Bank with the active support and guidance it rendered through
supervision missions in the different aspects of implementation --
management, procurement, reallocation and extension of the Loan, withdrawal
of loan proceeds and updating of project costs, etc. (PCR Section 6.05)
Lessons Learned
24.      The anticipated implementation period was  overly optimistic for a
project of this type. Because of the nature of works involved and their
wide geographical spread, appraisal quite correctly based project estimates
and design on preliminary feasibility level investigations and sample
analyses, providing for detailed construction level investigations and
preparation of final construction designs during implementation. The
likelihood of delays on this account, and the fact that all necessary land
acquisition could not have been foreseen at appraisal, should have been
anticipated. Also factors such as: speed and efficiency of Government
procedures; likelihood of frequent severe weather conditions; difficulties
arising out of the geographical spread of project works; contractor
problems; possible peace and order problems; likely funding difficulties;
etc., are common to several projects and deserved a deeper appreciation in
the context of project design, particularly implementation scheduling.
25.      Although not specifically intended, the use of farmer groups and
associations in the implementation of project works through Small Package
Contracts led to active beneficiary involvement in improvement of their
irrigation systems. This in turn has helped improve beneficiary
understanding of the irrigation infrastructure serving them, and enhanced
their willingness to participate with NIA staff to improve irrigation
services, particularly in the context of NIA's ongoing program to expand
Irrigator Association development.
