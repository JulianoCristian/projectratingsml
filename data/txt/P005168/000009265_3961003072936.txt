MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE TOURISM DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY FOR A
PRIVATE SECTOR TOURIS2M INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Tourism Development Authority (TDA.),
with a guarantee from the Arab Republic of Egypt, for US$130 million
equivalent to help finance the Private Sector Tourism Infrastructure and
Environmental Management Project. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRO
terms with 20 years' maturity, including a 5-year grace period, at the
standard variable interest rate. TDA would onlend the proceeds of the loan to
private sector beneficiaries for 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable rate, plus a margin of 200 basis points and an
additional 100 basis points for a subordinated loan. The Global Environment
Trust Fund (GET) will provide a gzant of US$4.75 million equivalent to support
some environmental management aspects of the Project.
2.          Background. The Arab Republic of Egypt is the most pop'1 ous
country in the Middle East. Beginning in the early 1950s, Egypt began a
public-sector-led and inward-looking development strategy, which culminated in
an unmanageable external debt burden, an unsustainable fiscal deficit and high
inflation. By 1990 the public sector accounted for 60 percent of total
investments, 80 percent of manufactured exports, and 40 percent of GDP. In
March 1990, the Government of Egypt (GOE) embarked on an Economic Reform and
Structural Adjustment Program (ERSAP) focusing on macroeconomic reform, public
enterprise refornt, domestic price and foreign trade liberalization and private
sector reform. The country's economic performance in FY91 and in the first
half of FY92 has been better than was anticipated a year ago: estimated GDP
increased by about 2 percent in FY91, compared with a projected decline of 1.5
percent; and the current account balance (including transfers) is estimated to
have shifted from a deficit of US$2.6 billion in FY90 to a surplus of US$2.4
billion in FY91, and an estimated surplus of US$2.6 billion in FY92. Although
the inflation rate is estimated at 21 percent for FY92, the pace of price
increases has decelerated sharply in the second half of FY92 (under 10 percent
in the 12 months through June 1992).
3.          The Tourism Sector.  Over the past five years, tourism has had the
highest average annual rate of growth among the main sectors of the economy.
Foreign exchange receipts from the tourism sector in 1990 were about US$1.1
billion, surpassing those from the Suez Canal and the oil sector. At present,
Egypt's share of the world tourism market is less than 1 percent. World
tourism is expected to grow about 5 percent per annum during the rest of the
century. If Egypt maintains its share of world tourism, tourist arrivals
would increase from 2.6 million in 1990 to about 4 million in the year 2000.
However, with the right policies, there is even greater potential for
increasing Egypt's share of world tourism in view of the country's unique
setting and endowment of antiquities and its unspoiled coastline. In spite of
the GOE emphasis on tourism, the potential remains underexploited because of
the sector's dependence on the public sector for its development, finance and
management. The lack of infrastructure, the development of which has not kept
pace with resort development, has also played a role. In addition, there is a



-2-
major risk of environmental degradation that could damage the ecosystems and
cultural properties, and endanger the very resources that attract tourists.
4.          Sec;or Strategy.  The Bank has assisted GOE in the formulation of
a strategy for the tourism sector that is aimed at: (a) changing the role of
the public sector from that of owner/operator to planner/regulator and
promoter/facilitator; (b) deregulating the industry to allow the private
sector to operate in a competitive environment; (c) promoting a larger role
for the private sector in the design, finance, implementation, ownership and
operation of tourism facilities; (d) removing infrastructural bottlenecks
within the tourist zones through public or private investment; (e) developing
a comprehensive system of monitoring and enforcement to ensure environmental
protection in the tourist zones; and (f) promoting the development of
environmentally sound and attractive tourism sites away from the main tourist
corridors.
5.          As part of its new strategy, in 1991 GOB. established TDA as an
autonomous organization for planning, developing and monitoring tourism
development in the remaining coastal tourist areas and some of the areas in
the Nile Valley. TDA has initiated extensive land-use plans with the
assistance of international consulting firms and has promoted private sector
investments in accordance with these conceptual plans. The initial intention
of TDA was to undertake large-scale infrastructure investments, and rely on
the private sector to develop the related superstructure. However, such an
approach entails risks, in that TDA would be unable to recover costs if
private investments in the superstructure did not materialize within the
expected time frame.
6.          TDA, therefore, has opted for a different, innovative approach
that emphasizes the need for integrated private sector development of
infrastructure and superstructure in an environmentally sound manner. Such an
approach would limit claims on scarce public sector resources, relieve the
public sector of any commercial risks and allow the public sector to postpone
major investments in trunk infrastructure until these were economically and
environmentally justified. GOE has requested Bank assistance in implementing
the proposed Project in accordance with the strategy highlighted above.
7.            Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The country assistance
strategy gives high priority to projects that increase employment and foreign
exchange earnings. Tourism has great potential in both of these areas. As
the tourism sector is at the forefront of deregulation, privatization and the
promotion of private investments, the Bank's involvement in the sector would
be instrumental in accelerating the pace of reform and maintaining its
momentum. Bank assistance in the Project has proved essential In catalyzing
lending and equity investments from the private sector for infrastructure, an
area that has traditionally been financed by public resources. The Bank loan
is also critical, given the shortage of sufficiently long-term local financing
from the financial system, while Egypt's performance in servicing external
debt severely limits access to foreign resources. Finally, Bank support in
mapping out an environmental management program under the auspices of the GET,
including institutional strengthening and the financing of public sector
environmental components, would assist GOE in regulating tourism development
in an environmentally sound manner. The Bank's support to the Project would
also complement the role of IFC in private sector development in Egypt.

8.             Past Involvement of the Bank Groun.  The Bank's only lending
operation for tourism in Egypt was the Egypt Tourism Project (Credit 909-EGT),
approved in May 1979. The project consisted of improvements in infrastructure
and superstructure in two areas: the introductior. of measures to protect
important archaeological sites and the renovation of the Egyptian Museum in
Cairo. Implementation was delayed by five years, with all major components
implemented except the renovation of the Cairo Museum and the protection of
six pharaonic tombs. lnstitutional and administrative improvements envisaged
at appraisal were not all achieved. IFC has been invelved in the Egyptian
tourism industry through loans and equity participation in several hotel
projects.
9.             Lessons Learned.  The proposed Project is an innovative
operation, which has never been tried out in Egypt. However, some of the
lessons learned from previous operations have been useful in its design.
First, the jurisdictional overlapping and fragmentation problems experienced
previously would be mitigated by focusing project implementation under TDA.
Second, jurisdictional authority over tourism i.frastructure has been clearly
delineated and recognized by law and by Presidential decree. Third, as the
Project would be mostly implemented by the private sector, delays experienced
in public procurement processes would be avoided. Fourth, previously
experienced mismatches between public investments in infrastructure and
private investments in superstructure would be mitigated under the Project by
designing the area development as an integrated package, to be fully developed
by the private sector. Finally, potential environmental problems would be
avoided through a master plan concept of land development and the close
monitoring of dfrvelopment and operational standards in the tourism area.
10.            Project Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed Project are
to: (a) support the Government in improving the policy environment for the
tourism sector through further investment rationalization, deregulation and
the privatization of the tourism portfolio; (b) provide catalytic financial
support for infrastructure development in major tourist areas sponsored by the
private sector, in order to mobilize long-term financing from commercial banks
and venture capital for equity investments; and (c) ensure sound environmental
management of the Red Sea coast, with the support of the GET.
11.            Project Description.  The proposed Project would consist of the
following: (a) improving the tourism sector policy environment by:
(i) the development of an overall framework for public and private sector
investments; (ii) the decontrolling of prices for tourism-related services;
(iii) the development of land allocation and ownership policies for private
investments; (iv) the privatization of selected tourism enterprises; and (v)
improvements in the regulatory framework affecting the operations of the
tourism sector; (b) providing financial support to the private sector for: (i)
the development of infrastructure for two integrated area development sub-
projects in greenfield sites on the Red Sea coast (Abu Soma Bay and Sahl
Hasheesh Bay); (ii) the provision of water supply, sewerage and solid waste
collection and disposal facilities for tourist developments on the Red Sea
Coast (South Hurgada to Safaga area); and (iii) the construction of additional
cruise ship berthing facilities at two majo- and four minor sites; (c)
providing financial support to the public sector for improving traffic
control, navigational aids and safety systems for Nile cruise ships and access



- 4 -
to tourist sites; (d) developing a coastal zone management plan and initiating
the implementation of this plan for the Red Sea coast; and (e) providing
technical assistance to TDA and training for TDA and Egyptian Environmental
Affairs Agency (EEAA) staff to: (i) strengthen the capacity in tourism
planning and marketing, procurement and financial management; (ii) develop
environmental guidelines and the capacity for monitoring and enforcing
environmental guidelines in tourism zones; and (iii) prepare projects for
further tourism development. The project would be implemented over a period
of about seven and a half years, mostly by the private sector, with only the
public sector and GET components implemented by TDA. The timetable of key
processing events is given in Schedule C, and the statua of Bank group
operations in Egypt is given in Schedule D. The Staff Appraisal Report (No.
1107 - ECT dated November 20, 1992) is being distributed separately.
12.            Project Cost and Financin.  Total financial requirements,
including interest during construction, are estimated to be about US$805
million (including the GET component), of which US$302 million (38 percent) is
in foreign exchange (schedule A).  The Bank loan of US$130 million, plus the
GET grant of US$4.75 million, would cover about 17 percent of the total cost.
The remaining financing would be covered as follows: private sector equity,
about 1*S$330 million (41 percent); commercial bank lending, about US$300
millic. (37 percent); and GOE, the remaining US$40 million (5 percent).
Details of procurement and disbursement arrangements are given in Schedule B.
13.           Agements Reached. The following agreements were reached
during negotiations: Conditions of Loan Effectiveness: (a) the issuing of a
Ministerial decree to liberalize all prices affecting tourist services; and
(b) the effectiveness of the GEF grant agreement.   Others:  (a) the
completion of a study to develop a new land allocation policy by June 30, 1993
and the implementation of the new policy by December 31, 1993; (b) the
preparation of an institutional arrangement for improved safety regulations
for navigation along the Nile River by December 31, 1993; and (c) a review of
the area development subprojects based on updated feasibility studies for the
second phase of implementation as a condition for the disbursement of
contracts under the second phase; (d) conditions of disbursement for the two
area development subprojects; and (e) TDA to furnish to the Bank by December
31, 1993 a proposal for the assignment to private sector sponsors of the
construction and operation of the Red Sea infrastructure and Nile berthing
facilities. TDA could execute these components with public resources if the
private sector failed to conclude its financing. However, even in such a
case, TDA would arrange for operation and maintenance of the facilities by the
private sector.
14.           henefits.  The proposed Project would assist GOE in the
formulation and implementation of strategies and policies for the
environmentally sound development of an important sector in the Egyptian
economy. The estimated economic rate of return of Project components vary
between 11 and 27 percent. Additional benefits from the Project would be: (a)
improved opportunities for private sector investments in the tourism industry;
(b) higher foreign exchange earnings for the country (incremental receipts of
US$380 million annually in constant terms by the year 2002); (c) increased
employment both in the tourism industry itself (12,000 people), as well as in



industries which serve tourism (20,000 people); (d) arrested environmental
degridation of the Nile river and s-me of the adjoining tourist areas; and (e)
improved health and safety for tourists on the Nile river. The Project would
have a demonstration effect in mobilizing the private sector for financing,
building and operating infrastructure, which have traditionally been
undertaken by the Government. If successful, the experience would be valuable
for GOB in promoting private sector participation in public services in other
sectors. The protection of the coral reefs and other coastal habitats and
actions to mitigate pollution in Red Sea waters would not only benefit the
people of Egypt, but also the littoral states, and would provide an example of
the integrated management that is needed on coastal areas worldwide.
15.           Risks. The risks associated with the proposed Project relate
to its implementation and involve coordinating the actions of many parties:
ministries, agencies, governorates, commercial banks, private investors and
contractors. Given the dispersed nature (vf the works, there is also some risk
of delays in implementation. The areas to be developed under the Project are
environmentally sensitive and must, therefore, be protected against any
possibility of environmental degradation. However, the strengthening of TDA
being undertaken under the Project would enable it to coordinate the various
parties involved in the Project, while, particularly in the initial stages,
the Project would be closely supervised by the Bank. The private sector would
be implementing major parts of the Project, and since it is within Its
interest to complete construction on time, this should minimize delays in
project implementation. The environmental component of the Project has been
designed specifically to mitigate the environmental risks inherent in large
tourism developments in coastal areas.
16.           Environmental As2ects. The coastal zones of the Egyptian Red
Sea are known for their eztensive coral reefs, mangrove swamps and extremely
diverse marine life. The developments on the Red Sea coast and the Nile River
were classified as "Category A" environmental projectf, and environmental
assessments were carried out. Mitigatory measures were proposed and agreed
to. Environmental guidelines for approving private sector proposals have been
prepared and would be further improved upon under the GET component, which
would also build up TDA and EEAA capacity to continuously monitor the
environmental situation along the Red Sea coast and help to prepare a Coastal
Zone Management Plan. The construction of additional berthing facilities along
the Nile River would reduce the pollution created by the cruise ships, while
improvements in navigational aids would promote safety standards and
procedures.
17.           Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
