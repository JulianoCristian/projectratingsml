Coastal and Marine Resource Management Project was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest and, the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicated that bringing together the main Government\n            agencies: Tourism Development Authority (TDA), Egyptian\n            Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), and the Red Sea\n            Governorate (RSG) in the day-to-day management of the\n            project, ensured that their interests were addressed and\n            facilitated the project implementation. The development of\n            the Geographic Information System database with an inventory\n            of coastal and marine ecosystems for the Egyptian Red Sea\n            coast, was a useful tool for investment programming, and\n            coastal zone management. The project definitely benefited\n            from the involvement of non government organizations such as\n            Hurghada Environmental Protection for Corals Agency, the\n            Safaga, private hotel operators, and dive boat operators.\n            Promotion of environmental awareness amongst stakeholders is\n            a key element in protecting fragile natural resources."}, "docdt": "2002-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
