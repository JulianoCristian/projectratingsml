Key Lessons Learned are summarized as follows: In a\n            time of great power shortages it took so long for Government\n            of India (GOI) to grant the clearances for the Project. This\n            suggests some disconnect between the development objectives\n            of GOI and the officials responsible in various ministries.\n            The Talcher TPP should receive coal of proper quality and in\n            required quantities in order to operate in a sustainable\n            manner at its full capacity.  Energy conservation on the\n            customer  State Electricity Board (SEBs) side and demand\n            management by the utilities through the adoption of\n            appropriate tariffs and tariff structure at SEBs and through\n            end-use efficiencies, are important other aspects to improve\n            efficiency in the power sector.  Land acquisition was a\n            major hurdle and as such, in future NTPC should plan to set\n            up projects only when land is acquired and made available to\n            NTPC in the initial stages of the project."}, "docdt": "1998-03-09T00:00:00Z"}
