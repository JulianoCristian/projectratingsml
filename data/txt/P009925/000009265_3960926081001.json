To accomplish this, the proposed project comprises:\n            (a) the construction of the first stage (2x500 MW) of a\n            3,000 MW coal-fired steam power station in Talcher, Orissa;\n            (b) construction of about 230 km of double circuit 400-kV\n            transmission lines; (c) installation of the earth stations;\n            and (d) consulting serices to review the engineering of the\n            proposed power station."}, "docdt": "1987-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
