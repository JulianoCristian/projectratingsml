LWAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             India, acting by its President
8eneficiary:          National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd. (NTPC)
Amount:               US$375 million
Terms:                Repayment over 20 years, ircluding 5 years
grace, at the applicable rate of interest.
Onlsnding Terms:      From the Government of India (CCI) to NTPC,
with repayment over 20 years, including 5
years grace, at an interest rate of not less
than 14.0Z per annum. GOI would bear the
foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Project Description:  The Project's main objective is to assist in
meeting the electricity demnd in the Eastern
Region of India through the addition of about
1,000 KW of thermal capacity at Talcher in
Orissa. The Project comprises the installa-
tion of two 500 MK generating units, the
construction of about 270 km of associated
transmission lines, and the establishment of a
satellite-based data processing comunication
network. There are no unusual risks involved
in implemeating the Project as NTPC is familiar
with the design and construction of generation
and transmission facilities and consulting
support will be provided in those ares in
which NTPC lacks experience.

TALCHER THERMAL POWER PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I* SECTORAL CONTEXT
Commercial Energy Resources
1.01    India's principal commercial energy sources comprise coal, oil, gas,
hydro and nuclear energy. Of the nonrenewable resources, coal is the most
abundant. Reserves of thermal coal have been estimated at slightly more than
100 billion tons, of which 25 billion are proven. Although reserves are
ample, the quality of coal produced is generally low and is deteriorating.
The high ash content, up to 501, increases power station capital and operat-
Ing costs and has exacerbated problems of coal transport. GOI's emphasis on
concentrated development of pithead stations helps to address transport
problems but will not reduce the other costs associated with poor coal
quality. In any case pithead development will be constrained by pollution
and water availability. GOI appointed the Fazal Committee to examine the
problems of coal supply to thermal power stations. This committee, which
reported in October 1983, made a large number of recommendations, affecting
all aspects of supply from coal preparation to railway operations
(para 1.14); the great majority of these recommendations have been accepted
by GOI. The Bcnk is supporting GOI's efforts in this area through its lend-
ing to the coal sector. The Dudhichua Coal Project includes studies to
examine coal linkages and identify potential improvements in handling and
transportation facilities. Coal quality is also being addressed, par-
ticularly through the inclusion of appropriate quality incentives in coal
supply contracts.
1.02    Proven and probable petroleum reserves comprise approximately 510
million tons of oil and 390 million toe of natural gas. Despite recent
increases in domestic production, India still imports aboit one third of its
oil requirements, which in FY84 cost the equivalent of 401 of its merchandise
exports. GOI has therefore given high priority to oil and gas exploration
and, at the same time, has implemented measures, including economic pricing,
to restrain the rapidly growing demand for oil products, particularly middle
distillates. In the past, C0- has generally limited natural gas to premium
markets such as petrochemicals and fertilizer; however, delays in the con-
struct-on of gas infrastructure have resulted in substantial volumes of gas
being flared. The Bank has encouraged GOI to develop the necessary
infrastructure and to allow other economic uses of gas including power gener-
ation. In response, GOI has begun to invest in pipelines and has recently
revised its policy on the use of gas for power generation (paras 1.14 and
1.15).



-2-
1.03    India's hydroelectric potential is equivalent to about 100,000 MW.
At present only 14,000 MW have been developed, 4,700 MW are under construc-
tion and a further 23,000 MW are being studied for future development. The
prominent role of hydro generation in regional least-cost power development
plans has led GOI to emphasize the need to accelerate hydro development;
however, progress has been slow owing to the lack of financial resources of
states with the greatest hydro potential, the time required to resolve water
rights and environmental issues, and the limited technical resources avail-
able for the simultaneous preparation of a large number of hydro schemes.
Attempts to address these issues through increased central sector involvement
have so far met with limited success (para 1.07).
1.04    The country's uranium reserves could support a modest nuclear program
(8,000 - 10,000 MW), and thorium reserves are enough for a large fast breeder
program. India's nuclear power generating capacity is currently 1,095 MW.
rlectricity Supply and Demand
1.05    In 1984/85 utilities' gross power generation amounted to
approximately 157,000 CWh from an installed capacity of just over 42,000 MW.
Almost 60% of generation was from coal, 34% from hydro, and the rest from
oil, nuclear energy, and natural gas. Electricity losses have risen slowly
but steadily over the last few years and now exceed 26% of gross generation.
The deteriorating quality of coal has increased station-use and the large
expansion in very low load iensity rural electrification, together with
inadequate investment in other transmission and distribution, have increased
system losses. The Bank has stressed the importance of balanced investment
to reduce system losses and improve service quality and will continue to
support transmission and distribution investments designed to achieve these
objectives.
1.06    Over the past two decades, the consumption of electricity has grown
approximately twice as fast as total commercial energy consumption and now
accounts for more than 30X of the latter. Even though the power subsector
receives 20-25% of total public investment, electricity supply has not kept
pace with demand and shortages have been prevalent throughout the country.
Total consumption has grown at an average annual rate of 8% although the
increasing severity of power shortages indicates that potential demand has
grown more rapidly. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has forecast
demand growth in the range 10-11 per year between 1984/85 and 1994/95
(Annex 1.2). owoever, actual growth will continue to be supply constrained.
The principal sectoral shares of total electricity consumption are:
industrial, 57%; agriculturalt 18%; and domestic, 13%, (Annex 1.1). Agricul-
ture's share has grown steadily owing to increased electrical irrigation
pumping made possible by rural electrification and encouraged by heavy sub-
sidies.



-3-
Organization of the Power Subsector
1.07    Responsibility for the supply of electricity is shared between the
Central and State Governments. The state electricity boards (SEBs) and the
regional electricity boards (REBs) are controlled by states; CEA is
administered by the Department of Power within the Ministry of Energy and the
National Thermal Power: Corporation (NTPC), the National Hydro-Electric Power
Corporation (NHPC), and the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) are
central sector corporations responsible to the Department of Power. SEBs
were instituted under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 (the Act), to
promote the development of the power subsector and to regulate private licen-
sees such as the Tata Electric Companies. Although SEBs are supposed to be
autonomous in managing their day-to-day operations, in practice they are
under the control of State Governments in such matters as capital investment,
tariffs, borrowings, pay, and personnel policies. As a first step towards
national integration, the SEBs have been grouped into five regional systems,
each coordinated by an RIB. Coordination responsibilities include overhaul
and maintenance programs, generation schedules, interstate power transfers
and concomitant tariffs. CEA was craated in 1950 to develop national power
policy and to coordinate the various agencies involved in supplying elec-
tricity. It is formally responsible for vetting investment proposals,
providing consulting support to SEBs, assisting in the integration of supply
systems, training of personnel, and research and development. However, in
its execution of these responsibilities, CEA has been severely limited by
shortages of skilled staff and other resources. Without any direct respon-
sibility for the provision of finance it has been unable to assume a very
positive role in the developmeut of the subsector. In view of this, GOI has
decided recently to form the Power Finance Corporation to complement CEA in
fostering development of the subsector (para 1.16). NTPC and NHPC were
formed in 1975 to construct and operate large power stations and associated
transmission facilities. They sell bulk power to the SEBs for distribution.
FMPC has had marked success and although it accounts only for about 52 of
installed capacity it is growing rapidly. In contrast, NHPC is still strug-
gling to establish a role for itself; the states control water rights and are
reluctant to relinquish hydro sites to the Center. This has prompted GOI to
explore joint ventures between the Center and states for the development of
hydro schemes. BEC was established in 1969 to coordinate rural electrifica-
tion and provide financial and technical expertise for SEB schemes.  Cur-
-rentlyt. DC finances more than 70X of total.rural electrification investment.
At. present there is -no organization with responsibility for the development
of a national transmission grid, although GOI is contemplating the formation
of such a body (para 1.17).
Finance and Pricing
1.08    The SEBs as a whole are estimated to have made a combined loss in
1984/85 of approximately Rs 11,230 million (US$935 million) exclusive of
subsidies, corresponding to a return on historically valued net fixed assets



-4-
of 2.3X before interest and -8.1X after interest. Internal cash generaLlon,
which was eqnivalent to only about 2.7X of capital expenditure in 1984/85,
has been correspondingly poor. Almost all SEB capital expenditure is
financed by debt, primarily loans from state governments. Recognizing the
unsatisfactory state of SEB finances GOI has, through an amendment to the Act
notified in April 1985, required SEBs to earn an annual return, after meeting
operating expenses, taxes, depreciation and interest, of at least 3% on their
historically valued net fixed assets (GOI does not accept the principle of
revaluation of assets). The Bank supports this initistive by GOI and has
changed the form of its financial covenant to reflect this. Although, in
terms of the Bank's conventional method of calculation, the return specified
in the Act generally corresponds to a modest return on revalued assets in the
range of 4 to 61, it, nevertheless, represents a very sub3tantial improvement
on current performance. Many SEBs, particularly those of the poorer states,
are expected to experience considerable di£:iculty achieving this level of
performance. NTPC a tariffs are approximately equal to its long-run marginal
costs (LIMC); however, there are deficiencies in tariff structure and GOI
has agreed to undertake in close cooperation with the Bank such studies as
may be necessary to address these. As is to be expected from their current
financial performance, SEBs' tariffs do not adequately reflect their LRMCs.
An analysis of 1981 SEB tariffs indicated that they were on average only just
over 50% of LRMC. A preliminary analysis of 1986 tariffs suggests that they
are now 60-70% of LRMC and achievement of the stipulated rate of return would
improve the average ratio still further. However, the structure of tariffs
is still unsatisfactory. Tariffs are frequently excessively complex and very
little has been done through tariffs either to achieve load management or to
tap selectively consumers' willingness to pay, which in many cases substan-
tially exceeds existing tariff levels. At the instigation of the Bank, LRMC
tariff studies were carried out for almost all of the states in the late
1970's. However, these istudies were generally of poor quality and the Bank
has since endeavoured to agree with GOI on a methodology for LMC tariff
studies. Progress has be-en slow because, despite espousing energy prices
"which reflect true costs" its both the Sixth and Seventh Plans, GOI and the
states continue to oppose economic pricing of power for reasons associated
with social and agricultural objectives. In lending to individual SEB's the
Bank will continue to address state-specific programs to improve resource
mobilization, for example, by developing financial programs capable, as a
minimum, of achieving the rate of return specified in the Act. Where higher
returns are both feasible and desirable the Bank will press state governments
to use their discretion under the Act to notify a higher rate of return. So
far as tariff structure is concerned the Bank will continue to require SEBs
to carry out tariff studies wherever tariff structures appear to be badly
distorted, in order to impress on the relevant authorities the true costs of
cross-subsidization. This has been done under both the Chandrapur Thermal
Power Project (Loan 2455-IN) and the Kerala State Power Project
(Loan 2582-IN). However, resistance to economic pricing is such that
progress in pricing reform is likely to be slow (para 1.18).



Power Subsector Planning
1.09    The Bank has consistently encouraged GOI to pursue integrated plan-
ning and coordinated operation of the country's electricity supply systems.
In response, GOI has prepared a set of regional least cost development plans,
published as the National Power Plan (NPP) in 1983. Although the NPP repre-
sents a good first step towards integrated planning, it needs further refine-
ment and regular updating. In addition, such a plan can only lead to effec-
tive improvements if complemented by measures to bring about coordinated
system operation. At present only the Northarn Region is achieving this.
0OI is encouraging states to reach the necessary agreements on operating
parameters but progress is likely to be slow so long as severe power
shortages exist. Even if coordinated intra-regional operation is achieved,
inter-regional transfers will be very difficult without the use of direct
current facilities to overcome problems of frequency control. The first such
facility, a link between Northern and Western Regions, is a component of the
Central Power Transmission Project (Loan 2283-IN). A second direct current
link has been included in the Rihand Power Transmission Project
(Loan 2535-IN). To facilitate further integration GOI has agreed, under the
latter project, to undertake a study of the long-term development of a
national transmission system and to examine related institutional and commer-
cial issues. Disparities between the long-term NPP, national five-year
plans, short-term budgets and actual performance have been substantial. Owing
to the lack of resources, fewer projects have been included in the five-year
plans than in the NPP and, as a result of inadequate allowance for escalation
and delays in project implementation, still fewer have been executed. The
resulting power deficit has undermined rational planning by necessitating
rapid expansion of supply rather than long-term least-cost development; for
example, shorter gestation thermal plant has been favored at the expense of
lower cost hydro. Furthermore, it has prompted overinvestment in captive
plant, a second best measure leading to excessive use of high value petroleum
products for power generation. In addition to supporting GOI's efforts to
increase the supply of power, the Bank will continue to stress to GOI the
role of pricing and load management in eliminating the deficit, and the
importance of integrating planning and pricing.
Management and Operations
1.10    In contrast to the good performance of NTPC, the SEBs' management and
operational capabilities have not kept pace with the expansion of supply. In
general, SEBs have adequately qualified engineering staff, but lack
experienced personnel in financial planning and control. The relatively low
status and pay of these personnel exacerbates the already significant pay
differential between the public and private sectors and makes it difficult to
recruit competent staff. Management practices are generally outmoded and
inadequate. Accounts have been maintained principally to track cash receipts
and expenditures, and there has been little use of accounting information for
managerial purposes. Consequently, the Bank has encouraged GOI to develop a



-6-
new uniform accounting system for 8EBs. After initial delays, implementation
is now proceeding. In addition, the Bank will continue to support institu-
tional development programs through lending to individual SEBs.
1.11    The operations of many SE8s are hampered by the poor condition of
their plant and equipment. Factors that have contributed to the poor state
of thermal plant include inadequate maintenance (in part due to capacity
shortages), deficiencies in manufacture, lack of spares, and the poor quality
of coal; in general, these problems have been recognized by the relevant
authorities and corrective steps are being taken. Distribution systems have
suffered from inadequate maintenance and overloading owing to inadequate
investment. Rehabilitation, particularly of thermal plant and distribution
networks, appears to be a very cost-effective way to improve efficiency and
augment system capacity. GOI has recently started to implement a rehabilita-
tion program for thermal plant but is less able to effect improvements in
distribution. The Bank will continue, whenever appropriate, to include
rehabilitation components in its projects.
OI's Strategy in the Power Subsector
1.12    In essence the Five Year Plan constitutes the only formal statement
of OI's energy and power policies. Although formalization of power policy,
in particular, is made difficult by the constitutional arrangement in which
responsibility for power is shared between Center and states (para 1.07),
the Seventh Plan, nonetheless, reflects a broad consensus of the objectives
of energy and power policies. The principal objectives of GOI's energy
policy are to: (a) develop energy supplies economically at a rate commen-
surate with growth in the economy and social needs; (b) substitute indigenous
energy resources for imported petroleum wherever this is both technically and
economically feasible; and (c) encourage the rational and efficient use of
energy resources. Although power policy is governed by essentially the same
objectives, alleviation (or at least containment) of acute power shortages
suffered nationwide dominates GOI's short-term strategy. Over the longer
term, achievement of least-cost development assumes greater importance. In
addition to the initial steps of its long-term strategy, GOI's short-term
strategy provides for a number of specific measures to address power
shottages, including:
(a)  rehabilitation of thermal plant - a program involving some 30 plants
is currently being implemented (para 1.11);
(b)  accelerating the implementation of ongoing projects - a recent reor-
ganization of Government created a new ministry specifically to
monitor and improve implementation of public sector projects;
(c)  a more liberal attitude towards captive generation;



-7-
(d) permitting the construction of shorter gestation gas or oil-fired
plants (para 1.02); and
(e) improving the quality and reliability of coal supplies, through
implementation of the majority of the recommendations of the Fazal
Committee (para 1.01).
1.13    GOI's long-term strategy requires a blend of policies designed to
address investment, organizational institutional and financial issues. With
respect to investment, resource constraints severely limit the quantum of
investment available to the power subsector. The Seventh Plan allocation is
almost exactly half the sum sought by the Working Group on Power, a sum which
was itself inadequate to eliminate power shortages. Long-term invectment
priorities are:
(a) accelerated hydro development (para 1.03);
(b) an increased proportion of investment in transmission and distribu-
tion (para 1.05);
(c)  the formation of a national grid (para 1.09);
(d) coal beneficiation to improve both quality and homogeneity
(para 1.01);
(e) diversification of the modes in which coal for power generation is
transported, possible examples include the introduction of coastal
shipping or slurry pipelines;
(f) diversification of the fuels used for power generation, GOI now
recognizes that gas fired plant, especially combined cycle, has an
economic role to play in system development (para 1.02); and
(g) steady growth in the development of nuclear power (para 1.04).
1.14    Long-term organizational/institutional and financial issues are more
controversial and GOI still needs to identify clearly defined strategies in
these areas. GOI recognizes the institutional and financial weakness of many
of the SEBs but constitutional constraints limit the rate at which the Center
can bring about improvement. Measures which Q01 is following include:
(a) increasing the role of efficient central sector institutions, par-
ticularly NTPC (para 1.07);
(b) implementation of a uniform system of commercial accounting for all
SEBs (para 1.10);



-8-
(c) requiring, through recent amendment of the Act, that SEls earn a rate
of return of not less than 31 after all expenses and interest
(para 1.08), a significantly more stringent financial requirement
than hitherto; and
(d) a more receptive treatment of private sector proposals for power
generation, particularly when it can be demonstrated that such
developments are mobilizing resources which would not otherwise be
available to the public sector.
In addition, GOI has decided to form the Power Finance Corporation as a
financial intermediary serving the subsector (para 1.07). It is expected
that funds lent by the Corporation would be attractive to SEBs because, at
least in part, they would be additional to agreed plan outlays. However,
loans would be subject to conditionality designed to improve the efficiency
and financial strength of beneficiaries.
1.15    GOI recognizes that the development and operation of an integrated
national grid will be difficult to achieve with the present organization of
the subsector and GOI is contemplating the f^rmation of a separate body with
responsibility for the grid (para 1.07). However, many commercial and
institutional problems remain and, as yet, GOI has no strategy for their
solution; although, under the Rihand Power Transmission Project, QOI has
accepted that these aspects of grid development need to be addressed
(para 1.09).
Bank Group Strategy in the Power Subsector
1.16    The Bank supports the elements of GOI's strategy identified above but
feels that, while each of these elements is desirable, they do not address
all of the serious deficiencies in the subsector. In particular, additional
efforts are needed to address problems in the areas of planning, pricing/load
management, institutional development and finance. The prevalent nature of
these problems suggests that a sector-wide approach should be sought.
However, the comparative autonomy of the states/SEBs from the Center makes it
difficult to achieve progress in this way. With the exception of the intro-
duction of uniform commercial accounting in SEBs, few improvements at the
state level have been realized through umbrella projects coordinated by CEA
or REC, primarily owing to the very weak control that these institutions are
able to exercise over SEBs. Consequently, the Bank is changing the mix of
its lending away from such umbrella projects towards a more direct involve-
ment with individual SEBs, where state-specific programs can be designed to
address areas of deficiency. Initial experience with individual SEBes sug-
gests that the prospects for impravement are encouraging. Pricing and finance
are the most problematic areas (para 1.08) and the Bank has indicated that it
will only work with those SEBs that are prepared to improve their financial
performance.



-9-
1.17    In parallel with lending to individual SEBs the Bank proposes con-
tinued support for expansion of the central sector, because: (a) increased
reliance of the states on central sector generation appears to be the best
way to encourage decisions at the state level consistent with the national
interest; and (b) a higher proportion of total generation provided at
economic tariffs by the central sector will help to improve tariffs to final
consumers. The difficulties that COI has experienced in bringing hydro
projects into the central sector mean that NTPC will continue to ui the main
vehicle for the Bank's support of the central sector. NTPC's recorA to date
is impressive. However, it is still far from being a mature institution and,
owing to its rapid development, it will continue to face problems in which it
could benefit from Bank support. In the wider context, the Bank feels that
an institutional review of the power subsector is needed and it is desirable
that this should include a review of the organization and functions of CEA.
The Bank will also pursue with GOI the possibility of Bank-financed technical
assistance to improve CEA's capabilities.
1.18    In addition to addressing areas in which GOI's strategy appears
deficient, it is appropriate that the Bank should focus on aspects of the
strategy already adopted, where the Bank can do most to catalyze progress.
In this respect specific aspects identified include:
(a) integration of power supply including the formation of the national
grid - the Bank will continue to support projects such as the Central
and Rihand Power Transmission Projects, the latter will afford the
Bank the opportunity for an active involvement in studies of
long-term transmission development (para 1.09);
(b) accelerated hydro development - by broadening lending operations to
encompass individual SEBs the Bank is able to support hydro projects
and, where the additionality of the Bank's funds to plan outlays is
crucial, it is able to bring about developments which might not
otherwise take place; and
(c) elements of strategy that involve concerted action by organizations,
both inside and outside the power subsector - the Bank can coordinate
its own lending operations within the different subsectors in order
to improve intersectoral cooperation. Priority examples concern
improvements in coal quality and transportation, and the use of
natural gas for power generation.
Bank Group Participation
1.19    The Bank has made 22 loans (US$2,709 million) and 17 IDA credits
(US$2,409 million) for Indian power projects (Annex 1.3). Nineteen projects
have been completed: 13 generation, 5 transmission, and 2 rural electrifica-
tion. Projects currently under implementation include 12 generation, 3 of
which are hydro, 2 transmission, 1 rural electrification, and the Kerals



-10-
Power Project, which includes a broad spectrum of generation, transmission
and distribution. With respect to NTPC projects,. the first-phase projects at
Singrauli, Korba, and hamagundam were commissioned on or ahead of schedule.
The second-phase extension at these sites, the Parakka, Rihand Power Trans-
mission and Combined Cycle Power Projects are proceeding satisfactorily. The
Third Rural Electrification Project, which has suffered significant procure-
ment problems, is about three years behind schedule.
1.20    A performance audit conducted in 1980 for the Second Power Transmis-
sion Project (Credit 242-IN) concluded that the project succeeded in helping
the nine beneficiary SEBs extend their transmission systems to meet their
growing power requirements. Utilization of generating capacity in these SEBs
exceeded the appraisal forecast. However, the audit highlighted the dif-
ficulties of effecting institutional improvements in the absence of a close
working relationship between the Bank and beneficiary SEBs. Another perfor-
mance audit, conducted in 1985 for the First and Second Rural Electrification
Projects (Credits 572-IN and 911-IN), concluded that India's rural elec-
trification program, of which the projects were a part, has helped the
country to achieve food self-sufficiency, alleviate poverty, and transform
the rural economy. In common with the previous audit this also emphasized
that the Bank should devote resources to deal with the SEBs individually.
II. THE BENEFICIARY
2.01    NTPC, the beneficiary of the proposed loan, was established in 1975
as a publicly owned utility, under the general supervision of the Ministry of
Energy. It is responsible for designing, constructing, and operating large
thermal power stations and transmission lines, and for the sale of power
generated to the SEBs. NTPC has broad powers to carry out its operatiens
except for decisions on investment plans and financing which require Govern-
ment approval before implementation. NTPC is also subject to periodic
examination by the Committee on Public Undertakings, a body established by
GOI to monitor the performance of public sector enterprises.
Existing Facilities and Development Program
2.02    NTPC commenced generating electricity in 1982 and, by the end of
.1985/86, operated 11 new 200 MS units (5 at Singrauli, 3 at Korba and 3 at
Ramagundam) and 2,130 km of 400-kV transmission lines. In addition, it has
under construction 7 power plants with a total capacity of 8100 NW and
11,000 km of transmission lines. NTPC also operates the 720 MW Badarpur
station near Delhi, and is responsible for construction of the 270 MW captive
power station being established at Korba for the Bharat Aluminium Company, on
a management-fee basis. NTPC expects to commission some 6000-7000 MW during
the Seventh Plan and, on the basis of starts provided for under the Seventh



-11-
Plant will commission a further 5000-6000 MW during the Eighth Plan. NTPC's
power stations and linest both existing and planned, are generally in remote
areas which have inadequate communication facilities. NTPC's massive logis-
tical effort is seriously hampered by this communication constraint and the
proposed Project includes a satellite-based communications network to over-
come this problem.
Organisation and Management
2.03    In response to the rapid increase in NTPC's operational and construc-
tion activities, a study to develop a decentralized organizational structure
was initiated in 1981, with assistance from power utilities/ consultants in
the UK and the USA. On the basis of this study, NTPC adopted a regional
organizational structure in August 1982, with each Region under the charge of
an executive director responsible for the design, construction and operation
of generation and transmission facilities. Regional headquarters have now
been established for:
(a) the Northern Region, with responsibility for the power stations at
Singrauli and Rihand, together with the associated transmission
system;
(b) the National Capital Region, with responsibility for the power sta-
tion at Badarpur and the planned station at Dadri;
(c) the Western Region, with responsibility for the power stations at
Korba and Vindhyachal, together with the associated transmission
system;
(d) the Southern Region, with responsibility for the power station at
Ramagundam and the Southern Regional Transmission System;
(e) the Eastern Region with responsibility for power stations at Parakka,
Kahalgaon and Talcher, together with the associated transmission
system.
Recently, UTPC has centralized design and procurement in order to utilize
trained manpower more efficiently. It has also created the post of Director
(Projects and Operations) to ensure that adequate attention is given to power
plant operations.
2.04    With decentralization, the corporate headquarters is progressively
concentrating its role on policy-making and the provision of functional
guidance to the Regions and operating divisions. The principal corporate
functions are finance, personnel and administration, planning and monitoring
design, procurement and commercial. The finance, personnel and design groups
are headed by Directors who are members of NTPC's Board. The procurement
group is responsible to the Executive Director (Corporate Contracts and



-12-
Materials). The planning and monitoring group reports to the Chairman and
Managing Director and the commercial group to Director Finance. The present
corporate organization structure is shown in Annex 2.1.
Recruitment and Training
2.05    Recruitment is progressing satisfactorily and is expected to meet
NTPC's expanding operational needs. In 1985, NTPC had about 14,200
employees. This number is expected to reach about 32,000 by 1990. Initially,
NTPC emphasized the recruitment and training of executives, engineers and
supervisors, who account at present for nearly 40% of its staff. However,
with the increase in operating plant, the emphasis has been gradually shift-
ing toward the recruitment and training of skilled workmen and plant
operators, who will account for about 70% of staff by 1988/89. Training
centers have been established at NTPC's plant locations. These centers, with
workshops, training materials, and hostel fasilities, are designed to train
young graduates, diploma holders and operating staff. NTPC also provides
specialized training in management and other aspects of the power sector at
the Centre for Education in Power Management in Delhi, the Central Institute
of Training at Badarpur and other academic institutions. In addition,
specific programs are organized in collaboration with power organizations of
international repute, e.g. the Central Electricity Generating Board (U.K.).
Performance
2.06    NTPC's construction performance has been satisfactory with most of
the generating units and transmission lines being completed within the
planned construction time. Such delays as have arisen in projects have been
primarily due to delays in placement of orders for the major equipment
(boiler and turbo-generators) and not in actual construction. Transition
from construction to operation is also being carried out successfully. NTPC
has, with che assistance of Central Electricity Generating Board (U.K.),
prepared detailed procedures for plant commissioning, operation and main-
tenance. Major emphasis has been placed on the introduction of maintenance
planning using computers and standard work procedures. Generating units under
operation have achieved satisfactory generation levels. A Research and
Development unit has been established to carry out applied research and to
assist in outage analysis.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Setting
3.01    India continues to face severe power shortages and GOI's strategy for
the power subsector, outlined in the Seventh Plan, calls for the accelerated



-13-
exploitation of indigenous energy resources to alleviate these shortages.
The Eastern Region, comprising Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa, three of the
poorest states in India, continues to suffer from chronic shorteges of power.
This has led to substantial pressures to postpone maintenance of equipment in
order to keep plants in operation. Consequently, plant availability is now
substantially lower than in any other region in India. CEA has prepared a
rehabilitation program, which has funding under the Seventh Plan, to improve
the efficiency and increase the output of existing thermal plants, and this
is currently being implemented (para 1.11). However, despite this program,
the Eastern Region will still need substantial new generating capacity. The
proposed Talcher Thermal Power Station is the first phase of a 3,000 MW
development, which forms part of the least cost power development plan for
the Eastern Region. The power station would utilize coal from the extensive
reserves in the Talcher coalfield, whL:h will be cheap to exploit but which,
in common with many other coals in India, his a rather high and abrasive ash
content. The executing agency for the project would be NTPC, which would be
less subject than SEBs to pressures to maximize present generation at the
expense of future plant performance.
Project Objectives
3.02    The principal objectives of the proposed Project are to:
(a) increase power generation capacity and hence alleviate power
shortages in the Eastern Region;
(b) introduce to India the technology of "tower boilers" which are suited
to the abrasive high ash coals prevalent in India; and
(c) improve the operational performance of NTPC by providing on-line
communications between NTPC's power stations and its headquarters in
Delhi (para 2.02).
Project Description
3.03    The proposed Project comprises:
(a) the construction of the first stage (2x500 NW) of a 3,000 NW
coal-fired steam power station in Taicher, Orissa, involving boilers,
turbogenerators, electrical and mechanical auxiliaries, associated
civil works and switchyard;
(b) construction of about 230 km of double circuit 400-kV transmission
lines to link the power station with the Eastern Region grid at
Rengali and Rourkela and 40 km of 220-kV transmission line for the
start-up of the power station;
(c) installation of the earth stations, microwave links and data process-
ing equipment for a dedicated satellite-based data communication
network connecting NTPC's corporate offices in Delhi with its thermal



-14-
power stations, consisting of six INSAT Type "B" satellite earth
stations at Singrautis Korba, Ramagundam, Farakka, Kahalgaon and
Talcher communicating with a central INSAT Type "A" Delhi Region
satellite earth station. In addition, the communication network
includes two long-haul terrestrial microwave links to interconnect
the Rihand and Vindhyachal thermal power stations with Singrauli; and
(d) consulting services for the review of the engineering of the proposed
power station.
A detailed description of the proposed Project is given in Annex 3.1.
Project Cotts
3.04    The estimated cost of the proposed Project, including contingencies
but excluding duties and taxes, is US$1,185.7 million. Taxes and duties
would amount to about US$36.4 million and interest during construction would
amount to about US$153.2 million. Thus, the total financing requirement
would be US$1,375.3 million, of which about US$524.2 million would be direct
and indirect foreign exchange. Details of the estimated costs of the Project
are set out in Annex 3.2 and summarized in Table 3.1.

Cost estimates for the proposed power plant are based on indicative proposals
made by prospective bidders and are comparable with recent prices for similar
works in India. Cost estimates for other equipment and materials are based
on the most recent quotations received for similar projects. Prices for
communications and data processing equipment are based on actual orders or
proforma offers. The estimated cost for consulting services is based on
current experience with other projects in India. Base prices were updated to
March, 1987. Physical contingencies of 10 on civil works and 5S on equip-
ment were assumed on the basis of experience with similar projects and amount
to about 6Z of the base cost. Price cnntingencies, which amount to about 25X
of the base cost, are based on the following expected annual inflation rates:
(a) local costs - 1986/87 to 1994/95, 6%; and (b) foreign costs - 1987 to
1995, 41.
Project Financing
3.05    A Bank loan of US$375.0 million would cover about 31% of the total
cost of the proposed Project, net of duties and taxes, and would amount to
71% of the estimated foreign exchange financing requirements. The balance
of the foreign exchange financing requirements, amounting to about US$149
million, is expected to be met from external borrowing or GOI foreign
exchange resources. The financing of local costs amounting to about
US$851 million equivalent would be met from NTPC's internal cash generation
(US$343 million), plus equity and loans from G00 (US$508 million). Table 3.2
shows the proposed financing plan.

OI may consider suppliers or export credits for the major equipment packages
if a successful bidder or other agency provides an acceptable financing
proposal for the lowest evaluated bidder in cash terms. In this event, GOI's
contribution would be reduced accordingly and, if required, the Bank would
reallocate the funds no longer needed for the financing of these items to
other items in the Project, as appropriate.

Project Engineeris
3.06    ITPC has completed the site investigations, the plant layouc, and
the technical specifications for most of the equipment. The specifications
for the turbogenerator sets have already been reviewed by the Bank. Although
NTPC has considereble experience in the design and construetion of thermal
power stations and and associated high voltage transmission systems, it would
require external assistance for the review of modifications to earlier power
stations' designs and for the preparation of concomitant specifications. In
particular, as NTPC has not desi,ned tower-type boilers before, it required
the services of consultants to review the boiler design and assist in the
preparation of the specifications. Electricite de France (EDF) was retained
by NTPC to review the boiler design and specS fications. The consulting
services for the power station engineering review and the above assistance in
boiler design and preparation of specificstions would require about; 100
man-months, which will be covered under tne proposed Project.
Fuel Supply
3.07    Coal for the Talcher power station will be supplied from the Lingraj
Block of the Talcher Coalfield. Coal would be transported about 30 km from
the mine to the power station by means of a captive merry-go-round railway
system. So far 700 million tons of coal reserves have been proven in the
Lingraj Block and another 300 million are in the indicated category. (A note
on the Talcher Coalfield appears in Annex 3.3.). The proven reserves in this
block of the coalfield would be sufficient to operate the 3,000 MS power
station at an 80X plant factor for 40 years, i.e. well beyond its useful
life of about 30-35 years. The Talcher Coalfield would be exploited by Coal
India Limited through its subsidiary, South Eastern Coalfields Limited. The
advance action proposal for the development of the Lingaraj Block was
approved in December, 1986. GOI has provided to the Bank a mine development
program indicating major milestones, e.g.: government approval; land acquisi-
tion; bid invitation, contract award, and delivery for major mining and coal
handling equipment; and schedules for overburden removal and coal production.
During negotiations, NTPC agreed to enter into a coal supply contract at
least one year before the operation of the first unit. The contract would be
subject to prior review and comment by the Bank (para 6.02(c)).
Water Supply
3.08    The cooling water requirements for the power station will be met by a
closed-circuit system with cooling towers, the most economical arrangement
for the selected site. Make-up water for the cooling water system will be
supplied from the reservoir created by the Samal Barrage on the Brahamani
River. The Department of Irrigation of Orissa is constructing the Barrage
and expects to complete it in 1989, well ahead of the power station. This
construction schedule is realistic. The Department of Irrigation has agreed
to provide the 10 cubic meters per second of make-up water required for the



-17-
ultimate development of the power station and has also confirmed that the
minimum river flow available at Samal throughout the year would not be less
than 115 cubic meters per second.
Land Acquisition and Resettlement
3.09    NTPC conducted a survey of the population affected by the construc-
tion of the Project and has prepared Land Acquisition and Resettlement plans
which were discussed during negotiations. It was agreed that certain minor
modifications were required in relation to the Resettlement plan and NTPC
agreed to furnish to the Bank by December 319 1987, a satisfactory Resettle-
ment plan incorporating the agreed modifications. Furthermore, NTPC agreed
to implement the Resettlement plan, as revised, in cooperation with the
concerned government authorities (para 6.02(a)).
Project Implementation
3.10    NTPC has adequate experience in managing construction of large power
stations and transmission lines. The organization for construction would be
similar to the one established for the second stage of the Farakka power
station (2x500 MW) presently under execution. The Project would be imple-
mented over a period of about eight years starting in June 1987. The first
unit would be commissioned in June 1993 and the second unit in June 1994.
The construction schedule for the power station and its associated transmis-
sion system is shown in Annexes 3.4 and 3.5. Construction by NTPC of the
satellite-based data processing communication network is expected to require
three years and would be completed in June 1990.
Procurement
3.11    The power-grade coal obtainable from the Talcher Coalfield is a
high-ash coal (up to 451 ash) and this ash has a high silica content (up to
601). To minimize abrasion with this type of coal, NTPC has proposed steam
generators of a special design known technically as "tower boilers."
Experience with this type of boiler world-wide confirms its suitability for
handling abrasive ash. GOI has decided that Bharat Heavy Electricals# Ltd.
(BHEL), the major Indian manufacturer of power plant equipment, should
acquire this new technology in view of the potential future application in
India, given the poor characteristics of Indian coals.  GOI has therefore
indicated that NTPC would negotiate directly with BHEL for the supply of the
boilers, and that BHEL would in turn enter into a technology transfer arran-
gement with a foreign manufacturer experienced in tower boiler technology.
BHEL is currently negotiating a license to manufacture tower boilers designed
by a French manufacturer, Stein Industries. The tower boilers would not be
financed by the Bank loan. This arrangement for the supply of the steam
generators is not expected to affect the project implementation or cost
adversely. NTPC expects to sign the boiler contract shortly but, in any
event, before June, 1988.



-18-
3.12    The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.3 below and
the major milestones of the procurement process are shown in Annexes 3.4 and
3.5. Major contracts for mechanical and electrical equipment procurement
would be on a supply-and-erect basis and some contracts would also include
civil works (e.g. coal handling. substation structure and transmission
lines). This would ensure better contract coordination during implementa-
tion. Procurement of equipment, materials and works, estimated to cost about
US$550 million, would be tendered on the basis of international competitive
bidding (ICB), in accordance with Bank's guidelines. Documents for
individual contracts estimated to cost above US$3.5 million equivalent would
be subject to prior review by the Bank. This would cover about 90% of the
value of the contracts, Local manufacturers would be expected to bid for
most categories of equipment. A domestic preference of 15% or the cor-
responding import duty, whichever is less, would be applied in bid comparison
for eqjipment contracts. Consultants for the project engineering would be
selected and employed in accordance with Bank guidelines.

Disbursement
3.13    Disbursement from the prQposed loan would be made against 1001 of
the cost of consultants for the boilee engineering and engineering review
(para 3.06), 1001 of the CI? price of imported equipment and materials
procured abroad through ICB, and 10OZ of the ex-factory cost of equipment and
materials procured in India subject to ICB. Estimated disbursements, shown
in Annex 3.6, correspond to the Bank's standard disbursement profile for
thermal power projects in India. The closing date for the loan would be
March 31, 1996. The Bank has authorized retroactive financing of up to US$15
million to cover expenditures after Jaauary 1, 1987, and prior to Loan sign-
ing, on consultancy for the design and speiLfications of the boilers and on
equipment for the satellite communicatios- network.  Disbursements would be
fully documented. To facilitate disbursements a special account would be
established for the loan with an authorized allocation of US$18.0 million.
Ecolog
3.14    NTPC completed an environmental impact assessment in January 1986.
This assessment has been submitted to the GOI's Department of Environment
for issuance of an environmental clearance certificate for the power station.
In principle clearance for the proposed Project was given in April, 1987.
The environmental assessment was discussed during negotiations and NTPC
agreed to provide the Bank with additional information December 31, 1987
(para 6.02(b)). In addition, the formal environmental clearance for the
Project would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan (para
6.01(b)). The power station does not involve forest land and hence no
clearance is required from GOI's Department of Forests and Wildlife. In
contrast the associated transmission lines may involve forest land, although,
as the alignment of the associated transmission lines has not yet been final-
ized, there is no accurace estimate of the forest area affected by these.
Final alignment for the transmission lines and clearance from the GOI's
Department of Forests and Wildlife is not on the critical path for the
project. However, to minimize any risk of delay, NTPC agreed during nego-
tiations to complete the route surveys for the lines and submit applications
for forest clearances by March 31, 1988 (para 6.02(d)).  In addition, the
absence of Department of Forest and Wildlife clearances after December 31,
1989, would be an event of suspension (para 6.03).
Project Risks
3.15    go unusual risks are foreseen in the execution of this project.  Risk
of damage due to fire, explosion, etc., would be covered by the respective
contractors during the construction phase, an4, after commissioning, by NTPC,
through its insurance policies which are satisfactory. Technical risks would
be minimized by the use of consultants where NTPC has inadequate experience,
e.g., in the review of the design of the boilers.



-20-
Project Monitoring
3.16    NTPC will submit, starting with the quarter in which the loan is
signed, quarterly reports covering the work of consultants, physical
progress, costs, disbursements and administrative aspects of the proposed
Project. In addition, there will be annual financial and administrative
reports. A completion report will be prepared by NTPC not later than six
months after the closing of the Loan.
IV. FINANCE
Accounting Organization and Systems
4.01    In 1979, NTPC, assisted by A.F. Ferguson Co. (India), designed and
subsequently implemented well conceived systems for financial and cost
accounting, project accounting, inventory control, billing, fixed assets
accounting, and payroll. The corporation has established decentralized
autonomous accounting units at the site of each plant in operation.
A.F. Ferguson Co. has monitored the implementation of these systems and has
assisted in the training of accounting staff. Well designed management
information and budgetary control systems were also introduced in 1979 and
these have been effective in providing the inputs needed for planning and
monitoring. An internal audit unit has been established with adequate sys-
tems and qualified staff. Training of accounting staff is well organizedt,
and recruitment of qualified staff is adequate to meet forecast requirements.
NTPC's accounting operations are functioning in a satisfactory manner.
Past Financial Performance
4.02    NTPC initiated its development program in 1977/78 and commercial
activities began in 1982/83. During 1983/84, 1984/85, and 1985/86 Nt?C's
financial performance has been satisfactory and financial results compare
favourably with the forecasts prepared by NTPC and approved by the Bank.
NTPC's financial statements for 1982/83-85/86 are given in Annexes 4.2 to
4.5 and a summary of financial results is shown in Table 4.1.

4.03    Electricity sales amounted to 3835 GWh in 1983/84 and more than
doubled to 8316 GWh in 1984/85 after the commissioning of the first three
units (3x200 MW) at Ramagundam. In 1985/86 sales increased by another 54% to
12,839 GWh as a result of an improvement in NTPC's plant load factor to 741
from 581 in 1984/85, at the 200 MW units of the Ramagundam, Korba and
Singrauli power stations. This increase in plant load factor occurred due to
the stabilization of the Ramagundam units, increased availability of the
Singrauli unit due to the completion of scheduled maintenance and because of
a sustained high level of performance by the Korba units.
4.04    In 1983/84, NTPC realized a net income of Rs 449 million and earned a
rate of return on historical net fixed assets in operation of 11.31 which
exceeded the covenanted requirement of 71 for 1984/85-89/90 agreed with the
Bank. In 1984/85, NTPC's sales revenues amounted to Rs 3,326 million and a
rate of return on historical net fixed assets in operation of 12.51 was
realized. As a result of the improved plant load factor, sales revenues
increased to Rs.12,839 million in 1985/86 and the rate of return was 17.2t.
NTPC's returns in 1983/84, 1984/85, and 1985/86 correspond to rates of return
on revalued assets of approximately 9.31, 10.11 and 13.51 respectivelyt which
are satisfactory. NTPC's cash generation as a percentage of investment was
31, 121 and 11% in 1983/84, 1984/85 and 1985/86 respectively. Growth in
sales, combined with adequate tariffs, and control over operating expenses
have accounted for the overall sound financial performance of NTPC. The low
contribution to investment is temporary and is acceptable in view of the fact



-22-
that NTPC continues to have a small sales volume in its early years of opera-
tion relative to the very large capital investment program under implementa-
tion. Assets in operation at the end of 1985/86 amounted to Rs 16,047 mil-
lion, representing only about 34% of total fixed assets including Rs 32,569
million of assets under construction. UTPC's debt equity ratio of 36/64,
current ratio of 1.2 and debt service coverage of 5.0 times in 1985/86 were
satisfactory.
Accounts Receivable
4.05    NTPC's collection of accounts receivable during its first two years
of operation was poor but significant improvements have occured since then.
The outstanding receivables of 7.2 months sales equivalent at the end of
1983/84 declined to 5.2 months at the end of 1984/85 and have recently
dropped further to about 2.8 months in May 1987. Several initiatives were
implemented to achieve these reductions. NTPC has taken action to reduce
receivables through provisions in its bulk supply agreements which require
that each concerned SEB open an irrevocable letter of credit equivalent to
one months power purchases and remit payment for power purchases not covered
by letters of credit within 30 days of receiving bills from NTPC. Although
in some cases the amounts of these are less than the amounts required by the
terms of the bulk supply agreements the arrangement has proved effective
where implemented, and NTPC is pressing for all SEB customers to open letters
of credit in the required amounts. In addition, GOI has recently taken
action, through diversion of central assistance to the states, to settle 80%
of the amounts owed by SEBs to NTPC, which are undisputed and more than two
months overdue. After the remaining amounts are paid to NTPC in 1987 under
this arrangement, the overall level of accounts receivable would be below the
equivalent of two months sales. During negotiations NTPC agreed to maintain
its accounts receivable, arising from sales of electricity at a level not
exceeding the proceeds of its power sales for the two preceding months (para
6.02(e)).

4.07    The financial forecasts for NTPC indicate that electricity sales are
expected to increase from 12,839 GWh in 1985/86 to 87,695 GWh in 1995/96,
representing an average annual rate of growth of about 21%. During the same
period average revenue is expected to increase from 40 paise/kWh to 94
paise/kWh in accordance with the projected tariff increases outlined under
the bulk supply agreements with SEB's. These agreements allow for adjust-
ments in the basic tariff rate to reflect changes in fuel prices and other
costs (Annex 4.10(g)). The projected increase in average revenue represents
an average annual growth rate of about 8.9Z which is higher than the expected
rate of inflation in India of about 6.0% up to 1996. As a result, average
revenue would be maintained at a level marginally above the estimated LRMC
(para 4.13). The forecast decline in electricity sales of 1.6% from 1985/86
to 1986/87 reflects the expectation that the high plant load factor achieved
during 1985/86 would decrease to a normal level and this effect would
dominate the increased sales from newly commissioned plants (para 4.03). The
forecast increase of 21X in average revenue from 40 paise/kWh in 1985/86 to
51 paise/kWh in 1986/87 is largely a result of an increase in the proportion
of sales made to SEB's that are charged higher tariff rates because of the
higher capacity costs associated with the plants which provide the power.
During 1986/87 increased sales are anticipated to SEB's in the Southern
Region and power would be sold to SEB's in the Eastern Region for the first
time. For SEB's in these two Regions the generation costs are higher and as
a result the applicable tariff rates would be more than for SEB's in the
Northern and Western Regions (Annex 4.7).
4.08    NTPC's operating revenues are projected to increase from Rs 5,233
million in 1985/86 to Rs 81,993 million in 1995/96. Operating expenses as a
percentage of operating revenues are expected to remain at a satisfactory
level of 451 to 551 Lhroughout the period, based on the projected regular
adjustment of NTPC's tariffs as per the bulk supply agreements. NTPC's
projected financial rates of return on historical net assets in operation



-24-
vary between 12X and 171 during the forecast period according to the timing
of work in progress being converted to assets in operation, and the con-
comitant build up in generation, tariff rates and sales revenues. The
forecast rates of return compare favourably with the covenanted rates. The
same rate of return requirement of 71 for 1984/85-89/90 and 9.51 for
1990/91-94/95* and thereafter annual rates of return at levels satisfactory
to ensure the financial viability of NTPC reiterated under the Combined Cycle
Power Project (Loan 2674-IN) would be repeated for the proposed Project
(para 6.02(f)). NTPC's rates of return on net revalued assets based on a pro
forma evaluation (Annex 4.8) are projected to be between 81 and 11 in the
forecast period. NTPC's internal cash generation is projected to remain low
through 1989/90 as a result of rapid expansion of new investment relative to
existing commercial operations. By 1990/91 it will reach 43Z of estimated
capital expenditures and remain at a satisfactory level thereafter. The
tariffs used in making NTPC's financial projections have been derived from
the terms of the bulk sales agreements with the SEB's. These tariffs are
higher than actually required to satisfy the agreed revenue covenant. While
there is no reason to expect lower tariffs, financial performance at the
covenanted rates of return has been analyzed. During 1984/85 to 1995/96 the
covenanted rate of retuirn would still yield positive internal cash generation
and a sm4ll contribution to investment. After 1989/90 NTPC's self financing
ratio is projected to continue to rise above 30X.
4.09    NTPC's projected balance sheet reflects the large investment program
and anticipated rapid growth in operations. Total capitalization is expected
to increase from Rs 52,526 million in 1985/86 to Rs 418,777 million in
1995/96 and corresponds with a rise in the debt/equity ratio from 36/64 to
42/58 for the same years. Projected debt/equity ratios and debt service
coverage are satisfactory. VTPC's net working capital position is expected
to remain satisfactory over the forecast period.
Future Investment and Financing
4.10 NTPC's financing plan for the period 1985/86 to. 1992/93 is presented
in Table 4.3. NTPC would finance about 301 of its investment program (includ-
ing IDC) from internal cash generation. The proposed Bank loan would finance
about 21 and the balance of 68Z would be financed from long term loans and
bonds (391) and GOI's equity investment (291). NTPC's financing plan has
been assured by GOI's undertaking to provide any necessary additional funds
to finance the investment program. In February 1986, NTPC made its first
public bond issue. One million secured, redeemable bonds of Rs 1,000 each,
yielding 141 interest per annum, were issued and fully purchased. The amount
of funds raised through the bond issue, equivalent to about US$76.9 million
provides only about 0.41 of NTPC's financing requirements for 1986/87-92/93
but represents a new source of financing made possible by NTPC's sound finan-
cial performance. Additional bond issues are planned for future years.
Total capital expenditures, including IDC, for the period are expected to
amount to just over Rs 250 billion of which the estimated cost of Rs 17,877



-25-
million (including IDC) for the proposed Project would represent 72.
Dividends on equity are not anticipated and it has been assumed that surplus
funds during the period would be applied to the investment program.

Taxation
4.11    NTPC is liable for income tax.  However, in view of its large capital
expenditure program, no income tax liability would arise during the period of
the financial projections. The investment and depreciation allowances per-
mitted by GOI are greater than NTPC's projected amount of taxable income.
A tax equalization reserve is, therefore, not necessary at this time.
Audit
4.12    UTPC's auditors are appointed by the Company Law Board, on the recom-
mendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India and are members of
the Indian Institute of Chartered Accountants. The auditors' report is
subject to review and comment by the Auditor General. For 1984/85 the
appointed auditors were P.K. Maheshwari & Co. and Goel, Garg & Co,, both
firms of Chartered Accountants. The audited financial statements and
auditors' report for 1984/85 were submitted to the Bank on time and were
found to be satisfactory. The auditors' reports contained no substantive
recommendations or adverse comments. As with previous Bank Group credits and



-26-
loans, NTPC agreed during negotiations to provide the Bank with audited
financial statements within seven months of the end of the financial year to
which they relate, together with a certified report by the auditors, and
comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (para 6.02(g)).
NTPC's Regional Tariffs
4.13    A comparison of NTPC's projected regional tariffs with estimates of
the generation and bulk transmission long run marginal costs (LRMC) over the
period 1985/86-95/96 is provided in Annex 4.7. NTPC's average tariff for
each region is expected to remain reasonably close to 1001 of LRMC throughout
the period. NTPC's tariffs are generally lower than the projected costs of
generation for the SEBs. However, there are likely to be times when some
SEBs' short-run marginal costs would be lower than NTPC's full tariff. This
issue is addressed below.
4.14    Under previous loans and credits, GOI and NTPC agreed to sell power
from NTPC's power plants under contracts satisfactory to the Bank. These have
now been concluded with the Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking, the Damodar
Valley Corporation, the Electricity Department of the Union Territory of Goa,
and all SEBs designated to receive power from NTPC plants. The Electricity
Department of the Union Territory of Pondicherry is not expected to receive
power from NTPC until early 4988. A contract in respect of this entity is
therefore not yet required but will be concluded at the appropriate time.
NTPC's role in the generation and transmission of electricity is forecast to
increase substantially. This will impose new requirements on the bulk supply
tariff structure and, in this context, issues which need to be addressed
include: (a) the potential multiplicity of tariffs - the existing regional
bulk supply tariff is set on a station specific basis, reflecting the facc
that NTPC is presently operating only one station in each region. This
approach would result in a multiplicity of tariffs with the commissioning of
additional plants in each region; (b) recovery of transmission costs - there
is no provision in the existing tariffs for recovering costs of transmission
facilities now under construction that are not associated with specific
generating stations; and (c) merit order operation - SEBs, which at times
have surplus generating capacity (e.g., at night during the monsoon), find it
cheaper to incur their own short-run marginal costs and avoid the "full" ITPC
tariff even though NTPC's short-run marginal costs may be lower than those of
the SEBs. This leads to operation of plant out of merit order, consequently
wasting resources. These potential deficiencies of NTPC's tariff structure
are currently being addressed under Loan 2674-IN.
On-Lending Arrangements for the Proposed Project
4.15    An amount of $375 million from the proposed Bank loan would be onlent
to NTPC by GOI in accordance with a Subsidiary Loan Agreement which will
provide for a maturity of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years with
interest payable on outstanding balances at not less than 14X per year. This



-27-
minimum onlending rate provides sufficient margin over the current Bank rate
of 7.922 to cover the foreign exchange, interest rate and guarantee risks
which are to be borne by GOI. The conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement
satisfactory to the Bank would be a condt  on of effectiveness of the
proposed Bank loan (para 6.01(a)).
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost Analysis
5.01    With the aid of the optimization model WASP-III, CEA has prepared a
least-cost system expansion plan for the Eastern Region, based on the load
forecast given in Annex 5.1. The earliest feasible implementation of the
Talcher Thermal Power Pro5e*nct forms an integral part of the least-cost plan.
The assumptions used, including the load forecast, and the results of the
optimization modelling have been reviqwed by the Bank and found satisfactory.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
5.02    Benefits of the Talcher station cannot readily be separated from
those of other investments in generation, transmission and distribution in
the Eastern Region. Therefore, having established that the station forms
part of the least-cost expansion plan for the Eastern Region, it is
appropriate to carry out a cost-benefit analysis on the plan as a whole in
order to ensure that the expansion envisaged is desirable. For this purpose,
a "time-slice" of the Eastern Region's investment program has been analyzed.
Capital costs of the investment program (covering generation, transmission
and distribution) together with incremental operating and fuel costs are
given in Annex 5.2. The benefits of the investment program relate mainly to
the incremental consumption that it makes possible. I/ A minimum measure of
benefit, ignoring consumer surplus, can be derived from incremental sales
revenue. In the absence of adequate class specific consumption conversion
factors, the standard conversion factor (estimated to be 0.8) has been
applied to convert financial revenue into a measure of economic benefit. On
this basis the minimum internal economic rate of return achieved by the
Eastern Region program is 4 .
1/ The program may also lead to benefits in terms of a reduction in the cost
of meeting existing demand, particularly through fuel savings. However,
the energy deficit is such that by far the greater part of the output
available from plants in this program will lead to increased sales. Fuel
savings -esulting from this program are likely to be small and this
element of the benefits has therefore been ignored.



-28-
5.03    However, this estimate is more a reflection of the inadequacy of
tariffs than of the economic merit of the investment program. The estimated
minimum economic rate of return of 4% is less than the established oppor-
tunity cost of capital, and this is indicative of the fact that tariffs in
the Eastern Region are presently less than LRMC (para 1.08). In reality the
program will confer benefits in excess of those described above. There will
be consumer surplus associated with the incremental consumption; consumer's
reactions to the severe shortages of power experienced at present, and
expected for the foreseeable future, suggest that willingness to pay substan-
tially exceeds present tariff levels. In addition there will typically be
other external benefits.
5.04    In order to derive a more realistic internal economic rate of return,
it is useful to estimate a measure of consumer surplus, at least for
industrial and agricultural consumers. Their willingness to pay will be
related to the costs of autogeneration and diesel pumping respectively. Many
consumers are presently observed to find these options economic when public
supply is not available. Annex 5.2 presents an estimate of diesel
autogeneration costs at Rs. 1.12/kWh. It would, however, be unreasonable to
assume that all industrial consumers would be willing to pay this price for
the whole of their consumption from the public supply system. Therefore, as
a conservative measure, it has been assumed that the consumer surplus
attributable to incremental sales in each Region can be derived from an
average of the cost of autogeneration and the prevailing tariff. Similarly,
for agricultural consumers the equivalent cost of diesel pumping has been
estimated at Rs. 2.21/kWh and average willingness to pay has been estimated
at halfway between the average agricultural tariff in each Region and this
alternative cost. This more realistic measure of the benefit of consumption
results in an internal economic rate of return of 10% for the Eastern Region.
However, it must again be stressed that this represents a lower bound
estimate as domestic consumer surplus and other external benefits, have still
not been included.
Justification for Bank Involvement
5.05    In preparation of this Project, the Bank has helped to stimulate an
effective mechanism for recovery of NTPC's receivables (para 4.05). Through
its continued involvement, the Bank would be supporting GOI's efforts
(para 3.02) to:
(a) augment generating capacity and alleviate the chronic power
shortages in the Eastern Region;
(b) exploit the very large low cost coal reserves available in the
Talcher coalfield;



-29-
(c) introduce into India the technology of tower boilers which are
suited to the abrasive high ash coals prevalent in India  and
(d) improve the operational performance of NTPC by providing on-line
communications between NTPC's power stations and its head-
quarters in Delhi.
In addition to supporting the above objectives, the Bank would through its
involvement in this Project:
(a) support reinforcement of the Eastern Region's 400-kV grid; and
(b) contribute to the development of one of the poorest regions in
India.
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
Agreements
6.01    During negotiations, the following conditions of effectiveness were
agreed:
(a) the conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOI and NTPC,
satisfactory to the Bank specifying (i) an interest rate of not less
than 14% per annum; and (ii) a repayment term of 20 years including 5
years grace (para 4.15); and
(b) formal environmental clearance for the proposed Project from the
Department of Environment (para 3.14).
6.02    During negotiations, NTPC agreed to:
(a) provide to the Bank by December 31, 1987, a satisfactory resettlement
plan and thereafter implement the plan in cooperation with the con-
cerned government authorities (para 3.09);
(b)  provide to the Bank by December 31, 1987, and additional information
requested with regard to the environmental impact assessment prepared
by NTPC for the proposed Project (para 3.14);
(c) enter into a coal supply contract at least one year prior to the
commissioning of the first unit of the proposed power station. The
contract would be furnished to the Bank for prior review and comment
(para 3.07);



-30-
(d) complete the route surveys for the transmission lines included in
the proposed Project and submit applications to the Department of
Forests and Wildlife for clearances, by March 31, 1988 (pars 3.14);
(e) maintain its accounts receivable at a level not exceeding the
proceeds of its power sales for the two preceding months (para 4.05);
(f) achieve annual rates of return on unrevalued net assets in operation
of not less than 7Z through 1989/90, 9.5Z in 1990/91 through 1994/95,
and thereafter annual rates of return at levels satisfactory to
ensure the financial viability of NTPC (pars 4.08); and
(g) submit to the Bank audited financial statements within seven months
of the end of the financial year to which they relate, together with
a certified report by the auditors and comments of the Comptroller
and Auditor General of India (para 4.12).
6.03    The absence after December 31, 1989, of Department of Forests and
Wildlife clearances for the transmission lines under the proposed Project is
specified as an event of suspension in the remedies section of the proposed
Loan Agreement (para 3.14).
Recommendation
6.04    The proposed Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$375 million
equivalent.

TALCHEn THERmAL POWER PROJECT
Project Description
1.        The Talcher power project, located in Orissa close to the Tal-
cher Coalfield, io one of a series of large coal-fired power stations
planned by NTPC to feed into a 400 kV interconnected grid and supply bulk
power to the State Electricity Boards in the Eastern Region.
2.        The power station at Talcher is conceived for an ultimate
cspacity of 3,000 MW, in six units of 500 MW each. Under the project,
the first stage with 2 x 500 MW units will be constructed.  This stage is
expected to be commissioned in 1994.
3.        The 500 MW steam turbines will be tandem compound operating on
reheat and regenerative feed water, heating cycle and condensing type,
with steam at 170 kg/cm2 and 537 degree C./reheat 537 degree C. The
generators will be water and hydrogen cooled, each rated 588 MVA. The
steam generator will be "tower-type", controlled circulation, pulverized
coal fired, balanced draft type using the direct firing system. The
boiler will have a continuous evaporation rating of 1,700 tons per hours
with superheater outlet pressure of 178 kg/cmz and temperature of 540
degree C. The boilers will stand about 100 meters above foundations. The
flue gas traverse electrostatic precipitators having an efficiency greater
then 99.5Z before dispersal in the atmosphere through a 275-m high chimney
common for both boilers.  Each generating unit will be connected to the
400-kV transmission grid through three single-phase transformers with a
combined rating of 600 MVA.
4.        The salient features of the proposed first stage of the power
scheme are the following:
- Fuel. Raw coal from the Lingras Block of the Talcher Coalfield.
Consumption of the 1,000 MS power station at 5,500 hrs of
operation per year is about 4.5 million tons on the basis of a
worst-coal calorific value of 2,800 kcal per kg. Blending
should produce a design coal with 3,800 kc*l/kg, 121 moisture,
0.7Z sulphur, and 381 ash. The steam generator will be designed
to accmodate raw coal with calorific value as low as 2,800
kcal/kg.



Annex 3.1
Page 2 of 2
- Transport of Coal. Bj- a merry-go-round rail line about 30-km
long equipped with bottom discharging wagons.
- Cooling System. The cooling water requirements of the power
station will be met by a close-circuit cooling towers system.
Make-up water to replace evaporation will come from the Samal
Barrage pond about 3 km distant.
- Ash Disposal. At 5,500 hrs operation per year the 1,000 MW
power station will produce about 1.7 million tons of ash. The
ash disposal area is available approximately 7 km from the power
station site. Ash will be pumped as slurry through a pipeline.
5.      The dedicated satellite-based data processing communication net-
work that will connect NTPC's corporate office with its power stations is
the least-cost option to overcome the current telecommunication con-
straint. The proposed communication network consists of six INSAT Type
"B" satellite earth stations located at the project sites of Singrauli,
Korba, Ramagundam, Farakka, Kahalgaon, and Talcher communicating on a star
configuration with a central INSAT Type "A" Delhi Region Satellite Barth
Station to be located at Muradnagar near Delhi. In addition, the com-
munication network includes 2 longhaul terrestrial digital microwave radio
relay links to interconnect the Rihand and Vindhyachal STPPs to the
Singrauli Earth Station and one double hop-link between the Delhi Region
Earth Station and NTPC's corporate office. The data processing network of
NTPC will consist of 6 main-frame computers to be installed at the NTPC's
corporate center, Singrauli, Ramagundam, Korba, Farakka and Talcher.
Remote communication processors will be installed at NTPC's other power
generating facilites to enable these power stations to use the data
processing resources available elewhere in the network.
6.      The power from the power station will be evacuated through two
400-kV, double circuit transmission lines:
- Talcher-Rengali - 40 km
- Talcher-Rourkela - 190 km
In addition an independent 220-kV line will be built from Rengali
to provide power for the start-up of the power station.

TALCHBR THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Notes on Coal Linkage
1.        The proposed power station has been linked to the Lingraj Block
of the Talcher Coalfield. This linkage has been confirmed by the Special
Standing Linkage Committee on Power at a meeting held in New Delhi on
January 2, 1986.
Characteristics of the Talcher Coalfield
2.        The Talcher Coalfield is located in the State of Orissa in the
Valley of the Brahamani River. It covers an rea of 1,800 sq kmes. Coal
formation took place in the Carboniferous Period and the coal deposition
is of drift origin, e.g., the carboniferous material was carried away from
its place of formation to the deposition area by water. An aggregate
thickness of 177 meters of coal horizons has been identified at Talcher an
estimated reserves are over 30,000 million tons. There are predominantly
8 coal horizons in this coalfield. The coal seams are intercollated by
carbonaceous shale.
The Lingraj Block
3.        The Lingraj Block is located in the south-eastern part of the
coalfield. So far 700 million tons of coal reserves have been proved and
another 300 million tons are in the indicated category. At present 12
boreholes per sq km have been drilled and Coal India Ltd., is planning to
drill 4 more boreholes per sq km to reach 16 boreholes per sq km. The
coal deposits are at a very shallow depth; about 8 to 10 X of overburden
near outcrops. The overall overburden to coal stripping ratio is 0.8
cubic meter per ton.
Coal Quality Parameters for Raw Coal
4.        The following are the the coal quality parameters obtained from
analysis of raw coal samples frca boreholes drilled at the Lingraj Block:
Design Coal     Worst Coal       Best Coal
Moisture                 12X             17X              10S
Ash                      381             451              302
Gross Calorific Value   3,800 kcal/kg   2,800 kcal/kg   4,500 kcal/kg
Volatile Matter         251              211              271

ANNEX 4.10
Page 5 of 7
The escalation rates applied to the above base 1985 fuel costs for
calculating cost increases and tariff fuel surcharges were are set out in
(c) below.
(c) Escalation Factors
The financial projections and project costs are based on 1986 prices
escalated at the Bank's price escallation factors for the foreign and loal
components. The turbo-generators and boilers are, however, subject to the
following maximum price escalation from the date of order:
Singrauli 200 MW units - 25%
Korba, Ramagundam, Farakka, and other 200/210 MW units - 20%
(In the case of Vindhyachal (210 MW units) fixed-price contracts
apply)
500 MW units for all projects - 15% Turbo-generators
- 20% Steam-generators
Physical contingencies
Civil works                    - 10% of construction costs
Equipment                      -  5% of equipment costs
(d) Operations & Maintenance Expenses
Power stations                 - 2.5% on original cost of 200 MW plant
- 2.0% on original cost of 500 1W plant
Transmission & satellite
communication network       - 1.0% on original cost
(e) Depreciation
Power stations                 - 3.5% on original cost of plant
Transmission & satellite
communication network       - 2.6% on original cost
(f) Auxilliary Consumption
Auxilliary power consumption for station use has been assumed at 10%
for 200/210 MW units and combined cycle gas/steam units 2.51, and 8% for
500 MW units.
(g) Tariffs
Tariffs have been determined from the formulae of the Regional bulk
supply contracts which provide for:



ANNEX 4.10
Page 6 of 7
(i) fuel costs with an automatic fuel price adjustment clause;
(ii)  depreciation applied to capital costs escalated to current
costs;
(iii) operations and maintenance costs based on capital costs for
power plants and transmission facilities, escalated to current
costs;
(iv) loan interest at the prevailing GOI interest rate (currently
14%) on estimated balance of loan principal outstanding;
and
(v) return on equity at 10%.
(h)  Capital Requirements
(i) Other capital requirements would met by NTPC's internal cash
generation combined with GOI advances in the form of equity and
share capital subject to the condition that unpaid loans, at
the end of each year, does not exceed share capital and
retained earnings. Equity capital advances would precede GOI
loan funding, except for Bank Loans 2555-IN and 2674-IN, and
the Bank loan for the proposed Project.
(ii) GOI loans (including the onlending of the proposed Bank loan
and previously approved credits and loans) are assumed to
finance projects included in NTPC's investment program.
Interest on loans up to the date of commissioning of each unit
would be capitalized, while subsequent interest would be
charged to Revenue. Repayment of principal is assumed in 30
semi-annual installments commencing on the first anniversary
following the end of the five-year grace period. The total
loan drawdown for each year, and for each project, is assumed
as a separate GO loan for purposes of loan repayments.
(i)  Balance Sheet
(i) Cash is assumed at 10 days operating expenses less depreciation.
(ii)  Accounts receivable are assumed at a level of equivalent to
two months total operating revenue for FY87 and for each year
thereafter.



ANNX 4410
Page 7 of7
(iii) Inventories are assumed at a level equivalent to 15 days coal
costs (including fuel surcharge), 60 days oil costs, 1.5 years
costs of spares requirements, and 6 months costs of chemicals
and lubricants.
(iv) Loans and advances are assumed at 1% of annual revenue,
Rs 15 million, an added Rs 2 million per year to provide for
loans to officers.
(v) Other current assets are assumed to be a constant figure of 4
million each year.
(vi) Current liabilities are assumed at 1X of annual fuel costs,
15 days of salaries, 2% of annual operations and maintenance
costs, loan principal repayments projected for the subsequent
subsequent year, and one month's average yearly capital
expenditure.

TALCHER THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Internal Economic Rate of Return
As described in Chapter 5, the proposed Project forms an integral
part of the expansion program for the Eastern Region and, therefore,
cost-benefit analysis needs to be carried out on the program as a whole
rather than on the Project in isolation. A time-slice of the Eastern
Region's investment program has, therefore, been analyzed. Capital cost,
incremental operation and maintsnance, incremental fuel cost and benefit
streams for the Eastern Region are shown in Table 1. Assumptions underlying
these figures are detailed below.
Capital Costs
b   Anticipated capita' expenditure on generation at financial prices has
been converted to economic prices by (i) expressing the imported content at
cif prices; (ii) valuing unskilled local labor at 0.75 of the market wage
rate; and (iii) applying the estimated standard conversion factor, 0.8, to
local costs. Transmission and distribution capital expenditures have been
estimated at 50% of generation expenditure.
Operation and Maintenance Costs
Incremental annual operating and maintenance costs have been
estimated as the following percentages of capital value: thermal generating
plant 2.5%, hydroelectric 1.13%, and transmission and distribution 1.0%.
Fuel Costs
Average fuel consumption of new coal-fired plant has been estimated
at 0.645 kg/kWh. The economic cost of coal at the pit head has been
estimated at Rs 164/ton. The economic cost of delivering cqal to load center
stations has been estimated at Rs 0.54/ton mile.
Case 1. Benefits
Case 1. benefits are based solely on incremental revenue at existing
tariff levels. These allow for system losses which are assumed to remain
constant at 21% of net generation in the Eastern Region. The average finan-
cial tariff in FY'85 was Rs 0.56/kWh. After allowing for (a) general infla-
tion of approximately 7% per year from FY'85 to date; and (b) a standard



ANNEX 5.2
Page 2 of 4
conversion factor of 0.8, the corresponding average economic tariff at cur-
rent prices is Rs 0.50/kWh.
Case 2. Benefits
In Case 2, the benefits of incremental consumption include elements
of consumers' surplus for both industrial and agricultural consumers.
Surplus has been imputed at half of the difference between the average tariff
for each category and the alternative costs of autogeneration for industrial
consumers and diesel pumping for agricultural.
The cost of industrial autogeneration, at mid-FY'85 prices, has been
estimated as follows:
Purchase price (incl. installation)        Rs 4,300/kW
Life of cet                                  15 years
Average utilization                            30%
Discount rate                                  12%
Operation and maintenance cost             Rs 215/kW per annum
Fuel and lubticant                         Rs 0.80/kWh
Average cost                               Rs 1.12/kWh
The cost of electricity which would equate the cost of electrical
pumping with that of diesel is calculated at mid-FY'85 prices as follows:

at which diesel and electricity            3 Rs. 2.21/kWh
are equivalent
Average industrial and agricultural financial tariffs during FY'85
in the Eastern Region are estimated at Rs. 0.64/kWh and Rs. 0.20/kWh respec-
tively. After allowing for inflation between mid-PY'85 and end FY'86, the
average estimated willingness to pay, converted into economic terms at a
standard conversion factor of 0.8, is Rs 0.78/kWh for industrial and
Rs 1.02/kWh for agricultural. Combining these with revenue estimates of the
benefits to other consumers gives an average benefit of Rs 0.70/kWh in
economic terms.
