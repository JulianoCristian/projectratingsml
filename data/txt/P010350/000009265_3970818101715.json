The project only\n            partially achieved its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was negligible, sustainability is\n            unlikely, and the performance of the Bank was marginally\n            satisfactory while the Borrower's was deficient.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, the\n            political will to effect critical changes, especially in\n            interest rates and granting autonomy to ADBP, should have\n            been critically appraised. Second, a broader financial\n            sector operation, like the ongoing Financial Sector\n            Deepening and Intermediation Project, is more appropriate.\n            Third, institutional weaknesses and financial policy\n            deficiencies need to be addressed before Bank funds are\n            channeled on a major scale. Fourth, overlapping periods\n            between the previous and follow-up project are best avoided\n            to learn from the past. Fifth, it is clear that establishing\n            target loan recovery rates while providing short-term\n            incentives, if any, is not an adequate response to the\n            underlying problems. Sixth, government ownership of banks\n            virtually eliminates a proper incentive framework.\n            Therefore, serious consideration should be given to an\n            insistence on privatization. Finally, unless\n            agricultural/rural credit interest rates are identical to\n            the market-based interest rates, participation of the\n            commercial banks in any rural credit operation will never\n            become meaningful."}, "docdt": "1997-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
