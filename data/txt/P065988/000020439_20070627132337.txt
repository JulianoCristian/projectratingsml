Supplemental GEF Grant 
–
Consolidation of the Protected Areas System Project 
 
Report on Compliance with Safeguard and Fiduciary Policies 
 
Background: 
 
This report refers to a supplemental GEF grant to the United Mexican States and Fondo 
Mexicano para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (FMCN) for US$7.35 million, to 
provide additional funding for the Mexico: Consolidation of the Protected Areas System 
Project (SINAP 2). The SINAP 2 Project was approved by the Board on February 7, 
2002. The corresponding Grant Agreement was signed on February 13, 2002, and 
became effective on April 25, 2002. The Project is expected to close by June 30, 2010. 
 
The Project's objective is to promote the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity 
in Mexico through the consolidation of the National System Protected Areas (SINAP) by: 
(a) conserving globally important biodiversity in selected areas of SINAP through an 
endowment fund; (b) promoting the economic, social and environmental sustainability of 
productive activities in selected protected areas; (c) promoting social co-responsibility for 
conservation; and (d) in general, promoting the inclusion of biodiversity conservation and 
sustainable criteria in development projects and other practices affecting selected 
protected areas. This project extends the protected areas program initiated with GEF 
funding in 1992 and restructured as an endowment fund for 10 protected areas in 1997 
(Project SINAP l), by adding 12 new protected areas to the program. There have been no 
substantial changes to the project's original objectives and design since Board approval. 
 
The original GEF grant amounted to US$31.1, while the total cost of the project is $60.12 
million (+ $55.08 million? See page 49 PAD). The first disbursement took place on May 
10, 2002 and included US$ 7.5 million in endowment funds to cover the basic 
conservation of four protected areas.  A second tranche of US$2.21 million, to support 
basic conservation in Sierra de Álamos in the state of Sonora in Mexico, was disbursed 
on July 1, 2004.The proposed supplemental GEF grant would be used to further 
capitalize the endowment of the protected areas fund under FMCN ("Fondo para Areas 
Naturales Protegidas" - FANP) for the second, fourth, sixth and seventh of the additional 
eight protected areas listed on page 99 of the Project's Appraisal Document (PAD). The 
protected areas to be supported by the funds provided in this supplemental grant are “La 
Encrucijada” in Chiapas, “El Pinacate Gran Desierto del Altar” in Sonora, “Sierra La 
Laguna” in Baja California Sur, and “Banco Chinchorro” in Quintana Roo. All four 
Reserves are considered to be areas of high biological and  
Page  5
ecological importance. All four also face important threats to the conservation and 
sustainable use of their natural resources, and are therefore considered of high priority for 
protection. More details on the ecology of the three protected areas, and the threats they 
face, can be found in Annex C.  
 
Per the policy adopted by the Board in March 2002, this supplemental grant includes 
additional information on the following: summary of evidence for compliance with 
established conditions for the supplemental grant; the estimated project costs, 
procurement and disbursement arrangements, the social assessment and social strategy, 
the FANP endowment, and the environmental analysis; revised logical framework; 
changes to the matching funds; and additional information on the Social Assessment and 
Operational Strategy design for the 
“La Encrucijada,” “El Pinacate Gran Desierto del 
Altar,” “Sierra La Laguna,” and “Banco Chinchorro” protected areas in the states of 
Chiapas, Sonora, Baja California Sur, and Quintana Roo, respectively. 
 
Summary of evidence for compliance with established conditions for supplemental grant: 
 
Compliance of the supplemental GEF grant with applicable Bank safeguard and fiduciary 
policies were ensured by applying the procedures established in the Project Appraisal 
Document (PAD) and Legal Agreement, particularly in the annexes on procurement, 
disbursement and environmental analysis. The conditions required the submission of the 
following documentation: 
 
·
Reserve-specific logical framework with protected area-specific indicators. 
 
·
Evidence of matching contributions to the endowment. 
 
·
Adequate social assessment for the entering protected areas. 
 
·
Adequate evaluation of indigenous peoples' issues and appropriate design of 
Indigenous Peoples Development Plans, if indigenous people are located within 
the protected area. 
 
·
Endowment contributions by SEMARNAT (
Secretariat for the Environment and 
Natural Resources: Secretar
ía del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales
)
to 
FANP, in order to cover taxes during project implementation. 
 
6. These conditions have been met and are summarized below and detailed in the 
 
attached annexes: 
 
a) 
Logical frameworks with indicators for the “La Encrucijada” protected area in 
Chiapas, “El Pinacate y Gran Desierto del Altar” in Sonora, “Sierra la Laguna” in 
Baja California Sur, and “Banco Chinchorro” in Quintana Roo have been 
completed and are included in Annex A.   
b) . 
 
c)  A total of $7.35 million in matching funds (a ratio of 1:1) has been received and 
deposited, and the Bank has reviewed all the documentation showing the deposits. 
Page  6
The deposited funds are endowment funds, and the interest will be channeled to 
priority protected areas as established by the original PAD. The funds were 
provided by both SEMERNAT and by private conservation foundations. The 
supplemental GEF Grant Document includes a summary of the sources and 
amounts of the matching funds for the third tranche, as well as those for earlier 
tranches.  Additional information (including copies of the bank statements 
showing deposits amounting to US$7.35 million accompanied by the agreements 
signed by the donors) are held in our project files and available upon request.  
 
d) 
The executive summaries of the completed social assessment for “La 
Encrucijada,” “El Pinacate,” “La Laguna,” and “Banco Chinchorro” are included 
Annex Aand provide an appropriate design of remedial actions, which are also 
defined in the logical framework.  The social assessments have been reviewed and 
cleared by the project’s social specialist, and meet the World Bank’s safeguard 
requirements. 
 
e) No Indigenous Peoples Development Plans were required, as the social 
assessment for “La Encrucijada,” “El Pinacate,” “La Laguna,” and “Banco 
Chinchorro” showed no potential impact on indigenous peoples.  
 
f) The documentation showing endowment contributions by the Mexican 
Government (SEMARNAT) to the project has been reviewed by the Bank and is 
held in our project files. SEMARNAT has deposited a total of US$2.67 million in 
endowment funds to cover taxes during project implementation in the third 
tranche. 
g)  in the third tranche.

7. The procedures described in the Project Appraisal Document, particularly in the 
annexes on procurement, disbursement, and environmental analysis were followed, and 
no significant modifications are required in Annex 3, 6, 11, 14 and 15, since the 
expansion of the FANP was part of the original project design and is included in the 
Project Appraisal Document in the following fashion: 
 
Annex 3
:
"Estimated Project Costs": the funds requested by the supplemental grant 
are included in the US$ 15 million under the GEF column in the third table found 
on page 49. The matching funds described in Annex B of this report are included 
under the "GOM" and "Private" columns of the same table. 
 
Annex 6
:
“Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements”: the supplemental grant 
will be part of the endowment capital.  Its generated income will finance the  
implementation of Annual Operating Plans (POA) in each of the four protected 
areas.  The $7.35 million supplemental grant by GEF and the corresponding $7.35 
million matching funds should be added to the “Other” column under “4. 
Endowment Fund”.   
Page  7
Annex 11
:
“Social Assessment and Social Strategy”: as stated above, the social 
assessments for the “La Encrucijada,” “El Pinacate,” “La Laguna” and “Banco 
Chinchorro” protected areas have been submitted and cleared by the World Bank.  
Their summaries are included in Annex C.  The social strategy that will be 
followed in “La Encrucijada,” “El Pinacate,” “La Laguna” and “Banco Chinchorro” 
is the one described in Annex 11 for the original four protected areas, since it is a 
general strategy designed for the 12 new protected areas to be supported by the 
endowment income.  
 
Annex 14
:
Annex 14: “Further Expansion of the FANP Endowment”: this annex 
incorporates the supplemental grants for the remaining eight protected areas, 
including “La Encrucijada,” “El Pinacate,” “La Laguna,” and “Banco Chinchorro” 
as part of the expansion of the endowment. The average costs per area are the ones 
described in this Annex and have suffered no changes. 
 
Annex 15
:
"Environmental Analysis": the procedures described in this annex will 
be followed, in case any of the activities included in the annual operating plans of 
the “La Encrucijada,” “El Pinacate,” “La Laguna” and “Banco Chinchorro” 
protected areas require an environmental impact assessment, in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in the FMCN/FANP Operational Manual and the CONANP 
Operational Manual.

Annex C1. Executive summary of the “La Encrucijada” social assessment 
 
Overview.
 The La Encrucijada Biosphere Reserve is the natural bridge between the 
Neartic and Neotropical areas, thus harbouring high biodiversity. It is located along the 
coast of southeast Chiapas and is located within six municipalities. The population within 
the reserve includes 21,195 inhabitants and there are 228 localities. If the surrounding 
area (influence area of the reserve) is included the population reaches 196,238 inhabitants 
and 1,682 localities. The main economic activities include fishing, agriculture and cattle 
ranching. Fishing and agriculture are mainly found within the reserve, while cattle 
ranching is more prevalent around the protected area. Pressure on the natural resources 
comes from lack organization in the fishing sector, extensive cattle ranching and lack of 
use of alternatives in an expansive agriculture.
 
Indigenous people and vulnerable population.
 No ethnic group is found in the reserve. 
The communities within the reserve are mainly 
mestizo
.
Although the region is 
recognized as the most prosperous in the sate of Chiapas, most of the people in the six 
municipalities earn below minimum wages and 10% reports no income according to the 
2000 national census (INEGI). Hence, the population is classified as under poverty and 
extreme poverty status. Vulnerable population includes temporal workers and subsistence 
farmers. Women are also included in this group, although land is inherited to both men 
and women in equal parts and census data show a higher fecundity control in the 
municipalities within the reserve than the average at the state level.  
 
Main social issues.
 Land tenure studies indicate that there are 728 properties within the 
reserve with 554 private (76.1 %), 65 federal (8.9 %), 61 belonging to 
ejidos
 (8.4 %) and 
48 are national property (6.6 %). The main pressure comes from unregulated fishing, 
agricultural expansion, extensive cattle ranching, and incipient projects in aquaculture 
and tourism that disregard environmental aspects. Cattle ranching in the northern part of 
the reserve is aimed at selling calves to intermediaries than then secure the final sale in 
cities. Milk production is low due to poor breeds and bad management of the pastures. 
The southern part of the reserve produces mango, bananas, cacao and sugarcane. 
Pesticides, overuse of fertilizers and opening of roads to sell the products characterize 
this activity in large plantations. Mango and cacao rely on intermediaries and are sold 
without any added value. The fishing activity is concentrated in the center of the reserve. 
The lakes provide the largest production and the activity is mainly extractive, although 
there are some incipient projects aimed at aquaculture. The mangroves are also used to 
extract firewood and wood for construction. All along the coast artisan fishing takes 
place, as well as tourism that lack regulation. Poor coordination between the activities 
promoted by public and private organizations results in overuse of natural resources that 
already affects local communities, as indicated by an increase in the fishing effort in the 
last six years.  
 
Social organization.
 
The organization and economic levels are directly associated in this 
area. The cattle ranchers, which have more economic resources, are well organized, 
followed by the farmers, the fishers, the subsistence farmers and the temporal workers. 
Page  36
Cattle ranchers are organized at the community, municipality and regional level. The 
majority belong to the National Cattle Ranching Confederation, which allows them to 
have access to credits. The Ministry for Rural Development has promoted the Sustainable 
Development Committee, which has attracted part of the farming community. Fishing 
cooperatives gather fishers and serve as intermediaries for the local markets. There are 
many fishing cooperatives but they operate as separate entities. In 1997 registered fishers 
amounted to 6,598 organized in 60 fisheries and five federations. However, only 15% of 
the cooperatives have fishing concessions. When the catch surpasses the limits 
established by the cooperative, fishers act as individual sellers thus undermining all 
benefits of forming part of an organization. Fishers not registered are estimated to amount 
to the same number as those registered. Fishing methods are rudimentary and largely 
disregard environmental impact. Unregulated fishing results in no restriction on size or 
time of capture, which is evident in the recent decrease of the stocks. Temporal workers 
lack any form of organization and often suffer from exploitation from members of 
ejidos
 
and cattle ranchers. People offering tourism services often live in the main cities of each 
municipality. Except for those involved n transportation they lack any form of 
organization. Those focused on transportation only coordinate their activities when 
needed for political leverage. In many communities women have organized themselves to 
obtain government credits for cattle ranching, organic produce, oil palm, rice and corn. 
Other actors that have an important influence include the organizations 
Cáritas, 
IDESMAC, La Esperanza del Año 2000, Comité Pigua, and Compartamos.
 
Universities 
and research centers that are active in the area include
 
UAM, ECOSUR (Tapachula), 
Universidad de Chapingo, UNICACH, Universidad de Rochester, and Universidad 
Antonio Narro. The management of the reserve itself was started by the Natural History 
Institute. Although it is now independent from this state organization, residents still 
associate the two institutions. The Advisory Council was functional in 1998 and 1999, 
but then stopped meeting as a group. However, its committees focused on surveillance, 
community development and ecotourism continued to operate until 2000. In 2005 the 
Advisory Council was re-established in order to design the plan of activities for the 
reserve starting in 2006.  
 
Social Strategy Action Plan
The social strategy will promote participatory forums to link social groups with 
authorities in order to reach consensus regarding decision making for actions in the 
protected area. It will include the two Watershed Committees, the three Municipal 
Councils for Sustainable Development, one group for regional planning, one Committee 
for Fire Management, one Committee for the fishing sector, one committee for marine 
security and one forum for civil society organizations. The social strategy will also 
develop a program on alternative tourism to guide the development of this activity in the 
reserve, including the establishment of a museum on the environment. Through a 
program aimed at productive alternatives it will focus on reaching 25% of the surface 
under cattle ranching or agriculture to be sustainable by 2010 with more than 200 people 
involved. It will further promote sustainable fishing through three pilot projects that by 
2010 will serve as a demonstration to fish sustainably in 50 ha with 210 fishers. At least 
Page  37
12 communities will be targeted by 2010 for an environmental education campaign aimed 
at recognizing the natural values of the reserve. In order to be eligible to receive the 
support from the reserve the communities will have to be legally established, belong to 
one of the two main lake systems in the reserve, have a direct link with the conservation 
of the watersheds, and indicate increasing pressure on the natural resources. The reserve 
personnel will also provide assistance to find alternatives for any parties interested in 
affecting lakes, extracting wildlife and wood, as well as using pesticides. A special 
Mitigation Plan has been formulated to address vulnerable population affected by 
restrictions on the use of natural resources. 
 
Consultation Process Summary
In 2003 consensus was built around the social action plan through meetings with 
representatives from the different sectors and followed by a series of interviews with the 
different stakeholders. In 2005 the action plan was discussed by the Advisory Council 
and the specific activities for the social action plan were defined. This consultation was 
complemented through a series of independent interviews to main leaders of the fishing 
and tourism sectors.

Annex C2. Executive summary of the “El Pinacate y Gran Desierto del Altar” social 
assessment 
 
Overview.
 
The Biosphere Reserve "El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar" is found in the 
state of Sonora. The 1993 decree encompasses an area of 714,556 ha. It includes three 
municipalities and a population that in 1995 reached 102 people distributed in 21 
localities. In 1995, 66% were men and 34% women. In 2005 the Reserve personnel 
counted a total of 90 residents, 70 of them dedicated to small restaurants and workshops 
along the federal highway. Population density is low due to the lack of water, rugged 
topography, lack of infrastructure and late human occupation. Natural resources are 
therefore well conserved. In the 1970’s properties in this inhospitable area were assigned 
to 
ejidos
,
which was then followed by the Reserve decree. The main economic activities 
in the region are agriculture, cattle ranching and mineral extraction. Cattle ranching 
shows one of the lowest stocking rates in the country. Tourism is considered an activity 
with great potential for the future. Visitation reaches 5 to 6 thousand people per year.  
 
Indigenous people and vulnerable population. 
No indigenous people inhabit the Reserve 
today. The occupation by the Tohono O'odham in the region dates back to more than 
3,000 years. They lived in El Pinacate until the beginning of last century. Today they 
mainly live in Arizona in the Unites States (more than 15,000 people) and in some 
localities in Sonora (not more than 300 people). Their ceremonial centers and main 
sacred sites are in Quitovac, which is found 40 km south of the reserve, which registered 
69 inhabitants in 2000. The Tohono O’odham consider the Pinacate a sacred site. Their 
historical right provides them access and use of the resources as described in the Reserve 
Management Plan. They participate actively in the Advisory Council. While not required, 
as a measure of good faith the project will develop an access plan to help ensure 
continued access to these sites. Funds for this plan have been included in the Social 
Strategy Action Plan Budget. 
 
Main social issues. 
The total surface of the area is distributed in 450,170 ha (63%) as 
property of 
ejidos
,
257,240 ha (36%) as national land, and 7,145 ha (1%) as private 
property. The main activities that have affected the conservation of natural resources are 
cattle ranching, agriculture and the extraction of minerals. In addition, the illegal 
extraction of wildlife and the introduction of invasive exotic species, robbery in 
archaeological sites, pollution with trash and opening of new roads are the main threats to 
the reserve. Cattle ranching is the main activity that affects the natural resources today, 
although the number of heads of cattle has diminished recently due to prolonged 
droughts. Excessive extraction of water from the subsoil will be the major challenge to 
address in the future. In order to feed the cattle the nearby agricultural areas have focused 
on providing forage grass. African grasses, which are invasive, have been introduced. 
Migration to the main cities of the municipalities and to the United States explains the 
decrease observed in the resident population in the area. 
 
Social organization. 
The Advisory Council in El Pinacate Biosphere Reserve was 
established in May 1997. Its activity diminished for a few years due to the long distance 
Page  39
that its members have to travel in order to attend. The Council was therefore restructured 
in May 2004. It meets at least three times per year.  Its 15 members decided to establish 
three sub-councils: one concentrated on historical and cultural aspects (8 members), one 
on science (9 members), and one on ecotourism (10 members). Members of the sub-
councils do not necessarily have to belong to the Advisory Council. Each sub-council has 
its operation guidelines, which can be modified in agreement with the Advisory Council. 
The sub-councils meet more frequently than the Advisory Council. The sub-council on 
history and culture was established in response to the request by the Tohono O’odham 
ethnic group. It is the most active one and it participates in environmental education, 
including its involvement in radio spots and working with schools in the area. The 
Cultural Committee for the Tohono O’odham in Puerto Peñasco forms part of the sub-
council.  
 
Social Strategy Action Plan
The social strategy in El Pinacate considers consolidating a program to ensure that 
economic activities in the area become sustainable with adequate technological support. 
Three main projects have already started. With respect to tourism the protected area has 
established as a goal a decrease in the sites that are impacted by unregulated activities. 
The strategy also includes improving the knowledge of residents and neighbours on the 
natural and cultural resources in El Pinacate with an emphasis on rescuing the local 
Indian culture. Monitoring of this activity will be conducted through annual interviews. 
Participation by residents and users of the Reserve will be strengthened through the 
Advisory Council. The protected area personnel plan that the Advisory Council, as well 
as its sub-councils, meet at least three times per year each. The goal is that at least 75% of 
the sectors are represented in these meetings, at least 90% of the agreements are met and 
at least 20% of the resident population actively participates in the conservation and 
management of the Biosphere Reserve. As mentioned above, as a measure of good faith 
the project will also develop an access plan to help ensure the continued access of 
Tohono O’odham resident in other places continued access to sacred sites. 
 
Consultation Process Summary
Four workshops took place in 2002 in the main localities around the protected area. A 
total of 82 people attended from 128 that were invited. All sectors participated with a 
54% representation form the 
ejidos
 (17 of the 28 ejidos in the area). The Tohono 
O’odham did not attend the workshops but they were contacted individually to obtain the 
view of their representatives. Between 2002 and 2005 the social strategy has been in 
consultation through the Advisory Council. At the end of 2005 the consultation was 
further complemented with interviews to the main leaders of the Tohono O’odham.

Annex C3. Executive summary of the “Sierra la Laguna” social assessment 
 
Overview.
 
Sierra La Laguna is in the mountain range in Baja California Sur dividing the 
watersheds leading to the Gulf of California and those leading to the Pacific Ocean. It 
provides 67% of the water in the Baja California Sur state and harbours its greatest 
biodiversity. In 1994 it was decreed as a Biosphere Reserve with an area of 112,437 ha. 
The main activity in the region is extensive cattle ranching, while wood harvest, 
agriculture and ecotourism are secondary activities. Mining is an activity that could affect 
the natural resources in the future. The reserve is located between the municipalities of 
La Paz and Los Cabos. It has 15 small watersheds, where 641 people live in 140 domestic 
units. Although population density is very low, the sate has experienced a rapid 
development in tourism in Los Cabos, which is south from the reserve. The region has 
thus experienced an increase in the demand for wood, art craft and local vegetation that 
has started to affect the reserve. The people that live in Sierra La Laguna are called 
“rancheros” and have a culture of their own due to the isolation they have experienced for 
centuries. Sierra La Laguna is therefore a cultural and natural refuge that needs to be 
conserved. 
 
Indigenous people and vulnerable population.
 
The Spanish Conquest brought the 
extinction of the Indian groups in the region. Colonizers and 
mestizo
 with no access to 
land began to establish in Sierra La Laguna at the end of the XVIII century. Due to their 
isolation the descendants of these colonizers have maintained a unique culture based in 
cattle ranching that has allowed them to survive in this arid region. There are 
ejidos
 in the 
reserve, but their members are 
rancheros
 and do not follow the operation of regular 
ejidos
.
Rancheros rear cattle, goats, pigs and poultry, but cattle represent the basis for 
their subsistence and are often sold to intermediaries. They grow their own vegetables 
and fruits, harvest their own firewood and produce some leather goods. Tasks are 
assigned according to gender. Men take care of the cattle, while women take care of the 
children. The latter prepare fruit preserves, make baskets and clothes to obtain additional 
income for the families. Most women do not have land. Together with young and old 
people they represent the vulnerable population of Sierra La Laguna. Illiterate people 
above 15 years represent 17% of the population, which limits the possibilities for 
development for young people. The average education level in the reserve is 4.7 years of 
school. Children stay in hostels in nearby cities to attend school, while young people 
often migrate in search of better opportunities. Although 
rancheros
 own their own lands, 
have houses and cattle, the lack of services, education and medical treatment indicate that 
this population has been excluded from the benefits derived from development. 
 
Main social issues.
 
One quarter of the area of the reserve is national, while 55% is private 
or 
ejido
 land. The rest still needs to be regulated. There are 31 identified properties in the 
area. Eight of them are 
ejido
 and 23 are private property. Wood harvest and cattle 
ranching have the highest negative impact on the environment. Wood extraction increases 
during the dry season. Wood is sold for construction or as firewood to complement the 
income of the local families. Cattle change the plant composition of the dry forest, but 
have been present for more than two centuries in the area with no major changes in terms 
Page  41
of management. Among the 124 cattle producers in the reserve, 81% sell their cattle and 
71% have 50 heads of cattle or less. According to recent estimates stocking rates are 
68.4% higher than the carrying capacity. Private companies from Los Cabos and La Paz 
have organized tours to Sierra La Laguna, but the rancheros practically receive no 
benefits.  
 
Social organization.
 
The 
ranchero
 culture is based on the individual and the family, so no 
social organization exists in the reserve. 
Rancheros
 do not like to have debts and 
therefore do not feel the need to get organized to have access to public credits. Ninety six 
percent of the population has lived all its life in one of the ranches in Sierra La Laguna. 
No civil organizations work in the area. Public agencies that work in the area include the 
state government, the Health Ministry, the Public Education Ministry and the 
Environmental Ministry. The Advisory Council of the reserve was established in 1999. 
Representatives of the federal, state and municipal agencies, as well as academic 
institutions, civil organizations and producers participate. Its main tasks have included 
thorough consultation with the residents of the area on the Management Plan, the 
definition of activities to be conducted by the reserve personnel every year, as well as the 
search for funds for reforestation, erosion control, surveillance and fire control.  
 
Social Strategy Action Plan 
The social strategy seeks increasing the knowledge of the residents on the importance of 
their natural resources. By 2010 the reserve expects that 40% of the residents of Sierra La 
Laguna have basic knowledge on the natural resources of the reserve. The strategy also 
focuses on making cattle ranching sustainable through ten projects aimed at intensifying 
cattle ranching through stables or other means with increasing participation of the 
rancheros
.
In order to increase participation the reserve will ensure complete 
representation of the residents in the Advisory Council and that the majority participates 
actively in conservation activities in their reserve.  
 
Consultation Process Summary
In 2002 extensive interviews were conducted in 32 households distributed in all small 
watersheds in Sierra la Laguna, which represent 28% of the 140 households within the 
reserve. The information gathered was used to prepare the social action plan, which was 
reviewed by the Advisory Council and translated into specific activities for 2006 in the 
second semester of 2005. This consultation was complemented through a series of 
independent interviews to ranchers involved in ecotourism projects and a group of 
women involved in a project for the production of cacti.

Annex C4. Executive summary of the “Banco Chinchorro” social assessment 
 
Overview.
 Banco Chinchorro Biosphere Reserve was decreed in 1996. It is located in the 
Othón Pompeyo Blanco municipality in the southern part of Quintana Roo state. It 
includes 144,360 ha that encompass coral reefs, lagoons, three keys and adjacent marine 
waters. The coral complex has been classified as an atoll and is located 30.8 km from the 
mainland, where the town Mahahual is found. A 1,000 m deep channel separates the 
reserve from the mainland. Banco Chinchorro is part of the Mesoamerican Coral Reef. Its 
reef lagoon is 53,376 ha and four keys are found inside, which total 581.91 ha or 0.4% of 
the total reserve surface. An area of 435.16 ha of these keys is emerged land and 146.75 
ha are interior lagoons. Population in Banco Chinchorro includes only temporary fishers, 
which can reach up to 100 people during the peak of the fishing season. They mainly fish 
the pink snail and the lobster. The fishers live on the mainland in Mahahual and Xcalak. 
 
Indigenous people and vulnerable population.
 
Fishers from Mahahual and Xcalak fish in 
Banco Chinchorro. Both localities have not more than 600 inhabitants each. They are 
mestizo
 and their income is significantly higher than the farmers in Quintana Roo state. It 
is estimated that they earn between $300 and $400 per day. They own their own boats 
and members of the cooperatives have medical insurance and a retirement fund. They live 
within the urban centers of Mahahual and Xcalak. Most lack property titles. Education 
levels are low and health care is available, although medical staff is not permanently 
assigned to either locality.   
Main social issues.
 Fishing is the most important activity in the area. The species most 
sought after are the pink snail and lobster, in addition to commercial fish. Fishers in 
Banco Chinchorro belong to three cooperatives. These cooperative include 118 members. 
In Banco Chinchorro they use 30 small cottages that were restored after hurricane Mitch 
in 1998. In addition to the cottages, three of the keys have a lighthouse and one of the 
keys has a radar system. The navy finished a station in one of the keys, which is occupied 
by a team in charge of marine oversight. To this date illegal fishing is still the main threat 
to the reserve. In addition to fishing, tourism is the other important economic activity at 
the BCBR. Although incipient, this activity is likely to show a rapid growth given the 
state government plans to strongly develop the coastal area. Banco Chinchorro is popular 
among divers and sport fishermen, as well as birdwatchers. Exotic species, such as cats 
and rats have been introduced to two of the keys and represent a threat to the native bird 
and reptile species.  
Social organization.
 Due to diminishing fishing stocks in the area the cooperatives and 
people from Xcalak were instrumental in the decree of Xcalak National Park and the 
elaboration of the Management Program for Xcalak and Banco Chinchorro protected 
areas. The Advisory Council established in 1998 relies on the existing fishing and 
tourism cooperatives. Changes in its members follow those in the cooperatives. 
Agreements reached include guidelines for fishing, number of boats allowed in Banco 
Chinchorro and number of members.  
 
Social Strategy Action Plan
Page  43
The social strategy focuses on four main activities that have already started. It promotes 
responsible fishing through the certification of sustainable lobster; and it supports the 
cooperatives against illegal fishers through surveillance. Responsible tourism is promoted 
through a registry of visitors and dissemination of authorized diving practices. Fishers are 
supported during their stay on Banco Chinchorro through availability of facilities. The 
dissemination of the natural resources in Banco Chinchorro, their importance and 
conservation practices is monitored through annual surveys.  
 
Consultation Process Summary
Consultation for specific project activities included in the social strategy took place in 
2002 through the Advisory Council. Activities initiated in 2003 supported with funds 
from The Summit Charitable Foundation and Marisla Foundation through the Fund for 
Protected Areas (matching endowment funds to SINAP 2). Consultation took place 
through the Advisory Council both for the strategy and for the specific yearly activities. 
The Advisory Council reviews annually the specific activities proposed by the reserve 
personnel and the advances attained within the social strategy.
