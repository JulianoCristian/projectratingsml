Objectives andDescription:Promote the       conservation and     sustainable   use   of
                          biodiversity in Mexico through the consolidation of the
                          National Protected Areas System (SINAP) by: (a) conserving
                          globally important biodiversity in selected protected areas
                          (PA) of SINAP through an endowment fund; (b) promoting
                          the economic, social and environmental sustainability of
                          productive activities in selected PAS; (c) promoting social
                          co-responsibility for conservation; and (d) in general,
                          promoting the inclusion of biodiversity conservation and
                          sustainable criteria in development projects and other
                          practices affecting selected PAS.

Benefits:                 The proposed supplemental GEF grant would be used to
                          further capitalize the Natural Protected Areas Fund (FANP)
                          under FMCN for the following PAS: La Sepultura and El
                          Ocote in Chiapas and Mapimi in the states of Chihuahua,
                          Coahuila and Durango. All three PAS are considered to be
                          areas of high biological and ecological importance and are
                          facing important threats to the conservation and sustainable
                          use of their natural resources, therefore they are considered
                          of high priority for protection.

      Supplemental GEF Grant -Consolidation of the Protected Areas System Project
                                          SINAP   n



1.      This report refers to a supplemental GEF grant to the United Mexican States,
Nacional Financiera S.N.C, and Fondo Mexicano para la Conservacibn de la Naturaleza
(FMCN) for US$5.44 million, to provide additional funding for the Mexico:
Consolidation of the Protected Areas System Project (SNAP 11). The SINAP I1 Project
was approved by the Board on February 7, 2002. The corresponding Grant Agreement
was signed on February 13,2002,and became effective on April 25,2002. The Project is
expected to close by June 30,2010.

2.      The Project's objective is to promote the conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity in Mexico through the consolidation of the National Protected Areas System
(SINAP) by: (a) conserving globally important biodiversity in selected protected areas
(PA) of SINAP through an endowment fund; (b) promoting the economic, social and
environmental sustainability of productive activities in selected PAS;(c) promoting social
co-responsibility for conservation; and (d) in general, promoting the inclusion of
biodiversity conservation and sustainable criteria in development projects and other
practices affecting selected PAS.This project extends the PA program initiated with GEF
funding in 1992 and restructured as an endowment fund for 10 PAS in 1997 (Project
SNAP I), by adding 12 new PASto the program. There have been no substantial changes
to the project's original objectives and design since Board approval.

3.      The total GEF grant amounts to US$31.1 million, while the total cost of the
project is US$60.12 million. The disbursement of the first tranche (US$16.1 million) took
place on May 10, 2002 and included US$7.5 million in endowment funds to cover the
basic conservation of four selected PAS.Six project cycles have been completed in these
first four protected areas, which have reached more then 90% of their annual targets
within a five-year strategic plan. After a thorough participatory exercise a new five-year
plan has been established based on the results observed in the previous one thus allowing
for adaptive management. Advances are being recorded annually. A second tranche of
US$2.21 million in endowment funds, to support basic conservation in Sierra de klamos
PA in the state of Sonora in Mexico, was disbursed on Julyl, 2004. This PA has also
been meeting its annual targets within its five-year strategic plan. The third tranche with a
corresponding disbursement of US$7.35 million took place on October 26, 2007 to
support four PAS:La Encrucijada in the state of Chiapas,Bunco Chinchorro in Quintana
Roo, El Pinacate in Sonora, and Sierra La Laguna in Baja California Sur. These four
protected areas are also achieving the targets of their annual indicators which are part of a
five-year strategic plan. Additionally, advances at the project level are reported annually
based on four main indicators. They show that transformation of natural habitat is
slowing down over time based in satellite images. The transformation rate is also lower
inside than around the protected areas. Further, the indicator species monitored show that
the frequency of observation of their populations is maintained. Additional data are
needed to detect possible trends in the future, but initial observations are encouraging.

The mid-term review of the project identified the monitoring system as an example to
follow in conservation projects elsewhere. The proposed supplemental GEF grant would
be used to further capitalize the Natural Protected Areas Fund (FANP) under FMCN for the
following PAS: La Sepultura and El Ocote in Chiapas and Mapimi in the states of
Chihuahua, Coahuila and Durango. All three PAS are considered to be areas of high
biological and ecological importance and are facing important threats to the conservation
and sustainable use of their natural resources, therefore they are considered of high
priority for protection. These PAS were selected according to the criteria established in
the Project Appraisal Document (PAD of January 10, 2002, Annex 14, page 99). More
details on the ecology of the three PASand the threats they face can be found in Annex C.
The project has set an international standard in fundraising success, since it surpassed the
1:l requested in endowment funds two years before the end of the project. The last
tranche consists of US$5.44 million while the match is US$10.15 million. FANP started
in 1997 with a US$16.48 million endowment, two donors and ten PA. Today FANP has
reached US$67.7 million provided by 12 donors and supporting 24 PA. The public-
private partnership, monitoring system, increase in fiscal and private funds, and
guidelines developed are an example being used by other environmental funds in the
world.

4.      Per the policy adopted by the Board in March 2002, this supplemental grant
includes additional information on the following: (i) summary of evidence for
compliance with established conditions for the supplemental grant; (ii) the estimated
project costs, procurement and disbursement arrangements, (iii) the social assessment and
social strategy, (iv) the FANP endowment, (v) the environmental analysis; (vi) revised
logical framework; (vii) changes to the matching funds; and (viii) additional information
on the Social Assessment and Operational Strategy design for the PASLa Sepultura and
El Ocote in the state of Chiapas, and Mapimi in the states of Coahuila, Durango and
Chihuahua.

Summary of evidencefor compliance with established conditionsfor supplemental grant:

5.      Compliance of the supplemental GEF grant with applicable Bank safeguard and
fiduciary policies was ensured by applying the procedures established in the PAD and
Legal Agreement, particularly in the annexes on procurement, disbursement and
environmental analysis. The conditions required the submission of the following
documentation:

        PA-specific logical framework with PA-specific indicators.

        Evidence of matching contributions to the FANP

        Adequate social assessment for the entering PAS.

        Adequate evaluation of indigenous peoples' issues and appropriate design of
        Indigenous Peoples Development Plans (IPDPs), as needed.

        Endowment contributions by the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources
        (SEMARNAT) to FANP, in order to cover taxes during project implementation.

6. These conditions have been met and are summarized below and detailed in the
attached annexes:

    a) The logical frameworks with the indicators for the La Sepultura, El Ocote, and
        Mapimi PASare included in Annex A.

    b) Evidence of matching contributions to the endowment: Annex B includes a table
        that summarizes the matching funds to date. Copies of bank account statements
        showing deposits amounting to US$ 10.15 million accompanied by the
        agreements signed by the donors are available in project files.

    c) The social assessments and social strategies for La Sepultura, El Ocote, and
        Mapimi PASare available in project files; executive summaries are included in
        Annex C. The appropriate designs of remedial actions are defined in the logical
        frameworks in Annex A.

    d) Social assessment identified that 80% of population in El Ocote PA is of
        indigenous descent; therefore the whole social strategy for this area has been
        prepared according to the Indigenous Peoples ~ o l i c (IPP). In the case of La
                                                                        ~ '
        Sepultura PA, there is only a small community of indigenous migrants
        concentrated in Villahermosa; an IPP has been prepared for this community.
        There is no indigenous population in Mapimi PA. The social strategy in Annex C
        comprises a summary of the IPP for El Ocote PA and the Villahermosa IPP in La
        Sepultura. Both IPP were fully discussed and agreed with indigenous populations
        and locally disclosed. Full IPP are available in project files and will be sent to the
        Infoshop for further disclosure.

    e) The endowment contributions by SEMARNAT to FANP are shown in the bank
        account statements described in Annex B. SEMARNAT has deposited a total of
        US$2.3 million           in endowment funds to cover taxes                 during project
        implementation.

7. The procedures described in the PAD, particularly in the annexes on procurement,
disbursement, and environmental analysis were followed, and no significant
modifications are required in Annex 3, 6, 11, 14 and 15, since the expansion of the FANP
was part of the original project design and is included in the PAD in the following
fashion:

      Annex 3: "Estimated Project Costs": the funds requested by the supplemental grant
      are included in the US$ 15 million under the GEF column in the third table found
      on page 49. The matching funds described in Annex B of this report are included
      under the "GOM" and "Private" columns of the same table.

Annex 6: "Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements": the supplemental grant
will be part of the endowment capital. Its generated income will finance the area
implementation Annual Operating Plans (POAs). The $5.44 million supplemental
grant by GEF and the corresponding $5.44 million matching funds (plus US$4.71
million additionally raised) should be added to the "Other" column under "4.
Endowment Fund."

Annex 11: "Social Assessment and Social Strategy": as stated above, the social
assessments for the La Sepultura, El Ocote, and Mapimi PAShave been submitted
and cleared by the World Bank. Their summaries are included in Annex C. The
social strategy that will be followed in La Sepultura, El Ocote, and Mapimi PASis
the one described in Annex 11 for the original four PAS, since it is a general
strategy designed for the 12 new PASto be supported by the endowment income.

Annex 14: Annex 14: "Further Expansion of the FANP Endowment": this Annex
incorporates the supplemental grants for the remaining three PAS, including La
Sepultura, El Ocote, and Mapimi PAS as part of the expansion of the endowment.
The average costs per PA are the ones described in this Annex and have suffered no
changes.

Annex 15: "Environmental Analysis": the procedures described in this annex will
be followed, in case any of the activities included in the annual operating plans of
the La Sepultura, El Ocote, and Mapimi PAS require an environmental impact
assessment, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the FMCNIFANP
Operational Manual and the CONANP Operational Manual.

      Preparation of the social strategy for this tranche follows the methodology established in
      the PAD (Annex 11).The main objectives of the social strategy are:

               To. address social issues that might be affecting natural resources conservation,
               while avoiding or mitigating social impacts, through sustainable development
               activities consistent with the project's conservation strategy.

               To build partnerships with the private sector and mainstreaming conservation into
               public sector programs to optimize conservation efforts and sustainability in PA.

               To ensure social participation and commitment to conservation by consolidating the
               project's participation system including direct community involvement in Advisory
               Councils      (AC) (Consejos Asesores)              and    strengthening community-based
                organizations.

      The design of the strategy takes into account the results of the social assessment completed
      during preparation of this fourth tranche and consultation carried out with community
      organizations, indigenous communities, ejidatarios, comuneros, academics and research
      institutions, as well as NGOs. Social strategy comprises the following action lines:

      a.         Indigenous peoples' plans. IPDPS* are to be prepared in PAS where social
      assessment has identified indigenous population linked to PASto ensure that their rights are
      protected and that they participate and benefit from the activities developed under SNAP.
      Accordingly, IPDPs, under the more recent concept Indigenous Peoples Policy (IPP)
      developed by the World Bank, have been prepared for La Sepultura and El Ocote.

      b.         Sustainable development action plans. Sustainable development action plans
      (SDAPs) will be implemented to mitigate possible social impacts due to restrictions in the
      access and/or use of natural resources. SDAPs are jointly identified and agreed with
      communities defining alternative activities to substitute damaging practices; it comprises
      grants to executing sustainable subprojects including training and technical assistance.

      c.         Participation       Strategy.    Participation     strategy   will  ensure stakeholders'
      involvement in the planning and execution of conservation strategy mainly through the
      Advisory Council. It will also include the establishment of alliances and partnerships with
      civil society organizations, NGOs, and the private sector to support conservation efforts
      and sustainable alternatives. It will also seek mainstreaming conservation criteria in public
      sector programs to be executed within PAS.

      d.         Communication. A communication campaign for each PA will promote public
      awareness about biodiversity values; commitment to conservation practices; and
      dissemination of good practices. This campaign will target general public within the reach
      of PASand stakeholder within PASto support conservation efforts.

 IPDP is used here instead of IPP because this project was prepared in 2001 before the change in Indigenous
Peoples Policy, IPP is used where this change has already been incorporated.

Social strategy is included in the logical frameworks in Annex A and its activities are
included in annual operational programs and budgets for each PA.

    Background


    La Sepultura PA, located in the state of Chiapas, was declared a Biosphere Reserve in 1995
    over a surface of 167, 309 hectares, comprising five core areas (13,759 ha) at the heights of
    the Sierra Madre. The buffer zone covers an area of 153,550 hectares most of which has
    been transformed to farming and stock breeding. The expansion of the agricultural frontier is
    the main threat on the PA. To address this threat, the conservation strategy has identified
    eight micro-regions targeting with specific actions agreed with local inhabitants in: (i) Los
    Amates-Pando, (ii) El Tablbn; (iii) Hojas Moradas; (iv) Macuilapa; (v) Las Arenas; (vi) El
    Lagartero; (vii) Zanatenco-Tiltepec; (viii) Ocuilapa (Tonala). These microregions are spread
    over five municipalities (Villacorzo, Villajlores, Cintalapa, Arriaga and Tonald).


    Social situation


    This region has been populated for centuries. However, the original indigenous population
    mostly disappeared during colonial times. By the XIX century the majority of its inhabitants
    were "mestizo3" and their lands converted in big haciendas and cattle ranches. Currently,
    there are 186 communities within the reserve perimeter with an estimated population of
    9,125 inhabitants. Moreover, 124 communities with 25,182 inhabitants living outside the PA
    have lands within the PA. Population concentrates in two major communities: Hojas
    Moradas (31.9 percent of the total) and El Tablbn with 24.7 percent, which has the largest
    population within the reserve. In the last ten years a group of indigenous migrants, mainly
    Tzotziles, Zoques and Tseltales arrived to the PA seeking lands and have established in the
    area; away from their main communities they have been assimilating and adopting the
    "mestizo" local culture.

    The PA lands are split between ejidos4, 52 percent and small owners, 43 percent; only 5
    percent are national lands belonging to the reserve. Ejidos lands comprise: 45 ejidos, legally
    recognized and 31 ejidos in the process to gain legal status; this area also includes
    "avencidados" who are farmers authorized to live in the ejidos but are not land owners. Small
    owners live outside the PA but use its land for cattle rearing. National lands are occupied by
    65 families, called for that reason "nacionaleros" who seeking to regularize their situation,



 Mestizo is a Spanish term that was formerly used in the Spanish Empire to designate people of mixed European
(Spaniard) and Amerindian ancestry living in the region of Latin America. (From www.wikipedia.org)

  The ejido (from latin exitum) is a property system that combines common ownership of lands with individual
exploitation by each member in the ejido called ejidatario. This use of community land was a common practice
during the time of Aztec rule in Mexico. (From www.wikipedia.org)

and by 1500 persons who received five hectares each from a trust fund created by the state
government to buy lands.

The breeding of cows is the most important activity followed by subsistence agriculture of
maize, beans and vegetables; these activities concentrate at micro-regions Los Amates, El
Tabldn, Hojas Moradas and Macuilapan; however coffee growing has been gaining
importance at the heights parts of these areas. The extraction of woods and palms (camedor)
is another source of income for these micro-regions and also for Zanatenco and Ocuilapa.
There is a mix of these activities in each micro-region according with the traditions and
needs of the population.


Main Organizations


Local organizations in the region evolved until recently under a paternalistic system linked to
electoral purposes. The movement of landless population to obtain lands was the most
important social movement in the last decade. However, once the process was completed, it
lost force. Now organizations grow around productive activities, therefore the most important
organizations are linked to cattle-rearing and agriculture including: Uniones de Ejidos,
Consejo de Vigilancia del Comite' de Cuenca Zanatenco, Sociedad Cooperativa "Unidn de
productores de la Sierra de Villaflores", Organizaciones agrarias (SOCAMA, CNC, CEC,
OCEZ-CENPA and OPI),Sociedades de Produccidn Rural.

Academia and research institutions that also play an important role in the region include:
Chiapas University, Chapingo University local campus, ECOSUR, INIFAP, and biology
faculties from other state universities such as Veracruz University and UNAM. Some
national and international conservation NGOs are also active in the region.

Municipal governments and some federal institutions mainly linked to agriculture, forestry
and natural resources management are also involved in the PA (FIRCO, CNA, SAGARPA,
PROFEPA, SEMARNAT, CONAFOR, and Mesoamerican Biological Corridor). MASECA
(the maize flour producer), and other private firms linked to the processing of local products
are also relevant for the PA because of their influence on local production.


Conservation issues

In contrast with other countries, decrees of PA in Mexico do not affect land tenure. Theyjust
regulate land use according to the ecological attributes of the different parts of the PA. Only
in a few PAShas the Government of Mexico or NGOs purchased core areas for conservation.
The challenge in purchasing is twofold: before the purchase is to avoid land speculation and,
most importantly, after the purchase ensuring constant surveillance to avoid illegal
settlements in remote areas is difficult. Thus in the majority of the PASthe regulation on land
depends on a strong collaboration between CONANP and the PA stakeholders that rests on
support of sustainable projects in the field. Because the majority of the La Sepultura PA
lands are either ejidos or small properties, conservation of its natural resources and
biodiversity represented a challenge for CONANP. The establishment of the PA created
initially a negative reaction from local population; it took a constant education process to
gain their support over the importance of the biodiversity richness and the need to conserve.

The approach of "working with the people" has been the basis for a change in their attitude.
Now there the majority of the population recognizes the importance to conserve the PA and
have agreed to change the most damaging practices.

The introduction of alternative production systems such as "conservation coffee," palm
cultivation and the development of ecotourism, and environmental services, as part of
conservation strategy, have gained the collaboration of the communities it is a new source of
income rather than a restriction.

Consultation carried out during social assessment preparations indicates that the local
population recognizes the benefits of conservation and it actively participates in programs
such as fire prevention, reforestation and voluntary forestry guards.


Social Strategy


The proposed social strategy is based on the social assessment carried out, including
consultation carried out with local population within the PA, its buffer zone and key
stakeholders including local government and federal institutions as well as NGOs and
research institutions.

a. Indigenous Peoples Plan

Since the XIX century original indigenous peoples in the region had disappeared giving place
to a "mestizo" population. However, in the last decade, a small group of indigenous
population, Tseltal, Tzotzil and Zoque coming from other poor areas in Chiapas arrived to the
reserve under an offer by the state's Agrarian Reform Secretariat, to create a trust-fund to
buy them land. This indigenous population, less than 500, has integrated into existing ejidos
to receive lands and has adopted the mestizo culture of the majority (19,982 persons).

However, an Indigenous Peoples Policy (IPP) has been prepared for Villaflores where the
majority of indigenous population, Tzotzil, concentrates. They were consulted to prepare this
IPP that includes, in addition to sustainable activities described next, their participation in
programs such as OPORTUNIDADES and PROCAMPO. This IPP, agreed with indigenous
population, is available in the Infoshop and in project files.

b. SustainableDevelopment Action Plan

The SDAP integrates the various actions designed and implemented jointly with the
communities to gradually substitute damaging practices for sustainable alternatives, thus
avoiding or mitigating impacts. This action plan comprises two-main areas, taking into
account socio-economic and cultural conditions and productive practices as well as natural
conditions advantages, as explained in next table.

                non wood species)                         Maize for self- consumption
                Coffee production                        Palm cultivation (instead of extraction)
                Maize and been commercial
                production
                Sustainable cow rearing


The establishment of alternative practices that take into account communities' capacities and
their priorities has gained support to conserve and avoid social impacts.

c. Participation

The PA Directorate has been very active reactivating the Advisory Council (AC) that is the
maximum assembly forum to discuss and take decisions about the PA. In 2007 the AC was
re-structured with the participation of all ejidos and small owners' organizations to make it
more operational around the established micro-regions and critical activities linked to local
population priorities and conservation strategy. A sub-council will be established in each
micro-region comprising participatory commissions around the following activities:

            Management of forestry products (wood and non wood resources)
            Sustainable agriculture
            Combined conservation and cattle rearing
            Community forestry
            Conservation coffee
            Ecotourism
            Carbon capture and environmental services
            Integrated fire management.
            Soil and water conservation
            Environment education and training.

d. Communication

Communication program in La Sepultura PA intends to inform and build consensus around
the importance of the reserve and its conservation among stakeholders. This program
includes thematic events, round tables, information and experiences exchange and school
children programs and special training for teachers. The establishment of field schools to
train local producers and the offering of economic incentives to introduce innovative
practices, have been very successful because they directly involve land owners and
ejidatarios. There are also radio programs and the distribution of posters and educational
materials.

                                            AND




Background

El Ocote PA was initially declared protected area in 2000. It became a biosphere reserve in
2006 over an area of 101, 288 hectares and was incorporated into the Man and Biosphere
Program of UNESCO. The reserve was established over an area comprising several
indigenous communities, mainly Zoque, as well as mestizo population, both living in poverty.
Of the 101,288hectares comprising the reserve, only 36,674 hectares are national lands while
2,736 hectares are illegally occupied; 26,845 hectares are "ejidos" and 35,010 hectares are
small property. This situation is taken into account in the conservation strategy of the PA,
which aims at:

    Promoting sustainable development under equity principles;

    Strengthening community organization and promoting their participation in the planning
and management of the PA; and

    Developing productive alternativeto ensure the sustainable use of natural resources.


Social situation

El Ocote has a population of 14,612 inhabitants scattered in small communities with only a
few families each; 36 of such communities are located within the limits of the PA while 28
are established at its buffer zone; only a few communities have more than 500 inhabitants
namely: Benito Juarez, Adolfo Ldpez Mateos, Luis Echeverria, Manuel Velasco and Las
Pimientas. Although the original Zoque People that used to occupy this area disappeared
almost completely during colonial times, indigenous migrants of Tztozil descent, who arrived
during the 1960s, comprise 54% of the population, 16% of them speaks only their own
language, while 84% are bilingual.

These indigenous communities (64 in total) are below the poverty-line and 90% of them are
categorized as highly marginalized; they live in extreme poverty, suffering from
malnourishment and health problems and lacking basic services. Access to education is
limited and most of the children do not complete basic education; only 1.8%declares to have
completed it and have additional studies. The majority of the population, 89% lives of
subsistence agriculture producing mainly maize for self-consumption; houses have only one
or two rooms in poor conditions; 40% do not have clean water although the majority has
electricity. The southeast communities are connected to the state capital Tuxtla Gutie'rrez, by
a main road but the north zone has only access by river and paths therefore are recurrently
isolated during the rain season.

Main Organizations

Community organizations are weak and lack representation; ejidos authorities are the main
type of organizations. Some municipalities have local representatives but usually lack the
resources to play a relevant role. Among the federal programs education and health are the
most important and teachers are well recognized by the communities. There are several
NGOs and research institutions also operating in the reserve. The most important institution
is CONANP through its PA Directorate.


Conservation issues

The predominance of non sustainable agriculture practices and grazing have had a negative
impact on the natural resources of the fragile tropical forest soils of the reserve; this impact
has been aggravated by the construction of the road Tuxtla Gutie'rrez-Cosoleacaque that
crosses the PA. This situation and the recurrent fires, some of them provoked, are the main
threats to the reserve. Local population is aware of the environment degradation that is
causing fertility loss and consequently affecting their harvests and income and is willingly
participating in alternative activities.

Conservation strategy focuses on the protection of two core areas and four critical areas
under pressure in the buffer zone through the development of alternative activities replacing
damaging practices and an adequate use of natural resources taking into account indigenous
peoples practices and priorities.


Social Strategy

Social strategy of El Ocote PA main purpose is to involve local communities in conservation
strategy and their direct participation in the execution of sustainable alternatives. This social
strategy has at its core the protection of indigenous peoples' rights and ensures that they
benefit from and participate in sustainable development practices compatible with their
culture and traditions.

a.    Indigenous Peoples Development Plan

Because the majority of the population in El Ocote PA is of indigenous descent the IPDP,
now under the concept of Indigenous Peoples Policy (IPP), comprises all communities within
the PA. Preparation of the IPP took into account existing studies and programs and
consultation carried out with indigenous communities during social assessment. Specifically
this IPP promotes:

           The right of indigenous peoples over their land and natural resources;
           Their participate in conservation planning
           Participation in sustainable development activities compatible with their culture;
           Respect to their cultural background and tradition in all activities within the PA.
           Poverty reduction and improvement of life conditions of indigenous communities.

To execute this IPP, the PA has bilingual staff knowledgeable of indigenous peoples' culture
and traditions.

b.    Sustainable Development Action Plan

To address conservation issues, the social strategy comprises a SDAP to develop sustainable
activities to replace damaging practices in agreement with local communities. This process
allows achieving conservation goals while avoiding negative impacts from restrictions in the
access to natural resources in core areas and deteriorated areas. This plan combining the
protection and sustainable use of natural resources includes:

            Diminishing deforestation and natural resources degradation;
            Controlling soil erosion and degradation;
            Ensuring protection of water sources;
            Increase productivity and diversify agriculture;
            Substitute extensive cattle-rearing by intensive more sustainable alternatives; and
            Promoting ecotourism in order to reduce poverty and improve conditions of local
            communities.

This plan is intended to protect core areas, reduce the growth of the agriculture frontier and
avoid further changes in land use. The plan offers investment and training to carry out
sustainable activities agreed with the communities according to their priorities and capacity.
Participation, education and self-awareness are the principles guiding this plan. Main
activities of this plan focus on Ejido Emiliano Zapata based on agreements with the
community to incorporate optional sustainablepractices.

c.      Participation

In accordance with the inclusive strategy proposed in the Natural Protected Areas Plan 2007-
2012 the social strategy comprises specific actions intended to ensure participation of local
communities. To this aim, social assessment included identification, categorization and
consultation of communities and other organizations operating at the PA. Participation
promotion has as its main objective the reactivation and strengthening of the Advisory
Council (AC), to be the main tool for participatory management of the PA; the AC will
operate over a network of local councils established in each community and will also
integrate representatives of the three levels of government. Participation strategy comprises:

            Consolidating and strengthening community organizations in environment
            awareness through community-based initiatives and environment education;

            Promoting sustainable development alternatives taking into account community
            priorities and capacity;

            Ensuring that indigenous peoples participate and benefit from conservation and
            sustainable development actions;

            Coordination of the different government institutions involved in conservation
            and sustainable development.

d.   Communication

The communication is an instrument through which the social strategy intends to promote
participation and awareness about the importance of conservation of the PA for local and
surrounding communities and population. Specifically, this strategy is intended to engage
population in environmental education activities, conservation planning and management of
the PA, as well as to disseminate good practices and outcomes.

It comprises education programs for school children and training on environment for school
teachers and education events for the various stakeholders in the region. Field schools have
been established to facilitate training of local producers in sustainability and conservation
practices.

                                            AND




Background

The Mapimi PA (Piedra en lo Alto) is located at the Chihuahua desert that has been
classified as a World Priority Region (RTP-52) for its biodiversity richness; in 2000 it was
categorized as Biosphere Reserve over an area of 342,388 hectares occupying 54% of the
Chihuahua desert in three states Chihuahua, Durango and Coahuila. It has two core areas of
28,532 hectares and a buffer zone of 313,855hectares.


Social Conditions

The PA is located in the confluence of three states: Durango, Coahuila and Chihuahua in an
area originally occupied by big haciendas and mining companies developed at the beginning
of the XX century. Currently, it comprises 11 ejidos and 4 small properties created during an
agrarian reform process that took place in the 1960's to provide with land to former hacienda
workers and miners. The decline of mining and the poor soil conditions limited the growth of
human settlements and made community life difficult. Population has been steadily declining
due to constant migration. As a result, according to data from the PA management plan, in
2006 there were only 353 inhabitants.

Only a few families live within the reserve while the majority inhabits the buffer zone.
Nearby there are also small groups of people without any connection with the PA providing a
few services and trading. States and municipality activities are limited and only a few federal
programs such as Progress and Temporary Employment Program (PET) are operating.

Rather than established villages, most families live in isolation under a "ranch model"
dedicated mainly to extensive cattle-rearing; cattle is estimated to be around 9,000 animals
comprising a mix of bovines, sheep, goats and horses; the common feature is the over-
grazing of scarce pastures. In Laguna Paloma and Estacibn Carrillo salt production is the
main source of income; however this activity is facing difficulties due to reduced prices.
There is also a limited number of small mining activities.

The PA has also some tourist activity around the so called "Silence Zone" and the old
haciendas and factories; however this activity was carried out in a disorganized manner by
external operators, damaging the area without real benefits for the local people, the true
owners of the area. As a result, they decided to stop this operation and carry out a full
reorganization.

Currently, with the support of the PA Directorate, a pilot ecotourism program is being
executed at Ejido La Flor. The core of the attraction though, the "Silence Zone" remains
closed to visitors.

    Main organizations

    Because of isolation and lack of social cohesion, there are no relevant organizations in
   Mapimi PA except the traditional ejido authorities and some groups organized around some
    activities like the salt producers and the cattle association.

    The PA Directorate plays a critical role in Mapimi PA and has been very active seeking
    opportunities to promote partnerships and coordinate activities among federal, states and
    municipal authorities. Recently, it has reached an agreement with CONAFOR to finance
    conservation activities such as the cultivation of "nopa15" for cattle feeding; it has also
    obtained he support by Mapimi PA municipal government in Durango to protect micro-
    catchments in ejidos La Flor and Los klamos.


    Conservation issues

    There is not a full study of the impact of economic activities in the PA. However, according
    to a sample study carried out by the PA's staff over an area of 51, 597 hectares, 3.5% of the
    surface (1,807 ha) requires priority conservation; 28.9% (14,942 ha) is in good conditions;
    44.5% (22,934 ha) is in regular conservation state; a 19.08% (9,844 ha) is in bad conditions;
    and 4% (2,067 h) requires urgent restoration.

    The main damages are the result of over grazing due to extensive cattle rearing and to the
    inadequate exploitation of some natural resources. To address these issues the PA Directorate
    has been closely working with local inhabitants in the design and execution of a social
    strategy.


    Social Strategy

    There are no indigenous peoples in Mapimi PA and population is scarce; therefore, the social
    strategy focuses on the implementation of a SDAP to transform damaging practices and
    avoid negative social impacts for limiting the access to natural resources. The promotion of
    participation in conservation planning and activities as well as the implementation of a
    communication program complement this effort.

    a.    Sustainable Development Action Plan

    Through this SDAP the PA's staff has directly involved the ranchers in a program to improve
    cattle rearing by providing training, technical assistance and small investment to improve
    infrastructure. Participation is voluntary and the staff closely provides support and technical
    assistance to minimize risks and achieve results. However, there are some ranchers that are
    not yet participating.




 Nopal refers to the species within the genus Opuntia in the cactus family, Cactaceae, which consists of more than
300 species spread between the U.S. and Patagonia.


                                                                                                                 45

The main issues regarding conservation and sustainable use of natural resources are
concentrated on an area of national lands under the official perimeter of the reserve that has
been illegally occupied by five families of Ejido La Soledad of Jime'nez Chihuahua. The
agreement reached with these families is that while the land will be legally under the PA,
they will continue using the resources under an agreement comprising sustainable activities
and application of conservation practices. The dialogue has been and will continue to be the
main instrument to address conservation issues.

In the case of tourism for instance, the PA Directorate prepared a report on the damages
produced by inadequate tourism activities. The land owners used this report as a basis to
complain on the external operators and, on their own initiative, agreed to close temporarily
the access to the area during a session of the Advisory Council on March 15, 2005. Recently,
an agreement was reached to grant restricted access to selected areasjointly defined with the
PA Directorate.

At the same time, the PA Directorate has developed an alternative to promote ecotourism
with ejidatarios in Ejido La Flor (Durango) that has been very successful. La Flor has built
with the support of the PA a Visitors Center and a Museum; women and men in La Flor have
received training to carry themselves the activity; they are currently the guides and provide
food and accommodation to visitors. This success has attracted other communities to develop
similar activities. The plan is to build facilities to benefit other communities within the
framework of the Conservation Management Plan of the PA in Laguna Palomas and La
Soledad at Jime'nez, Chihuahua; and ejidos Vicente Guerrero, and Mohovano de las Lilas in
Sierra Mojada, Coahuila.

Some other activities under the sustainable action plan include reopening the exploitation of
marble that exists in Tlahualilo. This activity was initially carried out irregularly by a private
miner from outside the region and closed its activities when the PA was established in 2000.
Negotiations are under way with ejidatarios that want to reinitiate this activity; some
alternatives are beingjointly evaluated to reach an agreement.

A program to improve salt production to benefit the population at Laguna Palomares
dedicated to this activity is also under process to make it more productive and sustainable.
The program includes: (i) the establishment of a better production process; (ii) identification
of additional business and market opportunities; and (iii) the promotion of a business
oriented organization. The community is receiving training and support to undertake this
program focusing on strengthening the role of young entrepreneurs.

Finally, there is an agreement with seven land owners to carry out an Integrated Pasture
Management Program to reduce over-exploitation in order to restore and preserve the pasture
ecosystem.

Altogether this action plan is expected to produce convincing results in order to bring
voluntarily all inhabitants in the PA to adopt sustainable practices and support conservation
efforts.

b.     Participation

The PA Directorate has been able to establish, despite difficult conditions, the Advisory
Committee (AC) which is the main forum to discuss and support to the conservation strategy.
Promoting active participation of its main stakeholders will help to consolidate its role and
further support towards conservation.

The AC has allowed the discussion of conservation planning, the use of soil, reach
agreements about natural resources use and the kind of activities to be included in the SDAP.
It has also helped to rescue local traditions and begin to build an identity around the
importance of the reserve.

Some achievements promoting community-based organizations are: (i) the support to the salt
producers' organization in Laguna de Palomas in which women play a critical role; (ii) the
ecotourism project in La Flor in which women's participation was instrumental; and (iii) the
organization of seven plot owners to participate in an integral program to better use pastures.

c.     Communication

Mapimi PA has been implementing a communication strategy centered on an environment
education program targeting ranchers, inhabitants, school children, high school students and
municipal population as well as visitors. The purpose is to raise awareness towards the four
main problems affecting the PA: (i) inadequate cattle rearing; (ii) lack of order in tourism;
(iii) inadequate solid waste disposal; and (iv) the illegal extraction of fauna, plants and illegal
hunting.

Between the years 2003-2007, this strategy obtained the following results:

            The recognition of the importance of the PA among the communities in the
            influence area;

            The operation of the visitor's center that has received annually on average 1,400
            visitors;

            The training of 150teachers who are the basis to expand environmental education
            and three certified instructors by the program: Learning a Tree. This effort is
            supported by educational materials such as the manual about the Bolsbn Turtle,
            soil conservation, the global biodiversity value of the reserve, etc.

            The establishment of two communal centers to promote environmental education
            at two of the most important population centers.

           The PA produces also a periodical informative bulletin to disseminate best
           practices and provide general information to continue communication.

           The plan is to expand the program bringing local authorities to contribute to this
           effort.
