  SupplementalGEF Grant-Consolidationof the ProtectedAreas SystemProject
                                           SINAP I1


Background:

1. This report refers to a supplemental GEF grant to the UnitedMexican States and
Fondo Mexican0 para la Conservacih de la Naturaleza (FMCN) for US$7.35 million, to
provide additional funding for the Mexico: Consolidation o f the Protected Areas System
Project (SNAP 11). The S N A P I1Project was approved by the Board on February 7,
2002. The corresponding GrantAgreement was signedon February 13,2002, and
became effective on April 25,2002. The Project i s expected to close by June 30,2010.

2. The Project's objective i s to promote the conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity inMexico through the consolidation o f the National System Protected Areas
(SNAP) by: (a) conserving globally important biodiversity inselected areas o f S N A P
through an endowment fund; (b) promoting the economic, social and environmental
sustainability o f productive activities inselected protected areas; (c) promoting social co-
responsibility for conservation; and (d) ingeneral, promoting the inclusion of biodiversity
conservation and sustainable criteria indevelopment projects and other practices
affecting selected protected areas. This project extends the protected areas program
initiated with GEF funding in 1992 and restructured as an endowment funds to support
conservation o f 10 protected areas in 1997 (Project SINAP l),   by adding 12new
protected areas to the program. There have been no substantial changes to the project's
original objectives and design since Board approval.

3. The total GEF grant amounts to US$31.1,while the total cost of the project i s
US$60.12 million. The disbursement o fthe first tranche (US$16.1 million) took place on
May 10,2002 and included US$ 7.5 million inendowment funds to cover the basic
conservation o f four selected protected areas. A second tranche o f US$2.21 million in
endowment finds, to support basic conservation inSierra de Alamos inthe state o f
Sonora inMexico, was disbursed on July 1,2004. The proposed supplemental GEF grant
would be usedto further capitalize the endowment o f the protected areas fund ("Fond0
para Areas Naturales Protegidas" - FANP) under the Mexican Fundfor Nature
Conservation (FMCN) for the second, fourth, sixth and seventh o fthe additional eight
protected areas listed on page 99 o f the Project's Appraisal Document (PAD). The
protected areas to be supported by the funds provided inthis supplemental grant are "La
Encrucijada" inChiapas State, "El Pinacate GranDesierto del Altar GranDesierto del
Altar" inSonora State, "Sierra L a Laguna" inBaja California Sur State, and "Banco
Chinchorro" inQuintana Roo State. All four Reserves are considered to be areas o f high
biological and ecological importance. All four also face important threats to the
conservation and sustainable use o ftheir natural resources, and are therefore considered
o f highpriority for protection. More details on the ecology o f the four protected areas,
and the threats they face, can be found inAnnex C.

4. Per the policy adopted by the Board inMarch 2002, this supplemental grant includes
additional information on the following: summary of evidence for compliance with

                                               1

established conditions for the supplemental grant; the estimated project costs,
procurement and disbursement arrangements, the social assessmentand social strategy,
the FANP endowment, and the environmental analysis; revisedlogical framework;
changes to the matching funds; and additional information on the Social Assessment and
Operational Strategy design for the "La Encrucijada," "El Pinacate GranDesierto del
Altar GranDesierto del Altar," "Sierra L a Laguna," and "Banco Chinchorro" protected
areas inthe states o f Chiapas, Sonora, Baja California Sur, and Quintana Roo,
respectively.

Summaryofevidence for compliance with established conditions for supplemental grant:

5. Compliance of the supplemental GEF grant with applicable Bank safeguard and
fiduciary policies were ensured by applying the procedures established inthe Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) and Legal Agreement, particularly inthe annexes on
procurement, disbursementand environmental analysis. The conditions requiredthe
submission o f the following documentation:

    0  Reserve-specific logical framework with protected area-specific indicators.

    0  Evidence o f matching contributions to the endowment.

    0  Adequate social assessment for the entering protected areas.

   0   Adequate evaluation o f indigenous peoples' issues and appropriate design o f
       Indigenous Peoples Development Plans, if indigenous people are located within
       the protected area.


   0   Endowment contributions by SEMARNAT (Secretariatfor the Environment and
       Natural Resources: Secretaria del Medio Ambientey Recursos Naturales) to
       FANP, inorder to cover taxes duringproject implementation.

6. These conditions have beenmet and are summarized below and detailed inthe
annexes:

   a) Logical frameworks with indicators for the "La Encrucijada" protected area in
       Chiapas, "El Pinacate Gran Desierto del Altar y Gran Desierto del Altar" in
       Sonora, "Sierra la Laguna" in Baja California Sur, and "Banco Chinchorro" in
       Quintana Roo have been completed and are included inAnnex A.

   b) A total o f $7.35 million in matching funds (a ratio o f 1:l) has been received and
       deposited, and the Bank has reviewed all the documentation showing the deposits.
       The deposited funds are endowment funds, and the interest will be channeled to
       priority protected areas as established by the original PAD. The funds were
       provided by both SEMARNAT and by private conservation foundations. The
       supplemental GEF Grant Document includes a summary o f the sources and
       amounts o f the matching funds for the third tranche, as well as those for earlier
       tranches.    Additional information (including copies o f the bank statements



                                             2

        showing deposits amounting to US$7.35 million accompanied by the agreements
        signed by the donors) are heldinour project files and available upon request.

        The executive summaries o f the completed social assessment for "La
        Encrucijada," "El Pinacate Gran Desierto del Altar," "La Laguna," and "Banco
        Chinchorro" are included Annex Aand provide an appropriate design of remedial
        actions, which are also defined inthe logical framework. The social assessments
       have been reviewed and cleared by the project's social specialist, and meet the
        World Bank's safeguard requirements.

       N o Indigenous Peoples Development Plans were required, as the social
        assessments for "La Encrucijada," "El Pinacate Gran Desierto del Altar Gran
       Desierto del Altar," "La Laguna," and "Banco Chinchorro" showed no potential
        impact on indigenous peoples.

       The documentation showing endowment contributions by the Mexican
        Government (SEMARNAT) to the project has been reviewedby the Bank and i s
       heldinour project files. SEMARNAThas deposited a total of US$2.67 million in
       endowment funds to cover taxes during project implementation in the third
       tranche.

7. The procedures described inthe Project Appraisal Document, particularly inthe
annexes on procurement, disbursement, and environmental analysis were followed, and
no significant modifications are required inAnnex 3,6, 11, 14and 15, since the
expansion o f the FANP was part o f the original project design and i s included inthe
Project Appraisal Document inthe following fashion:

     Annex 3: "Estimated Project Costs": the funds requested by the supplemental grant
     are included inthe US$ 15 millionunder the GEF column inthe third table found

       Annex C1. Executive summary of the "La Encrucijada" social assessment


Overview. The La EncrucijadaBiosphere Reserve i s the natural bridge between the
Neartic and Neotropical areas, thus harbouring highbiodiversity. It i s located along the
coast o f southeast Chiapas and i s located within six municipalities. The populationwithin
the reserve includes 21,195 inhabitants andthere are 228 localities. Ifthe surrounding
area (influence area o f the reserve) i s includedthe populationreaches 196,238 inhabitants
and 1,682 localities. The main economic activities include fishing, agriculture and cattle
ranching. Fishing and agriculture are mainly found within the reserve, while cattle
ranching i s more prevalent around the protected area. Pressure on the natural resources
comes from lack organization inthe fishing sector, extensive cattle ranching and lack o f
use o f alternatives inan expansive agriculture.

Indigenous people and vulnerable population. N o ethnic group i s found inthe reserve.
The communities within the reserve are mainly mestizo. Although the region is
recognized as the most prosperous inthe sate o f Chiapas, most o fthe people inthe six
municipalities earn below minimumwages and 10% reports no income according to the
2000 national census (INEGI).Hence, the population i s classified as under poverty and
extreme poverty status. Vulnerable population includes temporal workers and subsistence
farmers. Women are also included inthis group, although landi s inheritedto both men
and women inequal parts and census data show a higher fecundity control inthe
municipalities withinthe reserve than the average at the state level.

Main social issues. Land tenure studies indicate that there are 728 properties within the
reserve with 554 private (76.1 %), 65 federal (8.9 %), 61 belonging to ejidos (8.4 %) and
48 are national property (6.6 %). The main pressure comes from unregulated fishing,
agricultural expansion, extensive cattle ranching, and incipient projects in aquaculture
and tourism that disregard environmental aspects. Cattle ranching inthe northern part o f
the reserve is aimed at selling calves to intermediaries than then secure the final sale in
cities. Milk production i s low due to poor breeds and bad management o f the pastures.
The southern part o f the reserve produces mango, bananas, cacao and sugarcane.
Pesticides, overuse o f fertilizers and opening of roads to sell the products characterize
this activity in large plantations. Mango and cacao rely on intermediaries and are sold
without any added value. The fishing activity i s concentrated inthe center o f the reserve.
The lakes provide the largest production and the activity is mainly extractive, although
there are some incipient projects aimed at aquaculture. The mangroves are also used to
extract firewood and wood for construction. All along the coast artisan fishing takes
place, as well as tourism that lack regulation. Poor coordination between the activities
promoted by public and private organizations results in overuse o f natural resources that
already affects local communities, as indicated by an increase inthe fishing effort in the
last six years.

Social organization. The organization and economic levels are directly associated inthis
area. The cattle ranchers, which have more economic resources, are well organized,
followed by the farmers, the fishers, the subsistence farmers and the temporal workers.



                                               32

 Cattle ranchers are organized at the community, municipality and regional level. The
 majority belong to the National Cattle Ranching Confederation, which allows them to
 have access to credits. The Ministry for Rural Developmenthas promoted the Sustainable
 Development Committee, which has attracted part o f the farming community. Fishing
 cooperatives gather fishers and serve as intermediaries for the local markets. There are
 many fishing cooperatives but they operate as separate entities. In 1997 registered fishers
 amounted to 6,598 organized in 60 fisheries and five federations. However, only 15% o f
 the cooperatives have fishing concessions. When the catch surpasses the limits
 established by the cooperative, fishers act as individual sellers thus undermining all
 benefitso f forming part o f an organization. Fishersnot registered are estimated to amount
 to the same number as those registered. Fishing methods are rudimentary and largely
 disregard environmental impact. Unregulated fishing results in no restriction on size or
time o f capture, which i s evident in the recent decrease o f the stocks. Temporal workers
 lack any form o f organization and often suffer from exploitation from members o f ejidos
 and cattle ranchers. People offering tourism services often live inthe main cities o f each
municipality. Except for those involved n transportation they lack any form o f
organization. Those focused on transportation only coordinate their activities when
neededfor political leverage. Inmany communities women have organized themselves to
obtain government credits for cattle ranching, organic produce, oil palm, rice and corn.
Other actors that have an important influence include the organizations Chritas,
IDESMAC, L a Esperanza del Aiio 2000, ComitC Pigua, and Compartamos. Universities
and research centers that are active in the area include UAM, ECOSUR (Tapachula),
Universidad de Chapingo, UNICACH, Universidad de Rochester, and Universidad
Antonio Narro. The management o f the reserve itself was started by the Natural History
Institute. Although it is now independent from this state organization, residents still
associate the two institutions. The Advisory Council was functional in 1998 and 1999,
but then stopped meeting as a group. However, its committees focused on surveillance,
community development and ecotourism continued to operate until 2000. In 2005 the
Advisory Council was re-established in order to design the plan o f activities for the
reserve starting in2006.


Social Strategy Action Plan

The social strategy will promote participatory forums to link social groups with
authorities in order to reach consensus regarding decision making for actions in the
protected area. It will include the two Watershed Committees, the three Municipal
Councils for Sustainable Development, one group for regional planning, one Committee
for Fire Management, one Committee for the fishing sector, one committee for marine
security and one forum for civil society organizations. The social strategy will also
develop a program on alternative tourism to guide the development o f this activity inthe
reserve, including the establishment o f a museum on the environment. Through a
program aimed at productive alternatives it will focus on reaching 25% o f the surface
under cattle ranching or agriculture to be sustainable by 2010 with more than 200 people
involved. It will further promote sustainable fishing through three pilot projects that by
2010 will serve as a demonstration to fish sustainably in 50 ha with 210 fishers. At least



                                              33

12 communities will be targeted by 2010 for an environmental education campaign aimed
at recognizing the natural values o f the reserve. In order to be eligible to receive the
support from the reserve the communities will have to be legally established, belong to
one o f the two main lake systems inthe reserve, have a direct link with the conservation
o f the watersheds, and indicate increasing pressure on the natural resources. The reserve
personnel will also provide assistance to find alternatives for any parties interested in
affecting lakes, extracting wildlife and wood, as well as using pesticides. A special
Mitigation Plan has been formulated to address vulnerable population affected by
restrictions on the use o f natural resources.


ConsultationProcess Summary

In 2003 consensus was built around the social action plan through meetings with
representatives from the different sectors and followed by a series o f interviews with the
different stakeholders. In 2005 the action plan was discussed by the Advisory Council
and the specific activities for the social action planwere defined. This consultation was
complemented through a series o f independent interviews to main leaders o f the fishing
and tourism sectors.

 Annex C2. Executivesummary of the "ElPinacateGran Desierto delAltar y Gran
                          DesiertodelAltar" social assessment


Overview. The Biosphere Reserve "El Pinacate Gran Desierto del Altar y Gran Desierto
de Altar" is found in the state o f Sonora. The 1993 decree encompasses an area of
714,556 ha. It includes three municipalities and a population that in 1995 reached 102
people distributedin 21 localities. In 1995, 66% were men and 34% women. In2005 the
Reserve personnel counted a total o f 90 residents, 70 o f them dedicated to small
restaurants and workshops along the federal highway. Population density i s low due to
the lack o f water, rugged topography, lack o f infrastructure and late human occupation.
Natural resources are therefore well conserved. In the 1970's properties in this
inhospitable area were assigned to ejidos, which was then followed by the Reserve
decree. The main economic activities in the region are agriculture, cattle ranching and
mineral extraction. Cattle ranching shows one o f the lowest stocking rates inthe country.
Tourism i s considered an activity with great potential for the future. Visitation reaches 5
to 6 thousand people per year.

Indigenous people and vulnerable population. N o indigenous people inhabit the Reserve
today. The occupation by the Tohono O'odham in the region dates back to more than
3,000 years. They lived in El Pinacate Gran Desierto del Altar untilthe beginningo f last
century. Today they mainly live in Arizona in the Unites States (more than 15,000
people) and in some localities in Sonora (not more than 300 people). Their ceremonial
centers and main sacred sites are inQuitovac, which i s found 40 km south o f the reserve,
which registered 69 inhabitants in 2000. The Tohono O'odham consider the Pinacate a
sacred site. Their historical right provides them access and use o f the resources as
described in the Reserve Management Plan. They participate actively in the Advisory
Council. While not required, as a measure o f good faith the project will develop an access
plan to help ensure continued access to these sites. Fundsfor this plan have been included
inthe Social Strategy Action PlanBudget.

Main social issues. The total surface o f the area is distributed in 450,170 ha (63%) as
property o f ejidos, 257,240 ha (36%) as national land, and 7,145 ha (1%) as private
property. The main activities that have affected the conservation o f natural resources are
cattle ranching, agriculture and the extraction o f minerals. In addition, the illegal
extraction o f wildlife and the introduction o f invasive exotic species, robbery in
archaeological sites, pollution with trash and opening o f new roads are the main threats to
the reserve. Cattle ranching is the main activity that affects the natural resources today,
although the number o f heads o f cattle has diminished recently due to prolonged
droughts. Excessive extraction o f water from the subsoil will be the major challenge to
address inthe future. Inorder to feed the cattle the nearby agricultural areas have focused
on providing forage grass. African grasses, which are invasive, have been introduced.
Migration to the main cities o f the municipalities and to the United States explains the
decrease observed inthe resident population inthe area.




                                            35

Social organization. The Advisory Council in El Pinacate Gran Desierto del Altar
Biosphere Reserve was established in May 1997. Its activity diminished for a few years
due to the long distance that its members have to travel in order to attend. The Council
was therefore restructured in May 2004. It meets at least three times per year. Its 15
members decided to establish three sub-councils: one concentrated on historical and
cultural aspects (8 members), one on science (9 members), and one on ecotourism (10
members). Members o f the sub-councils do not necessarily have to belong to the
Advisory Council. Each sub-council has its operation guidelines, which can be modified
inagreement with the Advisory Council. The sub-councils meetmore frequently thanthe
Advisory Council. The sub-council on history and culture was established in response to
the request by the Tohono O'odham ethnic group. It is the most active one and it
participates in environmental education, including its involvement in radio spots and
working with schools in the area. The Cultural Committee for the Tohono O'odham in
Puerto Peiiasco forms part o f the sub-council.


Social Strategy Action Plan


The social strategy in El Pinacate Gran Desierto del Altar considers consolidating a
program to ensure that economic activities inthe area become sustainable with adequate
technological support. Three main projects have already started. With respect to tourism
the protected area has established as a goal a decrease inthe sites that are impacted by
unregulated activities. The strategy also includes improving the knowledge o f residents
and neighbours on the natural and cultural resources in El Pinacate Gran Desierto del
Altar with an emphasis on rescuing the local Indian culture. Monitoring of this activity
will be conducted through annual interviews. Participation by residents and users of the
Reserve will be strengthenedthrough the Advisory Council. The protected area personnel
planthat the Advisory Council, as well as its sub-councils, meet at least three times per
year each. The goal i s that at least 75% o fthe sectors are represented inthese meetings, at
least 90% o f the agreements are met and at least 20% o f the resident population actively
participates inthe conservation and management o f the Biosphere Reserve. As mentioned
above, as a measure o f good faith the project will also develop an access plan to help
ensure the continued access o f Tohono O'odham resident in other places continued
accessto sacred sites.

ConsultationProcess Summary

Four workshops took place in 2002 in the main localities around the protected area. A
total o f 82 people attended from 128 that were invited. All sectors participated with a
54% representation form the ejidos (17 o f the 28 ejidos in the area). The Tohono
O'odham did not attend the workshops but they were contacted individually to obtain the
view o f their representatives. Between 2002 and 2005 the social strategy has been in
consultation through the Advisory Council. At the end o f 2005 the consultation was
further complemented with interviews to the main leaders o fthe Tohono O'odham.

      Annex C3. Executivesummary of the "Sierra la Laguna" social assessment


Overview. Sierra L a Laguna i s inthe mountain range in Baja California Sur dividing the
watersheds leading to the Gulf o f California and those leading to the Pacific Ocean. It
provides 67% o f the water in the Baja California Sur state and harbours its greatest
biodiversity. In 1994 it was decreed as a Biosphere Reserve with an area o f 112,437 ha.
The main activity in the region is extensive cattle ranching, while wood harvest,
agriculture and ecotourism are secondary activities. Miningi s an activity that could affect
the natural resources in the future. The reserve is located between the municipalities o f
L a Paz and Los Cabos. It has 15 small watersheds, where 641 people live in 140 domestic
units. Although population density is very low, the sate has experienced a rapid
development in tourism in Los Cabos, which is south from the reserve. The region has
thus experienced an increase inthe demand for wood, art craft and local vegetation that
has started to affect the reserve. The people that live in Sierra L a Laguna are called
"rancheros" and have a culture o ftheir own due to the isolation they have experienced for
centuries. Sierra L a Laguna i s therefore a cultural and natural refuge that needs to be
conserved.

Indigenous people and vulnerable population. The Spanish Conquest brought the
extinction of the Indian groups in the region. Colonizers and mestizo with no access to
land began to establish in Sierra L a Laguna at the end o f the XVIII century. Due to their
isolation the descendants o f these colonizers have maintained a unique culture based in
cattle ranching that has allowed them to survive inthis arid region. There are ejidos inthe
reserve, but their members are rancheros and do not follow the operation o f regular
ejidos. Rancheros rear cattle, goats, pigs and poultry, but cattle represent the basis for
their subsistence and are often sold to intermediaries. They grow their own vegetables
and fruits, harvest their own firewood and produce some leather goods. Tasks are
assigned according to gender. Mentake care o f the cattle, while women take care o f the
children. The latter prepare fruit preserves, make baskets and clothes to obtain additional
income for the families. Most women do not have land. Together with young and old
people they represent the vulnerable population o f Sierra L a Laguna. Illiterate people
above 15 years represent 17% of the population, which limits the possibilities for
development for young people. The average education level inthe reserve i s 4.7 years o f
school. Children stay in hostels in nearby cities to attend school, while young people
often migrate in search o f better opportunities. Although rancheros own their own lands,
have houses and cattle, the lack o f services, education and medical treatment indicate that
this populationhasbeenexcluded from the benefits derivedfrom development.

Main social issues. One quarter o f the area o f the reserve i s national, while 55% is private
or ejido land. The rest still needs to be regulated. There are 31 identifiedproperties inthe
area. Eight o f them are ejido and 23 are private property. Wood harvest and cattle
ranching have the highest negative impact on the environment. Wood extraction increases
during the dry season. Wood i s sold for construction or as firewood to complement the
income o f the local families. Cattle change the plant composition o f the dry forest, but
have been present for more thantwo centuries inthe area with no major changes interms



                                              37

o f management. Among the 124 cattle producers inthe reserve, 81% sell their cattle and
71% have 50 heads o f cattle or less. According to recent estimates stocking rates are
68.4% higher than the carrying capacity. Private companies from Los Cabos and La Paz
have organized tours to Sierra L a Laguna, but the rancheros practically receive no
benefits.

Social organization. The ranchero culture is based on the individual andthe family, so no
social organization exists in the reserve. Rancheros do not like to have debts and
therefore do not feel the need to get organized to have access to public credits. Ninety six
percent o f the population has lived all its life in one o f the ranches in Sierra L a Laguna.
N o civil organizations work inthe area. Public agencies that work inthe area include the
state government, the Health Ministry, the Public Education Ministry and the
Environmental Ministry. The Advisory Council o f the reserve was established in 1999.
Representatives o f the federal, state and municipal agencies, as well as academic
institutions, civil organizations and producers participate. Its main tasks have included
thorough consultation with the residents o f the area on the Management Plan, the
definition o f activities to be conducted by the reserve personnel every year, as well as the
search for funds for reforestation, erosion control, surveillance and fire control.


Social Strategy Action Plan

The social strategy seeks increasing the knowledge o f the residents on the importance o f
their natural resources. By 2010 the reserve expects that 40% ofthe residents o f Sierra La
Laguna have basic knowledge on the natural resources o f the reserve. The strategy also
focuses on making cattle ranching sustainable through ten projects aimed at intensifying
cattle ranching through stables or other means with increasing participation o f the
rancheros. In order to increase participation the reserve will ensure complete
representation o f the residents in the Advisory Council and that the majority participates
actively inconservation activities intheir reserve.


ConsultationProcess Summary

In 2002 extensive interviews were conducted in 32 households distributed in all small
watersheds in Sierra la Laguna, which represent 28% o f the 140 households within the
reserve. The information gathered was used to preparethe social action plan, which was
reviewed by the Advisory Council and translated into specific activities for 2006 in the
second semester o f 2005. This consultation was complemented through a series o f
independent interviews to ranchers involved in ecotourism projects and a group o f
women involved ina project for the production o f cacti.

     Annex C4. Executivesummaryof the "Banco Chinchorro"social assessment

Overview. Banco Chinchorro Biosphere Reserve was decreed in 1996. It i s located inthe
Oth6n Pompeyo Blanco municipality in the southern part of Quintana Roo state. It
includes 144,360 ha that encompass coral reefs, lagoons, three keys and adjacent marine
waters. The coral complex has been classified as an atoll and i s located 30.8 km from the
mainland, where the town Mahahual is found. A 1,000 m deep channel separates the
reserve from the mainland. Banco Chinchorro i s part of the MesoamericanCoral Reef. Its
reef lagoon i s 53,376 ha and four keys are found inside, which total 581.91 ha or 0.4% of
the total reserve surface. An area of 435.16 ha of these keys is emerged land and 146.75
ha are interior lagoons. Population in Banco Chinchorro includes only temporary fishers,
which can reachup to 100people during the peak of the fishing season. They mainly fish
the pink snail andthe lobster. The fishers live onthe mainland inMahahual andXcalak.

Indigenous people and vulnerable population. Fishersfrom Mahahual and Xcalak fish in
Banco Chinchorro. Both localities have not more than 600 inhabitants each. They are
mestizo and their income is significantly higher thanthe farmers inQuintana Roo state. It
i s estimated that they earn between $300 and $400 per day. They own their own boats
andmembersof the cooperativeshavemedical insuranceand a retirementfund. They live
within the urban centers of Mahahual and Xcalak. Most lack property titles. Education
levels are low and health care is available, although medical staff is not permanently
assignedto either locality.
Main social issues. Fishing is the most important activity in the area. The species most
sought after are the pink snail and lobster, in addition to commercial fish. Fishers in
Banco Chinchorro belong to three cooperatives. These cooperative include 118 members.
InBanco Chinchorro they use 30 small cottagesthat were restoredafter hurricane Mitch
in 1998. In addition to the cottages, three of the keys have a lighthouse and one of the
keys has a radar system. The navy finished a station inone of the keys, which is occupied
by a team incharge of marine oversight. To this date illegal fishing is still the main threat
to the reserve. In addition to fishing, tourism is the other important economic activity at
the BCBR. Although incipient, this activity is likely to show a rapid growth given the
state government plans to strongly develop the coastal area. Banco Chinchorro is popular
among divers and sport fishermen, as well as birdwatchers. Exotic species, such as cats
and rats have been introduced to two of the keys and represent a threat to the native bird
andreptile species.
Social organization. Due to diminishing fishing stocks in the area the cooperatives and
people from Xcalak were instrumental in the decree of Xcalak National Park and the
elaboration of the Management Program for Xcalak and Banco Chinchorro protected
areas. The Advisory Council established in 1998 relies on the existing fishing and
tourism cooperatives. Changes in its members follow those in the cooperatives.
Agreements reached include guidelines for fishing, number of boats allowed in Banco
Chinchorro andnumber of members.

                                             39

The social strategy focuses on four main activities that have already started. It promotes
responsible fishing through the certification o f sustainable lobster; and it supports the
cooperatives against illegal fishers through surveillance. Responsible tourism i s promoted
through a registry o f visitors and dissemination o f authorized diving practices. Fishersare
supported during their stay on Banco Chinchorro through availability o f facilities. The
dissemination o f the natural resources in Banco Chinchorro, their importance and
conservation practices i s monitoredthrough annual surveys.


ConsultationProcess Summary

Consultation for specific project activities included in the social strategy took place in
2002 through the Advisory Council. Activities initiated in 2003 supported with funds
from The Summit Charitable Foundation and Marisla Foundation through the Fund for
Protected Areas (matching endowment funds to S N A P 11). Consultation took place
through the Advisory Council both for the strategy and for the specific yearly activities.
The Advisory Council reviews annually the specific activities proposed by the reserve
personnel andthe advances attained within the social strategy.
