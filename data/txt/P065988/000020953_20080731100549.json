Project\n            development objectives are: 1) to conserve globally\n            important biodiversity in selected areas of SINAP; 2) to\n            promote the economic, social and environmental\n            sustainability of productive activities in selected\n            protected areas; 3) to promote social co-responsibility for\n            conservation; 4) and to promote the inclusion of\n            biodiversity conservation and sustainable use criteria in\n            development projects. It is intended to carry out actions\n            related to education, agricultural diversification of\n            production and manufacturing, artistic and sporting\n            activities aimed at school-age population, women, seniors\n            and groups of producers organized in conditions of\n            vulnerability or belonging to indigenous groups. The\n            approach of the project towards indigenous groups fully\n            respects the Mexican legal framework protecting their\n            rights. An indigenous peoples strategy has been prepared to\n            ensure that indigenous communities participate and benefit\n            from the project. The project is not expected to have any\n            negative impact on indigenous population. The present plan\n            is intended to address the agricultural socio-cultural\n            reality in all its diversity to ensure that indigenous and\n            vulnerable groups become feasible actors and subjects in the\n            medium term transformation and who will improve their living\n            conditions, under a framework of sustainability. The project\n            will contribute to improving the living conditions of\n            indigenous people who experience very high poverty in the\n            Reserve, in terms of economic, social, health, environmental\n            and cultural areas."}, "docdt": "2008-07-28T00:00:00Z"}
