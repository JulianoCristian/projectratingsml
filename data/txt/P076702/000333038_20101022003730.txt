public institutions being connected to 113,500 as recommended by the Ministry of Power
and E nergy. T he reduced t arget i s appropriate in l ight of f aster t han a nticipated grid-
based rural electrification which reduces demand for off-grid renewable solutions.

households ( including 5 00 s mall a nd m edium e nterprises) t o be c onnected t hrough o ff-

The proposed revision of this target is largely attributed to tapering demand for off-grid
solutions as a result of rapid grid expansion which was not anticipated at the time these
targets w ere s et. T he ot her r esults i ndicators r emain va lid a nd t he pr oject c ontinues t o

Intermediate Result (Component One):
Direct access to electricity for 100,000 households and 1,000 rural small and medium enterprises and public institutions through off-grid systems (solar, community hydro and biomass) and an additional
60,000 households including 500 rural small and medium enterprises and public institutions from additional financing.
Revised Intermediate Result (Component One):
