                  Extension of Closing Date and Reallocation of Proceeds

1.      The overall implementation progress of the Project has been satisfactory
throughout its lifetime, as documented in past Implementation Status Reports (the latest
dated May 2011). The Project’s development objectives have been achieved and the
performance indicators have already exceeded its target values (e.g. the capacity of grid-
connected renewable energy installations have surpassed the 135 megawatt (MW)
cumulative target, while the reduction in carbon emissions has achieved 142% of the end
project target.) There are no outstanding fiduciary issues and Financial Monitoring
Reports are submitted on time with no overdue audit reports. Environmental and social
safeguards compliance is also satisfactory.

Extension of closing Date

2.    The closing date for Sri Lanka, Renewable Energy for Rural Economic
Development, IDA Credit No. 3673-CE and 3673-CE-1 and GEF Grant No. TF 051248-
CE, P076702 will be extended from June 30, 2011 until December 31, 2011.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to enable ongoing investments to be
completed and ensure satisfactory close-out of this successful project. The extension is
also being considered to make up for the delay in effectiveness of the Additional
Financing credit which was beyond the control of the implementing agency.

4.     The proposed six-month extension will take the Additional Financing beyond the
three-year limit of the original closing date of the project and RVP approval has been
granted for an exception to OP/BP 13.20, based on the justification of the delay in
additional loan effectiveness.

5.      This will be the first extension of the Additional Financing Credit. A previous
extension of the original IDA Credit and GEF Grant was approved in order to maintain
consistency with the latter closing date of the Additional Financing Credit.
