                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The credit line disbursements have reached approximately 80% and combined with commitments the cumulative is approximately 84% as of August 31, 2010. Full commitment is
                         expected taking into consideration four to five additional mini hydro projects with a cumulative capacity of approximately 15 megawatts (MW) and one wind power project with a
                         capacity of 10 MW positively evaluated by the Participating Credit Institutions. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant disbursement is approximately 89% as of August 31,
                         2010. Based on the above, the overall implementation progress of the RERED project is "Satisfactory."

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The end-of-project target for 'off-grid renewables' component of 161,000 households, small and medium enterprises and public institutions being connected has been revised to
                         113,500. The revision of this target was largely attributed to tapering demand for off-grid solutions as a result of rapid grid expansion which was not anticipated at the time the original
                         targets were set.
