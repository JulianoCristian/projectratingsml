were as\n            follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was negligible to low, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: local\n            participation and involvement, suitably incentivized, is\n            crucial to promoting distributed power generation\n            activities. Involving the private sector effectively in a\n            decentralized developmental effort requires flexibility in\n            implementation arrangements and space for adapting to market\n            conditions. An appropriate feed-in-tariffs policy and its\n            consistent and transparent application are crucial to spur\n            growth of small scale and non-conventional renewable energy\n            generation. Investments in off-grid electrification can be\n            underutilized or even abandoned in the event of a faster\n            than expected arrival of the electricity grid. To mitigate\n            this, the expansion of the grid should be coordinated with\n            off-grid investments, and, where warranted, the off-grid\n            facilities should be made grid-compatible to ensure\n            continued utility."}, "docdt": "2014-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
