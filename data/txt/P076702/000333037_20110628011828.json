The project's development objectives have been\n            achieved and the performance indicators have already\n            exceeded its target values (e.g. the capacity of grid\n            connected renewable energy installations have surpassed the\n            135 megawatt (MW) cumulative target, while the reduction in\n            carbon emissions has achieved 142 percent of the end project\n            target.)
