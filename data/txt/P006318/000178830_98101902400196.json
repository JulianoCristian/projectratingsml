"The objective of the project is to\n            increase income and agricultural production of small farmers\n            in central and northwest Maranhao by providing secure land\n            tenure, technical, and marketing assistance, agricultural\n            research, basic health care and expansion of education\n            services, and project coordination, monitoring and\n            evaluation. The project would reach some 39,000 small\n            farmers in 46 municipalities of the state of Maranhao. A\n            state land institute would be responsible for carrying out\n            the regularization and redistribution of public lands to\n            small farmers. Improved agricultural techniques would be\n            introduced gradually to increase productivity while limiting\n            soil erosion and improving soil fertility."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
