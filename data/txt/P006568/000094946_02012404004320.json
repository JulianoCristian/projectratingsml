The main\n            lessons learned include: The irregular funding flow\n            resulting from federal budget management constraints and the\n            complex fund transfer procedures adopted by the Project\n            negatively affected the implementation of both the research\n            projects and the Science Centers' construction\n            schedule. Budget-management rules and the Studies and\n            Projects Financing Agency's (FINEP) own operational\n            structure were designed to deal with external loans, but not\n            with grants. Some of the FINEP's financial intermediary\n            arrangements were incompatible with efficient\n            implementation. The call for competitive research funding\n            were based on broad thematic lines, which led to wide range\n            of thematic proposals. Eligibility criteria should therefore\n            be more strict to encourage concentration and ensure\n            solutions to very precise problems. The first call for\n            proposals lacked integration and synergy with the Pilot\n            Program as a whole. Mechanisms should be included in future\n            directed research projects to make them more responsive to\n            demand and help identify opportunities for greater synergy\n            with program objectives."}, "docdt": "2001-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
