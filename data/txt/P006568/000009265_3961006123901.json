This goal will be pursued through a\n            two-pronged strategy: 1) support for a grants program for\n            funding research projects on a competitive basis in the\n            Amazon region; and 2) strengthening of two established\n            research institutions of the Amazon. The project consists of\n            two components, a Directed Research component and a Science\n            Centers component. The Directed Research component will\n            support a grants program to fund research projects evaluated\n            and selected on a transparent competitive basis. The Science\n            Centers component will: strengthen institutional management;\n            support rehabilitation and expansion of research\n            infrastructure and equipment; increase human resource\n            capacity; disseminate research results; provide technical\n            assistance; and support key policy studies and planning."}, "docdt": "1994-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
