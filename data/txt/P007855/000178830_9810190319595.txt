THIRD LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJE&T
SUMMARY
ill       This report appraises a third project for a livestock development
program to further increase the productivity of the beef cattle industry.
Beef production is the most important industry in Paraguay providing an impor-
tant item in the local diet and earning about US$17.5 million annually in
foreigli exchange, about one-third of total export receipts.
ii.       Since June 1964, with the help of two IDA credits, investments
totalling US$15.7 million have been initiated on 638 ranches carrying 1.8
million cattle on 6.4 million ha. In the next five years this could increase
meat production by 30% or US$5 million per year.
iii.      The Third Project would help finance this program for a further four
years. Basic investments in fencing, water supply, essential ranch construc-
tions, pasture improvement, the! purchase of breebding stock and technical
services would be of the same nature as in the second project. It is ex-
pected that IL)& ranchers would participate in the Project, including at
least 90 who have previously taken part. One hAndrud and eighty of the
ranches of about 10,000 ha each, with 2,800 head of cattle would be in the
Chaco region, and 270 ranches of around 4,000 ha each, with 1,300 head of
cattle would be in the Oriental zone. Loans to ranchers would be repayable
in twelve yeELrs, including four years of grace with interest at nine per cent.
Investments on each ranch would be spread over two years.
iv.       The Project is estimated to cost a total of about US$15.5 million
equivalent, of vhich US$15.1 million vould be for ranch development and loans
to contractors, and US$0.4 million for technical services. The proposed
IDA/Bank credcit/loan would each be US$4.3 million equivalent, together cover-
ing 56% of the total Project cost. The balance would be provided by the
Central Bank (30%) and participating ranchers (14%). The foreign exchange
cost is estinLated to be about US$8.6 iillion.
V.        A Livestock Fund would administer the loan funds through the
National Development Bank (NDB). To improve the present arrangements for
project management, a special Livestock Project Division (LPD) would be
established in NDB to execute the Project. This LPD would be headed by a
Technical Director acceptable to the Bank, and all field technicians associ-
ated with the! Project would be under his supervision. The Coordinating
Committee, consisting of senior representatives of the two banks and the
Technical Director, would approve all loans to ranchers.
vi.       The Project is suitable for an IDA/Bank credit/loan each of US$4.3
million equivalent of which the Bank loan would be repayable over thirty years,
including ten years of grace. The borrower would be repayable over thirty
years, including ten years of grace. The borrower would be the Government of
Paraguay. The organizations involved would be competent to carry out their
respective functions. The average financial rate of return to ranchers would
be around 26% and the internal rate of return to the economy is expected to
be about 29%.

THIRD LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Paraguay has requested assistance to help
finance a project for the continuation of its program of livestock de-
velopment. This program was initiated in 1964 with a project supported
by IDA Credit 47PA of US$3.6 million, and was further financed in 1966 with a
siecond IDA Credit 86PA of US$7.5 million. The expe*ience under the first two
projects was on the whole satisfactory. Commitments under the Second Credit
are about one year ahead of schedule and further finance would be needed by
early 1969. This appraisal report is based on the findings of a mission which
visited Paraguay in September 1968. The mission was composed of Messrs.
J. Gerring (leader), J. Edwards (IBRD), R. Wilhelm and R. Battles (Consultants).
II.   BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Agriculture is the mainstay of the Paraguayan economy, generating
about 34% of GDP and providing some 92% of export earnings. Livestock prod-
ucts account for 36.5% of agricultural exports and on this basis all Bank
mission reports on Paraguay have stressed the importance of the cattle industry
to the national economy. Beef is a major item in the local diet (50 kilos
per capita per annum) and local consumption absorbs about two-thirds of the
anmual output from the national herd of around 6 million head. The balance
isi exported, mainly in the form of corned canned beef, meat extract and hides,
from which earnings have averaged US$17.5 million annually during the past
five years.
B. Credit 47PA
2.02      Recognizing the potential development possibilities of the live-
stock industry, IDA, after requiring the Government to reorganize and
liberalize the cattle marketing situation, signed a Credit Agreement, 47PA,
at the end of' 1963 providing US$3.6 million for a three-year cattle
development project. 1/ The Credit became effective on June 4, 1964 and
was to be disbursed over three and a half years to develop about 150 cattle
ranches.
2.03      This project proceeded at a faster rate than anticipated.   All
Credit funds were committed by the end of the second year (May 31, 1966)
and disbursement completed by the closing date - June 30, 1967. A total of
222 ranch plans were prepared, involving an investment of US$5.33 million,
of which the share of IDA Credit was approximately US$3.3 million, (the
remainder of the Credit being used for technical services and loans to
contractors). Details of investments made are given in Annex I.

2.04      Up to July 31, 1968, all regular amortization payments from Sub-loans
had been paid when due. Only six loans to ranchers and one to contractors had
been cancelled, which resulted in full recovery of the funds involved. Less
than 0.05% of total interest due from ranchers was past due.
C. Credit 86PA
2.05      A second IDA Credit, 86PA, was signed on April 4, 1966 and became
effective on July 28, 1966. It provided US$7.5 million to help finance a
second stage of the livestock development project. 1/ Under this agreement,
further credit was extended for ranch development, for the importation of
machinery by contractors for constructing water facilities and for the pro-
vision of technical supervisory services. In addition, some new categories
of investments, such as drainage works, pasture improvement, purchase of
breeding stock, construction of farm buildings and disease control measures,
were included in the program. Finance was also provided to equip a com-
mercial vaccine producing plant.
2.06      The total cost of this second stage project was estimated at
US$12.7 million, of which the IDA Credit 86PA of US$7.5 million covered 60%.
The foreign exchange component was estimated at US$6.8 million. The remaining
40%0 was shared by Government 15% and participating ranchers 25%.
2.07      Both the first and second stages of the project have been ad-
ministered on behalf of Government by the Central Bank, operating through a
Coordinating Committee. This Committee, consisting of a senior representa-
tive of the Central Bank as Chairman, a representative of the National De-
velopment Bank (NDB) and the Technical Director (a New Zealand livestock
expert) of the project, has been responsible for approving loans to ranchero
and machinery contractors. The NDB has used its technical and banking services
for the preparation of ranch development plans, for assessing the credit-
worthiness of applicants, for making disbursements of approved loans and
for collection of repayments.
2.08      It was estimated that Credit 86PA would be disbursed over four
years for the development of about 360 ranches. The closing date - June 30,
1971 - allowed for one year of slippage. As at August 31, 1968, the equiv-
alent of about US$10.4 million has been committed for 416 approved ranch
development plans. This represents about 87% of IDA Crelit 86PA allocated
for ranch development. Details of the investments made for this purpose
are set out in Annex I. Based on the rate at which loan applications are
being re(ceived, processed and approved, it is anticipated that the remain-
ing 13% of IDA Credit 86PA would be committed by early 1969, or about a year
earlier than anticipated.

D. Progress of the First and Second Stagos
2.09      Ranch development plans which have been executed or initiated under
the two Credits 47PA and 86PA, as at August 31, 1968, number 638. A further
60 to 70 plans should be approved by early 1969 making a total of about 700
compared with 510 forecast for the two projects. The average ranch size is
a little under 10,000 ha carrying 2,800 head of tattle each before development.
However, ranches have varied considerably in area, ranging from as low as
400 ha up to around 300,000 ha. The average investmenit per ranch has been
03.1 million (US$24,700). The total number of cattle involved is expected
to be about 1.8 million or approximately 30% of Paraguay's cattle population
(6 million). RancheTs participating in the projects are well distributed
over the main grasslund areas of the Chaco and Orieidtal Zones (see Map).
2.10      Out of the 638 ranchers so far participating in the project, about
260 have completed their full two-year investment program to date. Never-
theless the results already achieved make possible a preliminary assessment
of the impact; of the two IDA Credits on the beef cattle industry and on the
national economy of Paraguay.
2.11      Data obtained from the Technical Director and the technical staff
for 50 ranchers who have completed their investment program show that stock
numubers have been increased on average by 30%. This increased carrying
capacity has been brought about through better grazing managesent made pos-
sible by internal subdivisions and by the provision of additional stock
watering facilities. The liveweight of steers and cows sold for slaughter
on. average has increased by 20-30 kg per head. As a direct result of the
improved carrying capacity and the concurrent increase in the rate of herd
bulldup, it is anticipated that the number of slaughter cattle coming forvard
for sale from these 50 ranches will increase by about 30% in the next five
years. Should similar improvements in productivity be realized on the other
properties financed under the two Credits, the country could expect, within
the next five years (about 1974) an increase of around 30% in meat production
valued at about US$5 million annually at present market prices. This would
be considerably ahead of the increases in production projected when the First
and Second Credit was made.
2.12      Ranchers participating in the project are impressed with the
results achieved in increasing the productivity of their properties. They
attribute much of this to the high level of technical assistance provided
and the ready availability of credit for soundly conceived farm development
plans.  Other ranchers are keen to get into the project and the Government
feeis strongly that for the economic development of Paraguay it is vital to
continue the program.
E. The Commercial Production of Vaccines
2.13      Foreign exchange funds (US$360,000) were provided in Credit 86PA
for the importation of machinery for contractors and equipment for a commer-
cial production plant to manufacture vaccines in Paraguay. IDA approval for
the expenditure of US$200,000 equivalent of these funds for a vaccine plant
vas made conditional on the establishment by the Government of a central



- 4-
laboratory to control the quality of commercial vaccines. In a letter dated
April 4, 1966, the Government expressed its intention of setting up such a
laboratory. This has not yet been done and the allocations under IDA 86PA
have not yet been disbursed. Provision has now been made in a loan from the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for its construction (para 2.'14).
F. Foot and Mouth Disease Control Campaign
2.14      The Government, under Law 1267 of September 9, 1967, has established
a national institution, Servicio Nacional de Lucha Contra la Fiebre Aftosa
(SENALFA) for the specific purpose of organizing and executing a four-year
plan for a Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) Vaccination Campaign, including the
construction of the central laboratory referred to in para 2.13. The Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB) has approved a loan of US$2.8 million to help
finance this campaign, and a FtD tax of 50 guaranis per head of cattle sold
is being collected from ranchers. The estimated cost and source of funds for
this project is as follows:

Total               7,600              100
Decree No. 34546 promulgated on July 10, 1968, empowers SENALFA to regulate
and control the importation of FMD vaccines as well as the sale and distri-
bution of such vaccines within the country. Since SENAtFA itself does not
at present intend to produce more than ten per cent of the vaccine required,
it would welcome the support to the commercial productiSyn plant intended by
IDA under Credit 86PA.  This plant could produce the 10 million doses of
vaccine per year which would be required for the campaign during the first
3-4 years, and could increase its output to 19 million doses without major
alteration.

III. THE THIRD PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The Project is the third stage of the program of the Government
6f Paragmay to develoqf the cattle industry. It would extend tbe existing
project through investments over a further four years from 1969t to 19T2.
Investments would be similar to those provided for in the second project,
with more emphasis being given to pasture improvement and to the purchase of
breeding stock. It is expected that about 450 ranchers would participate in
the Project. At least 20% of these have already received sub-loans under
either the first or second Credit for basic improvements and are now expected
to seek further finance to intensify their ranching operations.
B. Detailed Features
3.02      Basic investments vhich have proved to be necessary and effective
under the second stage project would be continue&. These include: fencing,
water supply, cattle handling and disease control facilities, land clearance,
pasture improvement, drainage works, farm housing, the purchase of broeding
stock and technical services. Since requests ar6 still being made by con-
tractors for sub-loans to import heavy machinery for constructing water facili-
ties and for land clearance, an appropriate allocation would also be made for
this purpose in the proposed credit/loan. y
Pasture Improvement
3.03      Under the second project provision was made for the initiation of
a pilot operation in pasture improvement. To supervise this aspect of the
project, the Government of Paraguay, with the approval and assistance of
IDA, engaged a technical expert in tropical pastures with considerable ex-
perience in Australia where conditions are ecologically similar to those
existing in Paraguay. He had also had previous experience in Paraguay with
a local ranching company in early 1965, to whom he made recommendations for
a pasture improvement program. Under the pilot scheme, financed by IDA
86PA, a variety of tropical legumes and grasses, new to Paraguay, have been
imported and these are being tested over a range of soil types and climatic
conditions. Trials are in progress under the direction of the technical
expert on a number of commercial ranches, as vell as on the University of
Asuncion's farm at San Lorenzo. Results to date indicate that this work
is likely to lead to considerable benefits to the livestock industry through
increasing pasture yields and improving feed quality, particularly during
the dry season. Further support is needed, and for this purpose an allowance
has been included in the cost estimates for technical services to provide
U/   See TO-513a, dated February 24, 1966 entitled "Second Livestock Project,
Paraguay" for detailed description of loan features except pasture
improvement and cattle purchases which are elaborated below because of
their increased emphasis.



- 6 -
for an expansion in the research aspects of this operation, such as
fertilizer and grazing management trials. Provision has also been made
in the same category for the training of local technicians in tropical
pasture production through the financing of study tours to other countries
particarly Australia.    Preparations for these studies will be made through
the Technical Director working for this project.
Breeding Stock
3.04      Until recent years ranching in Paraguay has been based, for the
most part, on a primitive open range system under which cattle are grazed
in large mobs over extensive areas of unfenced, unimproved pastures. In-
sufficient watering facilities and an absence of subdivision meant that
pastures were either overgrazed or virtually unused over large parts of the
ranches. To meet this situation the main emphasis in ranch development,
under the first and second stages of the Project, has been on fencing and
water facilities. So far 67% of the total ranch investments planned have
been allocated to these two items. This ranch development policy is re-
sulting in quite spectacular increases in the stock carrying capacity of
affected ranches. Areas of the ranch previously ungrazeable during the
dry season can now be used. With fenced subdivisions adequately supplied
with year-round water for stock, the herd can be divided into smaller mobs,
comparable in age and sex, and fed more in keeping with their needs. For
the first time, on many ranches, controlled mating of the herd can be prac-
tised to enable calving to coincide with an adequate supply of feed. The
breeding herd can be given preferential treatment over the critical calving
and suckling period; the young stock can be similarly managed after weaning,
as can nlso the older steers during the bulk of the grass growing season.
To fully exploit this situation, more stock must be carried to convert more
of the grass to beef and to maximize the returns on investments. This can
be achieved in two ways, by natural increase and by the purchase of addi-
tional breeding stock. With an effective calving rate of 45% 1/ together with
an overall mortality of six per cent, the rate at which herd numbers can be
built up by natural increase in the short term is exceedingly slow, certainly
not more than t=_.gercek per annum. Accordingly, in the cost estimates for
the third Project, the average allocation made for the purchase of breeding
stock has been increased from 16.3% (in the second project) to 26% of the
investments proposed for ranach development. However for an individual ap-
plicant borrower a maximum of 50% of any single loan for ranch development
could be allocated to the purchase of breedir4, stock.
Spray Baths and Dips
3.05      A total of 281 Spray baths a:ad dips have been financed under the
two previous Credits. Though cattle in Paraguay, except for imported exotic
breeds, are normally resistant to the diseases transmitted by ticks, never-
theless heavy infest4tiops of the ticks themselves can cause considerable
irritation and loss of blood, adversely affecting young and debilitated
animals.  For these reasons the financing of spray baths and dips is impor-
tant and further funds have been allocated for this purpose under the pro-
posed credit/loan.

-7-
Farm Buildings
3.06      The erection of 2T9 fam buildings has been financed under "he
second Credit. These are mostly dwellings for farm workers. Experience
has shown that adequate housing makes it easier to obtain fThily labor and
to retain those which prove to be efficient. This represents an important
contribution to increasing production. Funds for this investment item are,
therefore, provided in the proposed credit/loan.
Stock Handling and Disease Control Facilities
3.(7      The fact that 734 corrals hare been financed so far, on 638
ranches, is indicative of the need for this basic stock handling facility.
Even the most elementary managwrent procedures essential for reasonable
efficiency demand that stock be sorted periodically into groups of similar
age and sex. Furthermore, the application of routine procedures, such as
vaccination and the administration of stock remedies, necessary for control-
ling disease, requires the provision of an effective means of animal restraint.
Under the proposed credit/loan, provision has been made for financing the con-
struction of corrals as well as for the purchase of a small number of kerosene
refrigerators and ice boles for storing and handling vaccines subject to.
deterioration under high temperatures. During negotiations assurances vere
obtained that all cattle owned by participating ranchers would be routinely
vaccinated against foot and mouth disease, and that the Governzient would
continue its policy of free importation of officially tested vaccines until
the! supply of such vaccines from within the country was adequate.
Technical Services
3.08      With the completion of the proposed third stage of Paraguay's
livestock development program, it is anticipated that some 1,000 ranchers
will have ben provided with the more basic infrastructures necessary for
a reasonably efficient ranching enterprise. This represents approximately
60% of all ranchers in Paraguay which have farms of 1,000 ha and above. The
stage is rapidly being set therefore for an appreciable upsurge in the produc-
tivity of the country's beef cattle industry. However, for this to be realized
it is essential to strengthen the existing technical services to help ranchers
exploit this potential for increasing production. Proposals for setting up
an organization capable of providing this important service to ranchers are
outlined in paras 4.01 to 4.04. Provision has been made in the project for
financing the cost of this service.

3.10      Estimates for on-ranch development costs are based on an up_dated
analysis of the average cost of inputs financed under the second project. The
basic adsumption is that 150 ranch development plans (120 new plans and 30 plans
for additional investments on ranches already participating in the program)
could be initiELted per year for a total of 450 plans. As the execution of
an individual ranqh developmpnt plan takes about two years, the total in-
vestment period would extend over four years. The distribution of costs
over this period is shown in Annex 3. Technical services estimates are
projected for the four-year development perioed (Annex 4), after which they
are expected to remain constant and would be financed from interest earn-
ings received from participating ranchers.
3.11      Major differences exist between the Chaco and Oriental Zones both
in ranch size and in t;he type of' investments required. Cost estimates are
based onL two model ranches, representative of each of these two regions.



- 9 -
One hundred and eighty ranches would be in the Chaco where the representa-
tive ranch is 10,000 ha, having 1,100 breeding cOWs. The remaining 270
ranches would be in the Oriental where the model used is 4,000 ha carrying
500 breeding cows.
D. ProPosed Fintincing
3.12      The total Project Cost, US$15.5 million equivalent, would be
financed as fblldws:

Ll i.e. 65% of 85%.
3.13      For on-ranch development the owner would on average provide in
cash, labor or materials 15% of the estimated cost, while the Livestock Fund
(para 4.04) would advance the remaining 85% of the cost of ranch development,
through the NDB, as loans to ranchers. The rancher's contribution of 15%
compares with 20 and 25% under the first and second projects, respectively.
Experience however indicates that these percentages were too high during the
herd build-up period. The scarcity and high cost of short-term credit has
resulted, in some cases, in ranchers selling off breeding stock in order to
raise current operating funds. This has been further aggravated by a drop in
cattle prices of about 25% since 1965. (From 023 to 017 per kg livewight.)
Furthermore, the process of herd buildup requires the retention of heifers,
and this represerts a substantial contribution by the rancher in income fore-
gone during the early years of development. Only a limited number of feeder
steers is available in Paraguay so that it is not possible for ranchers gen-
erally to engage in a fattening operation to generate additional income to
meet debt service commitments during the herd buildup period.
3.14      The Livestock Fund would provide US$13.2 million equivalent to-
wards the total Project cost, of which US$8.6 million equivalent, or 65%,
would be proceeds of the proposed IDA/Bank Credit/Loan and us$4.6 million
equivalent, or 35%, would be provided by Government. The Government would
carry the exchange risk. The IDA/Bank Credit/Loan would correspond to the
total foreign exchange costs of US$8.6 million shown in the cost estimates
(para 3.09). This amount comprises the foreign exchange component of the
total Project Cost (US$7.6 million); the interest payable on the Bank loan
(US$320,000) during development; the incremental expenditures for imported
vaccines, drenches and dipping materials (US$100,000) during development;
and the lossi of exports resulting from the retention of heifers for herd

buildup during development, conservatively estimated at US$600,000 on the
basis that only half of these would have been exported and the remainder con-
sumed domestically.
3.15      The Government contribution to the proposed Project would be fi-
nanced in part from collections from the Ex-Bank of Paraguay, amounting to
US$0.38 million equivalent, and for the balance from funds generated by the
existing two stages and the proposed third stage of the Livestock Development
Project. Annex 5 shows the cash flow covering the three stages of the Project
over the period 1964 through 1990. During the four years 1969-1972, the con-
struction period of the Third Project, expenditures would total US$15.7 mil-
lion equivalent, consisting of: (a) US$1.2 million equivalent remaining ex-
penditures on the second stage; (b) US$13.5 million equivalent expenditures
on the third stage (including US$0.3 million equivalent for interest payable
during development); and (c) US$1.0 million equivalent cash surplus nec-
essary to carry on lending activities over and above the present Project.
These expenditures would be financed as follows:

Net cash generation amounting to 37.7% of requirements is the balance after
allowing for compensation to NDB and the Central Bank (which includes part
of the Livestock Fund's operating expenses) for their services to the Project
and for debt service to IDA for Credits PA47/36 amounting to 039.1 million
(US$310,000). During negotiations assurances were obtained that the Govern-
ment would provide promptly as necessary the local currency funds required
for the Project.
3.16      Under the first and second Credits, NDB receive a fee of 2% on the
principal Of sub-loans wvich was conventionally agreed to meet the cost of
local technical services and administrative expenses. Sinee the third Proj-



- 11 -
ect would not; require substantial additional technical and banking services,
it, was agreed during negotiations, that NDB's fee would be reduced to 1% on
the third Credit/Loan (Annex 6).
E. Disbursements and Auditing
3.17      The IDA/Bank vould disburse an equivalent of 65% of the payments
made under sub-loans for on-ranch development and to finance the cif cost of
imported machinery for loans to contractors, on the basis of a certification
(statement of expenditures) to that effect by the Livestock Fund. For the
foreign exchange component of the technical services, disbursements vould be
supported by full documentation. In all instances the above documents would
need to be countersigned by the Technical Director. The Livestock Fund and
NDB would maintain separate accounts for the Project. These accounts vould
be audited annually by accountants, acceptable to IDA/Bank. Currently NDB
is being audited annually by an independent firm and the Livestock Fund would
be audited by Government auditors. Assurances coricerning these requirements
were obtained during negotiations.
F. Operating Results
3.18      The projected financial implications for the Livestock Fund and NDB
resulting frcm all three projects are set forth in Annexes 5 and 6. The
portion of collection from ranchers over and above what is necessary to
cover the Central Bank's (including the Livestock Fund's) and NDB's admin-
isitrative and technical services expenses, as well as the amounts needed by
the Government for debt servicing of the two IDA Credits and the proposed
IDA/Bank Credit/Loan would be relent to ranchers for the same purposes on
similar terms and conditions during a thirty-year period from the date of
the propoqed IDA/Bank Credit/Loan. The terms and conditions (para 4.05) under
which sub-loans would be made to ranchers from the proposed IDA/Bank Credit/
Loan would enable Government to repay this loan within the thirty-year period,
as well as providing for administrative expenses. The annual operating profit
obtained from all three livestock projects would accrue to the Livestock Fund.
As shovn in Annex 5 substantial resources would be available to the Livestock
Fumd for relending throughout the life of the loan. The deficit in the first
two years would be met by Government from budgetary resources.

IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Administration and Technical Services
4.01      The administrative arrangements for the first and second stages
of the project are described in para 2.07. Under these arrangements the
Central Bank has carried the risk of losses on sub-loans to ranchers and
has provided the funds for such sub-loans to NDB. The NDB has employed
local technical and administrative staff, to assess creditworthiness of
applicant-borrowers, prepare ranch development plans, supervise expenditure
of sub-loans approved by the Coordinating Committee, and collect and record
repayments. Such arrangements however have not always operated satisfactorily.
The Technical Director has found it necessary to assume the major burden for
the administration of the project and has in practice been the Project Director.
Furthermore, under this arrangement the Technical Director has been located
in the Central Bank, whereas the local technicians have been employed by, and
located in the NDB. This has made it difficult for the Technical Director to
provide adequate technical assistance to participating ranchers so as to maxi-
mize the benefits of inputs financed under the projects.
4.02      To avoid continuation of the present shortcomings the NDB would,
as a condition of effectiveness, establish a Livestock Projects Division (LPD)
within its Development Department, to be responsible for the technical aspects
of the Project. The LPD would be under the direction of the Technical Director
who would be seconded by the Livestock Fund to the NDB and would be staffed
by a minimum of ten field technicians and such other full-time administrative
and temporary technical advisory personnel as may be required. During nego-
tiations assurances were obt.ained that the Livestock Fund would employ a
Technical Director acceptable to the IDA/Bank for a period and on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the IDA/Bank, and cecond him to NDB.
4.03      Under the supervision of the Technical Director, the LPD staff would
be employed exclusively and on a full-time basis to assist ranchers in preparing
development plans to appraise the technical, economic and financial feasi-
bility of the plans, and to supervise their implementation. The Technical
Directo:r would report directly to the President of NDB, through the Director
of the Development Department, and would be given the authority to assist in
the training of the technicians and outline their duties and responsibilities
as well as to recommend the selection, promotion, demotion, suspension or re-
moval of LPD staff. He would be ultimately responsible for guiding the Proj-
ect and for approving and recommending ranch development plans to the Coor-
dinating Committee as the basis for lending to ranchers.
4.04      To strengthen the existing organization for Project management and
to provide continuity to the livestock program beyond tbe period of the
IDA/Bank assistance, a Livestock Fund would be established by the Government
to hold and manage all funds made available for and accruing from the three
livestock projects. The Livestock Fund would be managec. by the Coordinating
Committee ;,omposed of a senior officer of the Central Biink who would be
Chairman, a senior officer of the NDB, and the Technical Director. The two
former members of the Coordinating Committee would be appointed in consult-
ation with the IDA/Bank. T4e Coordinating Committee would approve loan re-
quests recommended by the Technical Director. It would only disapprove loan



- 13 -
applications on the basis of the prospective borrower's creditworthiness.
During negotiations asssurances were obtained that as a condition of effective-
ness the Operating Agreement between the Government, the Central Bank, and
NDB would be amended to take account of the creation of the Livestock Fund and
of the changes in Project administration and management, in agreement with the
IDA/Bank.
B. Lend:lg Operations
4.05      The proposed Credit/Loan would be made to the Government. The term
of the IDA Credit would be for 50 years free of interest and the term of the
Loan would be thirty years, including a ten year's grace period at the Bankts
interest rate existing at the time of approval. The Livestock Fund would
administer the Credit/Loan funds.  It would make available through NDB 85% of
the estimated cost of approved ranch development plans as sub-loans to parti-
cipating ranchers at an interest rate of nine per cent for a term of twelve
years, including four years of grace.  Individual ranch development loans
greater than US$100,000 equivalent would require prior approval by the Bank.
Loans to contractors for the cost of imported machinery would be for a shorter
term of three to five years at nine per cent interest.  NDB would finLance the
actual local currency cost of technical services and Project administration
from the compensation received from the Livestock Fund.  During negotiations
assurances were obtained that as a condition of effectiveness the Operating
Agreement refferred to in para 4.04 would be amended accordingly.
C. Procurement
4.o6      Goods and services required for ranch development would be
purchased by the individual rancher through normal commercial channels.
This follows the procedure used in the previous two projects which has been
seLtisfactory.  Sufficient competition exists among more than a dozen firms
sutpplying the goods required, which also have adequate repair facilities,
for machinery financed under the Project.
4.07      Procurement of both imported and local breeding stock (para 3.04)
would be subject to the approval of the Technical Director with respect to
quality, source and animal health standards. International competitive
bidding would not be appropriate for livestock procurement since animals
adapted to the environment of the type and quality required, can best be
obtained from Argentina and Brazil, countries adjacent to the Project area.

V. PRICES, MARKETS AND RANCHERS' BENEFITS
A. Prices
4.08      Producers are free to sell cattle to any buyer.  In an attempt
to stabilize prices the Government established Corporacion Paraguaya de
Carnes (COPACAR) which operates in the Asuncion area and offers minimum prices
for slaughter cattle. Prices actually paid to the producer by COPACAR have
risen from 015 in 1963 to 025 in 1966 per kg liveweight for steers weighing
400-420 kg. By 1968 prices had fallen to 022. Prices paid to producers by
the meat export companies over the same period have averaged about 02-43 below
these levels, and dropped to 018 per kg liveweight in 1968. 1/ These lower
prices paid by the export companies reflect, in part, the taxes they pay
(para 4.09). The high prices received in 1965/66 vere due mainly to an abnormal
rise in the price of meat extract. Returns from this product have since fallen,
as vell as those from hides. A price to the producers of 017 per kg liveweight
has been used in the financial projections for this weight category.
4.09      Government levies taxes on producers for all cattle sold.  These
are subject to change but at present (1968) amount to 0300 per animal. In
addition, butchers slaughtering cattle for the domestic market are levied
0365 per head, while the companies processing meat for export pay 0715
per head of cattle slaughtered. This tax differential favors the domestic
market and provides a disincentive for exports. During negotiations assur-
ances were obtained that the Government will review its tax structure with
a viev to improving the balance of taxes levied on cattle so as not to dis-
criminate against exports, and exchange views with the Bank no later than
six mon;hs after effectiveness of the loan on proposed legislative reform;
to this effect as well as a timetable for implementation thereof.
4.10      Per capita consumption of beef in Paraguay, 50 kg per annum, is
the third largest in South America. 2   To ensure adequate supplies at
reasonable prices on the domestic market, the Government for over twenty
years has used a quota device to limit the slaughter of cattle for export
to a six-month slaughter season each year. However in recent years the quota
set has been above the actual number of cattle slaughtered for export. The
availability of cettle therefore has determined the level of beef exports
rather than the quota set by the Government. This seasonal restriction will
increasingly lose its significance with the introduction of tropical legumes
that will tend to prolong the grazing period find thereby the fattening season
for slaughter animals. Under the IDA Credit ,36PA the Government reaffirmed
its intention to continue a liberal cattle ana beef marketing policy. An
assurance that this policy would be continued under the third Project was
obtained during negotiations.
1/   Owing to the relatively small numbers of cattle purchased by COPACAR
(about 40,000 per year) coupled with the considerable delays in settling
accounts with producers, the export companies are able to purchase
cattle at these lower prices.
2/   Argentina 80 kg. Uruguay 70 kg.



- 15 -
B. Markets
4.1].     In recent years the estimated number ot cattle slaughtered
anntally has ranged from around 569,000 in 1963 to about 687,000 in 1967.
(See Annex 11). Domestic demand has remained reasonably stable and the
operation of the quota control has been such that most of any increases in
prodluction have been available for export.
4.12      Cattle destined for the domestic market are handled and processed
either by small independent operators or by the Government established
COPACAR. Three relatively large meat packing plants slaughter cattle and
process the meat for export. These plants have adequate capacity to handle
any anticipated increase resulting from the Project.
4.1:3     Owing to it.s geographical situation, type of cattle and the
presence of foot and mouth disease, Paraguay is likely to continue export-
ing beef surplus to domestic requirements mostly as tinned meat products,
principally corned beef. However, as greater numbers of younger, better
fin:Lshed, higher quality cattle flow from project ranches, under improved
animal health control facilities, it is expected that the better quality
cuts might be marketed in the fresh and/or frozen form. Outlets for such
products already exist, e.g. in Chile and Peru, at favorable prices and
demiand is high. The meat packing plants are equipped to handle these prod-
ucts, and other firms in Paraguay are investigating such market outlet pos-
sibilities.
C. RANCHERS' BENEFITS
5.01      The benefits to participating ranchers from investments made under
the Project are projected in Annex 8, Tables 1 through 8. The estimates are
based on two representative ranches, one of 10,000 ha carrying 1,100 breed-
ing cows in the Chaco and the other of 4,000 ha with 500 breeding cows in
the Oriental (para 3.11). Expected results per ranch at various stages of
development are summarized below:

- 16 -
5.02      As these projections show, the increase in net profit per ranch
after twelve years would be substantial, more than 500%. The rancher would
also increase the capital value of his herd by more than 100% by this time.
Assuming that major investments such as fences, water facilities, corrals
and other constructions would have an effective life of about thirty years,
the average financial rate of return to the rancher would be 24-30% (An-
nex 8, Tables 7 and 8).



- 17 -
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The increase in annual production derived from the completed third
stage of the Project (after fifteen years) would amount to about 44,000
metric tons of beef over the present .evel of around 120,000 tons. Evaluated
at domestic prices to the producer (017 per kg liveveight) the gross value of
incremental production would then total US$11.9 million per year. As most
of this production would be exported, the Project's contribution to the
country's foreign exchange earnings would be substantial. After allowing
for the increased administrative costs, the internal rate of return to the
economy from this third stage of the Project would be about 29% (Annex 9).
Both the financial and economic rate of return projecticons are more favorable
than those under the previous IDA Credits due to the accelerated herd buildup
prorided for in the proposed credit/loan (para 3.04).
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.61      The Project, is the third stage of a livestock development program
already successfully underway. There is a continuing demand for investment
fund.s and satisfactory returns would result for participating ranchers. A
substantial benefit would accrue to the national economy.
7.02      The project would be suitable for an IDA Credit and a Bank loan
each equivalent to US$4.3 million. The borrower would be the Government of
Paraguay, and the Livestock Fund vould act as its agent for administration
of the funds. The Credit/Loan would be equivalent to about 56% of the total
Project cost. The foreign exchange cost would be about US$8.6 million.
7.03      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
a)   The Government would:
(i) eonsure that all livestock on ranches participating
in the Project would be routinely vaccinated against
foot-and-mouth disease (para 3.07);
(ii) continue its policy of free importation of an
adequate quantity of officially tested vaccines
umtil such time as the commercial plant is operating
effectively (para 3.07);
