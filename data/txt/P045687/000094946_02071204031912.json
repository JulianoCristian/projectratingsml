As\n            well, the value lies in the up-to-date health sector work,\n            as the analytical foundation for this combined adjustment,\n            and technical assistance operation, which as it happened,\n            coincided with the country's fiscal crisis, thus\n            providing the opportunity for financial adjustment. During\n            this particular crisis, and political turmoil, the fact that\n            intense supervision was provided, helped focus on political\n            developments, and adapt the project design to changing\n            circumstances. However, the reform process needs strong\n            support from high levels of civil society, which implies\n            deep cultural changes, and a meaningful consultation among\n            the government, the implementing agency, and in particular,\n            civil society and stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2002-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
