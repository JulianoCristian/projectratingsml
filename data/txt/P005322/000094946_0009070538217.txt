3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The original objectives of the project, as stated in the Memorandum of the President, were to improve the
efficiency of telecommunications services in Jordan by: (a) developing a market-oriented sector policy and
a transparent regulatory framework; (b) commercializing and subsequently privatizing the Jordan
Telecommunications Corporation (JTC); (c) encouraging private investment in the sector; and (d)
enhancing service quality, expanding network capacity and increasing coverage.



The project objectives were consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) at the time which
emphasized financial restructuring, cost recovery, commercialization and privatization of public enterprises
to improve resource allocation and reduce burdens on the budget. The project was also consistent with the
Bank's telecommunications sector strategy of the time which called for shifting the role of governments
from ownership and management to policy-making and regulation, promoting efficiency and quality
through commercialization of operational activities and competitive provision of services, and using new
financial instruments (such as guarantees).
The project objectives supported the Government of Jordan's strategy for the telecommunications sector.
As outlined in their Letter of Sector Policy (May 2, 1994), the strategy called for: (a) preparing and
promulgating a new Telecommunications Law; (b) commercializing, corporatizing and privatizing the
operations of JTC; and (c) promoting competition and private provision of services.
Although these project objectives were ambitious, given the Government's commitment and the
incorporation of technical assistance (TA) in the project design to assist with sector restructuring and to
assist the project management unit in JTC, the Bank had strong reasons to believe the project's goals were
attainable, which proved to be true by project closing.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The project objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
Sector Restructuring Component
This component was designed to help the Government formulate and implement reforms that would lead to
further development of the sector and facilitate opening up new possibilities for the private sector.
Restructuring was to be implemented in two phases. The first phase, which was completed as a part of the
project preparation, involved providing technical assistance to help the Government and JTC prepare
proposals for a new sector policy and a draft Telecommunications Law. As a result of this work, the
Government developed a new sector restructuring strategy to be implemented under the project on the basis
of a time-bound action plan during the second phase. The program consisted of five distinct but
interdependent activities: (i) legal changes to provide a robust legal foundation for the sector in line with the
new sector policy; (ii) a Sector Policy Division to be established at MOPC; (iii) an independent Regulatory
Office to be established and staffed with trained professionals; (iv) commercial management and
organizational development of JTC; and (vi) a strategy and an action plan for the privatization of JTC.
Although the outcome of the sector restructuring component was highly satisfactory, the preliminary
timetable for the implementation of these reforms may have been overly ambitious. The initial delays in
appointing sector restructuring consultants (financed under a grant from the Overseas Development Agency
- ODA) and in the approval of the new Telecommunications Law by Parliament, had not been anticipated
and consequently set back the timing of the reform process. The component, however, was largely
completed by the time of project closing with the sale of a 40% stake in JTC to the private sector in early
2000.
Physical Component
The physical component was to comprise the following: (a) 225,172 additional lines of switching
equipment; these lines included the establishment of 20 new main exchanges, 80 new remote subscriber
units, the expansion of one existing main exchange and 24 remote sites; (b) microwave and optical fiber
junctions to provide links between remote subscriber units and corresponding main exchanges; (c)
-2-



associated local networks for the connection of subscribers; (d) power and air conditioning equipment; (e)
buildings; (f) specific initial training for operation and maintenance of switching and transmission
equipment; (g) formation of an initial spare parts stock; (h) consultant services for assistance in project
management and supervision of implementation; and (i) computerized customer service, billing, collection
and operational support systems.
The physical component was well designed, yet very large and complex, requiring strong project
management to avoid delays in procurement. To ensure that JTC would have adequate capacity to manage
this component, consultants (funded by BITS of Sweden) were hired to assist JTC with project
management, procurement, monitoring and reporting. An implementation plan was prepared outlining the
interdependencies of the tasks to be carried out under this component, including a time schedule for
implementation. Despite these measures, the physical component did experience procurement and
disbursement delays, mainly due to the Borrower's initial lack of experience with bid preparation and
evaluation. However, by the closing date the project had exceeded almost all of the physical targets.
3.4 Revised Components:
Procurement of the computerized customer care system using Bank funds was replaced by procurement of
additional optical fiber, copper cables and cable accessories, following a formal reallocation of
disbursement categories in March 1999. This reallocation, however, did not result in a project
restructuring. It was determined that procurement of the customer care system could not be completed by
the closing date of the loan and that it would be better to wait until the strategic partner was on board to
finalize the design and selection of the system. The system is now being financed through JTC's own
resources.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The project was not reviewed by QAG. However, at the time of this ICR, the Quality at Entry is
considered to have been satisfactory. As mentioned above, the project was designed in line with both the
Bank's and the Government's priorities for the sector. Throughout project preparation, the Government
showed strong commitment to the sector restructuning program and ensured the support of other groups
(Council of Ministers, Steering Committee, private sector, Association of Engineers and JTC managers) by
holding interactive workshops to debate issues and develop the sector policy.
Additionally, several measures were taken to ensure that the project would be ready for implementation
upon effectiveness. Prior to negotiations, all bidding documents were prepared and issued, a detailed
project implementation plan was developed and a comprehensive project management organization had
been established.
It should be noted that there was a one year delay between the project Board date and project effectiveness.
This was mainly due to difficulties in meeting the conditions for effectiveness. The submission of the draft
Telecommunications Law to Parliament was delayed, as was the issuance of the new by-laws granting JTC
autonomy. The Bank also experienced some glitches in securing firm commitments from cofinanciers and
in finalizing, with JTC, the bond issue. These unforeseen delays, however, did not greatly affect the overall
implementation schedule of the project, as project procurement (preparation of bidding documents, bid
evaluation and award, selection of consultants, etc.) was still able to move forward without the project
being effective. In retrospect, it may have been better to make the effectiveness conditions less stringent, or
to have put them up front, as conditions of board or negotiations.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project was highly successful in achieving its overall objective of improving the efficiency of
telecommunications services in Jordan. Telephone service coverage was expanded to 25 new primary areas
and 356 new villages. Teledensity (main lines per 100 inhabitants) increased from 7.7 in 1994 to an
estimated 17.1 in 2000. Installed switching capacity increased from 320,000 in 1994 to 840,000 in 1999,
and the number of users and connections almost doubled from 287,000 subscriber lines in 1993 to 565,000
subscriber lines in 1999. A broader range of services is now available to customers on a competitive basis,
including internet, paging, cellular and payphones. The cellular market is growing rapidly. Fastlink,
currently the country's sole cellular provider, has increased its subscriber base from 11,500 in 1995 to
more than 150,000 by April 2000, and it is expected that the number of subscribers will double when JTC's
Mobilecom begins operating at the end of 2000. The project achieved or surpassed many of the original
performance indicators (Annex 1) outlined in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR).
The project also achieved its goal to commercialize and eventually privatize JTC. After an unsuccessful
attempt at privatization in March 1998, the Government re-launched the bidding process in April 1999
which successfully resulted in the receipt of three competitive bids from reputable operators. On January
23, 2000 the privatization transaction was completed, and 40% of the Company's shares, with management
control, were sold to the Joint Investment Telecommunications Company (88% of which is owned by
France Telecom and 12% is owned by the Arab Bank).
The project was also successful in terms of its policy objectives. The Government's telecommunications
sector policy, as agreed and discussed with the Bank during project preparation, was issued in early 1995.
The Telecommunications Law was ratified by the Jordanian Parliament in September 1995 and became
effective on October 1, 1995. In November 1995, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC)
was established as an independent statutory agency for regulating and monitoring the telecommunications
sector.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Sector Restructuring Component The outputs of this component are rated as satisfactory. As depicted
below, there were major changes to the sector during the life of the project:

All of the reform measures initiated under the project were advanced: (a) the new Telecommunications
Law, which allowed for the corporatization of JTC and the establishment of a regulatory authority, was
approved by Parliament in September 1995; (b) the Telecommunications Policy Department (TPD) was
established within the MOPC to provide forward-looking, long range policy advice to the Government; (c)
the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) was established and staff were hired and trained.
During the life of the project, TRC built its credibility by issuing more than 16 licenses, covering the
various market segments, in a transparent manner; (d) the Government's sector policy, promoting
competition and private provision of services, was issued in early 1995; and (e) the privatization of JTC
was successfully completed in January, 2000.
Physical Component. The outputs of this component are highly satisfactory as the project achieved the
following physical results, generally exceeding the original estimates:
Switching - new digital switching equipment was installed for 22 primary centers and 81 remote switches,
increasing the switching capacity to 840,000 lines (exceeding the SAR estimate of 640,000).
Transmission - PDH equipment was installed at 128 sites, SDH equipment at 49 sites, and microwave
equipment and towers at 26 sites.
Local Line Plant - approximately 80% of the contracted work on the local line plant had been completed at
project closing. The work thus far has allowed 40 manual service sites to be converted to automatic service
and the transfer of more than 100,000 customers from the old network to the new one.
Buildings - 128 new buildings were constructed, 26 of which are main-exchange buildings for combined
technical and administrative use; four of the existing primary center buildings were enlarged.
Customer Service Improvement Plan - procurement of the computerized customer care service system was
halted as JTC was experiencing delays and complications with bid evaluations and it was decided that it
would be better to wait until the new strategic partner was on board to make decisions regarding the design
of such system. Funds for the system were then used to purchase additional optical fibre cables, copper
cables and accessories.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The economy-wide benefits from the project are substantial. The project increased the level of private
participation in the sector through the successful privatization of JTC and by establishing a regulator which
helped to build investor confidence. The proceeds from the sale of JTC, (US$508 million) brought an
amount equivalent to 159% of the average annual inward direct investment flow for the period of 1997-99.
Even beyond JTC, foreign interest in the Jordanian telecommunications sector has included the sale of a
51% stake in two local ISPs to the Bahrain Telecommunications Company and the sale of a 20% stake in
Maktoob.com, the leading Arabic language communications server to Egypt's EFG-Hermes. Jordan's IT
conference in March 2000, attracted over 100 international and 50 local companies, including Microsoft
which expressed interest in working with the GOJ in developing a computerized network connecting
government departments.
New employment opportunities were generated through the development of new services and the addition of
new service providers in the various market segments (cellular, paging, etc). JTC's cellular subsidiary,
Mobilecom, will create 350 jobs alone in its first year. Businesses, which increasingly rely on
telecommunications and internet services to enhance productivity, greatly benefited from JTC's improved
efficiency, service quality and expanded network capacity. Improved telecommunications services will
allow for business to have better access to international markets, creating new export opportunities and
reducing purchasing costs.
A significant share of the project's economic benefits were realized by rural and low-income communities.
By project closing, JTC had expanded their geographical coverage to include 356 new villages. In rural
areas manual service was replaced by remote digital line units and, as a result of exchange modernization,
new value-added services were introduced for the first time to rural customers. Through tariff reduction,
telecommunications services became more affordable for all consumers. Competition in the mobile sector
has already resulted in an average 30% reduction in cellular tariffs.
Resource mobilization was one of the main economic benefits of the project. The US$50 million Eurobond
issue helped to mobilize private sector finances from the local and international markets that would have
been otherwise placed in bank accounts or invested abroad. The bond issue also helped to improve the
overall image of the Jordanian economy, as reflected in the recent upgrade of the country risk rating from
"C" to "B" by the Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service Report, June 2000.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
JTC's financial performance during the project period (1994-1999) was strong enough to generate
sufficient funds from operations to cover 35% of total project costs, close to the 37% projected at
appraisal, and to comfortably meet all financial covenants. However, JTC suffered pressure on revenues
and profitability due to a combination of factors including a tariff rebalancing plan initiated in 1997 as part
of the project, declining international revenues and a sluggish local economy. Despite strong growth in the
physical telephone network with the number of subscribers increasing by 100 % to 565,000 between 1994
and 1999 and telephone traffic (minutes billed) doubling as well (with the largest gains in local and
outgoing international traffic), total revenues only grew by 29%. Domestic revenues nearly doubled as the
cross subsidy from high international charges was reduced through tariff rebalancing, but international
revenue grew by only 1% per annum and incoming international revenue declined by 11% per annum due
to declining international settlement rates. Total revenues grew by just 5% per annum, while operating
expenses increased 13.5% per annum, causing JTC's gross and net operating ratios to decline. As a result
of these trends, average annual revenue per subscriber declined from JD546 in 1994 to JD 342 in 1999, a
decline of 37%. Further negative comparisons can be expected until the five-year tariff rebalancing
-6 -



program runs its course in 2001, unless JTC is able to increase revenues through more rapid growth in
cellular traffic, data and value added services.
The company's financial position - though still strong - exhibited a gradual weakening during the period (as
shown in the following summary table). Accounts receivable have been a continuing problem for JTC,
growing faster than revenues until 1999, and provisions for uncollectible accounts have remained high at
about two-thirds of receivables. It is expected that the investment of a major private shareholder and the
eventual purchase of a sophisticated customer care/billing system will have a positive effect on tighter
commercial practices at the JTC and an improved financial position.
The documents showing the calculation of the FRR and ERR at appraisal could not be lQcated for
preparation of the ICR so the financial and economic rates of return on the project have been calculated on
the basis of the incremental cash flows from the new investment financed by the project, over a 20-year
period 1993-2013. The FRR is calculated at 20 percent, slightly less than the 22 percent calculated at
appraisal, although the two calculations may not be on a comparable basis. This calculation assumes a
further three percent per annum decline in the net weighted average tariff in 2000 and 2001 as part of the
ongoing five-year tariff rebalancing plan. The economic rate of return has been calculated on the basis of
the incremental cash flows after deducting the taxes and other fees and transfers paid by the company and
on the assumption that income tax will be payable at the current rate of 30 percent of taxable income for
the period 2000-2013. On this basis the ERR is calculated at 28 percent compared with 24 percent at
appraisal, although again the two calculations may not be on a comparable basis.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional development impact of the project was substantial:
Government of Jordan / Ministry of Communications developed the capacity to design and implement the
sector restructuring program. The role of the Ministry with respect to policy making was expanded with
the creation of a Telecommunications Policy Department to advise on the introduction of new services and
to promote and support the development of the telecommunications policy. The Government, with the
assistance of the Bank, was able to successfully implement a large program which included legal, sector
policy and regulation activities as well the strategy and action plan for the privatization of JTC.
JTC staff were charged with designing and implementing the ambitious National Telecommunications Plan
(NTP) and managing the program's financial plan which amounted to approximately US$250 million.
Throughout the life of the project, JTC improved its capacity for financial management, as demonstrated in
the financial performance ratios, which generally exceeded those stipulated in the financial covenants of the
Loan Agreement. JTC also improved its capacity to carry out the procurement of goods under international
competitive bidding procedures. Although initially weak in this area, by project closing, JTC had
effectively reduced project costs through successful international competitive bidding and contract
negotiation procedures.
TRC's institutional capacity to regulate the sector was developed under the project through training of staff,
and TA provided by ODA-funded international consultants. Since its establishment, TRC has issued more
than 16 licenses, including JTC's license, in a credible and transparent manner. Although, not originally
envisaged under the project, it is now apparent that TRC could use further TA (study tours, workshops)
and financing for the set-up of a proper frequency management system, in order to strengthen its authority
as a regulator. The Bank is discussing with the GOJ possible future assistance to TRC in this capacity.
The institutional capacity developed under the project is most clearly demonstrated, however, in the ability
of all three parties (Government, JTC and TRC) to learn from the mistakes of the initial unsuccessful
attempt to privatize JTC, revitalize the bidding process a second time, and successfully complete the
privatization transaction.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
None
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Government's strong commitment to sector reform greatly contributed to the overall success of the
project. However, there are two instances in which factors subject to Government control may have
actually impeded reform progress:
(a) Sector Policy - after issuing its Letter of Sector Policy (LSP) in 1995, the Government proceeded to
change its sector policy several times, creating uncertainty for potential investors in the sector. The
original LSP indicated that competition in PSTN services would commence at the time of JTC
privatization. In December 1996, however, the Council of Ministers (COM) issued a decree delaying
introduction of competition in PSTN until 2002. Regarding the cellular segment, the COM issued a
decree in November 1995 permitting the issuing of a second cellular license. However, just prior to
JTC's privatization, the second license was granted to JTC (rather than through a competitive bidding
procedure) and the Government announced it would award a third license in 2001. Although this
decision may have helped to maximize the sale price of JTC, it also may have adversely impacted the
- 8 -



level of competition in GSM service in the sector in the long run. A more consistent sector policy may
have helped to avoid delays in the reform and to increase private investment in the sector.
(b) Privatization progress - the initial attempt at JTC privatization was not successful for a number of
reasons, some of which were subject to the Government's control : (i) the GOJ was not able to reach a
political consensus among key stakeholders on the privatization strategy; (ii) the absence of a
ministerial "champion" for the privatization, which may have been interpreted by potential buyers as a
lack of commitment on the part of the GOJ; (iii) the GOJ did not undertake a comprehensive
transactional and value analysis of other privatization transactions around the world, which could have
been used as a basis for setting realistic expectations; and (iv) the inability of the Government to
reconcile the issue of sovereignty and the perceived erosion of its patrimony of a key national public
asset, against the urgent need to obtain management expertise and financial resources for that asset.
Nevertheless, the Government was able to reconstruct its privatization strategy and re-launch the tender
for a strategic investor utilizing a revised information memorandum in May 1999. Following this
second round of bidding, the privatization transaction was completed successfully in January 2000,
after receiving three competitive proposals from reputable operators.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The Project Management Office (PMO) in JTC carried the bulk of the responsibility for implementing the
National Telecommunications Program (NTP), the physical component of the project. The PMO was well
staffed with a project manager, procurement specialists and financial management specialists. The PMO
benefited during project preparation and implementation from the international expertise of consultants
from Telia Swedtel (financed by Swedish BITS and JTC).
Procurement management was the main factor largely subject to the control of the PMO that caused some
initial delays in project implementation. In particular, procurement of the computerized customer care
system was not well managed. Working with a consulting firm (Booz-Allen & Hamilton), JTC spent many
months preparing the bidding documents for the system, yet in the end no bidder could adequately meet the
technical specifications. Bid evaluation, also took several months and was not carried out properly,
according to the evaluation criteria specified in the bidding documents. The Bank, therefore, did not give its
clearance to the bid evaluation report, and given the closing date of the project, it was agreed that the
purchase of the system could not be completed on time. The funds allocated to the system were reallocated
for the purchase of additional fiber optic and copper cables and accessories.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The project's original financing plan, revised loan amounts and total disbursement at project closing
(January 31, 2000) are shown in the table below:

Prior to effectiveness, the original financing plan was reduced by US$8.8 million (the JBIC loan was
reduced to US$16 million and the BITS financing was reduced to US$2.2 million) to reflect cost savings on
tenders for equipment and technical assistance. A second loan from EIB became effective in March 1996
to help finance additional works on the Local Line Plant, thus increasing EIB's total contribution to US$57
million. The revised overall financing for the project totaled approximately US$241 million.
For the first time in the telecommunications sector, the project financing included US$50 million funded
through a Eurobond issue supported by an ECO Guarantee. The purpose of the Guarantee was to provide
JTC with a vehicle for private sector involvement in its investment program in the form of private sector
debt and subsequent equity participation. The Guarantee was specifically intended to: (i) help mobilize
Jordanian foreign currency deposits held offshore and direct them back into the country for the purpose of
productive investment in a priority sector; (ii) facilitate Jordan's re-access to the financial markets,
following the Brady debt restructuring, thereby assisting the country to diversify its borrowing sources; (iii)
establish a track record for JTC in the market by exposing the company to the rigors of market discipline,
thus facilitating the commercialization and privatization process; and (iv) provide impetus to the domestic
capital market, as well as help to open up a foreign institutional investor base for the country.
The use of the ECO Guarantee proved to be very successful, not only in terms of catalyzing private sector
investment for the telecommunications program, but also in facilitating Jordan's access to the Eurobond
market. As it was the first bond operation for Jordan, which did not have a credit rating at the time, it also
helped to establish a track record for the country in international capital markets. Through the ECO bond
operation, JTC became the first Middle Eastern corporation to tap the Eurobond market. Exposing the
company to the commercial discipline of the capital markets helped commercialize JTC's corporate culture
in preparation for privatization. In addition, the bond issue involved the participation of local banks and
facilitated the mobilization of domestic foreign exchange deposits for investment in the company. Following
the very successful reception of the JTC bond, Jordan was able to re-access the Eurobond market for
subsequent bond operations without the Bank's support.
Throughout the project there were disbursement lags, mainly due to the initial delay in effectiveness and
procurement delays and inefficiencies (in some cases bid evaluation took 4 to 6 months). The closing dates
of the Bank loan and the JBIC loan were extended by 4 and 6 months, respectively in order that JTC might
use balances that remained undisbursed due to delayed procurement. By project closing, however,
substantial savings had been achieved. In particular the final contracts under the Bank loan for the
procurement of copper cable & accessories and optical fibre cable and accessories, originally estimated to
cost US$5.7 million, amounted to only US$1.4 million, partly due to successful use of ICB procedures by
the Borrower. The remaining undisbursed balance of US$4.6 million under the Bank loan has been
canceled.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The sustainability of the project's achievements are highly likely. The sector reform achieved under the
project has already allowed for and will continue to increase private participation in the sector. The
newly-privatized JTC is planning for further expansion and improvement of the network to prepare for
competition, following the end of their exclusivity period. The Government intends to continue to promote
competition in the sector through the award of a third GSM license in 2001, and two licenses for
international operators in 2004. JTC's tariff rebalancing plan has been underway since 1997, and it is
expected that the entrance of new operators in the sector will result in further tariff rebalancing as
determined by the market.
- 10 -



All of the above should continue the progress made under the project to improve the efficiency and
accessibility of telecommunications services in Jordan.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The Government has expressed a need for continued Bank assistance in the sector, particularly in the
following areas:
*   TRC - further support to strengthen the regulatory framework created under the project and improve
the independent functioning of the regulator. TRC staff require additional training and a proper
spectrum management system, including equipment, is yet to be put in place.
*   Postal Services - support for the Ministry's recently launched Postal Sector Restructuring Project,
which aims at expanding the coverage and improving the quality of Jordan's postal services. This
project also includes a plan for privatization of the postal operator.
* Informnation Technology - assistance to the GOJ in the implementation of its recently developed
National IT Strategy (REACH Initiative), and possible support for an "administration on line" initiative
to improve the efficiency of public administrative systems through the use of IT.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Bank performance at identification, preparation and appraisal of the project was satisfactory. The project
team built on the relationship developed between the Bank and GOJ during the preparation of the First
Telecommunications Project (loan 2953-JO), a project which was approved by the Board but canceled
shortly after by the Government due to changes in the macro-economic conditions in Jordan which led to
cancellation of the investment program for the telecommunications sector and related financing. During the
12 months of preparation, from the initial identification mission to Board approval, the Bank maintained a
close dialogue with the GOJ to ensure that the project objectives were directly in line with the Government's
goals for the sector.
The staff mix and continuity during preparation and appraisal were highly satisfactory. Financial analysts
and telecommunications engineers provided the core expertise, while IT and Private Sector Development
specialists also provided valuable input in missions and as peer reviewers. Several of the preparation
missions included the participation of a Financial Officer from the Project Finance and Guarantees
Department to deal with issues relating to the World Bank Guarantee. The loan amount and project
execution period was well estimated at the time, although the one year delay in effectiveness was not
anticipated and the project closing date was extended by four months to give the Borrower more time to
complete procurement actions. It should also be noted that several of the performance indicators (Annex
1), were not in line with rapidly developing technology trends, and may have been overly ambitious given
the initial level of sector development in the country.
There was clear recognition by the preparation team of the project risks, namely the potential for political
interference in the implementation of the sector restructuring and the risk of delays in the investment part of
the program due to procurement or insufficient institutional capacity. These risks were discussed with the
Borrower during negotiations and the agreements reached to minimize these risks were reflected in the
conditionalities of the project.
- 11 -



7.2 Supervision:
The overall supervision of the project was satisfactory. Regular supervision missions were canied out
generally every six months and the documentation in the project file is adequate. A mid-term review was
conducted in September of 1997, though it did not involve co-financiers. There was a change in task
managers 18 months before project closing. However, this did not disrupt project supervision and had no
impact on project achievements. Project performance indicators and financial indicators, as outlined in the
SAR, were monitored on a regular basis and generally served as realistic measures of the project's
achievements, with the exception of the quality-of-service targets, which had been over-estimated, as
mentioned above. The Borrower noted that in several instances there were delays in obtaining the Bank's
non-objection on procurement matters.
Following the first attempt at privatization of JTC, the Bank participated in a mission, with two external
consultants, to provide the Government with a neutral and independent perspective of international
experience in telecommunications privatization transactions. This mission, which was carried out at the
request of the Chairman of the Executive Privatization Unit, analyzed the reasons for the failure of the first
attempt and helped the Government re-think its privatization strategy in order to re-launch the bidding
process with successful results.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank performance was satisfactory. Bank staff worked closely with the Government and the
implementing agency to push the sector reform ahead and to monitor progress on the physical component.
The Bank gave strong advice to the GOJ on maintaining a consistent sector policy, in following
international best practice for the privatization transaction and in establishing a credible and transparent
regulatory environment. Project modifications, including extensions of the effectiveness date, a credit
reallocation and one extension of closing date, were generally processed by the Bank team in an efficient
manner in order to respond to the Borrower's needs.
The Bank also assisted in securing the cofmancing for the project which involved five different donors, with
the loan from JBIC (formerly the Japan Exim Bank) being administered by the Bank. The project
successfully piloted the use of a World Bank Guarantee in the telecommunications sector. The US$50
million Eurobond issue was oversubscribed, illustrating a successful approach to finance a well justified
investment program.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The quality of the Borrower's commitment and contributions to project preparation were notable. In terms
of the restructuring program, the Government and JTC took several steps to ensure the support of key
stakeholders: (a) in the process of developing the sector policy, the Council of Ministers, the Steering
Committee, the private sector, the Association of Engineers and JTC managers worked closely and debated
issues in workshops held for this purpose; and (b) in order to ensure the ownership of its middle
management, JTC established working groups to serve as "change agents" to help explain to staff the
objectives, expected outcome and benefits of the reform process.
In terms of the investment component, the Borrower organized program management on two levels: (i) a
Program Management Unit, responsible for strategic issues, including global scheduling, information
management, financial and contractual matters, human resources planning and technical advice, was
established in 1994; and (ii) a project management structure was defined to handle micro-scheduling and
implement supervision of the different works (buildings, switching, transmission, outside plant), including
quality and quantity control and the issuance of performance certificates.
- 12 -



Prior to negotiations, the Borrower had developed a detailed project implementation plan and the bidding
documents for all major procurement had been prepared and issued.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government, and in particular the Project Management Unit, was mainly responsible for
implementation of the sector restructuring component. Although there were some hitches and delays along
the way, given the overall progress made on the sector reform during the period of 1994 to the present
(Telecommunications Law adopted, Sector Policy Statement issued, regulatory agency established, policy
division in MOPC created, and corporatization and subsequent privatization of the telecommunications
operator), the Government's performance can be considered satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The implementing agency's (JTC) performance was highly satisfactory. The Project Management Office
provided quarterly progress reports on a regular basis with performance indicators generally exceeding
expectations. Financial management of the project was carried out in a very professional manner. Audit
reports were usually received on time and were unqualified, and the financial covenants, as specified in the
Loan Agreement, were adhered to. Given the high level of overall funding for the NTP (US$250 million),
JTC did an excellent job of managing the various grants and loans and ensuring that funds were used
properly. The success of the bond issuance (ECO Guarantee), further demonstrated JTC's maturity in
financial management practices.
Procurement management, however, was a problem during the initial phase of project implementation.
Multiple layers of review in the national public procurement system (JTC, national tender board, Ministry
of Planning, etc.), sometimes delayed the bid evaluation process by 4-6 months, throwing off the time
schedule for planned delivery and installation of goods. Due to procedural delays it was frequently
necessary to update the technical specifications of the various tenders to take into account new technologies
and to request variation orders to signed contracts. Although JTC noted that they felt the Bank's
procurement procedures were time consuming and did not allow for flexibility, they did manage to use ICB
procedures effectively to reduce equipment prices resulting in significant project cost savings.
Despite these initial difficulties, JTC's management of the physical component of the project was highly
successful, and generally exceeded expectations.
7. 7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance and participation in both preparation and implementation is highly
satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The main lessons to be drawn from this project implementation experience are the following:
Sector Regulation. The support of regulatory reforms does not end with the creation of the independent
sector regulator. Although the telecommunications regulator was successfully established and staffed
under the project, more attention could have been given to building the capacity of the regulator through
more specialized training and study tours, and in emphasizing the importance of complete separation of the
regulator from the ministry, including the allocation of a separate and independent budget for the TRC.
Project Financing. The efficient implementation of different financial instruments, in particular the bond
issue, not only ensured the investment program financing, but more importantly, stimulated the
- 13 -



enhancement of financial management skills and positive evolution of JTC corporate culture. The project
provides the first "best practice" example for the use of a WB guarantee in the telecommunications sector.
Privatization. Any privatization transaction should be preceded by a well designed public relations
campaign and involvement of all current and potential stakeholders in the sector. A consistent sector policy
and strong display of Government commitment is crucial in attracting private investors.
Cofinancing Arrangements. Cofinancing arrangements should be secured as early as possible in project
preparation. When the Bank is charged with administration of a cofmancier's loan (as was the case for the
JBIC loan in this project) there is a necessity for a common supervision approach and eventual joint
missions to ensure faster reaction to a Borrower's requests for extension, reallocation, etc.
Technical Assistance. The early provision of quality technical advice to the GOJ for sector restructuring
and to JTC for implementation of the physical component, as well as the Borrower's capacity for absorbing
and using the TA, greatly contributed to the overall success and sustainability of the project.

JORDAN TELECOM
NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION PROGRAM (NTP)
FINAL REPORT
December 1999
Summary
JORDAN TELECOM - NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION PROGRAM
During the period 1995 to 1999 Jordan has undertaken substantial new developments within
the Telecommunications sector. The introduction of the new Telecommunications Law has: (i)
promoted competition and private provision of services, (ii) facilitated establishment of the
Telecommunications Regulatory Commission to ensure fair play, (iii) transformed the
Telecommunications Corporation into a commercial company - Jordan Telecom, and (iv) ensured
commencement of the strategic partnership and privatization process within JTC. The National
Telecommunication Program has been implemented simultaneously and in harmony with these
changes
The objective of the Program is to enhance service quality, expand network capacity and increase
coverage. These objectives have been achieved through a substantial increase in infrastructure
volume; in terms of switching and local line plant capacity the figure for 1994 was 320,000, in
comparison the 1999 figure is 840,000. The number of users and connections has almost doubled
from 287,000 installed lines in 1993, to 565,000 lines in December 1999.
Financing of the NTP was secured at an early stage through loans, grants and intemal JTC
budgetary commitments. The total investment in the NTP to date amounts to 200 million USD and
covers the construction of buildings, the procurement and installation of switching equipment,
associated power and transmission systems and outside plant civil works and LLP material. Jordan
Telecom has internally financed a quarter of the total investment from operating revenue.
Service coverage has been extended to within the reach of 98% of the population of Jordan; in rural
areas the manual service has been replaced by remote digital line units and as a result of exchange
modernization new value-added services have been introduced.
The dedication of the Program Management Office and its staff has ensured adherence to
contractual agreements and financial commitments, the NTP implementation phase has been
efficiently supervised. The selection of a single supplier/contractor resulted in a simplification of
coordination activities and scheduling of works. The direct involvement of several local partners in a
joint venture with the main LLP contractor gave varied results. Management of both Employer and
Contractor work forces must be strong and clear to ensure quality in performance and compliance
with agreed standards.
The "on-going works" are carried out internally by JTC for network expansion in specific target
areas. Four major sub-projects with a total capacity of 139,000 lines have been implemented at a
total cost of 54 million USD
Further expansion through variation and continuation of work by existing suppliers is awaiting the
outcome of the strategic partnership issue; expectations are that this will be concluded positively in
the very near future.
The purpose of the detailed report that follows is to accurately record the latest statistics and financial
figures, compare objectives with achievements and present an overall picture of implementation
progress in a format acceptable to finance institutions, donors and directly concerned entities.

Background
0.1   Introduction
Preparation for the National Telecommunication Program (NTP) commenced in early 1994. A
decision was taken by the Govemment of Jordan to expand the existing network in light of the
increased demand. A World Bank appraisal mission identified the main elements of the proposed
project and subsequently a WB loan, and an Expanded Co-financing Operation (ECO), was
approved. WB Report No. 12788-JO Other financial institutions were approached and suitable loans and
grants were negotiated to cover in all 50% of the total program cost (Heading 4)
The target period for project implementation was from 1995 to 1998. The planning and the tender
documentation were prepared by TCC and released for international bidding in 1994. The NTP was
divided into four disciplines, Transmission, Switching, Local Line Plant, and Buildings, with specific
terms of reference for materials and services for each one. The switching contract included power
systems, fire control and air treatment equipment. Supply contracts for cable and wooden poles were
issued separately.
Evaluation, negotiation and award of contracts were undertaken intemally, within the then TCC, in
accordance with acknowledged international procurement procedures.
In mid-1995 a Program Management Office was appointed to oversee all undertakings relating to the
physical implementation of the NTP, the PMO mandate extends until the final resolution of all
technical and financial matters.
I     NTP Objectives
1.1   Enhance Service Quality
Achieved through:
* The introduction of new value-added services, i.e. CLIP & ISDN.
*  Decentralization and increase in the number of Customer Service reception points through the
addition of administrative office facilities to 26 new main exchange buildings.
*  Emphasis on adherence to agreed technical specifications and work methods in the field during
implementation.
1.2 Expand Network Capacity
From WB report, page 15, para. 66, The physical component will:
*     Increase infrastructure capacity from 320,000 to 600,000
NTP contribution + 384,000
On-going works + 139,000
Infrastructure capacity increased from 320,000 to 840,000
*     By 1999 the number of subscribers expected to be between 520,000 - 540, 000
JTC achievement: 565,000 subscribers (December 1999)
*     NTP as-built quantities
Direct exchange lines: 384,022 (annex 8.3)
Main cable pairs:   536,235 (1999-12-31)
Distribution pairs:  868,475 (1999-12-31)
1.3   Increase Geographical Coverage
The main areas covered by the NTP are Greater Amman, Central Region and North Region,
in addition on-going works aim to further increase coverage across the Kingdom.

5   Physical Results
5.1 Buildings
The building project for the National Development Programme started in 1995, one year in advance
of system implementation. All NTP related buildings were completed by March 1999.
In total 128 new buildings have been constructed, 26 of these are main-exchange buildings for
combined technical and administrative use with a floor area of approximately 1100 m2, and in
addition four existing primary centre buildings were enlarged. The remaining 98 buildings have
approximately 108 m2 of floor space and are mainly used to accommodate the remote exchanges,
power and transmission equipment. One main exchange and 17 RLU buildings will be used in future
network expansion.

The total cost of the building construction project was 13,919,114 JD, equivalent to 19.6 million USD,
this includes building permits and the connection of utilities, but excludes land acquisition costs.
5.2 Switching
The contract for the supply and installation of digital switching equipment for 22 primary centres and
81 remote switches was awarded to Siemens AG of Germany. The initial contracted switching
capacity was for 300,304 Direct Exchange Lines (DEL'S). During implementation a further 76,968
DEL's, 3 main exchanges and 1 RLU, were added through 4 variation orders. An additional 4
variation orders included ISDN facilities and other hardware items. The Aqaba project has added a
further 6,750 lines bringing the NTP total to 384,022.
Stand-by diesel generators were installed at 95 sites together with power plant (rectifiers and
batteries) at 119 sites. Fire fighting/fire alarm and air treatment systems were installed at 94 and 100
sites respectively. Power equipment for some transmission sites is included in these figures as well
as sites where existing power plant has been upgraded under the NTP.
The installation work was completed in accordance with the implementation time schedule and a final
settlement for the switching contract has been agreed upon. The total as-built value for the completed
switching works is equivalent to 41 million US$. A breakdown of costs and quantities is included
under Annex 8.2 & 8.3.
5.3 Transmission
The contract for the supply and installation of transmission equipment was awarded to Siemens AG
of Germany. The contract includes the following:
1.    PDH equipment for 128 sites.
2.    SDH equipment for 49 sites.
3.    Microwave equipment and towers for 26 sites.
4.     1400 km fibre optic cables, plus duct and direct buried copper cables.
5.    Two network management centres.
6.    Civil works for duct and excavation for direct buried cables.
The scheduled completion period was 750 calendar days, subsequently a further 151 days were
allowed for specific works and delays and a final settlement has been concluded between the
Employer and the Contractor. The agreed as-built cost of the transmission project is equivalent to 30
million US$. A breakdown of equipment costs and services is included under Annex 8.4.
5.4 Local Line Plant
The contract for local line plant civil works and accessories was awarded to Siemens and Partners -
Jordan, the initial implementation period was 36 months.
- 28 -



The bidding document was released to bidders in early 1995 with a bill of quantity (BQ) based on
estimates from only 20% of the network design sites completed at that time. The final design BQ was
received from JTC Planning Department on March 31, 1998, and by then the estimated quantities
were far in excess of the contracted quantities. JTC was therefore obliged to initiate two variation
orders to overcome the quantity increase as a consequence of the increase in the contracted
switching capacity and the extended coverage to remote areas. A 12-month time extension was
agreed upon with the Contractor for the completion of the work.
During the implementation of the LLP project a further increase in the as-built quantities of between
10% and 20% has caused JTC to transfer some 30 RLU sites to a 'Buffer Zone", as a temporary
measure. These sites will be implemented during the next phase of network expansion.
The project was divided into work-packages (WP) per exchange area and each WP subdivided into a
number of jobs. Performance Certificates were issued upon completion of jobs and Preliminary
Acceptance Certificates awarded per WP upon successful completion of acceptance tests.
At the time of preparation of this draft report (November 1999) 130 work packages have been
completed together with 1938 jobs; 39 work packages and 220 jobs remain in progress. As of
November 30th 1999 the as-built cost of the LLP works is equivalent to 68 million US$
A breakdown of site costs and overall material usage is included under Annex 8.5.
5.5 JTC on-going works
The urgent relief projects were implemented by TCC/JTC to accommodate the demand in the rural
areas by increasing the exchange capacity, modernizing the existing service from manual to
automatic and by adding a new National & International Switching Centre (NISC).

6   Conclusions and Recommendations
6.1 Program Management Office
An important corner stone of the Program was the establishment of a dedicated Program
Management Office (PMO) in mid-1995. The PMO mandate was clearly defined and authority given
to co-ordinate all NTP related activities. Responsibility was delegated to the levels where decisions
were taken, both in the office and in the field. An early commitment to quality in both management
and operations, through the introduction and adherence to agreed processes and formats, has given
positive results.
Together with competent and motivated staff the PMO has ensured relatively problem-free
procurement and implementation phases in relation to the size of the investment and the complexity
of the Program. In particular the attachment to the PMO of a Finance Department for Development
has contributed positively to the transparent and effective handling of all Program related financial
matters.
There has been some turnover in recently trained and experienced NTP staff with their departure to
other telecommunications entities in the Gulf States. While this may be beneficial to the individual
and in the medium-term interest of Jordan, for JTC and the NTP it is a negative factor. Due to the
current downsizing of NTP staff numbers this does not appear to be of immediate concem, however
in the long-term JTC should ensure that its investment in human resources benefits both staff and
employer.
6.2   Privatization and Strategic Partnership
The approaching (for the past 12 months) merger of JTC in a 60/40 partnership with an alternative
telecommunications operator has caused some disturbance to the decision process within JTC upon
which the NTP is dependent. For the NTP the clock is still ticking; material has to be purchased,
further network expansion has to be taken into account, staff need to be gainfully employed,
contractors, if they are delayed, expect to be compensated, etc. It is in the interest of both JTC and
any new partner that the NTP continues uninterrupted to its logical and scheduled conclusion.

6.3 Procurement Process - JTC
The bid evaluation process was time consuming; on average it took 4 - 6 months. Some methods for
pre-qualification of bidders should be considered together with realistic time frames for evaluation
deliberations. Terms of reference and evaluation criteria need to be made clear to all.
JTC technical specifications require modernizing to take into account new technologies, services and
developments in the telecommunications sector. The commercial conditions and procurement policy
should reflect the new company's independence from previous purchasing constraints.
6.4 Procurement Process - Financiers
The rules and procedures applied by financial institutions, such as the World Bank, are considered
complicated by the end user. Restraints in the utilization of allocated funds can cause the borrower
(telecom operator) delay in purchasing additional or altemative goods under current loan agreements.
Some flexibility should be allowed to ensure that the telco could make adjustments within an agreed
framework, to take into account changes in requirements due to market or technological
developments. Thus the financiers time-consuming procedures for verification and approval of
changes could be streamlined.
6.5 LLP Network Design
The initial LLP design could have been more accurate; inconsistencies were mainly due to an
increase in the initial exchange quantities from 220000 to 377000 lines. This in turn increased
substantially the total volume of survey work and its geographic disbursement. Other factors that
negatively affected the results were time constraints, a lack of design tools and methods, insufficient
control and supervision of staff and the scarcity of accurate municipality maps.
More in-house training is needed for new staff before deploying them in the field. The experienced
LLP designers must be given higher status. Modern tools, such as computers and quantity/design
programs, must be made available.
6.6 Variations
Variations to all technical disciplines have occurred partly because insufficient time was allocated for
overall planning before inviting tenders and negotiating contracts, and because the initial design was
made before all priorities and changes could be taken into account. Delays in the decision process
and extemal influences have also contributed.
Variations and changes in priority are likely to cause disturbance and disruption to a contractors
sequential work schedule, and may cause delays. Where variations are considered unavoidable, or
even advantageous, they must be clearly documented, priced and acknowledged by all parties.
6.7 Purchasing and Delivery
In the continuous development and expansion of a telecom network, fundamental items such as
cables and poles are constantly required. While appreciating some financial benefits of 'just-in-time"
procurement, the "a-little-too-late" supply of basic items can cause unnecessary delay in field
implementation.
In light of the knowledge gained of suppliers performance and the quality of goods supplied to the
NTP, Jordan Telecom should be able to select a number of proven suppliers of standard items and
negotiate regular delivery arrangements at competitive prices. Less complicated procurement
procedures should reduce the need for frequent international tenders, the production of which can be
both time-consuming and costly.

6.8 Further Network Expansion
Repeated 5-year major network expansion programs tend to produce 'staircase" development, e.g.
intense activity over relatively short periods followed by "wait-and-see" periods. Continuous linear
network development, based on market forecasts, would result in smooth growth without
over-straining JTC's financial and human resources.
Utilization of the knowledge and experience of the PMO staff and its organization in major network
development should be continued, possibly through closer integration with the line organization of
JTC i.e. the Planning and Development Division.
The current NTP network expansion will probably be fully utilized within the first two years of the new
millennium. To meet the competition from a second fixed service operator JTC must plan for
continued network expansion to accommodate for market driven developments in the form of
IP-based technology and services.
