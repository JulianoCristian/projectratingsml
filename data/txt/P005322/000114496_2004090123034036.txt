Guarantee, TCC shall pay or cause payment to be made to the Bank in same day 
funds by telegraphic transfer on the Closing Date, a guarantee fee of US$

due under the Redeemed Bonds cease entirely either by operation of law or under 
the terms and conditions of the Trust Deed: (i) the Bank shall make an 
appropriate refund to TCC of the guarantee fee in accordance with the

accordingly with regard to the calculation of any subsequent guarantee fee refund 
to TCC.

indulgence which may be granted to the Bank by the Trustee or the holders of the 
Bonds, by any variation of the terms and conditions of the Trust Deed or Bonds 
(other than to reduce principal amount due on stated maturity), or any related 
agreement nor by any circumstances which would or might (but for this provision) 
constitute a discharge or stay of or defence to Jordan and/or TCC obligations to 
reimburse or indemnify the Bank hereunder.
(b)
The Bank may at any time, without thereby foregoing, impairing or 
otherwise affecting any rights, powers and remedies hereby created or conferred

Deed or by law (i) offer or agree to or enter into any agreement for the 
extension or variation of the IBRD Guarantee without increase in the IBRD

entity in respect of reimbursement or indemnification against payments made or 
liabilities incurred under the IBRD Guarantee provided always that the exercise 
and/or enforcement of any of these rights in conjunction with the rights, powers 
and remedies hereby conferred shall not result in the Bank obtaining 
reimbursement or indemnification which exceeds the aggregate of all amounts and 
matters in respect of which the Bank is entitled to reimbursement and 
indemnification pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i) and (ii) above.
(d)
The Bank shall not be obliged before taking steps to enforce any 
rights conferred on it by this Counter-Guarantee and Indemnity Agreement or 
exercising any of its rights, powers and remedies hereunder, the Bonds, the Trust 
Deed, related agreements or by law: (i) to take action or obtain any judgment or 
award in any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction against any other 
person or entity (including persons or entities from whom it may seek 
reimbursement or indemnity in respect of sums paid under the IBRD Guarantee); or 
(ii) to enforce or seek to enforce any other rights it may have against Jordan or 
TCC or its rights against any other person or entity.
Section 2.04.  Without prejudice to any of their other obligations 
hereunder, Jordan and TCC hereby undertake to punctually perform all of their 
respective obligations under the Bonds, the Trust Deed, the Paying Agency 
Agreement and related agreements, and Jordan further agrees that any amount due 
to the Bank by it and by TCC jointly and severally hereunder shall be deemed, for 
purposes of Sections 6.02(b) and 7.01(d)(ii) of the General Conditions, to be an 
amount due in consequence of a guarantee extended by the Bank to a third party, 
with the agreement of Jordan.
ARTICLE III
Other Covenants
Section 3.01.  TCC and Jordan hereby warrant jointly and severally to the 
Bank as follows:
(a)
on the Closing Date, TCC shall use such amount from the proceeds of 
the Bonds as is necessary to pay:  (i) the guarantee fee specified in Section 
2.02(a) of this Agreement; and (ii) those amounts payable to the Managers, the 
Paying Agents, the Trustee and advisors engaged by TCC for the purposes of the 
issue of the Bonds as specified in the Subscription Agreement or as agreed with 
such advisors, as the case may be.
(b)
the balance of the proceeds of the Bonds shall be used by TCC for 
the purposes of the Project.  TCC shall ensure that the goods and services 
required for the Project and financed out of the proceeds of the Bonds:  (i) 
shall at all times be procured with due regard to considerations of quality, 
reliability, economy and efficiency in accordance with procedures satisfactory to 
the Bank; and (ii) shall be applied exclusively for the purposes of the Project.
Section 3.02.  The proceeds of the Bonds shall be managed by TCC in 
accordance with the following provisions:
(a)
TCC shall open in its name on the books of Central Bank of Jordan on 
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank a separate freely convertible and

Special Account) in which it shall, on the Closing Date, deposit the entire 
balance of the proceeds of the Bonds; and
(b)
TCC agrees that such funds shall be held in the Dollar Special 
Account on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, including adequate and 
legally  effective  protection against set-off, seizure or attachment and further

Page  5
(a)
(i) maintains records and procedures adequate to identify the 
expenditures financed out of the proceeds of the Bonds, and (ii) responds 
promptly to any reasonable request from the Bank concerning the expenditure of 
the proceeds of the Bonds and the goods and services financed out of such 
proceeds including, without limitation, the provision of all such documents and 
other evidence as shall be adequate in the opinion of the Bank to show that 
amounts disbursed from the Dollar Special Account were disbursed for Eligible 
Expenditures as contemplated in Sections
3.01 to 3.02 above, respectively; and 
(b)
(i) causes the records and accounts referred to in paragraph (a) of 
this Section and those for the Dollar Special Account for each fiscal year to be 
audited (in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied) 
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (ii) furnishes to the Bank as 
soon as available, but in any case not later than six months after the end of

to the Bank such other information concerning said records , accounts and 
financial statements as well as the audit thereof as the Bank may from time to

Section 3.04.  If at any time the Bank determines that any sum paid out of 
the Dollar Special Account was paid out in respect of any expenditure not 
eligible as contemplated by Section 3. 01 (b) above, as the case may be, or was 
not justified by the evidence furnished pursuant to Section 3.03 above, TCC 
shall, promptly following written notice from the Bank, deposit in the Dollar 
Special Account an amount equal to such sum to replenish the account in question.  
Jordan hereby guarantees such replenishment.
Section 3.05.  In the event that any amount is paid by the Bank pursuant to 
the provisions of the IBRD Guarantee, Jordan and TCC jointly and severally 
undertake to pay interest to the Bank on such amount, in the currency determined 
in accordance with Section 2.01(c)(i) above, at the rate per annum specified by 
the Bank based on the Bank's prevailing borrowing cost in such currency plus its 
applicable margin over such borrowing cost, until such amount is paid in full to 
the Bank by TCC and/or Jordan.
Section 3.06.  (a)  TCC and Jordan shall obtain the prior written consent 
of the Bank before agreeing to any change in the terms and conditions of the 
Bonds or the Trust Deed or related agreements;
(b)

the Exchange, Jordan and/or TCC (or their authorized agent) take possession of 
the Exchanged Bonds, Jordan and TCC jointly and severally undertake to effect the 
immediate irrevocable cancellation of the Exchanged Bonds in accordance with 
their terms and conditions and the provisions of the Paying Agency Agreement.

principal paying agent pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement, the IBRD Guarantee 
and the obligations of TCC and Jordan set out in Section 2.01 above shall lapse 
automatically and the Bank and Jordan and TCC shall be forever released and 
discharged from any further obligation to one another hereunder with respect to 
the Exchanged Bonds, without prejudice always to any claims already made or 
liabilities already accrued hereunder:  (i) in respect of any Bonds not the 
subject of the Exchange; and (ii) which are not definitively extinguished by the 
Exchange.  TCC shall notify the IBRD of any Exchange as soon as reasonably 
practicable and in the case of an Exchange in which not all Bonds are exchanged 
or converted, the provisions of Section 2.02(b) shall apply, using the aggregate 
face value of the Exchanged Bonds.
(d)
For the avoidance of doubt, and unless otherwise agreed, where the 
Exchanged Bonds have been exchanged and acquired by Jordan rather than converted 
and retired by TCC, the cancellation of the Exchanged Bonds shall not in any way 
affect the existence at law of the debt owed by TCC to Jordan in the amount of
