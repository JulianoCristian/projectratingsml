Amendment to the Guarantee Agreement
Excellency:
Please refer to the Guarantee Agreement, dated June 28, 1994, between the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the “Bank”) and the Hashemite 
Kingdom of Jordan (the "Guarantee Agreement").  Pursuant to the incorporation of the 
Jordan Telecommunications Company, and its assumption of the obligations of Jordanian 
Telecommunications Corporation, we hereby agree to amend the Guarantee Agreement as 
follows:
The first WHEREAS clause is changed to read as follows: 
“WHEREAS (A) the Guarantor and Jordan Telecommunications Company 
(the 
Borrower), having been satisfied as to the feasibility and priority 
of the 
Project described in Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement, have 
requested the Bank 
to assist in the financing of the Project; and”
A new Section 3.04. is added to the Guarantee Agreement as follows:
“Section 3.04   The Guarantor shall, by June 30, 1997, cause the 
Organisation for the Regulation of the Telecommunications Sector to 
forward to 
the Bank for its review and comments, the proposed License 
with the Borrower, and the 
Bank’s comments thereon shall be taken into 
account in the issuance of the said 
License.” 
This amendment will enter into effect on the date that the Bank issues its 
written notice to Bankers Trust under Clause 14(c) of the Trust Deed.\0b\0d
Please confirm your agreement to the amendment by signing and dating the form of
