                         The TFCP was closed on July 31, 2012 after restructuring and a 32-month closing date extension. Achievement ofProjectDevelopmentObjectives has been moderately satisfactory

                         ForPDO Component 1 (Project's main component): Customs Automation (ASYCUDA World) has benefited traders and privatesector as customs process time becomes shorter and
                         more predictable in clearing declarations and releasing goods, and simplifyingtrade documents as well as greater consistency and transparency in how this government agency treats
                         traders. Number of documentsrequired to clear imports has been reduced to 10 (from 44 during the time of project design in 2005 and15 at the time of projectrestructuring in2009
                         and to 10 at the time of project closing date). Share of customs declaration processed through"ASYCUDAAutomated System" rose to nearly 100% by the time of project closing date

                         (July 31, 2012) compared to targeted objective ofabove 80% (baseline PDO was29%) and similarly, availability of the "ASYCUDA Customs Automated System" also expanded to
                         nearly 100%.Time required for customs clearance of shipment fell from 6.5 days at the time of project preparation (ICA2004) to 5.1 days in2012 (preliminary result of ICA 2012). And
                         finally, share of shipment selected for physical inspection (secondary inspection)at the port of Sihanoukville fell to 14.2% by the time of project closing date July 2012 (well achieved
                         PDO target rate ofbelow16%). An outcome associated with this progress is also respected in Logistics Performance Index ranking in 2012 (LPI 2012)where Cambodia made a 28-
                         ranking jump compared to previous ranking (LPI 2010) done two years ago. This makes Cambodia the 12thfastest reformer in the world over two years an done of the star
                         performers among Low-Income Countries (9th place). A smallsetback under this component was the project failed to computerize (automate) the Certification of Origin (CO) under
                         the Ministryof Commerce which is mainly due to failed procurement that resulted from receiving non-compliant/non-responsive bidders. Thiscomponent is considered as satisfactory
                         (If CO automation was done, this component would have been considered as highlysatisfactory).

                         For PDO component 2 (Export Market Access Fund): The matching grants to promote exports also succeeded in openingnew markets and encouraging new exporters. 65 firms and
                         associations have become beneficiaries of EMAF with export developmentplan prepared (well above PDO target of 50 firms). Of the 65 firms and association,13 are new exporting
                         firms (short of PDO targetof 30 new exporters). The Better Factories Cambodia initiative (alsoEMAF beneficiary) has also promoted the opening of new marketsthrough encouraging
                         greater social responsibility among garment factory managers regarding the wages and working conditions oftheir labor forces (mostly young women), a quality assurance that has
                         gained the industry wider and deeper access with leadingretail chains in USA and Europe markets. In the same time, non-donor revenues for Better Factories Cambodia (BFC)
                         reached 55% bythe end of 2011 and increased to 75% by 2012 (Committed budget), this has met the targeted PDO of above 65%. This component isconsidered as satisfactory.

                         For PDO component 3 (PPI andInvestment): The area where the project has been less successful is underComponent 3, managed by the Council for the Development ofCambodia
                         (CDC),a Concessions Law was developed and adopted by parliamentand relevant officials were trained, but no pilot transaction of private participation in infrastructure(PPI) was
                         launched. Thisis not altogether surprising, as the preparation of the legal framework and procedures and the corresponding training wereovertaken by the global financial crisis of
                         2008-2009, which deterred such investment almost every where, especially in `new'countries. But at the least there should be a low-cost, low-risk pilot operations done rather than
                         the relatively high-cost,high-risk proposals put forward. The targeted PDO of having 3PPI piloted isnot met and similarly the Investment Tracking System'srolling out plan to 7 CDC
                         departments has not materialized by the closing date (July 2012). The Investor Tracking System isoperational at one key department (Project Evaluation and IncentivesDepartment)
                         only. And finally Cambodia's Ranking in GlobalInvestment Promotion Benchmarking done in 2012 fell to 28% (fell short of PDO target of 50%).This component is rated
                         asunsatisfactory.

                         For PDO component 4 (Legal Transparency): The websites for the Ministry ofJustice (http://www.moj.gov.kh/) and theSupreme Court (http://www.supremecourt.gov.kh/) have been
                         up and running and successful training sessions have been conducted butthe volume and content of information available on those websites fall short of expectations. Those sites
                         are supposed to makeavailable to the public all cases or at least 50% of final judgments in the SupremeCourt and in the Court of Appeal. Encouragingprogress made by the Supreme
                         Court is the posting its civil and criminal judgment cases from1997 up to 2007 (and promised to beupdated more later) and with most updated hearing schedules available to the
                         public,the Ministry of Justice's site has also beenimproved recently, but the volume of information remained short of targeted PDO. TheTrade Information Website (TIW), which
                         wasadded to this component during restructuring, and is supposed to be carried out undertheMinistry ofCommerce, has not beenaccomplished. This component is rated moderately
