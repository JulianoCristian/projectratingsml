The restructuring\n            will mainly reallocate resources from the subcomponent on\n            the electronic single window to: (i) a further extension of\n            the customs automated system; (ii) automation of\n            Certificates of Origin (C/O) issuance; and (iii) creation of\n            a Trade Information Website (TIW). Early during project\n            implementation, the Government indicated its decision not to\n            proceed with the institutional model initially envisaged for\n            the creation of a single window. However, it remained\n            committed to offering much of the functionality initially\n            envisaged under such a single window, building on the\n            platform of the customs automated system supported by the\n            TFCP. The restructuring supports this new approach through\n            redeploying resources that will support further deployment\n            of the customs automated system, the automation of C/O, and\n            the dissemination of trade-related information on a new TIW.\n            Other resources are being redeployed to continue support to\n            trade-related labor standards in the garment industries\n            ('better factories Cambodia') and additional training."}, "docdt": "2009-11-12T00:00:00Z"}
