A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

Cambodiafaces a profounddevelopmentchallenge.

   Cambodia is among the world's least developed countries. According to the NPRS, 36
   percent o f the total population o f 13.4 million lives below the poverty line o f US$O.46-$0.63
   per day; less than a third o f this population have access to an improved water source; one
   third is illiterate; 45% o fyoung children are underweight.

   The legacy of conflict. Decades o f conflict, ruinous policies and embargo destroyed the
   institutional fabric o f civil society and commerce. Cambodia's challenge i s compounded by
   the legacy o f internal conflict that not only depleted the country's reserves o f human talent
   on which entrepreneurship i s based, but also disrupted the continuity o f social institutions
   and formal and informal rules that provide the framework for trade and investment. The
   economic landscape reflects this lack o f key institutions, most notably the rule o f law. It also
   reflects an attempt by the Government to fill the institutional vacuum through administrative
   measures that have largely not worked, and created opportunities for corruption. Basic
   public services and infrastructure are absent for much o f the population.

   Narrow growthbased on an extremely smallformal private sector. An estimated 80% o f
   the population i s rural, and linked to subsistence agriculture. Of these families who depend
   on agriculture, 80 percent are poor. Manufacturing employs less than nine percent o f the
   workforce. A large share o f the private sector operates informally, contributing minimally to
   the tax base and facing limited access to finance and trade.

   Extreme dependence on one export sector, and substantial risks. The remarkable growth
   o f the garment sector from 1997 to 2001 demonstrated the potential impact o f private sector
   development on poverty.         Garment sector exports grew from $28 million in 1995 to
   approximately $2 billion in 2004, employing over 270,000. By the end o f 2004, Cambodia
   had become one o f the 20 largest garment exporters to the US. However, the quota system
   under which Cambodia's exports emerged has ended, giving way to a competitive
   marketplace in which China i s rapidly increasing its share. Cambodia now faces significant
   risksbecause its garments comprise 76% o f its exports.

   Poor infrastructure. Cambodia's infrastructure coverage i s the lowest in the East Asia
   region, contributing to high cost, poor quality services and limited access to markets. There i s
   no power grid, a lack o f adequate highway and rail service, and highport costs. Competition
   i s minimal in all sectors, lowering quality and raising costs. The services that exist are mainly
   concentrated in urban areas, and the rural population suffers from lack o f access to markets,
   from unsafe and unreliable water and dependence on traditional biomass energy. Future
   growth in such sectors as agroindustry and tourism are particularly sensitive to infrastructure.

   DecliningFDI over the past decade. FDIhas been on a secular trend downward since 1996,
   when inflows reached nearly $300 million. FDI inflows for 2003 were $87 million (WDI).

PolicyEnvironmentand InstitutionalPerformance

To better understand the policy and institutional environment facing firms, the World Bank
conducted an Investment Climate Survey in 2003 o f 802 enterprises. O f these 200 were rural,
100 urban informal, and 502 were urban firms in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Kampong Cham,
Sihanoukville, and Battambang. These enterprises ranged from micro (fewer than 10 employees)
to large (over 100 employees) and included both domestic and foreign firms. The key findings:


    0  Excessive regulation and weak institutions contributed to low productivity levels. The
       Investment Climate Survey found that total factor productivity and labor productivity are
       low in comparison with Bangladesh, India, China, and Pakistan. Some key factors that
       contribute to low productivity include corruption, weak property rights, informal
       practices and complex and costly regulation. Cambodia's unique history has resulted in
       economic openness, and yet administrative controls that are a heavy and costly burden to
       Cambodia's private sector. Cambodia has the most annual inspections, the highest cost
       per capita to officially register businesses, and requires management time to deal with
       officials on par with China. A Bank-funded assessment identified that import processes
       require 45 documents, many o f which are associated with unofficial fees.


    0  Institutionsvulnerable to corruption. A combination o f low salaries - average salaries
       in the Customs and Excise Department are less than $23 per month          -  and regulatory
       processes that create frequent interaction between public officials and firms create
       powerful incentives for corruption.       In the Investment Climate Survey, 82% o f
       respondents reported that they pay bribes, and 71% o f large firms suggest such payments
       are frequent. These payments amount to a reported average o f 5.2% o f firm sales    -twice
       the similar metric for Bangladesh - but increase with firm size and formality, exceeding
       6% large firms.

        Constraining trade facilitation processes. Among Cambodia's regulatory processes,
       importing and exporting were identified as having the highest unofficial costs in the June
       2003 survey. The Bank's 2003 Value Chain Analysis found that the cause o f high trade
       costs was not related to any one particular institution, but rather the cumulative impact o f
       overlapping institutions, each o f which required streamlining.       As a result, clearance
       times are among the longest and unofficial costs among the highest among countries in
       which the Bank has completed ICAs.


    0  Outside the garment sector, market and trade-supporting institutions are absent.
       There is a substantial gap both in trade supporting formal institutions and in firms with
       experience in exporting, including in complying with destination-country standards, and
       manage quality or resolve disputes. As the institutions are developed, there i s a gap in
       local understanding o f how to use these institutions to affect trade.


    0  Weak governance of public-privatepartnerships and concessions. The private sector
       represents the best opportunity for infrastructure development given financial and human
       resource constraints and the need for efficiency. However, consumers will only accrue

        the benefits o f private participation if there i s competition and transparency. However,
        private infrastructure transactions suffer from a lack o f clarity over roles and
        responsibilities within and between various government agencies with respect to PPI
         design, procurement, approvals and implementation, a general lack o f transparency inthe
        handling o f dealings between the public and private sectors, and specifically in the
        negotiation and management o f specific contracts between government and investors,
         from the initiation o f a potential project through the construction, implementation or
        transaction to the operation o f the project        -    few if any concession agreements or
         negotiated contracts have been made available for audit or public scrutiny.                      The
         consequences o f these problems include non-bankable projects, higher than necessary
        prices to consumers in the Cambodian economy, and a lack o f information on the value-
         for-money received by the public and the RGC from infrastructure projects, due to the
         inability to assess and allocate revenues, risks and profits in concessions.


    0    A lack of a credible judicial system. Progress is being made in enacting commercial
         laws and adopting related regulations, but judicial system capacity, remuneration and
         integrity are not yet being addressed in any adequate way. The inability to enforce laws
         and contractual rights and obligations in a predictable, transparent and efficient fashion
         has restricted the ability o f the financial sector to expand services to even 10% o f the
         private sector, and continues to undermine investor confidence. Judicial decisions are
         seen inthe private sector as arbitrary and subject to capture.

PolicyReformsin Support of Trade Facilitation& Competitiveness

1.       Cambodia now faces an historicopportunity to change its growthpath. Cambodia is
faced with a growing, stable, and integrating East Asian region, macroeconomic stability, and
new market opportunities afforded by its successful bid to become the first Least Developed
Country to be invited to join the WTO. Beyond WTO, the ASEAN Free Trade Area and China
Early Harvest measures provide Cambodia with an increasing number o f market access
opportunities free o f tariffs. This provides a good context to undertake a second generation o f
reform focused on enabling broad-based growth. However, without also addressing "behind the
border" investment climate constraints, the extent to which market access can be converted to
employment gains i s sharply limited.

2.       The Government has elaborated a private sector development strategy. In August
2004, the Government released its Rectangular Strategy, in which it committed to "broaden the
base    o f growth by strengthening             governance     to    attract  investment       and    ensuring
competitiveness."' In February 2005, the Government further described its platform as (i)trade
facilitation, by rationalizing government agencies that impose high costs and delays on the
private sector and reducing transaction costs; (ii)promotion o f market infrastructure and
deregulation; (iii)enhancing market access and access to information; (iv) institution building
and enhanced Rule o f Law; and (v) promoting small and medium-sized enterprises. Key features
o f this strategy are listed below:

0 Implementing WTO commitments and promoting exports are cornerstones of the
  Government's strategy. Cambodia's Protocol o f Accession commits the country to low
  bound tariffs, phased implementation o f the agreements on Trade Related Intellectual
  Property Rights (TRIPS), Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMS), the Telecom
  Reference Paper, and opening key service sectors, and use o f WTO-compliant trade measures
  (pricing, tariffs, fees, subsidies and customs measures inter alia) in exchange for MFN
  treatment by all members.      To take advantage o f market access, a new National Export
  Strategy i s being developed with support o f the International Trade Center Gevena (ITC),
  which focuses on expanding the base o f exporters to include agro-industry, handicraft,
  aquaculture and organically-certified products.


0 The legal framework is evolving. Legal and judicial reform has been an area o f slow
  progress over the past five years, but there are indications that CY05 may see the
  development o f a more conducive regulatory framework.          At the time o f writing, the
  following laws had either already been presented to Parliament or were in an advanced stage
  o f the drafting process: the Company Law, the Insolvency Law, Secured Transactions Act,
  Civil Code, the L a w on Commercial Arbitration, Sub-Decree on Economic Concessions and
  L a w establishing a Commercial Court.       Drawing attention to the pressing issues o f
  transparency and reliability in the implementation o f the law, in March 2005, the Prime
  Minister took initial steps to crack down onjudicial corruption.


0 A Twelve-Point Plan of investment climate reforms was adopted as a cross-Ministerial,
  multi-donor platform. The Prime Minister appointed a Special Inter-Ministerial Task Force
  (SITF) to respond to the findings o f the Investment Climate Assessment. In June 2004, the
  SITF defined an integrated program of reform to reduce unofficial costs and clearance times,
  while increasing public revenue. This was articulated in twelve intermediate objectives. It
  determined, intev alia, to create a cross-agency Reform Team, consolidate inspection
  mandates across agencies, introduce selective inspections based on risk criteria, reduce
  documents to a Single Administrative Document, introduce a Single Window process, and
  reengineer and automate procedures.       At present, five o f the twelve actions have been
  implemented, and the remainder are scheduled for completion by December 2005 (see B o x
  1). Importantly, within the Twelve-Point Plan, the Ministry o f Commerce has substantially
  reduced the cost and time required to register a business. The cost has been reduced by over
  $400, while the MinimumDeposit Requirement reduced from US$5,000 to US$l,OOO.


0 Redefining the Role of CamControl. Cambodia Import Export Inspection and Fraud
  Repression Department (Camcontrol) has long been recognized as a source o f redundancy
  with CED. As part of the Trade Facilitation Reform program, the Government with EU
  support conducted a review to examine the role o f CamControl and how the Government can
  discharge its important regulatory responsibilities, while maintaining and/or further
  improving its contribution to the overall trade facilitation objectives.  The main options
  considered are merging some or all of CamControl's functions with Customs, Ministry o f
  Industry, MAFF; or the Ministry o f Health; and (b) creating a new food and drug agency
  with a working title of Food Safety Cambodia. To the extent that these options eliminate
  routine trade inspections from CamControl's mandate, they would largely be acceptable, A
  decision i s expected inMay.



                                               4

0  Customs reforms. As part o f WTO accession, Cambodia prepared a new Law on Customs
   consistent with the Revised Kyoto Convention that addresses a number o f discrepancies with
   modem intemational practices including in valuation, staff remuneration, inspection and
   audit. This L a w was forwarded to the National Assembly with a target passage date o f July
   1,2005. The RGC's pace on delivering on WTO commitments has been mixed.


0  Streamlining trade documentation. The Govemment, with EU, and has completed
   technical work that would introduce an enhanced customs declaration to serve as a Single
   Administrative Document, replacing 45 documents that are currently involved in an import
   transaction. Streamlining documentation i s a proxy for reengineering the information flow,
   an essential prerequisite for ICT. This reform specifically included the following sub-steps:
       P Economic Police Permit, Export License and Import Permit eliminated
       P Consolidatedinspection, rather than multiple agencies inspecting independently
        P Certificate o f Origin now not requiredpre- shipment to be convertedto post-shipment

       New investmentpromotion strategy. The Council for Development o f Cambodia (CDC)'s
       Cambodian Investment Board (CIB), as Cambodia's investment promotion agency, i s
       currently undergoing the process o f re-defining its role as a result o f the Amendment to the
       Law on Investment, which was approved by the National Assembly in February 2003. The
       Amended L a w on Investment explicitly moves the CIB toward serving as a facilitative and
       promotional agency, with many evaluative and regulatory functions replaced by automatic
        systems. FIAS and MIGA are currently helping CDC define                                           a new corporate strategy
        including goals and objectives, the strategies and resources it will use to achieve these and
       the performance measurements by which it will assess its progress and success.

       Merit-Based Pay Initiative (MBPI). The Government is introducing, on a pilot basis,

       Financial Management (PFM) in the Ministry o f Economy and Finance. A team comprised
        o f the Ministry o f Commerce, Customs & Excise Department and Port Authority has been
       tasked with proposing a framework, using the MBPI framework developed by MEF, by 20
       M a y 2005. It will be funded, inpart by user fees.

0   Acceleration of the judicial reform process. The RGC's avowed Legal and Judicial
    Reform (LJR) Strategy2 outlines seven broad objectives that are aimed at improving access
    to, and the quality of, Cambodia's legal and judicial services. The third o f these objectives
    requires the "provision o f better access to legal and judicial information by promoting
    dissemination o f basic legal knowledge through official publications, electronic media and
    information folders and ensuring easy accessibility to all legal and juridical information for
    legal practitioners and any other interested party". And, in accordance with the LJR Action
    Plan formally adopted by the RGC in November 2004, acceleration o f the LJR process i s to
    occur in part by making "the improvement o f access to legal and judicial information" an
    "operational priority" o f the RGC in 2005-2006.

2. Rationalefor Bank involvement

Trade facilitation reforms are positively associated with increasedtrade and GDP growth,
while investment climate reforms more broadly are associated with decreasing corruption,
increasing formalization of business, increased growth and public sector revenue. Wilson, Mann
and Otsuki (2003) found that ifbelow-average APEC members could increase trade facilitation
performance half-way to the APEC average, inter-APEC trade would increase by $254 billion.
UCTAD (2001) found that a 1% reduction in the trade facilitation costs could increase Asian
GDP some $3.3 billion.        Given the end o f MFA, any cost reduction associated with trade
facilitation would also have the effect o f making the garment sector more competitive, and in the
long-term contributes to diversification.

P The 2004 Investment Climate Assessment has played a key role in informing national
    policy, and placed the Bank in a leadership role on the PSD policy dialogue. The Bank
    leads the donor working groups on Trade Facilitation, Private Participation in Infrastructure
    and Investment policy, while the Asian Development Bank leads the donor working group on
    SME development. The Bank Group i s in a unique position to support the Government due
    to its integration o f the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), the Mekong Private
    Sector Development Facility (MPDF), International Finance Corp (IFC) as Secretariat to the
    Govemment-Private Sector Forum, the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility
    (PPIAF), and relevant technical capacity drawn from throughout the Bank. Inthe view o f the
    counterparts, the integrated capacity has helped the government achieve more rapid results
    and convene a cross-Ministerial dialogue.

P The operation supports Cambodia's results-based Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
    The CAS includes a pillar on Private Sector Development which defines results in removing
    governance impediments to growth. The proposed operation i s aligned against three results.
    On 13 July 2004, the Bank received an official request for a project to finance the reform.

3. Higher level objectivesto which the projectcontributes

The project contributes to the higher level objective of increasing growth through
improved governance. The project builds on the country's growth strategy, WTO accession,
and Rectangular Strategy by facilitating a fundamental shift in governance o f private activity

* The Strategywas formally adoptedby the RGC's Council of Legal and Judicial Reform inJune 2003.

 from institutional environment characterized by overlapping, discretionary and costly controls to
 an institutional environment that facilitates efficient and competitive markets through transparent
 and predictable processes. It responds to the finding in the Investment Climate Survey that the
 leading constraints to business are governance-related, and the specific findings in the earlier
 Value Chain Analysis, Integrated Framework and Country Framework Report that govemance-
 related constraints are most acute in trade processes and private participation in infrastructure.
 The reforms focus on using transparency, competition, regulatory streamlining and market-based
 standards to increase confidence, to improve private sector's capacity to make investment and
 trade decisions, and to increase the efficiency o f public service delivery. The reforms will help
 Cambodia convert WTO/ASEAN market access to jobs.                       Improvements in trade facilitation
 practices are strongly correlated with increases intrade and GDP.

 3. Projectcomponents

 Component 1.             Trade Facilitation Component. ($6.15 million).                     The application o f
 appropriate IT to border management activities can significantly streamline operations, improve
 the level o f transparency and accountability and facilitate the achievement o f all border related
 government objectives. The project will finance (a) an electronic Single Window integrating all
 trade facilitation agencies, including the deployment o f ICT for automation o f Customs
 functions, linked to complementary improvements in systems, procedures and developments in


                                                          8

the organizations involved inproduct clearance (b) adherence to the Kyoto Convention including
the adoption o f a risk management capacity; (c) a design o f a merit based pay system for
Cambodia's trade regulatory agencies; and (d) the development o f an Integrity Action Plan for
CEDbased on a self assessment.

Component 2. Export Market Access Fund. ($2.1million). The component will finance (a)
technical support to the Ministry o f Commerce's Department o f Export Promotion to establish
the exporter technical assistance window, and (b) a technical assistance matching grant facility that
would cover 50% o f the cost o f achieving market standards, or evidence o f compliance with those
standards. The EMAF would offer its services solely in response to private sector demand on a
nondiscriminatory and a first-come-first served basis. An initial survey suggests demand from at
least 100 enterprises.   The Garment Manufacturers' Association of Cambodia (GMAC) i s
expected to apply for $600,000 cofinancing over three years to finance the International Labor
Organization's Better Factories campaign in order to achieve Core Labor Standards.

Component 3. PPI and Investment Component. ($1.2 million) The PPI and Investment
Component will finance a program o f capacity building to implement the L a w on Concessions
and the Amended Law on Investment. The objective o f the technical assistance i s to improve the
organizational capacity o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance, Council for Development o f
Cambodia, National Audit Authority, infrastructure regulatory bodies such as the Electricity
Authority o f Cambodia, and infrastructure line Ministries to manage and deliver o f PPIs
transactions that are conducted fairly, transparently, competitively and in the public interest. The
Investment Promotion sub-component i s aimed at supporting the CDC and CIB to adopt
strategies that streamline the process o f foreign direct investment, and that enhance the
attractiveness o f Cambodia as an investment destination through improvements in the regulatory
environment as well as in factor markets. The program consists o f three distinctive activities:
(a) appointment o f a local long-term resident advisor; (b) a series o f 5-days training workshops
for 15-20 CIB staff on subjects like investment generation and facilitation; and (c) installation o f
IT system.

Component 4.       Legal Transparency Component. ($0.4 million). This Component will
finance (a) the establishment and maintenance o f a website in the Khmer language to make
readily available to the public the final judgments o f all cases in the Supreme Court and in the
Court o f Appeal; (b) the establishment and maintenance o f a website to ensure the electronic
publication o f all Cambodian laws, related regulations and draft legislation in the commercial
law field, broadly defined; and (c) training to utilize the established systems. A link will be
established between this site and other relevant websites, including, most importantly, the
website o f the Ministry of Commerce and to the legislation and the subsidiary legislation (i.e.
decrees and sub-decrees), as referred to in the judgments. Publication o f such information will
contribute to increasing confidence in the capacity o f the appellate courts to interpret, apply and
enforce Cambodian laws generally and the commercial legal framework in particular in a fair
and consistent manner.    An increase in confidence in the transparency and predictability o f
judgments will reduce the risk now associated with private domestic and foreign investment.

4. Lessonslearnedand reflectedinthe project design

Demonstrate political will. The reforms financed by the proposed project have wide-ranging
implications for both public institutions and private sector behavior, including a substantial
decrease in opportunities to exploit public office for personal gain. As such, they require strong
political will to be achieved. The project has incorporated these lessons through sequencing
decisions that demonstrate such political will - such as passage o f enabling legislation, removing
Camcontrol from routine inspections and streamlining documents        - ahead o f project approval
without using conditionality. The approach has also created venues for very broad dissemination
and consultation inwhich the government has made measurable commitments.

Take a cross-agency perspective. The key problems in trade facilitation presented themselves
as issues - such as high unofficial payments - that could easily be interpreted as caused by the
Customs & Excise Department, which has recognized the need to improve its performance and
has developed a plan to that end. However, through a value chain analysis, the problem was
recognized as involving both internal issues within departments, problems o f role clarity across
agencies, and problems of information sharing and coordination both across agencies and in the
interface with the private sector.

Reengineer processes ahead of ICT investment. One o f the broad and enduringlessons from
technology investments around the world are that much o f the efficient gain resulting from ICT
investment i s from simplification and streamlining o f underlying process rather than from the
technology itself.    A corollary o f this point is that processes should be streamlined and
information flows simplified before technology investments. The project has incorporated this
point through mapping of the full process involving all relevant agencies, elimination o f process
overlaps, and sharing a Single Administrative Document across all relevant agencies.

Address incentives and financial sustainability. Many ICT investments have failed due to
weak incentives to use the new system. The proposed project addresses this question through
adoption o f the merit-based pay initiative funded through a WTO-compatible fee on transactions.

Measurementto enable the "demand side." While much o f the project investments improve
the delivery o f key public sector functions, a core lesson from the Bank's experience with service
delivery (as particularly highlighted in WDR 2004) i s the need to enhance accountability to tax
payers and beneficiaries of the service.        In the PPI component, this is incorporated through
enhancing accountability of PPI processes to the MEF and treasury, representing taxpayers,
Overall, the project will utilize a citizen score card approach through which the media and
general public can measure performance. The media itself will be consulted on the final design
o f the scorecard to better facilitate their reporting.

Use country systems.         The recent work on donor harmonization and effectiveness has
highlighted the need to use, wherever possible, the government's existing institutions rather than
create new project implementation units. The project has integrated these lessons by utilizing
management structures created by the Prime Minister in order to lead PSD efforts as the project's
management structure.      Other donors have endorsed this approach and will utilize the same
structure. Procurement processes, however, will remain consistent with Bank guidelines.

5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

Pure customs project, The Bank has undertaken a number o f projects around the world that
focus on customs for reform, and often include institutional strengthening as well as automation.
The project team considered this and rejected this option due to the fact that trade facilitation
issues extended well beyond customs functions, and was effectively an interagency problem as
described in the 2003 Value Chain Analysis and Investment Climate Survey. A customs project
would have left key interagency problems and non-customs functions undressed.

PPI Unit. The Project Team considered the establishment o f a dedicated PPI Unit inside o f the
Cambodian Treasury or CDC, as has occurred inthe UK, South Africa, Pakistan, Philippines and
Vietnam. While such units can concentrate expertise, this option was rejected because it ignores
the underlying causes o f dysfunction - the lack o f role clarity, weak incentives to maintain
transparency, and the poor integration o f competitive PPI into the functioning o f line Ministries.

In preparing the capacity building plan, we also considered whether alternative delivery
mechanisms might be preferable to those making up the proposed plan. Options considered
included appointing one or more long-term advisors to work with individual ministries or
agencies. This option was excluded as only benefiting a single RGC entity, while the capacity-
buildingplan is focused on trying to reach all entities involved inthe PPI Framework, and being
a high-cost solution, offering no certainty that ministries benefiting from long-term advisors are
those that have most need o f them, as the demand for support will be partly driven by the
pipeline o f suitable PPI opportunities.

Social Safety Net. The project concept note included the possibility o f financing retraining o f
workers or other safety nets for workers fired from the garment sector. However, this possibility
was rejected due to a lack o f signals of net job losses, and due to other donor efforts.

Legal and Judicial Reform. The possibility o f undertaking a stand-alone LJR has been
considered by the country team, due to the need for judicial strengthening in light o f the large
number o f laws being introduced currently. However, as indicated in the Country Assistance
Strategy, the World Bank has chosen for the foreseeable future not to engage to any significant
degree with the reform o f state institutions until credible evidence o f political commitment to
reform i s demonstrated.


C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

Partnership with donors. The World Bank leads a donor sub-working group on trade
facilitation. This working group includes seven other donors who coordinate policy and have
achieved a division o f labor with respect to implementing the 12-Point Plan o f investment
climate reforms.     The European Union, with its Multilateral Trade Assistance Project, has
supported the streamlining o f documentation necessary to introduce a Single Administrative

Document, as well as the review and redefinition o f the role o f Camcontrol. AusAID, with its
Cambodia-Australia Technical Assistance Facility (CATAF) has provided important support to
help implement a risk management strategy. The IMF and JICA have led the work o f reforming
the Customs and Excise Department, while UNCTAD and UNIDO have been extensively
involved in reform o f investment and PPI. Export diversification work has been led by the
International Trade Center and GTZ.

Partnershipwith the private sector. The private sector has played a critical role indemanding
and defining the reforms financed by the proposed project.       The Government-Private Sector
Forum includes an Export Processing and Trade Facilitation Working Group, co-Chaired by the
Sr. Minister o f Commerce and the Chairman o f the Garment Manufacturers' Association. It has
been raising and discussing key issues throughout the duration o f the Bank's engagement.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

The project will utilize existing coordination structures established by the Government as
its management structure. In August 2004, Prime Minister's Decision No. 12/2004 created a
Special Inter-Ministerial Task Force (SITF) on Trade Facilitation and Investment Climate,
Chaired by the Minister o f Economy and Finance and Vice-Chaired by the Minister o f
Commerce. On 26 July, 2004, following the formal creation o f the new Government, the Prime
Minister signed Decision44/2004, formalizing this as the Government's focal point for reformo f
the investment climate, trade facilitation, SME promotion, and PPI - the Steering Committee on
Private Sector Development. The Government established the Trade Facilitation Subcommittee,
Chaired by the Sr. Minister o f Commerce, as well as the Investment Climate and PPI
Subcommittee, Chaired by the Sr. Minister o f Economy and Finance.

Executing Agency. Given that over 80% o f funds will be utilized to finance the Trade
Facilitation and the Market Access Components, the Government has nominated the Ministry o f
Commerce as the Executing Agency.

Project ManagementUnits. In each key agency (Customs & Excise Department, Ministry o f
Commerce, Council for Development o f Cambodia, and Ministry o f Justice) a project manager
will be namedto supervise the daily implementationo fthe Project activities.

ReformTeam (ProjectCoordinationUnit). The Government's Reform Team will be response
for coordinating project tasks, executing all procurements and preparation o f Quarterly
Management reports that the Executing Agency will provide to the Bank and other donors.

Procurement:Particular attention will be given to procurement arrangements to ensure that the
project i s executed in a timely, transparent, efficient and integrated approach. Procurement o f
works, goods and services under the project will follow World Bank Guidelines. Details are
given in the Annex 8. All procurement will be executed by the Reform Team which has
successfully executed procurement processes for the Project Preparation Facility. This team's
capacity will be strengthened to ensure that staff has adequate skills and competence.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

The Govemment has asked for a second Investment Climate Assessment, on which many o f the
indicators are based, in 2006/07, supporting the mid-term report for the project. This will
provide an overall assessment o f progress toward the development objectives. To provide more
immediate feedback the Government i s establishing a Performance Monitoring System. For trade
facilitation, the agreed approach combines a simplified version o f World Customs Organization's
Simplified   Timed Release System, as well as a user survey based on the Investment Climate
Assessment. Indicators will focus on Processing Time, Inspections, Steps, Perceptions (of the
service provided by and the integrity o f six agencies), and costs (both official and unofficial).
The indicators will be captured in a reform "Score Card" that will be publicly disseminated,
including through public media. The PPI component will be monitored through the Ministry o f
Finance and CDC's ongoing role in project approval, as well as the Government Private Sector
Forum. The legal transparency component's websites will be readily observable by concemed
staff. This monitoring data is expected to feed into group performance targets under MBPI.

4. Sustainability

The sustainability o f the technical capacity financed by the project will depend on (a) the
government's political will to enforce policies supported by the project through positive and
negative incentives; (b) the ability to finance, after the project, maintenance o f the investments.
Positive and negative incentives to maintain policies will be established through govemment's
policy messages, enforced by sanctions placed on civil servants who violate policies, appropriate
performance-based      remuneration and promotion o f staff who promote policies.                                   This will

require intensive, ongoing policy dialogue with and within government, a robust monitoring
system whose results are available to the public, and donor collaboration.                           Financial
sustainability o f technology investments will be assured through a WTO-compatible fee on a
per-shipment basis sufficient to finance maintenance and salary incentives.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economicand financial analyses(See Annex 9)

The Cambodia Trade Facilitation and Competitiveness Project supports four components whose common
attributes are the use o f transparency, predictability, competition and market standards to improve the
ability o f the private sector to make economic decisions and to conduct transactions. Some benefits o f
improved confidence cannot be readily quantified. Examples o f such benefits are:


Trade Facilitation          Reduced smuggling, more competitive trade partner, reduced management time.
Export Market Access Fund  Job creation, value added, export revenue and tax collection from new exporters.
PPI                         Increased PPI volume, higher quality of projects, impact of improved infrastructure.
Investment Promotion        Improved confidence in Cambodia as a destination for foreign direct investment.
Legal Transparency          Better economic decision making through better understanding of laws.

However, it i s possible to justify the project on economic and financial terms if (a) society as a whole
achieves a net economic gain from the project, excluding fiscal transfers, and (b) the project generates
                            -                ~        "        ,
fiscal revenues that are higher than the project costs in discounted terms.

Survey, to 3.25 days by year 4. Global average
monetary impact o f time savings is equal to the value o f 0.5% o f imports according to OECD
calculations. Since other donors and officials are involved trade facilitation efforts, we only assume that
20% o f the benefits deriving from faster clearance can be attributed to the project. By projecting trade
volumes conservatively, the investment costs, user fees, volume o f imports and the gradual introduction
o ftime savings, a cost-benefit stream i s projectedwith an ERR o f 216%.

Financial analysis. The financial analysis estimates the incremental increase in the taxes on imports that
would result from the project. The provisions o f the project (technology, streamlining, performance-
based remuneration, decreased opportunities for discretion) are assumed to change incentives facing
traders and public officials in favor o f compliance with agreed tariff schedules and a shift from unofficial
costs to official revenue (including the collection o f customs duties, excise taxes and penalties, but
excluding VAT). This increase from the current baseline i s expected to be 2% per year, stabilizing at
10%. 25% o f this gain is attributedto the project. The IRR is 144%.

2. Technical

The project is expected to be technically viable. Asycuda, a software system developed by UNCTAD
essentially for developing countries, and the electronic Single Window are technically proven. The key
technological risk is the integration of ASYCUDA with the Single Window, which has been investigated
and found to be viable. Substantial investment by other donors is supporting technical capacity. Other
technologies applied to the project, such as websites, are mature.

3. Fiduciary




                                                          15

Fiduciary risks are considered to be high due to high country fiduciary risk coupled with the lack o f an
adequate project financial management system in place, inadequate capacities and experiences o f the
agency and executing units in project financial management and the Bank's FM requirements. To ensure
the proposed arrangements are adequate and ready for implementation, an Action Plan was developed in
coordination with Bank Financial Management staff.           The action plan calls for (i)the adoption of
Standard Operating Procedures and a Financial Management Manual, recently prepared by the Ministry
o f Economy and Finance, to the project; ii)assign a team o f staff with qualifications acceptable to the
IDA to be responsible for overall project financial activities with supports from two local experts, hiring
based on qualification and TOR acceptable to the Bank; iii)putting into place an acceptable accounting
software package; and v) training project staff on financial management procedures.

4.  Social

To the extent the project improves core labor standards and competitiveness o f the garment sector, social
risks arising from shedding o fthe largely female garment sector labor force will be mitigated.

5. Environment

7. Policy Exceptions and Readiness

The project results form a substantial policy dialogue arising from the Investment Climate Assessment,
and culminating in a speech provided to the Seizing the Global Opportunity Conference that outlined the
clear commitment to all o f the specific reforms and laws. Due to the substantial legislative agency
requiredby WTO accession, a number o f laws requiredby the project are still in the legislative process.
The key enabling policy decisions are (a) the decision on the future role o f Camcontrol (decision o f
Council o f Ministers pending), (b) the Law on Concessions and implementing sub decree (both drafted,
law at Council o f Ministers) and (c) the Sub decree on Amended Law on Investment (law passed, sub
decree at Council o f Ministers). Decision (a) has been incorporatedas a condition o f negotiation, whereas
(b) and (c) are conditions o f disbursement o f the relevant part o f Component 3.

                CAMBODIA: Cambodia Trade Facilitationand Competitiveness

Background on TradeFacilitation

The design o f the project emerges from a sustained policy dialogue, starting from the Integrated
Framework o f Trade Related Technical Assistance, the Protocol o f WTO Accession, the Investment
Climate Assessment, and subsequent policy dialogue with donors.

1.       IntegratedFramework.

The policy matrix of the Integration and Competitiveness Study (2001) included the following actions:
    0    Support computerization and automation o f procedures and information systems
    0    Clarify roles and responsibilities o f several overlapping agencies involved inborder inspection.
    0    Support professionalization o f officials with appropriate rewards, accountability and recruitment
    0    Support computerization o frelated agencies.

2.       Protocolof WTO Accession

The Working Party Report, paragraph 97 states that "The Representative of Cambodia confirmed.. .
Customs and Excise Department was reviewing all customs clearance procedures and processes with a
view to simplification and modernization, and the application o f risk management techniques.. . H e
expected automation o f the customs clearance process to result in further efficiency gains, and the new
Law on Customs would provide the legislativebasis for this initiative."

3.       InvestmentClimate Assessment.

In February 2004, the World Bank presented to the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) its draft
Investment Climate Assessment, based on a survey o f 502 urban, 200 rural and 100 informal firms
(documents and Aide Memoirs inProject File). Recommendation one (of eight) was as follows:

Reform must start from a cross-agency perspective- rather than in agency silos. Currently, each
agency pursues mandates independently and communication across agencies i s insufficient. Since the
CED and Camcontrol have overlapping approximately the same powers and responsibilities, their
activities should be better integrated or possibly mergedover time.

Set quantifiableperformance goals - and measure progress. Agreement on a set o f regularly tracked
metrics i s proposed, to (1) assess overall performance, (2) compare efficiency across departments and
against competitors, (3) assess staff performance, (4) guide staffing and policy decisions by management,
and (5) improve public relations with respect to process improvement.

Reengineer the Facilitation Process while Introducing a Single Administrative Document, The
current "real" trade facilitation process contains numerous steps that provide little or no value in
facilitating trade and significant opportunities for rent seeking among government agents. As such, basic
process streamlining i s required to drive cost and unnecessary processing time out o f the system by
eliminating "non valued-added'' steps. The reengineering i s designed to support the move from
independent dealing by each concemed agency with a single, rationalized process facing the customer,
which i s the private sector export or importer. Such a process, based on improved information sharing
across agencies, could usefully start with the replacement o f the current multiple documents with Single
Administrative Document shared by all agencies. Initially, streamlining should focus on improving the


                                                        17

manual processes, but at the same time it will pave the way to automation. WTO entry requirements
(valuation standards and the Harmonization System) should be incorporated.

RationalizeRoles and Responsibilities Across RGC Agencies under a Single Window with Flat Fee
for Service and Service Level Agreements To increase efficiency and accountability, trade facilitation
processes should be consolidated into a Single Window. The implementation o f a Single Window i s a
core step to improving overall customer service, reducing opportunities for rent-seeking and addressing
the needs o f the legitimate private sector. The Single Window should consolidate all documentation and
payment processing into a single customer interface for importers and exporters operating in Cambodia.

Introduce a Risk Management System to Reduce the Inspection Rate per Container. Current
discretionary inspections should be replaced by a system by which inspections are selectively inspected
based on risk parameters. The development o f risk parameters would take into consideration historical
performance, and the perspective o f the various agencies involved inthe TF process.

Automatethe Process. To support the successful implementation o f other streamlining initiatives and to
achieve the vast process efficiency improvements the technology has demonstrated, a comprehensive
automation system should be deployed. An overall architecture across key agencies should be developed,
followed by a phased implementationplan.

    HR Management Reform. Although it is unlikely that official salaries will ever match the full
    compensation that customs agents are currently making through official and unofficial payments, it i s
    important to increase compensation to reasonable levels. An effective, comprehensive compensation
    program requires restructuring o f salary scales to increase formal base compensation, restructure
    positiondgrades to provide additional promotion opportunities and development o f a system o f
    tangible performance goals. To pilot new processes and automation within the trade facilitation
    process and to increase customer service, an "elite unit" within Customs should be established.

    Establish a trusted, transparent, dispute settlement mechanism. Cambodia has committed to
    establishing a dispute settlement mechanism within its WTO commitment^.^ The mechanism should
    be independent, autonomous, and to the extent possible, include private sector participation. It should
    focus on specific technical issues such as nomenclature and valuation rulings, which have as their
    base, publicly disseminated information.

4.        Twelve Point Plan: Government Commitments to Improve the Investment Climate and
Trade Facilitation

The Investment Climate Assessment was discussed in a series o f Cabinet-level meetings which resulted in
Prime Minister's Decision No.1212004 dated March 22, 2004, to form a Special Inter-Ministerial Task
Force o n Trade Facilitation and Investment Climate, Chaired by the Minister o f Economy and Finance
and Vice-Chaired by the Minister o f Commerce. The Special Task Force was tasked, among other things,
to improve investment climate and trade facilitation, with the responsibilities as follows:


     0    Raise and put into implementation measures to reduce cash payments o n intermediaries related to
          export-import.
     0    Raise and put into implementation measures to reduce procedures or cancel duplicating
          procedures inthe management o f trade process.
     0    Raise and put into implementation measures to reduce time delays for goods export and import.
     0    Raise and put into implementation all measures that would increase national budget.

The Special Task Force defined an integrated program o f reform to address the most urgent impediments
in trade facilitation and agreed upon a Twelve Point Plan: Government Corninitinelits to Improve the
Investnzeiit Climate and Trade Facilitation. The reform measures agreed establishing a cross-agency
reform team, consolidating inspection mandates across agencies and introducing selective inspections
based o n risk, implementing a Single Administrative Document and Single Window process, automating
information flows across agencies, streaming business registration procedures and recognizing ethical
behavior inthe private sector           - and are to be implemented o n an urgent basis by December 2005.

obiectives. Proqress reports will be provided to the Government-    trade-related             Private   Sector   Development    Steering


5.        Implementingthe Twelve Point Plan

To achieve the objectives o f trade facilitation, the RGC has issued a Decision on the Establishment o f a
Steering Committee for Private Sector Development, Decision No. 46 SSR, dated 11 August 2004. Three
Sub-steering Committees have been established under this Steering Committee relating to Investment
Climate and Private Participation in Infrastructure; Trade Facilitation; and Small to Medium Enterprises.
The Sub-steering Committee on Trade Facilitation, which i s chaired by HE Cham Prasidh, Senior
Ministerand Ministerof Commerce, is tasked with the following responsibilities:

>    Reduce all complex and lengthy processes at ministerial/institutionallevel related to import, export o f

>    companies;
     Abolish duplicated tasks of relevant ministriesiinstitutions in order to install effective examination

>   just inone place;

>    Strengthen the implementation o f "Single Window" mechanism at international gates; and
     Raise necessary measures to serve the enforcement o f laws and regulations on all negative aspects
     that impact business activities.

The Trade Facilitation Committee has had the following achievements since its establishment:

>    A change from separate on-site inspections by Customs and Camcontrol to joint simultaneous on-site
     inspections from September 1,2004 where only one joint inspection document i s used.
9 From September 1, 2004 onwards: Issuance by the Ministryof Industry,Mines and Energy (MIME)
     Certificate of Processing, Certificate o f Origin by Ministry o f Commerce (MOC), Visa on
     Commercial Invoice and Export License are done based on joint inspection documentation of
     Customs and Camcontrol. After issuance o f these documents, officers of MIME and M O C undertake

>   post-export inspection. This replaces pre-shipment inspectionby MIME.
     The RGC has offered to establish a joint Customs-Camcontrol Focal Point/Office on a permanent
     basis in Garment factories with greater than 2,000 employees to facilitate and speed up the inspection
     and clearance process.




                                                                   21

>   The number o f steps in the procedure and processing application for Certificate o f Origin, Visa on
    Commercial Invoice or Export License at MOC has been reduced from 11 steps to 8 steps since May
    12, 2004. The processing time for issuance o f application for Visa on Commercial Invoice, Certificate
    of Origin and Export license was reduced from 16 business hours (March 2002) to 12 business hours
    from M a y 12, 2004.
3 A strategic review of Camcontrol has been completed and recommendations currently under
    consideration by the RGC.

With respect to a risk management strategy for inspection and clearance o f goods, the Government's
Rectangular Strategy states: "Inthe area o f revenue collection by the Customs and Excise Department, the
Ministry o f Economy and Finance will: "Implement forceful strategies andriskmanagement principles to
reduce smuggling and illegal activities along borders. Strengthen the legal framework based on new
customs law and its strict implementation including the development o f policy on customs and excise,
formulating guidelines on customs procedure; and training officials.         Promote computerization o f
Customs and Excise Department. and develop short term measures to implement a customs automating
program including a legal framework, and procedures related to training and project formulation." (p 78)
AusAID has established a training program for senior officials, designed to result in a risk management
strategy.

Customs and Excise Department Modernization Strategy

The CED has established a Work Programs on Reform and Modemization of Cambodia and Customs
2003-2008. Key areas o f the work plan include:

>   Strengthening o f the Legal Framework: A draft law on Customs has been prepared and i s currently
    with the Council of Ministers. Implementingregulations are being finalized. Policy and Procedures
    Operating Guidelines and under preparation for dissemination to Customs Officials and industry.
3 Tariff Restructuring.
3 Modernization and Simplification of Customs Procedures: This includes pre-shipment inspection to
    be phased out by 2007 and includes the introduction o f a risk management system in 2005. Customs
    have recently implemented an intelligence unit inthis regard.
3 Valuation and Post-Clearance Audit
3 Information Technology Systems and Automation
3 Improving Service and Trade Facilitation: This will include introduction of a dispute settlement
    mechanism.

The IMFprovided technical support to help implement the Work Program, and JICA has aresident expert
inthe CED to buildcapacity and support implementation.

 Background on Export Diversification (Component 2)

 Along with trade facilitation issues addressed in component 1, access to markets and information on these
 markets are among key constraints to Cambodia's export diversification. For Cambodian firms, including
 those garment firms involved in subcontracting arrangements who want to be arms-length and
 independent exporters, finding and cultivating export markets involves significant investments -and
 often up-front investments - not only in financial terms but also in terms o f skilled and scarce
 managerial resources. A highly trained marketing staff i s required to obtain information and understand
 the needs of the market. A skilled technical workforce i s required to translate the market needs into
 appropriate production and quality assurance processes. These activities are information intensive and
 often require years o f understanding the market, and have to be undertaken in an environment where
 f i r m s already have to cope with existing problems such as poor infrastructure, inadequately trained work
 force, delays in securing inputs, complying with procedural requirements o f customs and Camcontrol,
 and accessing credit from an inefficient banking systems.

                               TUNISIA  EXPORT    MARKET   ACCESS    FUND-EMAFTUNISIA
 T h e creation of export market access fund (F;IL\IES)     in ;ipril 2000 marks an important shift of focus of export
 promotion efforts: away from a TPO model led by tlie government, to a public-private sector participative approach. I t s
 emphasis i s on iiidividual exporters and their associations, realizing that firms compete a n d not nations: it helps
 individual firms implement a systematic strategy to enter, sustain and expand export markets. T h e fund lias been set up
 by CEPE1 (the export promotion agency under the SLinistiy of Commerce) through Bank assistance, under private
 management coiisisting of international and local experts. I t encourages firms, especially S V E s , to enter export market
 by covering oii a temporary basis up to 50% of the cost of consultant services and by providing teclinical assistance.
 Services are offered by local consulting industry a n d international experts in collaboration v d i local consultants in
 response to private firms demand. Through i t s 5 years life, tlie F;lhlEX has assisted 700 firms to become exporters,
 export n e w products and services or enter n e w markets. Initial estimates indicate that each $1of ESL1F assistance lias
 generated m o r e than $20 of additional exports. ;irecent survey lias also indicated that 60% of firms that benefited from
 ELLIF assistance are now willing to pay full market price for export services. In addition, a small export consulting
1indust? has been created around tlie program wliicli can b e considered tlie m o s t important accomplishment of ELLIF
 Tunisia.


 International experience suggests that the relaxation o f the information constraint and market access
 bottlenecks faced by firms would create scope for further product and market diversification and that the
 benefits normally go beyond the exporting firm. Information spillovers arise on the exporter side, as
 export activities generate a better understanding o f how foreign markets work. Also, the export success o f
 a firm may generate demonstration effects for other firms, which become aware o f potential opportunities
 in foreign markets. In addition, exporters acquire valuable information regarding the functioning of
 customs administrations, foreign consumer tastes, shipping procedures and distribution networks, which
 could profitably be usedin future transactions with other countries.

 Resolving the market access constraint i s a challenge in Cambodia because o f the scattered structure o f
 the productive sector.        Small and medium enterprises represent the bulk of existing and potential
 exporters in Cambodia.          In several economic activities, including sectors with good prospects and
 potential for exports, firms do not have the minimum critical size to be competitive and to increase
 exports, This i s the case in the agro-processing sector, comprising o f a small number o f structured firms.
 most o f which o f small size. Consequently, not only small and mediumproducers but also large producers
 do not actively cultivate export markets especially large and sophisticated export markets. They cannot
 afford to add another area of demand on their limited cash flows. Further, they also recognize that their
 small size prevents them from making some o f the up-front investments in developing export markets.
 Even if they are willing, investments in export marketing may not be justifiable because they cannot
 achieve economies o f scale and scope.




                                                             23

The above discussion points out that, if Cambodian producers are to be encouraged to produce for export
markets, mechanisms have to be found to bring the market closer to them. Mechanisms are also required
to alleviate the producer from the burden o f having to undertake most o f the marketing tasks. If market
development, marketing and selling, delivery and logistics management i s addressed, then producers can
focus on the core basis o f competitiveness -low production costs, good quality, highproductivity and a
skilled workforce. The solution i s not necessarily direct government intervention or subsidies but policies
and strategies to actively court institutions and firms that have specialized marketing expertise.

Backgroundon PPI Governance(Component3)

Cambodia's poverty reduction strategy places an important priority on improving delivery o f public
services, which were particularly weakened by years o f conflict and neglect. Because needs are so acute
and resources so limited, we argue that the state should yield a substantial role for delivery o f public
services to the private sector. Because o f its resource constraints, Cambodia has in fact been a center o f
innovation in public-private partnerships for delivery o f services, including health, water, rural electricity
provision, and even the introduction o f labor protection standards linkedto trade. Inthe water sector, the
RGC undertook private participation initiative which involved the use o f competitive, output-based
contracting o f connections to the public water system. The first batch o f four towns using the OBA
approach was procured and the contracts signed by the RGC in March 2004, resulting in an average
reduction in the cost per connection o f 30% compared with the historic cost o f public investments in
similar systems. Local participation i s spread across almost all sectors, suggesting that there i s a local
market to respond at least to some o f the PPI opportunities. In the power sector, for example, there is
local ownership in one o f the independent power producers (Jupiter Power            -  minority Cambodian
shareholding), and among the small-scale power producers that provide about 60 MW o f capacity, largely
financed from their own funds. Inthe water sector, all the small-scale service providers inprovincial and
district towns and rural areas (16 intotal) are locally owned and primarily internally financed.

Increased private participation in infrastructure (PPI) in Cambodia, under an appropriate institutional and
regulatory framework, i s likely to provide opportunities for augmenting budget resources and for
improving efficiency. The benefits o f the latter can be substantial, particularly when accompanied by
pro-competitive reforms (or even monopolistic activities operating under an appropriate regulatory
framework).       Public-private partnerships, including the use o f Build-Operate-and Transfer (BOT)
arrangements or output-based contracting o f private providers o f public services, need to be seen as part
o f a strategy to increase the efficiency o f service delivery. To ensure the best outcomes for Cambodia's
citizens and to support service delivery goals, the Government would need to introduce the principles o f
transparency, competition, accountability and rational design in all transactions with the private sector.

Butthe practice ofprivate participation ininfrastructure inCambodiais frequently characterized by a lack
of competition and transparency, which denies the country the efficiency benefits that are the most
important reason to involve the private sector. Because o f the nature o f public services, most o f these
efficiency gains can only be captured at the point o f transaction. To increase the impact o f the private
sector in delivering infrastructure services, the report focuses on the framework for contracting with the
private sector, and identifies a number o f legal gaps, institutional overlaps, and lack o f clarity at each
stage. The process i s sufficiently "broken" as to require firms to circumvent it to secure transactions - a
process that denies Cambodia most o f the benefits o f private participation. The practice o f PPI, however;
does not reflect many o f these apparent advantages; and in the absence o f an appropriate legal.
institutional, and regulatory framework, many o f the benefits associated with PPIhave not been secured.

In2003, the Government launchedan effort to reform its governance o fpublic-private partnerships using
technical support o f PPIAF, the World Bank and UNIDO. The key objective underlying the PPI
Governance Study was to create an enabling framework for PPI that i s sufficiently flexible to allow for



                                                       L4

unique sectoral requirements in contracting.         A t the same time, the regulatory, procedural, and
institutional framework should be sufficiently robust and inclusive to ensure that all PPI transactions     -
regardless o f the sector, source o f funding or size o f the transaction-are conducted fairly, transparently,
competitively, and in the public interest. Strengthening governance for increased private participation in
infrastructure and public service delivery rests on four principles that are cornerstones o f a sound,
enabling environment for PPI:

3 improvingpredictability via improvements to the legaland institutional framework;
3 assigning clear lines ofresponsibilitywithin institutions;
3 ensuring accountability o f those institutions responsible for applying the procurement processes

>   according to the legal framework; and
    Improving the transparency and openness o f government procurement processes.

Following a year-long effort, the Framework announced in the Investment Climate Assessment and
agreed by Govemment includes the following elements:

PPI Policy. The PPIPolicy sets out the roles and responsibilities o f the various parts o f government with
respect to PPI projects, as well as specific policy proposals for managing the PPI process throughout the
typical PPI project cycle, with various aims to address inter alia several serious concerns with respect to:
the lack o f transparency in the handling of dealings betweenthe public and private sectors particularly in
the selection, negotiation and management o f specific contracts betweengovernment and investors; more
systematic control over the contingent and ongoing liabilities taken on by the public sector under PPI
contracts; and improvements to supervision of the performance o f PPI concessions during project
implementation and operation.

Concession Law and Sub-decree on Concessions. These pieces o f draft legislation embed the key
policy recommendations underlying the draft PPI Policy in the law. Prior to the Bank-supported PPI
Governance Study, UNIDO was commissioned to assist RGC to develop a Law on Concessions, the
intention of which i s to replace the BOT Sub-Decree and to supersede the relevant provisions o f Order
30BB on the Management of State Properties. The RGC asked the Bank team to work with UNIDO to
ensure overall consistency with the approach beingproposed inthe PPI Policy. The effort resultedin:

Policy Guideline Documents,dealing with:

     FinancialManagement of PPI Projects - setting out a range o f policy options and guidelines for
    managing government's fiscal exposure through PPP projects;
     Policy for Dealingwith Unsolicited Bids - setting out guidelines and suggestions for managing the
    trade-offs involved in balancing the advantages o f encouraging private sector initiative to come
     forward with sensible project ideas with the potential loss in transparency and efficiency gains o f a
    well-conceived competitive tender process;
     Contract Design Issues      -  setting out some recommendations for ensuring that contract design i s
    consistent with encouraging private sector participation; the parties responsible for management and
    monitoring are involved incontract negotiation; and that contracts transfer the appropriate risks to the
    private sector, while beingrobust to material changes to the context in which to operate;
    Policy for Contract Publication - setting out some recommendations on how best to make public
    the contractual terms for PPI projects, to maximize transparency and enhance public confidence and
    trust inthe integrity o f the procurement process;
    Policy on Decentralizationof PPI Project Governance setting out some guidance notes on how
                                                                    -
    to ensure that initiatives to improve the PPI governance that are appropriate to the requirements o f
    large national or large provincial-level projects do not have the undesirable side-effect o f suffocating
    small scale infrastructure development.

Capacity building program to implement the new PPI Policy, to be funded under the Project. The
Framework establishes processes for the identification, appraisal, tendering and evaluation o f PPI
projects, as well as the management o f unsolicited bids. Key to the framework i s the distinction drawn
between those entities responsible for sponsoring and promoting PPI projects and those which act as
`checks and balances', monitoring and approvingproposed PPIprojects.

Awareness of the PPIFramework. The level o f awareness o f the PPIGovernance Framework i s mixed.
Some ministries and agencies are preparing for the introduction o f the Framework, for example, the
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has established a unit responsible for PPI while the CDC is
supporting the introduction of the Framework. Other ministries appeared to have little understanding o f
the Framework or their roles under it. No ministry appeared to have a developed strategy for identifying
and developing potential PPIprojects. Instead, most appear to rely on unsolicited approaches.

Access to skills.   Ministries and agencies appear to generally have adequate skills in-house to develop
and appraise the technical aspects of proposed PPI projects. However, all identified weaknesses in
financial analysis and, particularly, legal skill areas. Typically, ministries and agencies have few lawyers
and those they do have are only recently qualified.     The general lack of financial and legal skills and the
limited familiarity with PPI requirements encourages ministries to adopt a passive strategy towards PPI
projects. There i s a strong tendency to wait for the private sector to propose projects on an unsolicited
basis rather than actively developing and tenderingPPI opportunities.

Ministries and agencies have access to extemal legal advisors during negotiations, the costs o f whom are
recovered from payments by the selected private sector contractor. Such an approach i s suitable for
individual transactions but does not assist ministries in the initial phases o f developing suitable projects.
The lack o f legal, and financial, skills among ministries and agencies i s partly due to an overall shortage
o f these skills within Cambodia, particularly among advisors with some familiarity with PPI
requirements. The low salary levels within government service also mean that individuals who have
acquired these skills and experience prefer to leave government employment to work in the private sector.

The limited training and experience with PPI and the lack o f skilled staff at the level o f central ministries
and agencies i s magnified at provincial and municipal level. Levels o f education are generally lower, for
example, high school rather than university graduates, and foreign language abilities much weaker.
Duringdiscussions, emphasis was placed on the need to include municipality and provincial governments
in any capacity building program. Under decentralization measures, these governments will have
responsibility for approving investments o f less than S2 million, which i s likely to represent a substantial
proportion o f all PPIprojects in Cambodia.

Backgroundon Investment Promotion

FIAS has long supported the Government o f Cambodia to introduce the regulatory framework that i s
more conducive to attract foreign investment,which resultedinthe Amendment to the L a w on Investment
in February 2003. The Amended Law on Investment explicitly moves the CIB toward serving as a
facilitative and promotional agency, with many evaluative and regulatory functions replaced by automatic
systems. Inresponse to the request from the Secretary General o f the CDC, FIAS and MIGA organized a
strategic planning workshop in Phnom Penh on March 2-3 2005. At the workshop, participants stressed
the need to strengthen the CIB's capacity to promote, facilitate and retain investment in order to fulfill its
new mandate.      Their focus on capacity building was echoed in the results o f MIGA's institutional
assessment (which preceded the workshop), in which CIB's score was found to be among the lowest for
investment promotion agencies in the region.           The strategy workshop particularly highlighted the

importance o f the following: (a) capacity building to implement the strategy; (b) skill building in
investment promotion; (c) upgrading IT systems.



Background on Legal and Judicial Reform

1. The RGC's avowed Legal and Judicial Reform (LJR) Strategy4outlines seven broad objectives that
are aimed at improving access to, and the quality of, Cambodia's legal andjudicial services. The third o f
these objectives requires the
                 "provision o f better access to legal and judicial information by promoting
                dissemination o f basic legal knowledge through official publications,
                electronic media and information folders and ensuring easy accessibility to all
                legal and juridical information for legal practitioners and any other interested
                party".

2. On its adoption o f the LJR Strategy, the RGC also published a draft Action Plan listing numerous
interventions it would consider implementing in the short-, medium- and long-term to achieve the
strategic LJR objectives.   Following a National Workshop on Legal and Judicial Reform, numerous
intemal RGC deliberations and consultations among senior representatives o f the RGC`s Executive and
Judicial branches, civil society and the intemational community, including the World Bank, a Short- and
Medium-TermAction Plan for LJR (the "Action Plan") was formally adopted by the RGC on November
15, 2004.

3. As the Action Plan makes clear: "The Royal Government i s committed to accelerating the Legal and
Judicial Reform process". Acceleration i s to occur inpart by making "the improvement o f access to legal
and judicial information" an "operational priority" o f the RGC in 2005-2006.            In this respect, the
Government specifically seeks in the near-term"to collect and publishjudicial decisions".

At least inrespect o f Cambodia's commercial law framework, the Ministryo f Commerce continues to do
a remarkable job o f collecting and disseminating on a timely basis (both electronically and in print) all
laws, decrees and sub-decrees dealing with, or touching upon, business activity in Cambodia. For
Ministry o f Commerce purposes, the term "commercial law framework" i s properly given a broad
definition.  Still missing, however, i s the collection and wide dissemination o f the summaries and
judgments o f any, let alone key, commercial cases in the courts o f Cambodia. As a result, Cambodia's
business community, its judicial establishment, the Executive and Legislative branches o f Government,
the Bar o f Cambodia, the Royal School of Magistrates, the Faculty o f Law and other institutions (as well
as the public in general) remain ignorant o f how this commercial law framework i s being interpreted,
applied and enforced.    The Government recognizes it i s time to start the process o f ensuring that this
essential information for the operations o f all commercial activities in Cambodia i s actually provided.

               CAMBODIA: CambodiaTrade Facilitationand Competitiveness


There has been no formal trade facilitation, private sector development, or automation projects financed
by the Bank in Cambodia. There have been a number o f relevant donor-funded technical assistance
projects inthe sector, as well as analytical and advisory work.

The International Monetary Fund provided the Customs and Excise Department with resident technical
assistance for two years in the context o f their Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. This TA
supported the development o f the Customs Law and related sub-decrees, as well as internal reorganization
and reform plans referenced in Annex 10. A major recommendation o f the assistance was the automation
o f customs processing. The IMF supported the development o f bidding documents, and an evaluation o f
alternative providers o f such automation.

A group o f six donors financed the Integrated Framework of Trade Related Technical Assistance (IF).
The IF further found that the major issues with trade facilitation in Cambodia are cross- agency innature,
including CED but also five other agencies operating without clearly distinct mandates and contributing
to substantial delays and high levels of unofficial costs. The Integrated Framework included a number o f
sub-sectoral studies that identified specific technical gaps that would constrain exporters. This has
influenced the design o f Component 2.

Beyond these past studies, the Bank i s working closely with ongoing projects o f donors:

     The European Union's Multilateral Trade Assistance Project (MULTRAP) is a multi-year technical
     assistance project for Cambodia and Lao PDR designed to support capacity to achieve WTO
     compliance. This has included reform o f trade facilitation.

     AusAID's Cambodia-Australia Technical Assistance Facility (CATAF) is providing a range of fast-
     disbursing technical assistance to achieve private sector-led growth. This includes support for the
     development of a risk-management capacity within trade facilitation agencies.

     UNIDO supported the drafting of the Law on Concessions.

     UNCTAD supported the Blue Book, which provides technical advice toward the development o f the
     investment facilitation function.

     The Bank is preparing, for FY06 delivery, a project financing the automation and reform o f public
     expenditure and financial management in Cambodia.

                              Annex 4: Detailed ProjectDescription
               CAMBODIA: Cambodia Trade Facilitation and Competitiveness


Component 1:Trade Facilitation

Sub-Component 1.1($5.95 in). Automation of Custom and TradeRegulatory Agencies.

Unlike most countries throughout the world, Cambodia i s one o f only a small number o f countries
managing its border-related regulatory functions without the benefit o f appropriate Information
Technology (ICT) support. To achieve the project objectives described above it i s critical that
priority attention be paid to identifying and implementing an appropriate suite o f purpose built
ICT solutions that can undertake core border management related functions.

The application o f appropriate ICT to border management activities can significantly streamline
operations, reduce the risk o f errors, improve the level o f transparency and accountability and
facilitate the achievement o f all border related government objectives. The project will ensure the
effective and efficient deployment o f IT in support o f Customs and other border related agency
operations.    Specifically, the project will fund implementation o f new I C T systems and the
establishment o f a community network linked to complementary improvements in operational
procedures and developments in the organization and institutional arrangements addressed under
the trade facilitation component. The sub-component will result in:

     P enhanced control over imports, exports and transit goods;
     4 improvedcontrol ofexemptions, concessions andduty suspension regimes;
     4 reducedcargo clearance times;
     P closer cooperation and rationalization o f activities betweenkey border control agencies;
     4 uniform applicationofborder-related legislation;
     P increasedtransparency, predictability and lower transaction costs for the business sector:
     4 reducedopportunity for inappropriate exercise ofofficial discretion;
     4 enhanced management information;
     4 more efficient revenue collectionand accounting;
     4 more accurate andtimely trade statistics;
     P more effective deployment o f human and technical resources; and
     P More accurate information for risk management and post clearance audit purposes.

Implementation o f the sub-component will proceedthrough two parallel, complementary parts:

Electronic Single Window. The component will finance the development and implementation
o f information technology to integrate and automate the trade regulatory and facilitation functions
o f all key agencies through a shared electronic trade network (tentatively called "CamTradeNet").
This system will allow direct trader input o f Customs declarations and other informationrequired
by the regulatory agencies in an integrated electronic form. It will facilitate the sharing o f this
entered information electronically by the Government, thereby (a) eliminating the need for
multiple, often duplicative requests for information and the associated time and resources; (b)
increasing the speed and accuracy o f the disposition o f regulatory functions, and (c) reducing
opportunities for unofficial charges.

The resultant electronic "single window" for all border processing and clearance related
formalities will make a significant contribution to the achievement o f the government's trade
facilitation objectives by lowering transaction costs and reducing clearance times.        Ensuring


                                                   31

appropriate interconnectivity between core govemment agencies and private sector traders (to
allow direct trader input o f declarations and associated documentation) and banks (to facilitate the
payment o f duties and taxes) i s an essential element o f the sub-component. The Single Window
will integrate, inphases:

         Customs and Excise Department;
         Ministry o f Commerce;
         Camcontrol and its successor;
         The Autonomous Port o f Sihanoukville;
         Dryportsicontainer parks;
         Ministry o fAgriculture, Fisheries and Forestry;
         Ministryo fHealth
         Financial institutions.

Procurement and implementation of UNCTAD's ASYCUDA automated Customs
processing system in the Customs and Excise Department. The system will provide the IT
support necessary to introduce a range o f modem approaches to Customs administration
including risk management and post clearance audit. The ASYCUDA systemhas been deployed
ina number o f countries throughout the world and the latest version of the product is designed to
support selective examinations, trader compliance incentives, effective management o f Customs
clearance, payment schemes to facilitate trade and secure duty and tax collection, and the
production o f more accurate and timely trade statistics.

The Sub-coriiponent willfinance the procurement and effective irnpleinentation of the ASYCUDA
system in Custom iricluding theprovision of appropriate technical assistance to ensure effective
implementation of the systenz and its seamless integration with non-autonzated system and
procedures.    The Sub-coniponent will also finance the developinent and inzplenientation of a
coniiizunity network to provide an electronic Single window' to ensure traders are able to
discharge all their regulatory responsibilities through one gateway.           As a part of this
development, a numbe~of sinal1 agency-spec@              systems will need to be developed and
irnpleinented to ensure all key iniport/export related processes are able to be undertaken
electronically.


Sub-Component 1.2. ($40,000). Building capacity of trade regulatory agencies to adopt modern
border nianagement practices, including selective inspection approaches based on risk
management tools in line with the provisions of the revised Kyoto Convention on the
Simplification and Izarinonization of Customprocedures.

While the Revised Kyoto Convention i s specifically designed to meet the requirements o f a
modem Customs environment, its key principles are equally relevant to all border management
and clearance agencies. The key principles that underpinthe Convention include:

         Improving transparency, accountability and predictability;
         Enhanced cooperation between all border related government agencies;
         Balancing facilitation with control based on risk management;
         Use o f post clearance audit based controls;
         Simplification and standardization inline with internationally agreed standards;
         Cooperation and partnership with the private sector;
         Compliance management and improvement;
         Effective deployment o f ICT.


                                                  32

Modern border management operations imply predictability for private sector operators, and that
procedures should be applied in a uniform manner throughout the country. Under international
best practice, traders must be able to obtain advice from Customs, for example on how goods
should be classified and valued. The sub-component will help build capacity to implement an
advanced ruling system, with the corresponding legislation, procedures, and control mechanisms.
Likewise, the right to appeal against decisions made by border management agencies i s embodied
inthe RevisedKyoto Conventionand current WTO commitments. It is animportant element that
limits the discretionary power of decision makers and increases accountability and transparency.
Another key capability deriving from the Kyoto Convention i s the building o f key `value added'
functions and activities within Customs that are considered essential to the implementation o f
modern risk-based approaches to customs administration, such as the strengthening o f the risk
management capacity throughout the organization; The establishment o f an Intelligence
BrancWUnit with responsibility for the collection, analysis, storage and dissemination o f
information and intelligence; Strengthening o f the post clearance audit capacity; and the
development of a comprehensive compliance managementhmprovement strategy.                 Activities
associated with this sub-component will be closely aligned with the activities o f other donors and
the Private Sector Forum.

     >   The activity will finance ongoing capacity building through the development o f
         international cooperation, including through mutual assistance agreements;
     3 the exchange ofdata;
     P Externalpartnerships, notably interms of training and dissemination of information; and
     3 The preparation and introduction o f sound performance indicators covering all key areas
         o f border management, as well as the design, introduction, monitoring and reporting o f
         client service standards together with a robust system for ongoing performance
         monitoring.

Buildiiig on the work of other donors supporting trade facilitation, the Sub-conzponent will
Jiiiance trainiizg, international cooperation and exchange of information to support:
     P Advance rulings systems for tariffclassificationand valuation;
     P Administrative appeal mechanisms;
     3 Enhancedcooperation at the national, regional and international levels;
     3 SoundPerformance indicators androbust monitoring systems,
     P Client service charters;
     3 Enhancedcapacity for riskmanagement, intelligence, andpost clearance audit; and
     >   Comprehensive compliance managementhmprovement strategy.

Sub-Component 1.3 ($100,000) Implementation arid cross agency integration of appropriate,
merit arid incentive-based human resource management policies arid a Iiumaii resource
development strategy

Recent research undertaken by the World Bank into the long term success o f previous Customs
and trade facilitation projects has highlighted the need for adequate attention to be devoted to
improving a range of supporting HRM policies, procedures and incentive systems. As such the
CTFC project includes a sub-component to address:

     P Recruitment, selection, promotion and advancement
     P Mobility androtation o fofficials
     P HumanResource Development and Training
     3 Remuneration and conditions o fservice
     P Performance managementlstaff appraisal


                                                 33

In line with complementary work beingundertaken by the World Bank and other donors on the
adoption o f merit-based incentive and remuneration schemes (including the Merit Based Pay
Initiative), the project sub-component will focus on the effective integration o f these schemes in
all relevant border management agencies and will ensure the concept o f `merit' adequately
addresses the objective o f trade facilitation. Likewise, where appropriate, the sub-component will
focus on reviewing and redeveloping existing bonus schemes to ensure the incentives provided
through such schemes are aligned with the long term objectives o f the project.

Special attention will be paid to the training and development needs o f Customs and Camcontrol
officials. This will involve the conduct o f a national training needs analysis, the provision o f
advice on the development o f a new and comprehensive national curriculum designed specifically
to meet the current and future needs o f new staff and existing officials who require job-specific
training to adapt to the changing roles and responsibilities they will be expected to perform. The
sub-component will finance the review o f existing practices and the development o f a new human
resource management strategy which will include, at a minimum:

     >   a recruitment component setting out in clear terms the standards expected for
         appointment to relevant agencies including examination results and objective selection
         criteria;
     P a clear set of requirements for selection, transfer and promotion o f staff together with
         robust means o f measuring staff performance;
     3 a remunerationand conditions o f service regime that encourages and adequately rewards
         high performance and the maintenance of a decent standard of living for all officials,
         including the possible development of a flat fee system that removes incentives to
         increase the frequency o f activities that are fee-generating; and
     P A human resource development strategy aligned to the strategic plan and the future
         competency needs o f the GDC.

Sub Component 4. ($60,000). Design and implementation of an Integrity Action Plan

Given the vitally important role Customs. CamControl and other border-related agencies play in
revenue collection, trade facilitation, national security and the protection o f society, it i s
important that a comprehensive integrity/anti-corruption program be developed and implemented.
To assist Customs administrations to establish such programs the World Customs Organization
has prepared the Revised Arusha Declaration on Integrity in Customs. The Declaration consists
o f ten distinct but interrelated elements considered essential to a sustainable anti-corruption and
integrity enhancement program:
     1. Leadership and Commitment
     2. Regulatory Framework
     3. Transparency
     4. Automation
     5.  Reform and Modernization
     6. Audit and Investigation
     7. Code o f Conduct
     8.  Human Resources Management
     9. Morale and Organizational Culture
     10. Relationship with the Private Sector

The Sub-conzponent will finance technical assistance to conduct a self assessmerit and gap
analysis of thepeifornzance of the Custonzs and Excise Department relative to the Revised Arusha
Declaration and the developnzeiit of an Integrity Action Plan based on this assessment.


                                                   34

Component 2: Export Market Access Fund


The Export Market Access Fund complements a number o f ongoing initiatives, particularly the
Intemational Trade Center's National Export Strategy arising from the country's Pro-Poor Trade
Strategy articulated in the PRSP. It will focus extensively on providing technical assistance to
firms and organizations that need to achieve market standards.           Such standards will include
product quality standards, core labor standards, organic product standards, safety or
environmental standards. The main instruments o f the EMAF would consist o f (a) technical
assistance to clients o f the program in the preparation o f their export plan: and (b)
nonreimbursable matching grants (50 percent o f expenditures), payable to beneficiaries o f the
EMAF for eligible activities undertaken withinthe framework of an export plan.

Sub-Component 2.1 ($0.5 million). Teclznical support to the Ministry of Coninzerce's
Department of Export Promotion to establish the exporter technical assistance window. The
component would finance a management team for the Export Market Access Fund, reporting to
the Ministry o f Commerce Department o f Export Promotion. The EMAF management team
would have the responsibility (and would therefore have the relevant skills and experience) to
actively help firms and associations prepare export plans, including support with market research
on export market standards and compliance needs, and coordinate access to sources o f technical
assistance to implement such plans.

Subcomponent 2.2 ($1.6 million). Export Market Access Fund (EMAF). The EMAF would be
a technical assistance matching grant facility that would cover 50% o f the cost o f achieving
market standards, or evidence o f compliance with those standards.                The matching grant,
combined with the applicant's resources, would be used to hire technical support from a pre-
qualified list o f market providers o f the required assistance. In doing this, the EMAF would also
stimulate use o f business and export development services. The EMAF would co-finance: (a)
enterprise diagnostics in view o f developing export plans; and (b) consultant services, acquisition
o f information (including software and reference material), trips by entrepreneurs to explore
specific export opportunities and buyers, mailing o f samples, promotion material, and other
miscellaneous expenses required to implement the export plans. It i s expected that the commitment
o f firms to their projects would be significantly increased by virtue o f their contribution to the cost.
The EMAF would offer its services solely in response to private sector demand on a
nondiscriminatory basis. The EMAF would not co-finance investments, equipment purchase, or
operational costs o f the beneficiary enterprises.

The EMAF i s consistent with the new framework o f the World Trade Organization (WTO). The
grants are nonactionable subsidies as defined in Article 8 o f the Agreement on Subsidies and
Countervailing Measures. They are non-actionable because they are not specific, as provided in
Article 8, paragraph 1 (a): specificity under the WTO rules typically involves a targeting o f
geographic regions or economic sectors and paragraph 2 of Article 8, principally the exception
for research activities carried out on a contract basis for industrial research and for pre-
competitive development activity. In accordance with Article 8.3, WTO would be notified o f the
program. The EMAFwould be subject to a quarterly review.
Based on a partial survey of enterprises conducted during project preparation, at least 100 small
and medium firms producing tradable goods across the country and a few associations are
expected to benefit from an EMAF. The Garment Manufacturers' Association, representingover
200 exporters, is expected to submit an application for $0.2 million per year to co-finance (with
the GMAC, the Government, and labor unions) the Cambodia Better Factories Campaign. Better
Factories engages the Intemational Labor Organization to support Cambodia's adherence to core
labor standards, which are a requirement o f a segment of the market that Cambodia serves.

Component 3: Private Participationin Infrastructure and Investment Promotion

Subconiponent 3.1. ($1.0 dllion) Technical Assistance to Irnplernerit Law on Concessions
(See Annex 5).

The overall objective o f the PPI sub-component o f Component 3 i s to improve the institutional
capacity o f relevant Cambodian government agencies to effectively manage, deliver and
implement PPI transactions that are conducted fairly. transparently, competitively and in the
public interest. The PPIcapacity building program has three related objectives, namely:

    >   Creating a common understanding of the PPI Governance Framework across sectors and
        spheres of government, and o f the roles and responsibilities o f individual institutions;
    3 Equippingline ministries and other contracting authorities with the appropriate capacities
        to design, award and implement PPI projects in the context o f sound sector planning
        strategies;
    3 Enabling the entities that act as checks and balances on PPI processes to function
        effectively.

The key intermediate indicator i s that the revised PPI process articulated in the L a w o n
Concessions and in the Sub-decree o n Implementation o f the L a w o n Concessions (i.e. the
implementing regulations) will be implemented.

The key indicator i s that the L a w and implementing regulations will be enforced, as evidenced
by the RGC having completed all PPI transactions subsequent to the promulgation o f the Law in
full compliance with the revised PPI Govemance Framework (as defined inthe Law)            -  resulting
inimproved PPIdesign, transparent and competitive procurement, and the attainment o fvalue for
money to RGC and consumers o f infrastructure services.

Core training course on general PPI principles and processes. This will provide a basic
understanding o f PPI, agreed terms and definitions and the PPI process. The course will be
delivered at both central and provincialimunicipal level.

Raising awareness of the PPI Governance Framework. This will describe how the Framework
will operate, the legislation implementing the Framework, the role o f each ministry and agency
under the Framework and will be used to disseminate model contracts.

Support to specialized agencies involved in the PPI process.This will focus on helping those
agencies with roles promoting or providing checks and balances on sector ministries developing
PPIprojects.

Support in the identification, preparation and negotiation of pilot PPI projects. This will
provide advisory services to sector ministries at the central level to pursue promising projects. It
will help with the development and documentation o f processes, which can subsequently be
introduced into other ministries and agencies, as well as providing on-the-job training to
ministries involved in the pilot projects. Within each component we have identified high and
secondary priority elements. Those elements designated as high priority are the most important
for the successful implementation of the PPI Governance Framework and should be funded under
the TFCP. They are pre-requisites for the establishment o f a successful program o f pilot PPI
projects, which will provide a means o f testing the framework inpractice and for dissemination o f
the Framework and the benefits o f PPI to stakeholders.

3.2     Investment Promotion ($0.2 million). Teclinical Assistance to inzplemeizt Amended
Law on I nvestment.

The objective o f the o f the Investment Promotion sub-component of Component 3 is to support
the implementation o f the Amended Law on InvestmentRGC through the adoption o f strategies
that streamline and make more predictable and transparent the process o f foreign direct
investment, and that enhance the attractiveness o f Cambodia as an investment destination through
improvements inthe regulatory environment as well as in factor markets.

The introduction o f the Amended Law on Investment and proposed implementingsub-decrees
move CIB away from a regulatory function and towards a more facilitative and promotional role.
The proposed project is to support the implementationo f the Amended LO1by building capacity
within the CIB so that it can assume the role of investment promotion and facilitation more
effectively.

The program consists o f three components:         appointment o f Khmer-speaking consultant to
support implementation; a series o f 5-days training workshops for 15-20 CIB staff on subjects
like investment generation and facilitation; and installationo f IT system.

Khmer-speaking consultant:          to support the Secretaries General o f CDC and CIB in
implementing the action plan.

Stafftrainingworkshops:a series o f workshops would be facilitatedby internationalconsultants
on the fundamentals o f investment promotion, facilitation, and retention. The workshops will
cover understanding private foreign investment flows, image building, investment generation and
investment facilitation.

IT Systems: installation ofhardware and software will be complemented bytraining for the use
and maintenance o f the systems. The systems shall consist o f a website, investor tracking system
and supporting hardware.

The abovementioned program is complemented by other technical assistance programs that are
currently under preparation by FIAS and MIGA. These other areas o f assistance consist of:

Long term technical assistance: appointment o f an internationally experienced long-term
resident advisor for institutional capacity building. The advisor will prepare an initial (12 month)
action plan from the strategic plan developed in the preceding project, and assist with the
implementation o f that action plan, by helping with the organization o f promotional activities,
providing mentoring inputs for staff through on the job training and identifying and coordinating
capacity buildinginputs from other sources.

Administrative procedures: identify and eliminate counterproductive business procedures, and
streamline the necessary regulationsthat remain.

Component4. LegalTransparency Component ($0.4 million)

This Component will assist in financing the collection and electronic publication of final
judgments o f the Supreme Court and o f the Court o f Appeal. It will start as a pilot project in
these courts, with a view to extending such collection and publication to final judgments as well
o f the Municipal and Provincial Courts as quickly as possible.

                                                  37

The Component will finance the establishment and maintenance o f a website within the Ministry
o f Justice o n which these final judgments will be placed in Khmer. A brief synopsis o f these
judgments will also be placed on the site in English and in French. A link will be established
between this site and other relevant websites, including, most importantly, a website containing
all commercial legislation. The transcriptions will be in UNICODE Khmer or some other Khmer
font which, in time, will allow robust, on-line, key word indexing, as well as a sophisticated
search capability. Electronic links will also be made to the law as referred to in the judgments
and, ideally, to an equally searchable site.

In addition, this Component will provide training in utilizing the system for all 120 existing
judges o f Cambodia. Training will take place at the Royal School o f Magistrates in Phnom Penh
ina total of 10 sessions lasting one week each. Each session will have approximately 20 judges
in attendance and each judge will attend two sessions.         The project will cover trainer and
participant expenses o f attending the training.

Finally, this Component will finance the electronic publication of Cambodian commercial
legislation, broadly defined, including all relevant decrees and sub-decrees.

Implementation arrangements will be as follow:

Executing Agency. The Executing Agency on behalf o f the Govemment will be the Ministry o f
Commerce. This i s in accordance with the Prime Minister's Decision No.46 SSR dated 11
August 2004, which named the Sr. Minister of Commerce to lead trade facilitation.                       The
Executing Agency will be responsible for all operational decisions and will be accountable for
project success.

ProjectManagement Units. Five Project Management Units will be established. PMUs will be
established in the Ministry o f Commerce, to implement the Single Window ICT system, the
Customs and Excise Department to implement the Asycuda World software system serving as
back-office software for CED, the Ministry o f Commerce Export Promotion Department to
implement the Market Access Fund, the CDC to implement the PPI capacity building and
investment promotion capacity building, and the Ministry o f Justice to jointly implement the legal
transparency component with the Ministry o f Commerce. Within each PIU, the Govemment will
nominate one official, as described above, to be accountable for implementing the project on a
day-to-day basis, including achievement o f target objectives, preparation o f Terms o f Reference,
guiding consultants and contractors, ensuring sufficient and appropriate counterpart staff, and
referring progress as well as implementationproblems to the Executing Agency. Problems which
cannot be resolved at the level o f the Trade Facilitation Sub-committee will be referred to the
Private Sector Development Steering Committee. Each P M U will provide a brief monthly report
to the ExecutingAgency including operational progress as well as financial disbursements.

             Annex 7: FinancialManagement and Disbursement Arrangements
               CAMBODIA: Cambodia Trade Facilitationand Competitiveness


Summary of the FinancialManagementAssessment

The review o f financial management arrangements for the project was carried out in January
2005. The assessment concluded that the risk was considered to be high due to high country
fiduciary risk coupled with lack o f adequate project financial management system in place,
inadequate capacities and experiences o f the agency and executing units in project financial
management and the Bank's FMrequirements.

Country Issues and Risk Analysis. The Country Fiduciary Assessment CFAA was carried out in
M a y 2003 and it was noted that the overall country fiduciary risk in Cambodia i s considered to be
high. In spite of the multiplicity of controls and the centralized nature of the Public Expenditure
Management (PEM) system, weak financial management practices pose serious fiduciary risks.
The fundamental problems result from a weak control environment, severe weaknesses in
National Treasury (NT) operations, especially in the area o f cash management, inadequacies in
the public accounting system, and weak intemal and extemal auditing capacity. These problems
are so serious that the Govemment's budget and reporting systems cannot be relied upon to
expend resources in an accountable manner. The system i s cash based and most receipts and
almost all payments do not pass through bank accounts. These systemic weaknesses thus raise
concerns about fiduciary malfeasance and create the potential for misuse o f funds or corruption.

In order to mitigate the risk and to ensure that the project would have the adequate system in
place before project starts, the agency needs to establish an appropriate financial management
system for the project with adequate number o f skilled staffs. The capacity in project financial
management and reporting to meet the Bank's requirements need to be established and
strengthened. Training needs to be provided to staff responsible for the project.

Financial Management Arrangements. The project financial management arrangements will
include the following features:

Implementing Entitv. A reform team will be set up within the Ministry o f Commerce (MOC) to
coordinate overall implementation of the four components and responsible for overall project
management including procurement, financial management and disbursement.

Funds Flow. All disbursements for the four components will be managed by the reform team.
Disbursement of the Grant proceeds will be made through direct payment from grant account for
major consultant contracts, goods and from a Special Account for small payments i.e. local
consultants, sub grants, training and workshop with reimbursements made based on full
documentation or against Statement o f Expenditure (SOE) depending on procurement prior
review threshold.

Staffing. Currently, there are totally 38 officials in accounting department o f Ministry o f
Commerce to handle accounting, budget, finance and procurement. Staff education background i s
mostly bachelor degree in accounting but English proficiency i s low.           Four o f them were
nominated to be responsible for accounting (2) and disbursements (2). Since the proposed staff
lack o f experience in the Bank's procedures and requirements, there i s a need to hire two local
consultants to support the team: one in accounting, another in disbursement and financial
functions. The TOR and the process o f recruitment o f the two consultants are required to be


                                                 42

agreed and acceptable to the Bank. The reform team's capacity will be strengthened to ensure that
staff has adequate skills to implement and monitor the financial management activities.

Accounting Procedures. Recently the Ministry o f Finance has uniformed project management
procedures and issued three standard manuals to be adopted for all external fund projects in
Cambodia. Those manuals include 1) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), 2) Project Financial
Management Manual (FMM) and 3) Project Procurement Manual (PMM). As for the financial
and accountingprocedures for the project, the standard FMM, which elaborated procedures, shall
be adopted. The staff assigned and the consultants selected to work on project should be familiar
with the manuals and the project's reportingrequirements.

The current accounting activities are mainly related to maintaining budget records according to
budget line item. The role o f payment processing and payments still rest with National Treasury.
The unit has no capacity to deal with bank accounts, disbursement and payment processing. The
computers have been used to keep simple records and facilitate reports with four sets o f
computers available.

Audit arrangement. An independent auditor acceptable to the Bank shall be appointed to audit the
annual financial statements according the TOR acceptable to IDA.

Reporting and Monitoring. The project shall provide the Bank with regular reports on fiduciary
aspects including annual financial statements and Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The
reporting system will be in accordance with the Financial Monitoring reports; Guideline to
Borrowers issuedon November 30,2001.

The FMR reports shall include: (1) Discussion o f Project Progress, (2) a Balance Sheet (3)
Sources and Uses o f Funds Statement (4) Uses o f Funds by Project Expenditures (5) Output
Monitoring Report and (6) Procurement Report. The formats will be agreed at Negotiation. The
chart o f accounts and the reporting module of the accounting package will be customized
appropriately to facilitate the reporting needs. The reports are required to be submitted quarterly
to IDA within 45 days after the end o f each quarter.

The annual financial statements are required to be submitted annually within 6 months after the
end o f fiscal year. The format o f annual financial statements will be agreed before the first audit.

Action Plan

To ensure the proposed arrangements are adequate and ready for implementation, the following
actions should be taken before project starts. Those include i)apply and adopt the SOP, FMM to
the project; ii)assign a team o f staffs with qualifications acceptable to the IDA to be responsible
for overall project financial activities with supports from 2 local experts, hiring based on
qualification and TOR acceptable to the Bank; iii)putting into place an acceptable accounting
software package; and v) training project staffs on the Bank's requirement and project financial
management procedures.

               CAMBODIA: CambodiaTrade Facilitation and Competitiveness

A. General

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general description o f various
items under different expenditure categories are described below.        For each contract to be
financed by the Loadcredit, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods,
the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are
agreed between the Borrower and the Bank project team in the Procurement Plan. The
Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.

Procurement of Goods (US$5,800,000): Goods procuredunder this project shall be one package
o f hardware and software installation o f a cross agency trade network to be procured through
International Competitive Bidding procedures using the Bank's Standard Bidding Document             -
Supply and Installation o f Information Systems (Two-Stage Bidding). Procurement o f Automated
System for Custom Data (ASYCUDA) would be procured by Direct Contracting to UNCTAD,
with Bank's prior agreement.      Hardware such as computer and accessories to be used for
development o f website estimated to cost less than $5,000 shall be procured through shopping
procedures. Licensed or proprietary software may be procured through Direct Contracting with
Bank's prior agreement.

Selection of Consultants (US$2,250,000): Consulting services for all four components including
audit and advertising, and survey execution services and staff for the PIU would be procured
through: (a) Quality- and Cost - Based Selection (QCBS) method and Selection Based on
Consultants' Qualification (CQS) for firms, and (b) Selection o f Individual o f Consultant (IC).

Sub-Grants (US$1,600,000): Matching grant paying 50% o f cost o f provision o f technical
assistance to exporters. Average size of grantifinn i s $20,000 and estimated 80 firms. Project
Implementation Manual will be prepared by the P N .

Training, workshop and incremental operating expenses [US$lOO,OOO]:             Training, workshop
and incremental operating expenses would be procured using the procedures acceptable to the
Bank with due consideration to quality, efficiency and cost-effectiveness.


B. Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement

Procurement activities will be carried out by the Project Coordination Unit established within the
Reform Team in the Ministry of Commerce. The procurement unit in the Accounting Department
i s staffed by 5 existing procurement officers (two o f them are tentatively selected to assist in the
project) and an additional local procurement staff with Bank's procurement experience will be
recruited to work in the P I U for 36 months. Procurement will follow the Bank's Guidelines for
both Goods and Consulting Services. Standard Bidding Documents for Supply and Installation o f
Information System will be used.




                                                 45

An assessment o f the capacity o f the Reform Team to implement procurement actions for the
project has been carried out by Ms. Oithip Mongkolsawat              o n January 5: 2005.    The
organizational structure for implementing the project was not yet established at the time o f the
assessment but the mission assessed the Accounting Department o f the Ministry o f Commerce.

Most o f the issuesirisks concerning the procurement component for implementation o f the project
have been identified in the Procurement Capacity Assessment Report (available in the project
file) and included lack o f Bank's procurement experience o f the existing procurement staff. The
corrective measure which i s to recruit a local consultant with Bank's procurement experience to
work in the PIU for 36 moths was agreed and reflected inthe procurement plan.

The overall project risk for procurement i s HIGH

C. ProcurementPlan

The Borrower developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation which provides the
basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the Borrower and the
Project Team at Appraisal and i s available in SAP. It will also be available in the Project's
database and in the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement
with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs
and improvements in institutional capacity.

 D. Frequency of ProcurementSupervision

In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity
assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended three times a year for the first year
and later o n twice a year supervision missions and post review.

                                   Annex 9: Economic and FinancialAnalysis
                      CAMBODIA: CambodiaTrade Facilitation and Competitiveness

 The objectives and components o f the Trade Facilitation and Competitiveness Project are united by the
 use o f transparency, competition and market standards to support private-led growth in Cambodia. Many
 benefits o f the project cannot be readily quantified. Examples o f such benefits are:


 Trade Facilitation                  Reduced smuggling, better valuation, lower unofficial costs, reduced management time
 Export Market Access Fund           Export revenue and tax collection, job creation
 PPI                                 Increased PPI volume, higher quality of projects, impact of improved infrastructure
1Investment Promotion                lmrxoved confidence in Cambodia as a destination for foreian direct investment
 Legal Transparency                 IBetter economic decisionmaking through better understanding of laws.

 However, i t i s possible to justify the project on economic and financial terms if (a) society as a whole
 achieves a net economic gain from the project, excluding fiscal transfers, and (b) the project generates
 fiscal revenues that are higher than the project costs in discounted terms. The attached analysis indicates
 that the project i s justified using a small subset o f the expected benefits.

 Economic Analysis

 The Economic Analysis i s based on one expected benefit, the reduction of time required to clear imports.
 The expected reduction o f time over the course of the project i s a 50% reduction from 6.5 days as
 determined through the Investment Climate Survey, to 3.25 days by year 4.                            As indicated in the
 monitoring table, this will take place gradually over the course o f four years. According to a quantitative
 analysis o f historical data by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), each
 day saved on average results in an economic gain equal to the value o f 0.5% o f imports. By projecting
 the investment costs, user fees, import volume and gradual introduction o f time savings, a cost-benefit
 stream i s projected. A model o f GDP and trade growth i s constructed using the provided assumptions.
 GDP growth i s projected at 4%, and the import to GDP ratio is held constant at 58% (to be conservative,
 although the rate has increased over time). The value per declaration i s held constant at $42,800.

 A number o f donors and government officials are involved trade facilitation efforts, and there is a natural
 process o f institutional improvement that we expect to take place in Cambodia. Therefore, we only
 assume that 20% o f the benefits deriving from faster clearance can be attributed to the project.

 Financial analysis

 The financial analysis estimates the increase in the taxes on imports that would result from the project,
 and compares them with taxes that would have been collected under the status quo. The project i s
 assumed to have a positive impact on official revenues because it changes the incentives facing traders
 and public officials in favor o f compliance with agreed tariff schedules. I t makes compliance easier, since
 the previous array o f officials and agencies would be replaced by an online system requiring single entry
 o f required information, introducing performance-based remuneration, and decreasing opportunities for
 discretion, direct interface, and corruption. Coupled with public messages and enforcement actions, the
 net result i s expected to be a gradual increase in official revenues.

 The expected rate of growth of revenues (including the collection o f customs duties, excise taxes and
 penalties, but excluding VAT) i s two percent per year over five years, stabilizing at a ten percent increase
 in public revenues. 25% is attributed to the project (Prime Minister's messages, other donors, CED).
