"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Trade Facilitation and\n            Competitiveness Project for Cambodia were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was significant, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the higher risk can sometimes produce higher\n            return; the success of customs automation has led to\n            systemic and institutional changes in the way customs\n            clearance is operated. IT may be a good tool for\n            institutional and structural changes. It can bring about a\n            more transparent and predictable way of conducting\n            transactions which can lead to growth of trade and of the\n            economy. The crucially important factor in this success was\n            the strong ground team, with close and frequent exchanges\n            with the client. The Bank may not want to implement the same\n            type of project in a country where there isn't such a\n            strong field presence. This kind of customs\n            automation/modernization project serves and supports the\n            backbone of the private sector, and Cambodia's national\n            poverty reduction strategy emphases that the private sector\n            is the engine of economic growth. The project responded well\n            to that. It may be useful for other LDCs to learn from that\n            approach. Another lesson was learned when stakeholders in\n            this project accused the Bank of excessive rigidity in its\n            management of procurement, resulting several times in the\n            rejection of all bids. In such cases rebidding delayed\n            implementation by 6-12 months, which has been costly to the Government."}, "docdt": "2012-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
