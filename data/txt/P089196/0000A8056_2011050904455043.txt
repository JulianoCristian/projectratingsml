                         The Project Development Objective is to promote economic growth by reducing transaction costs associated with trade and investment, introducing
                         transparency in investment processes, and facilitating access of enterprises to export markets.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         1 – The mission noted continued progress by the General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE) to strengthen the existing ASYCUDA Customs Automation system and
                         prepare for the implementation of the next phase (rolling out to other sites).

                         implementation period (since the initial costs reflect the costs of setting up processes and learning how to operate them) and simplify approval processes – should address those
                         concerns, b). It was noted that the transition process toward a self-sustaining Better Factory Cambodia (BFC) has been postponed as the Government's concerns about risks

                         involved with the transition process, and the need for BFC to retain its full credibility with the industry. The uncertainty related to the closure of TFCP in one year was also discussed.
                         3 - No progress has been made with respect to Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI). It had been agreed to proceed with training on the Law on Concessions to support the
                         preparation of a sub-decree and enable the piloting of transactions. While training has been delivered, no PPI transaction has been piloted and this part of the project development
                         objective is unlikely to be met. But it was encouraging by the finalization of the Foreign Investor Perception Survey and progress toward launching the Investor Tracking System at the
                         Cambodia Investment Board.
                         4 - Finally, progress on legal transparency, the project's fourth component, has been limited. While the websites of the Ministry of Justice and of the Supreme Court are up and
                         running, and significant resources have been devoted to training officials, the volume and usefulness of information available on those websites fall short of expectations. Another
                         activity, the mobilization of the ICT Advisor to support the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) in (i) the automation of the application processes for Certificates of Origins (CO) and (ii)
                         creating a Trade Information Website, has been slow.
