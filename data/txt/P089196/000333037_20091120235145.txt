           Project Paper Supporting the Restructuring o f the Grant H165-KH

 I.      Introduction

 1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to introduce the
 following changes in the Cambodia Trade Facilitation and Competitiveness Project: IDA Grant
 No.HI 65-KH, PO89196 and accompanying amendments to the project's legal documents.

2.       The proposed restructuring would mainly reallocate resources from the sub-
 component on the electronic Single Window (US$3.6 million) to (i) further extension of the
                                                                        a
customs automated system; (ii)    automation of Certificates of Origin (C/O)issuance; and (i)    ii
creation of a Trade Information Website (TIN`). Early during project implementation, the
Government indicated i t s decision not to proceed with the institutional model initially envisaged
for the creation o f a Single Window. However, it remained committed to offering much o f the
functionality initially envisaged under such a Single Window, building o n the platform o f the
customs automated system supported by the TFCP (the Automated System for Customs Data, or
ASYCUDA). The proposed restructuring supports this new approach through redeploying
resources that will support further deployment o f the customs automated system (US$2.5
million), the automation o f C/O (one o f the critical trade-related processes, especially for the
garment industry, US$0.2 million), and the dissemination o f trade-related information o n a new
T I W (US$0.7 million). Other resources are being redeployed t o continue support to trade-related
labor standards in the garment industries ("Better Factories Cambodia") and additional training.

3.       The proposed restructuring would not affect the Project Development Objective
(PDO). The combination o f the extended Customs automated system, the automation o f C/O
processes, and the TlW will create much o f the practical functionality o f the Single Window,
hence assist in establishing the necessary foundations upon which the Single Window could
ultimately be achieved, while at the same time delivering meaningful benefits for the trading
community. Hence these activities contribute to achieve the original PDO, albeit at a different
pace and with a different institutional setup than with the original concept o f a Single Window.
However, the reformulation (and more focused scope) o f the main indicators used to measure the
PDO, as well as several o f the project indicators, i s deemed necessary to better monitor project
implementation and impact and to better align indicators with project outputs and activities. The
reformulation will also require an extension o f the closing date f r o m December 1, 2009 to June 1,
2012 to allow for adequate time to successfully complete the activities covered by the
restructuring.

1.      Background and Reasons for Restructuring

Project status and performance to date

4.         The project was approved by the Board on June 2, 2005, and became effective on
 December 12, 2005. The total IDA Grant amounts to SDR 6.62 m i l l i o n (US$lO.O million), o f
 which SDR 2.61 m i l l i o n has been disbursed to date (excluding the Designated Account Balance).
 The original project objective i s to promote economic growth by reducing transaction costs
 associated with trade and investment, introducing transparency in investment processes, and
facilitating access o enterprises to export markets. The project comprises four components: (i)
                     f
trade facilitation; ( i export market access h d ; ( i )
                     i)                                  i iprivate participation in infrastructure and
investment promotion; and (iv) legal transparency.

 5.        T h e most recent supervision (October 2009) concluded that progress was
 satisfactory along the four components. Key concerns have continued to be focused on
 achievement o f the ambitions envisaged under the initial single window concept. Early in project
implementation, the Government decided not to proceed with the original design o f the Electronic
 Single Window. Initial project implementation was also slow given the project's complexity.
However, the mid-term review (May 2008) o f the TFCP found overall encouraging progress o n
customs automation (component 1) and risk management (with support from the Japan
International Cooperation Agency and Australian Aid), in particular with the launch o f
A S Y C U D A at the Port o f Sihanoukville o n M a y 1, 2008. The mid-term review concluded that the
PDO and i t s outcomes remained relevant and a minor restructuring was agreed to lay the ground
for this proposed restructuring. The minor restructuring, effective in August 2008, consisted o f a
reallocation: (i) conduct a Trade Information Website (TIW) / M o C automation masterplan
                    to
                                          i)
plan study under Component 1; and ( ito further support Better Factory Cambodia (BFC) under
Component 2. After this minor restructuring, in March 2009, and given concerns about the long
t e r m sustainability o f the customs automated system as implemented, the General Department of
Customs and Excise (GDCE) requested Bank support to undertake a detailed review o f
A S Y C U D A implementation: concerns about implementation quality have since been largely
addressed and a baseline evaluation has been conducted in October 2009, the conclusions and
lessons o f which feed into the rationale for this restructuring.

Rationalefor restructuring

 6.       T h e rationale f o r the restructuring i s to reflect lessons learned f r o m initial
 implementation and to better reflect m o r e realistic and achievable ambitions f o r t h e
 project. One o f the major goals o f the project was to reduce the time and transaction costs
 associated with complying with import and export regulations and controls. Among a number of
 activities identified toward this objective was to be the introduction o f a "single window" facility
t o integrate and automate regulatory functions o f 6 ministries and agencies, as well as ports and
 financial institutions, through a shared electronic trade network. The expectation was that this
would eliminate duplication, increase speed and accuracy o f the clearance process and reduce
opportunities for rent seeking. W h i l e the original implementation plan envisaged some phasing in
o f the single window, there was n o explicit plan for immediately building stakeholder
commitment at the agency, sub-agency and individual level, leaving the risk o f poor adoption and
undermining o f the technology unaddressed. Initial implementation activities identified a number
o f institutional and environmental constraints that made the achievement o f such an ambitious
strategy unrealistic and it was agreed that a more gradual approach, building o n upgrading
existing and planned systems (computerizing them, simplifying them, making them more
transparent), would have more chances o f success and would be more sustainable in the medium
term, while at the same time malung a meaningful contribution to the ultimate achievement o f the
full single window if and when the constraints could be overcome.

7.       T h e restructuring builds o n some initial success in ASYCUDA implementation.
Indeed, Customs automation, through the implementation o f the A S Y C U D A system, i s n o w
operational at the Port o f Sihanoukville (accounting for more than 40% o f import declarations)
and i s expected t o be implemented in the Phnom Penh International Airport and Phnom Penh dry
ports by the end o f 2009 (accounting for a further 25% o f import declarations). The system has
also facilitated the initial implementation o f the RGC's risk management strategy and has sharply
reduced the number o f containers physically inspected from almost 100 percent at the time o f
project inception to less than 20 percent now. Nevertheless A S Y C U D A implementation falls
short o f the original design, since (i) system will only be implemented in three o f the five
                                         the
locations originally envisaged; (ii)     the system has not been setup as a centralized system
operating through a wide-area network (instead through separate local-area networks); ( i )i ikey

                                                 3
functional modules such as manifest and transit are yet to be enabled and implemented (although
the functional capability has been installed as part o f the ASYCUDA application suite); and (iv)
initial configuration o f the system was based o n a hybrid system.

 8.         Hence the proposed restructuring builds on insights learned from ASYCUDA
implementation - and its challenges - about the management o f such a complex
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) project: (i) lead agency (GDCE)
                                                                         the
needs strong support in project management (including setting up and managing a performance
                                                                        i)
monitoring framework; developing quality control mechanisms); ( i the sustainability o f the
system depends on the I C T capacity o f the recipient (GDCE in the case o f ASYCUDA, especially
i t s latest version, which i s deployed in Cambodia and employs a more advanced technology); ( i )ii
technical design needs to factor in Cambodia's capacity constraints (e.g. the lack o f a cost-
effective solution for a wide-area network until recently); (iv) procurement packaging requires
careful design to allow for the emerging, but weak capacity o f the local ICT industry and the r i s k
o f integrated software / hardware contracts to not deliver value for money; and (v) contract design
requires attention to performance management given the risks o f delays in such complex project.

9.         The proposed restructuring also provides a vehicle for allowing exporters and
importers to acquire information on and better comply with regulations on an incremental
basis. First, the further roll-out o f the customs automated system combined with the automation
o f C/O will contribute to the original goal, since the Royal Government Cambodia intends to
build i t s "single window" around the customs automated system platform. Second, based o n the
review o f A S Y C U D A implementation to date, the proposed restructuring supports the
development o f a more sustainable I T function within the GDCE as w e l l as supporting a stronger
project management and quality assurance capacity, to strengthen the long t e r m sustainability o f
the ambitions articulated in the PDO. Third, the RGC proposes to introduce a "Trade Information
Website" which would provide in a `user friendly' and easily accessible way a l l o f the key
information necessary for importers and exporters to comply with regulatory requirements. The
TJN would also assist Cambodia to comply with changes to GATT Article X currently being
discussed as part o f the WTO Trade Facilitation negotiations, which will l i k e l y require all W T O
members to make all relevant import, export and transit information (including laws, regulations,
procedures, penalties, fees and charges etc) available and easily accessible to the public via
dedicated trade information websites. In addition, the RGC requested that the proposed
restructuring supports continued to BFC, which i s critical at a time o f a severe downturn in the
garment industry.

 10.     The new approach would achieve a similar development objective, at a slower pace
but on a more sustainable basis. The expected result o f this new approach remains a reduction
in documents and time (and, as a corollary, private costs and rents) required to process trade
transactions. Gains would be achieved at a more modest rate that originally proposed (as most o f
the progress would be linked to G D C E and the customs automated system plus one additional
process - C/O issuance -, rather than a Single Window connecting all trade-related processes).
An additional benefit, however, would be that changes that occurred in practices, approaches, and
elimination o f redundancies would have been internalized and would be more sustainable.
Another benefit will be the significant experience gained by GDCE - and the government more
generally - in implementing large-scale ITC projects, a precursor for the Single Window under
the ASEAN framework. The National Single Window Steering Committee established in 2008
will develop the vision for Cambodia's National Single Window, building among other things on
the achievements and experience learned through the activities financed under this component.

11       Proposed Changes

Proposed changes to main outcome indicator and component indicators

 11.     While the overall project development objective (PDO) remains unchanged, the
main indicator has been slightly reformulated to focus on the perceptions o f trading and trade-
related companies (rather than general "investors") and to focus o n the performance o f customs
(rather than the overall trade process which includes variables outside Customs' control). During
restructuring discussions with the RGC, it was also f e l t that some indicators needed
improvements, either because they are not currently measured or n o objective measurement
methodology exists (e.g. response time to investors) or because adjustments in project design
require some changes to better align with project inputs. The proposed revised and sharpened
indicators o f progress are summarized in the table attached in Annex 1.

Proposed changes i n project scope

         1
COMPONENT : TRADEFACILITATION

 12.     The restructuring would shift resources from the original design of the electronic
Single Window to further roll-out of ASYCUDA and automation of C/Os. The project
originally provided for the implementation o f A S Y C U D A in the GDCE, as well as the
implementation o f a Single Window. With restructuring, the Single Window would be dropped.
Component 1 would instead finance a wider and more sustainable rollout o f the Customs
automated system, i t s implementation in a number o f additional sites, i t s networking via secure
communications infrastructure, together with support for the implementation o f the full suite o f
functional modules including, as a priority, the transit and manifest modules. In addition, and as
identified during the mid-term review and strongly reinforced by the in-depth review o f
A S Y C U D A implementation, additional resources will be directed to developing the I C T support
function within the GDCE to ensure long term sustainability o f the project's ICT-related
deliverables. M o r e attention will be paid to project management and quality assurance as well,
including through a more output-based contract and through building GDCE's capacity to
manage this ambitious project. The in-depth review also recommended to: (i)           separate out the
hardware and IT capacity development from the main contract of services for the implementation
o f the customs automated system; and (ii)     strengthen the management capacity o f the National
Project Team under the direction o f the National Project Director. This restructured component
will also include the automation o f certificates o f origin in the Ministry o f Commerce (MoC).

13.      While the restructured project would devote significant resources to improving the
sustainability o f the ASYCUDA system as well as extending i t s deployment to new locations
and increasing i t s technical functionality, the technical assistance contracts to provide this support
would be open to international competitive tendering as opposed t o the previous sole source
arrangements. Such an approach will facilitate closer supervision o f project deliverables by the
client and will mitigate implementation risks significantly. At the same time additional technical
assistance will be provided to the GDCE and the M o C via the complementary multi-donor
financed Trade Development Support Facility to assist the GDCE to develop long term options
for further deployment o f ICT to achieve the Government's trade facilitation objectives.

COMPONENT 2: EXPORT    ACCESS
                  MARKET    FUND

 14.    The Better Factory Cambodia (BFC) project continues to monitor compliance with
                                         n
labor standards in the garment industry. I September 2007, the RGC requested an extension o f
the ILO support until 2010. BFC, with support from the IFC, i s n o w developing a transition

                                                   5
                    shift
     strategy to (i) from i t s original compliance approach to a service (in part fee-based) approach
     o f monitoring, training, and good practice sharing in the area o f work conditions and (ii) shift to
     an independent Cambodian management (without I L O direct support). BFC has reported
     satisfactory progress on the use o f i t s resource envelope (beyond the portion financed by TFCP).
     In this context, i t was agreed to finance an additional $0.5 m i l l i o n (beyond the $0.6m in the
     original procurement plan and the $0.2 m i l l i o n agreed during the minor restructuring and
     disbursed in early 2009).

     COMPONENT 3 : PRIVATE PARTICIPATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVESTMENT (PPI)

      15.                                     N o changes are proposed under the restructuring for Component 3 .

     COMPONENT 4: LEGAL
                      TRANSPARENCY

     16.     This component will include a new activity, the "Trade Information Website" (TIW). T o
    respond to a consistent concern o f the Cambodian Private sector - the lack o f access to trade-
    related information covering, inter alia, regulations, procedures, fee schedules, penalties and
    necessary forms to be used - the T I W will be created, linlung a number o f existing or to be
    created websites (and ensuring their updating) to create an exhaustive collection o f regulations,
    processes, fees, etc for traders. Building o n lessons learned during ASYCUDA implementation,
    the T I W will be part o f the Ministry o f Commerce ICT masterplan to ensure sustainability.

    Cost Comparison with Original Project

   17.     Overall project costs would remain unchanged (in SDR terms) as a result o f the proposed
   modification. However, re-allocation o f financing within component interventions and categories
   are warranted. The summary i s shown hereafter (details are summarized in Annex 2).

19.     Financial Management. The overall financial management (FM) performance i s
considered to be satisfactory. The submissions o f quarterly FMRs and annual audited reports have
been timely. The auditor's opinion o n the financial statements o f the Project for FY 2008 i s
unqualified (clean). The existing FM and disbursement arrangement for the Project will be
continued to operate for the proposed restructure, including f l o w o f funds, Designated Account
and FM procedures, structure and controls.


20.      Disbursement Status and Forward Projection. As o f September 30, 2009, the
cumulative disbursements excluding the outstanding Designated Account advance amount to
SDR2.61 m i l l i o n or 39.5 percent o f total grant o f SDR 6.62 m i l l i o n after almost 4 years o f
implementation. The slow disbursement rate in part reflects that 36 percent o f the total grant (or
SDR 2.3 8 m i l l i o n equivalent) was allocated to the non-implementing activities o n the Single
Window. The proposed restructuring will result in a redistribution o f funds between disbursement
categories and components toward full utilization o f the undisbursed balance within the next two
years (see Annex 2 for details).


21.     Procurement. The International Procurement Agent (PA) will continue to carry out all
procurement under the restructured TFCP, with the exception o f small value and simple
procurement falling below the thresholds agreed between the Bank and Ministry o f Economy and
                                                                        N
Finance, and also excluding any Direct Contracting, Procurement from U Agencies, SingleBole
Source Selection and selection o f NGOs. T o strengthen MoC's capacity to effectively carry out
those procurement not requiring the P A under the restructured TFCP, it has been agreed that the
services o f the international procurement consultant who i s currently being engaged by M o C
under the multi-donor financed Trade Development Support Project, will also be used o n a part-
time/shared basis for the TFCP. Furthermore, the applicable procurement methods have been
revised to meet the needs o f the remaining procurement under the restructured project. This
includes (i) application o f the Bank's latest Procurement and Consultant Guidelines (May
              the
                                   i)
2004, revised October 2006), ( i the addition o f National Competitive Bidding (NCB) as a
permissible method for procurement o f goods accompanied with an NCB-Annex including
reference to the Government's Procurement Sub-decreemanual for Externally financed projects
                                                                  i iharmonizing the thresholds
and stipulating the further N C B improvements required thereto, ( i )
for use o f the various procurement methods consistent with the Government's Procurement Sub-
decreemanual, and (iv) updating IDA'Sreview requirements.

22.     The Good Governance Framework (GGF, Annex 4) had been reviewed as part o f
supervision missions and showed good progress o n all dimensions, including strong leadership by
the MoC. An updated version has been agreed in M a y 2009 to reflect lessons learned with the
TFCP and other projects and i s effective since June 26,2009.

Proposed amendments to the Development Grant Agreement

23.     I t i s proposed to extend the closing date by thirty months from December 1, 2009 to June
1, 2012. This would be the f i r s t extension. The extended closing date reflects a realistic timeframe
to implement the T I W and the r o l l out o f the customs automated system, with other activities
proposed under the restructuring expected to be completed in a shorter time frame.

24.      Other amendments include: (i) revision o f the results indicators (Annex 1); ( i a
                                           a                                                  i)
                                                                                      i ia
revision o f Schedule 1 to reflect the changes in category allocation (Annex 2); and ( i )revision
to the procurement arrangements (Annex 3).

IV. Analysis

Economic and Financial

25.           The proposed approach to trade facilitation will lead t o benefits largely similar to the
originally designed "single window" approach. The roll-out o f the customs automated system will
bring more benefits than originally planned in terms o f customs automation. The automation o f
C/O will bring more limited benefits in terms o f non-customs process automation than the
original design. Finally, the TIW will bring the transparency in information as originally planned.
In addition, the n e w approach, which builds o n the Royal Government o f Cambodia's own initial
experience with customs automation, will be more sustainable, with stronger ownership and much
better attention to I C T and project management capacity. Hence, overall the restructuring will not
significantly alter the basic economic benefits accruing to the project. I t i s expected that that the
measures to facilitate trade would s t i l l ultimately yield reduced smuggling, increased voluntary
compliance with regulations and the tax regime (and reduce the opportunities for rent-talung), and
improve Cambodian trade competiveness, anticipated from the original project design. Hence the
ERR and FRR, originally calculated at 216% and 144% respectively, would be somewhat lower,
but s t i l l very much significant.

Technical, Social and Environmental

26.      Modifications proposed do not alter the social or environmental impact o f the project.

27.    The proposed changes will not change the environmental category and will not trigger
new safeguards policies.

28.      The modifications proposed do not require changes in W o r l d Bank policies.

V. Expected Outcomes

29.      The PDO o f the TFCP remains "to promote economic growth by reducing transaction
costs associated with trade and investment, introducing transparency in investment processes, and
facilitate access o f enterprises to export markets". T h e components' outcome indicators have
been somewhat adjusted to reflect changes in design or lessons learned during initial
implementation about monitoring and evaluation (Annex 1).

VI. Benefits and R i s k s

30.      Benefits o f the restructured project would broadly remain as those anticipated in the
original project design, at a slower pace but o n a more sustainable basis. These include a
significant enhancement in the efficacy and efficiency o f Cambodia's trade regime. This i s a
major contributory factor in the RGC's growth and poverty reduction strategies. The relevance o f
these benefits has become a l l the more apparent as Cambodia i s facing the global economic crisis.
A major transmission channel i s through exports. In a dollarized economy, with l i t t l e flexibility
for adjustment, trade facilitation i s a major instrument for the competitiveness o f existing
industries and for the gradual diversification o f the economic base.

31.     The project PDO would continue to face substantial r i s k s following restructuring. The
experience so far has confirmed the original risk assessment o f substantial risks. The proposed
restructuring would somewhat reduce the risks o f weak political commitment and resistance to
change, since it builds o n a technical and institutional solution developed and owned by the RGC
during the f i r s t phase. The risk o f limited technical and project management capacity has


                                                  8
materialized and will be mitigated in the proposed restructuring by additional support to GDCE to
manage the customs automation project. An additional risk relates to the sustainability o f the
technical solution used for customs automation (in particular to ensure it can be employed as a
component o f the National Single Window) and the technical capacity to operate this system.
Ongoing support through a Multi-Donor Trust Fund on Trade Related Assistance - financed by
DANIDA, the EC, and UNIDO and administered by the Bank - will also help mitigate some o f
the risks through (i)support to institutional capacity development o f the Ministry o f Commerce;
  i)
( i support to the Ministry o f Commerce overall I C T infrastructure and capacity; and ( i )      i ito
assist the GDCE to explore long t e r m options for I C T deployment in support o f trade facilitation.

32.       As originally planned, the restructured project will continue supporting GDCE's efforts
to develop and implement i t s integrity strategy, in support to other projects including the Multi-
Donor Trust Fund on Trade Related Assistance. The cost o f unofficial fees indeed continues to
threaten the achievements o f the project objectives. In the context o f i t s response to the economic
crisis, the RGC has committed to further streamline these fees and processes to help private sector
cope with the difficult external environment and, with resources from the Multi-Donor Trust
Fund and building on synergies with the F C , the Bank team i s supporting the dialog between the
R G C and private sector business associations to diagnose these fees and processes and streamline
them.

      CAMBODIA: TRADE FACILITATIONAND COMPETITIVENESS PROJECT

A.       General

 1.      Procurement for the Restructured Trade Facilitation and Competiveness Project (TFCP)
will be carried out in accordance with the W o r l d Bank`s "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD
Loans and I D A Credits" dated May 2004, revised October 2006 and "Guidelines: Selection and
Employment o Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, revised October 2006.
               f
The general description o f various items under different expenditure categories i s given below.
F o r each contract to be financed by the Project, the procurement methods or consultant selection
methods, the need for prequalification or post-qualification, estimated cost, prior review
requirements and time frame have been agreed between the Recipient and the International
Development Association (IDA) in the Procurement Plan for restructuring. The Procurement Plan
will be updated annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements in institutional capacity.

2.       Procurement o f Goods: Goods procured under this restructured project would primarily
include IT equipment, printed materials, office furniture, and office equipment, as well as further
requirements emerging from an information system that i s currently under development. Goods
estimated to cost the equivalent o f US$lOO,OOO or more per contract shall be procured through
the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) method; and the procedures set forth in the IDA'S
Procurement Guidelines and using the IDA'S applicable Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs),
and Domestic Preference will also be allowed to eligible national bidders. Goods estimated to
cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract may be procured through the National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) method and the procedures set forth in the Sub-Decree 14 on
Promulgating o f the Standard Procedure for Implementing the W o r l d Bank and the Asian
Development Bank Assisted Projects dated February 26, 2007 and relevant provisions o f the
Royal Government o f Cambodia Externally Assisted Project Procurement Manual for Goods,
Works and Services, subject to the improvements listed in the Annex to the Grant Agreement.
Goods estimated to cost less than US$20,000 equivalent per contract may be procured through
the Shopping method and the procedures set forth in the aforesaid Sub-Decree and Procurement
Manual. The methods o f Direct Contracting and Procurement fi-om UN Agencies may be used
subject to the circumstances described respectively in paragraphs 3.6 and 3.9 o f the Procurement
Guidelines.

3.       Procurement o f Works: N o c i v i l work contract i s foreseen under this Restructured
Project.


4.      Selection o f Consultants: Consultant services financed through this restructured project
are expected in the following areas: Capacity building, Development o f the CED IT Support
Capacity and IT Strategic Plan, Pilot Private Participation in Infrastructure Projects etc. Services
requiring hiring o f f i r m s would generally be procured through Quality-and Cost-based Selection
(QCBS) method. However, when consultant firms and non-for-profit organizations are expected
to be included in the same short-list, and if the value o f the contract i s estimated to cost
US$50,000 or more, Quality-Based Selection (QBS) method shall be used. F o r assignments
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract the method Selection Based on
Consultants' Qualifications (CQS) may be used, and for external audit assignments the Least Cost
Selection Method may be used. Services for tasks under circumstances which meet the
requirements o f paragraph 3.10 o f the Consultant Guidelines may, with the IDA'S prior

                                                15
 agreement, be procured through the Single Source Selection method. Services requiring hiring of
 individual consultants may be procured in accordance with the provisions o f Section V o f the
 Consultant Guidelines, whereas Sole Source Selection o f individual consultants may be done only
 with the IDA'Sprior agreement and under the circumstances described in paragraph 5.4 o f the
 Consultant Guidelines. Shortlists o f consultants for consulting services estimated to cost less
 than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants.

 5.      E M A F Matching Grant Sub-Grant: Matching Grant i s expected to finance 50 percent
 o f cost o f provision o f technical assistance to exporters. Some procurement o f goods and
 consulting services have been included in the proposals o f some sub-grantees o f EMAF. The IDA
 and the implementing agency agreed that all procurement using the funds from the EMAF's sub-
 grants are required t o follow the IDA'SProcurement and Consultant Guidelines as stipulated in
the Project's Grant Agreement and also in the EMAF Manual. Since the maximum sub-grant
amount i s only USD25,000, there are n o large value procurement packages foreseen under the
sub-grants, and it i s expected that the procurement o f goods would comprise o f packages less than
USD5,OOO per contract which may be procured through Shopping method in accordance with
paragraph 3.5 o f the Procurement Guidelines, and consultant services are expected to comprise o f
mainly individual consultants, which may be procured through the individual consultant selection
procedures under Section V o f the Consultant Guidelines. All the procurement packages under
the sub-grants shall be subject to IDA'S post review. The IDA informed the implementing
agency, Ministry o f Commerce (MoC), to keep all relevant procurement documents for the
Bank's post review. The procurement arrangement for the sub grant will also be specified in each
sub grant agreement.


B.      Assessment o f the agency's capacity to implement procurement

 6.      The procurement capacity o f the implementing agency MOC was assessed by IDA during
the original project preparation and procurement risk was determined t o be high and it was agreed
that a national procurement consultant would be engaged to strengthen the capacity o f M o C for
carrying out the procurement under the original Project, and the national procurement consultant
was subsequently engaged. For the purpose o f restructuring, the procurement capacity o f M o C
was reviewed again to verify i t s adequacy for carrying out the remaining procurements under the
restructured project that fall below the threshold requiring international procurement agent.
Currently, there i s one government procurement staff assigned to this Project and one national
individual procurement consultant was also engaged as the procurement coordinator and they are
responsible for assisting M o C in carrying out the procurement and serving as the focal point for
coordination and follow-up o f procurement activities between MoC's line agencies which have
activities financed by the TFCP, and the International Procurement Agent (PA), MEF, and the
IDA. Procurement expertise i s s t i l l very much under-developed in Cambodia and there i s a
shortage o f qualified procurement professionals in the country, including in the private sector
where national procurement consultants with adequate s l u l l s and experience in procurement in
general and in W 3 procurement procedures in particular, are not readily available. IDA i s
                   E
engaged at a broader level with the Government to encourage the development and
implementation o f a procurement capacity building program in the country for both the public
and private sector, but this i s a medium t e r m objective. In the meantime, procurement capacity o f
project implementing agencies in many cases continues to r e l y o n external support o f
procurement consultants along with some periodic training o f project staff. Some project
procurement staff as w e l l as national procurement consultants have moved from one project and
organization to another for better prospects and this has adversely affected the implementation
and procurement knowledge-transfer o f some projects. TFCP also experienced the loss o f a
national procurement consultant for a period o f time before the current national procurement
consultant was engaged. The present procurement skills, knowledge and experience o f the current

                                                 16
government staff and also the national procurement consultant under the Project in the application
o f the IDA'S procurement procedures were assessed to be limited and not sufficient for
effectively carrying out the remaining procurement under the restructured Project and the
procurement capacity o f the Project s t i l l remains weak. The quality and timeliness o f procurement
processing can be improved through hrther capacity strengthening to build the procurement
knowledge and skills o f M O C staff for effectively carrying out the remaining procurement under
the restructured procurement in accordance with IDA'Sprocurement procedures, as well as to
strengthen procurement management systems as a whole within MOC.

7.       The assessment has also taken into consideration o f a substantial fiduciary risk associated
with the overall weak governance environment in Cambodia which impacts procurement.
Specific issues are the general risk o f collusion during the bidding process, biased bid
evaluations, and supplier/contractor offering informal payments as incentives for favorable
treatment. Three IDA-financed projects were suspended and misprocurement declared in 2006
after allegations o f corruption led to investigations in Cambodia by the IDA Department of
Institutional Integrity. However, TFCP was not included in or affected by the fiduciary review
and investigation o f 2006.

8.       Following the aforesaid misprocurement, the Borrower proposed and agreed by the IDA
to use the International Procurement Agent (PA) for a l l the IDA-financed projects including this
restructuring project and the P A was engaged by the Borrower in December 2007. In December
2008, the Government and the IDA also agreed t o exclude specified small value and simple
competitive procurement packages from the P A requirement and to allow these to be procured
by the project implementing agencies themselves as i t was not practically and economically
feasible for these to be procured through the PA.

9.      Based on the result o f the assessment, the procurement risk under the project was
determined to remain High. However, this risk will be mitigated through the wide range o f
strengthening measures that are being incorporated in the restructure o f the Project and Grant
Agreements. With the incorporation o f the capacity strengthening measures and the extensive
requirements for improving governance, including transparency and accountability in the
procurement process, as listed in Section F and detailed in the Good Governance Framework
(GGF) provided in Annex 4, the residual procurement risk under the Restructured Project i s
determined to be substantial.

C.      ProcurementPlan

 10.    The procurement plan, which forms the basis for the procurement methods, has been
agreed between the Borrower and IDA and will be available in.thedatabase o f the IA. It will also
be available in the W o r l d Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in
agreement with the project team at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs. The procurement plan for the restructured project i s included in this
Project Paper-Annex.

D.      Frequency o f Procurement Supervision

 11.    In addition t o the prior review supervision t o be carried out by IDA, the procurement
capacity assessment o f the I A recommends that procurement supervision missions, including ex-
post review, be conducted bi-annually. Furthermore, procurement and financial management staff
are expected to conduct joint ex-post procurement reviews and Statement o f Expenditure (SOE)
reviews in order t o broaden the perspective, including checking for compliance with agreed


                                                 17
procedures, capacity issues, adequacy o f documentation and record keeping arrangements,
indicators o f collusion, and verification o f deliverables and end-usage.

E.       I D A Review Requirement

 12.         The following contracts will be subject to prior review by IDA: (i)      each contract for
                                                                          i)
goods estimated to cost the equivalent o f US$lOO,OOO or more; ( i each contract for goods
procured under Direct Contracting and under Procurement from U Agencies; ( i )
                                                                        N              i ieach contract
for consultants' services for employment o f a firm estimated t o cost the equivalent o f
US$lOO,OOO or more; (iv) each contract for the employment o f individual consultants estimated
to cost the equivalent o f US$50,000 or more; (v) each contract involving Single-Source Selection
o f f i r m s or Sole-Source Selection o f individual consultants, irrespective o f value; and (vi) the
contract for external financial audit provided by a firm procured through Least Cost Selection,
irrespective o f value. All other contracts shall be subject to ex-post review by IDA. The
percentage to apply for contracts subject to ex-post review i s 20 percent.

F.      Agreed Actions to strengthen procurement capacity and mitigate procurement risks

Capacity-relatedStrengthening Measures:

13.     The I P A will continue to carry out all procurements under the restructured project, except
                                                                                         N
for procurement through the methods o f direct contracting, procurement f r o m U agencies,
single source for consulting firm, selection o f individual consultants (regardless o f value), hiring
o f NGOs, and procurement o f goods estimated to cost less than $50,000 per contract.

 14.     A qualified international procurement consultant experienced in IDA procurement
procedures and terms o f reference satisfactory to IDA, has been agreed t o be engaged by M O C
under the Trade Development Support Project (TDSP) and the selection process i s at an advance
stage and the consultant i s expected to be appointed by November 2009. This international
procurement consultant, who i s expected to be hired and contracted with MOC, will also provide
part-time procurement support for the restructured TFCP. The services o f the international
procurement consultant will be used o n a part-timehhared basis for the restructured TFCP. The
consultant will be responsible for supporting and enabling M O C procurement staff t o effectively
carry out in accordance with IDA procedures all procurement packages for goods and consulting
services falling below the IPA requirement under the restructured Project, f r o m preparation o f
bidding documents up to signing o f contract, . The consultant will also assess and propose
measures for strengthening the procurement management system o f MOC, including roles,
responsibilities and accountabilities o f staff involved in procurement, formation o f bid evaluation
committees, review and approval requirements and associated accountabilities, complaints and
disclosure mechanisms, procurement audits and record keeping arrangements, with a view to
streamline and strengthen the integrity o f the procurement management system. T o build
capacity o f M O C staff, the international procurement consultant will develop and conduct a
program for structured and hands-on training, which would also build linkages to the broader
procurement capacity building program being initiated under the public financial management
program at the country level.

15.    I t has been agreed that M O C would support capacity building efforts t o strengthen the
procurement capacity o f i t s staff. These capacity building efforts will be coordinated with the
Government-wide Public Finance Management Reform Program (PFMRP).

16.     Furthermore, IDA will provide procurement training at least once a year.


                                                 18
Governance-related Strengthening Measures:

17.     In addition to IPA requirement for carrying out the procurement above the specified
thresholds and also an international procurement consultant to assist, o n a shared basis with
TDSP, in carrying out the procurement under TFCP below the I P A thresholds and to build
procurement systems and capacity o f MOC, a Good Governance Framework (GGF) has been
adopted by M O C (Annex 4). The GGF includes various elements for improving transparency and
accountability through strengthened procurement arrangements, strengthened financial
management, enhanced public disclosure, involvement o f c i v i l society, a complaints mechanism,
a code o f ethnic conduct, sanctions, and by addressing project-specific implementation risks.

18.      The Government's Standard Procurement Manual for Externally Financed Projects,
including standard bidding documents, which has been agreed by IDA for use in N C B and
Shopping procurement under IDA-financed projects in Cambodia will also be applicable under
the restructured TFCP. This Manual includes numerous measures for further enhancing
competition, transparency and accountability in the procurement process, including defined roles
o f government staff, integrity pledges, and additional provisions for wider publicity o f bidding
opportunities and procurement information including contract awards, involvement o f
beneficiaries, complaints handling and de-briefingrequirements, etc.

 19.    It has been agreed to rationalized thresholds for use o f ICB, NCB and Shopping methods.
Under the original TFCP, there was n o provision for NCB, and as a result I C B was required for
procurement o f goods exceeding the specified Shopping threshold o f US$5,000 per contract,
which was unrealistic for attracting international bidders. This has n o w been corrected with the
revision o f the thresholds to also allow use o f the N C B method for procurement o f goods ranging
between US$20,000-$100,000 per contract, and making a l l the thresholds consistent with the
Government's Procurement Manual for Externally Financed Projects and in-line with other Bank-
financed projects in Cambodia.

20.     I t has also been agreed to expand the scope o f ex-post procurement reviews by the Bank
to include checks for indicators o f collusion and end-use deliveries in addition to verifying
procedural compliance, as w e l l as integrated procurement and FM/SOE reviews.

2 1.    IDA will carry out at least two supervision missions per year, including ex-post reviews.
IDA will also conduct workshop for project agencies staff as w e l l as for private sector suppliers
and contractors to disseminate the IDA'Sprocurement procedures with specific attention to the
provisions against fraud and corruption.

5.   Fraud and Corruption

     The Association shall declare a firm or individual ineligible, either indefinitely or for a
     stated period, to be awarded a contract financed by the Association, if it at any time

     corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive or obstructive practices in competing for, or in
     executing, a contract financed by the Association.

6.   Right to Inspect/Audit

     Each bidding document and contract financed from the proceeds o f the Financing shall

     submission and performance o f the contract and to have said accounts and records
     audited by auditors appointed by the Association. The deliberate and material violation
     by a bidder, supplier, contractor or subcontractor o f such provision may amount to
