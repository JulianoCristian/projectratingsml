unconditionally agrees:
(a)    to reimburse the Bank immediately on demand or as the Bank may otherwise direct in
writing for any amount paid by the Bank under the IBRD Guarantee in Euro together with interest thereon
at the rate per annum determined by the Bank and notified to the Member Country (which rate shall not
exceed the Bank's prevailing lending rate for Fixed Spread Loans denominated in Euro, as shown from
time to time on the Bank's external website) from the date such payment is made by the Bank until such
amount is paid in full;
(b)    to indemnify the Bank on demand and hold the Bank harmless against all actions,
proceedings, liabilities, claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses brought against, suffered or incurred
by the Bank directly or indirectly in relation to or arising out of or in connection with the IBRD
Guarantee (except as otherwise provided in Section 8.04(i) of the General Conditions);
(c)    that (i) the Bank is irrevocably authorized to comply with any Demand Notice(s) (that is
supported by the documentation required under of the IBRD Guarantee) served on the Bank pursuant to
the IBRD Guarantee and make any payments which may be due from or claimed or made upon the Bank
under the IBRD Guarantee (the Bank shall promptly notify the Member Country of any such demand, but
failure to give such notice shall in no way affect the Bank's obligation to make payment under the IBRD
Guarantee or the Member Country's obligation to reimburse or indemnify the Bank pursuant to this
Indemnity Agreement); and (ii) it shall not be incumbent on the Bank to inquire whether or not any
statements in such Demand Notice are in fact correct or whether payments are in fact due or whether or
not any dispute exists between the Member Country and the IBRD Guaranteed Lenders;
(d)    that any such Demand Notice (that is supported by the documentation required under of
the IBRD Guarantee) served on the Bank pursuant to the IBRD Guarantee shall, as between the Member
5
A


﻿Country and the Bank, be conclusive evidence that the demand is properly made and payment is due.
Following the notification to the Member Country of the receipt by the Bank of any Demand Notice, the
Member Country may investigate the validity of the statements in such Demand Notice and take such
actions as the Member Country may see fit against the IBRD Guaranteed Lenders, in respect thereof; all
without prejudice to the Bank's obligations under the IBRD Guarantee to make a payment in respect of
such Demand Notice and to the Member Country's obligations under this Indemnity Agreement in
relation to its indemnity and payment obligations to the Bank. The obligations of the Member Country
hereunder shall apply notwithstanding that the Member Country disputes the validity of any such Demand
Notice or the accuracy or correctness of any documentation, fact or figures relied upon or stated therein;
and
(e)    in the event that the Bank receives funds from the Member Country pursuant to Section
2.01(a) and, in respect of the same amounts, the Bank receives a refund of funds from the IBRD
Guaranteed Lenders pursuant to the IBRD Guarantee (the "Double Payment"), then the Bank shall
promptly refund to the Member Country the amount of the Double Payment.
Section 2.02. In further consideration of the Bank providing the IBRD Guarantee, the Member Country
shall pay directly to the Bank a guarantee fee (the "IBRD Guarantee Fee") equivalent to 0.50 percent (50

Guarantee, payable up-front. The IBRD Guarantee Fee shall be due and payable to the Bank on or before
the Effective Date of the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement. The IBRD Guarantee Fee shall be paid to
the Bank by electronic transfer in immediately available freely transferable funds in Euro to a bank
account designated by the Bank.

payable in a lump sum in an amount equal to 0.25 percent (25 basis points) of the Maximum IBRD
Liability under the IBRD Guarantee, which shall be due and payable on or before the Effective Date. The
Bank shall furnish the Member Country with an invoice requesting payment of the IBRD Front-end Fee;
provided that the Member Country shall continue to be obligated to pay such IBRD Front-end Fee
notwithstanding any failure by the Bank to provide such invoice, or to provide such invoice in a timely
manner.
Section 2.04. (a) The obligations of the Member Country under this Indemnity Agreement are
irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Member Country's obligations under the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement, and
shall not be discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance. Such
obligations shall not be subject to any prior notice to, demand upon or action against the IBRD
Guaranteed Lenders or any other person, or any prior notice to, demand upon or action against the
Member Country with regard to any failure by the Member Country to pay any amount in respect of
which a Demand Notice is served on the Bank pursuant to the IBRD Guarantee. Such obligations shall
not be impaired by any of the following: (i) any extension of time, forbearance, concession or other
indulgence given to the Bank, the Member Country, the IBRD Guaranteed Lenders or any other person;
(ii) any variation of this Indemnity Agreement, the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement or any other
related agreement; (iii) any assertion of, or failure to assert, or delay in asserting, by any party to the

Guaranteed Lenders or any other person, or in respect of any security created or purported to be created
for the IBRD Guaranteed Loan (or any part thereof or interest thereon); or (iv) any other circumstances
which would or might (but for this provision) constitute a release, discharge, defense or waiver for the
Member Country.

any rights, powers and remedies hereby created or conferred upon it by this Indemnity Agreement or any
other related agreement or by law: (i) offer or agree to or enter into any agreement for the extension or
variation of the IBRD Guarantee (except one which would materially increase the obligations of the
Member Country under this Indemnity Agreement unless so agreed by the Member Country), this
Indemnity Agreement, the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement or any other related agreement; and (ii)

from the Member Country or any other person or entity, reimbursement of or indemnification against
payments made or liabilities incurred by the Bank arising from or in connection with the IBRD
Guarantee.
(d)    The Bank shall not be obliged before or after taking steps to enforce any rights conferred

IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement); or (ii) to enforce or seek to enforce any other rights it may have
against the Member Country or its rights against, or security given by, any other person to the Bank.
