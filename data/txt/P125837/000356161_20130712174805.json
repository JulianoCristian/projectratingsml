satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: the PBG instrument proved to be a\n            successful instrument for leveraging additional resources\n            for the client. FYR Macedonia would have been unable to\n            raise a loan of this size without the PBG. Due to its\n            improved leverage of Bank assets, the PBG is a viable and\n            potentially more powerful policy-based financing tool than a\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL). The PBG has proven to be a\n            useful instrument, in particular with the current incentive\n            structure. The instrument might be of particular benefit to\n            smaller countries, for which the leveraging ability of this\n            instrument might be of higher importance than for bigger\n            ones. The program permitted adequate flexibility to account\n            for responses to changing circumstances, especially during\n            times of crisis."}, "docdt": "2013-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
