            Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: Policy Based Guarantee

                              SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION

                               Meeting of Executive Directors

                                     November 10, 2011


        The Executive Directors approved the Policy Based Guarantee to the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia in the amount of EUR 100 million (USD 134.9 million equivalent) on
the terms and conditions set out in the President’s Memorandum (R2011-0224).

        Directors expressed support for the Policy Based Guarantee, which will support reforms
to enhance sustainability of public finances and functioning of the labor markets. They
acknowledged that the policy based guarantee will assist the country in its efforts to access
international capital markets, diversify its borrowing portfolio, and raise funds on more
competitive terms. Directors noted that in spite of the growing uncertainty in the external
economic environment, the Government has maintained strong macroeconomic management and
structural reforms. They, however, noted with concern the country’s slow economic growth and
increasing finance needs.
