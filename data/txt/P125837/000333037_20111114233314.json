They acknowledged that\n            the policy based guarantee will assist the country in its\n            efforts to access international capital markets, diversify\n            its borrowing portfolio, and raise funds on more competitive\n            terms. Directors noted that in spite of the growing\n            uncertainty in the external economic environment, the\n            Government has maintained strong macroeconomic management\n            and structural reforms.
