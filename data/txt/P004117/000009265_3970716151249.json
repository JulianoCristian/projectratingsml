Secondly, the project\n            includes; (b) an institutional component for KTDC. This\n            comprises; (i) consulting services to support the operations\n            of KTDC and training of KTDC staff as well as to deepen\n            KTDC's capacity to identify, appraise, and supervise\n            R&D projects and to enable KTDC to carry out surveys of\n            the technological needs of Korean industries. The\n            institutional development component further includes; (ii)\n            purchase of training materials for KTDC staff."}, "docdt": "1984-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
