                                PROGRAMSUMMARY


    Borrower:        The Islamic Republic o f Pakistan

    Amount:          IDA SDR 65.3 million (US$ 100million equivalent) and
                     IBRDUS$ 200 million.

    Terms:           Standard IDA terms: 35-year maturity including 1O-year grace period
                     IBRD terms: Fixed Spread US Dollar Loan with 20-year maturity
                     including 8-year grace period with commitment linked level repayment
                     and automatic rate fixing feature.

    Description:     Pakistan has achieved significant progress in reforming its banking
                     sector since the launch o f its `home grown' reform program in 1997.
                     Overall assessment o f the recently concluded FSAP was quite positive
                     and the findings highlighted that the banking sector reforms undertaken
                     have been effectively implemented in the context o f broader
                     macroeconomic stabilization, providing an essential foundation to
                     financial sector recovery.

                     The proposed credit and loan support the Government o f Pakistan
                     towards improving sector govemance through privatization o f UBL,
                     HBL and resolution of ABL, further strengthening the regulatory and
                     supervisory environment for banking, improving transparency and
                     disclosure, and preventing possible use o f the banking system for money
                     laundering. Both CAS & PRSP recognize the importance o f financial
                     sector reforms for accelerating economic growth and reducing poverty.

    Benefits:        Financial sector reforms have significantly improved the soundness and
                     efficiency o f the financial system by reducing state intervention and
                     improving the environment for banlung.          The divestiture o f state
                     ownership o f banks has substantially changed the structure o f the
                     banking sector and nearly 80 percent o f sector assets are now controlled
                     by private banks as compared with 34 percent in 1999, andjust 8 percent
                     in 1990. As aresult, accessto finance has improvedand creditto private
                     sector has witnessed significant growth duringthe past three years. Last
                     year alone private sector credit showed an increase o f over 30 percent. A
                     large part o f the success o f the reforms stems from the improved legal
                     and regulatory framework and enhanced corporate governance as a result
                     of reduced role o f the govemment. Profitability and liquidity indicators
                     for the commercial banks have shown a marked improvement. The
                     banking sector has also become considerably more competitive and
                     responsive.    BSDPC would support further strengthening o f banking
                     sector competitiveness and its outreach to areas/population with little or
                     no access to banking services.

Risks andMitigation The risko f the programcredit and loanis low since prior actions are
Strategy:           already completed. However, there i s a risk o f policy reversal in the
                    medium term, if access to financial services does not expand to the rural
                    areas and other traditionally underserved sectors. The significant growth
                    incredit to the consumer marketsposes ariskandrequires strengthening
                    of credit appraisal systems and risk management by the banks as well as
                    strong monitoring by the regulator.       SBP has already issued risk
                    management guidelines and increased the provisioning requirements of
                    banks for consumer lending. There have also been initiatives to promote
                    and expand credit information services in the private sector, enhancing
                    governance and transparency, as well as improved legal and judicial
                   processes for insolvencyhankruptcy.

Disbursement:       The credit in an amount of US$lOO million equivalent and a loan o f US$
                    200 million will be disbursedinone tranche upon effectiveness.

                                    I. INTRODUCTION

1.      Pakistan has implemented far-reaching reforms in the financial sector during the last
decade with the help o f the Bank. The banking sector has undergone fundamental changes
through a three phased reform program. The first phase o f reforms initiated in 1997, was
supported by the Banking Sector Adjustment Loan (BSAL). The reforms managed to address the
root cause o f sector's problems and achieved a complete turnaround in the environment for
banking in the country. The reforms involved controlling abuse o f the public sector banks by
vested interests through changes inlaws and governance; strengthening the regulatory framework
and institutions; rationalization of interest rates through reforms inthe National Savings Scheme
(NSS),  improving the environment for enforcement o f financial contracts, bringing greater
transparency and disclosure o f information, and operational restructuring o f public sector banks.
While these reforms managed to improve the environment, the sector remained government
dominated and privatization efforts stalled.       Realizing the need, the Government initiated a
second phase o f reforms with further restructuring.        These reforms were supported by the
Banking Sector Restructuring and Privatization Support Project (BSRPP) in 2001. Under this
program public sector, banks further downsized their workforce and rationalized their branch
networks, reducing their overall cost structure and improving profitability. The program also
managed to liberalize bank branching, and rationalizedthe tax structure. Together, these reforms
paved the way for third phase o f reforms which covered privatization o f two out o f the three
largest commercial banks Le., UBL and HBL and the sale o f 75 percent shares o f Allied Bank
Limited to local investors. With the privatization o f two o f the three NCBs which accounted for
nearly 25 percent o f the system and sale o f Allied Bank Limited (ABL), nearly 80 percent o f
country's banking sector assets are now in private hands.          This has also brought the first
generation reforms commenced in the late 1980s to near a conclusion.             Concurrently, the
Government and SBP also initiated second-generation reforms which aimed to further develop
the financial markets infrastructure by improving the policy and regulatory environment and
expanding access to financial services for all segments o f the society and sectors o f the economy.
These reforms are fully aligned with the results o f the Financial Sector Assessment and are an
important pillar of the Government's medium term Poverty Reduction Strategy.               These are
outlined inthe Government's Letter o f Development Policy attached as Annex 1.

2.      The proposed Banking Sector Development Policy Credit (BSDPC) supports the
completion o f the thirdphase and helps with financing the costs incurredby the government inre-
capitalizing these banks prior to privatization.

                      11.      POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT

3,      Pakistan's per capita growth averaged 3 percent in the 1980s, but only 1.2 percent in the
1990s. The slow growth o f the 1990s, exacerbated by drought and poor agricultural performance
in the second half o f the decade, led to an increase inthe incidence of poverty over the 1990s.
Successive govemments in the 1990s attempted to respond but for the most part reforms were
only partially implemented and results were generally disappointing. The military government

which came to power in 1999 sought to reverse this situation and build upon the efforts o f its
predecessors. It launched a comprehensive reform program that sought to attack the interlinked
problems o f slow growth, poor social indicators, and the heavy debt burden. Over the past four
years,     the government has made substantial progress in implementing reforms and
macroeconomic performance has strengthened considerably.

A.         Recent PoliticalDevelopments

4.         The present government took office after elections in October 2002 and i s marked by
continuity o f policy and personnel in key economic management positions, including Finance
Minister and the Governor State Bank. It has continued the banking reform program launched
under the Nawaz Sharif government in the context o f a wide-ranging and ambitious reform
program initiated by the military government. Recently there has been a change o f leadership in
the ruling party leading to the swearing in of a new Cabinet under Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz,
who also retains the portfolio o f the Finance Minister. The new government has announced its
commitment to continuity o f reforms which would be helped by the continuity o f key Cabinet
members.


5.         Regional tensions have subsided over the past year.                Relations between India and
Pakistan have continued to improve as the "composite dialogue" to address the full range o f
issues between two countries has proceeded.                  The new government in India has further
invigorated the dialogue, and expressed its full commitment to continue to further the peace
process. A further round o f talks was held in late November 2004. The January 2004 SAARC
summit resulted in a landmark free-trade agreement under which SAARC members will reduce
their intra-regional tariffs to 5% or less during the next decade while eliminating informal trade
barriers.

6.         Internal security challenges persist. Pakistan's cooperation in the war on terrorism has
been extremely unpopular among extremist elements o f the society. Recently, the Government
initiated military action in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan to remove Taliban remnants and
to respond positively to Afghanistan's concems regarding anti-government forces taking refuge
inPakistani territory. Additionally, inthe province of Balochistanthere have been incidents of
terrorist attacks on key government installations. Inthe last few months there has been escalation
o f sectarian violence inthe coastal city o f Karachi.

B.         MacroeconomicDevelopments and Growth Performance

7.         Continuity o f reforms has largely been successful and helped transform the country from
a highly regulated to a more open market economy. As a result, macroeconomic performance
continued to improve, with increased growth, greater extemal financial inflows, and improved
fiscal performance (Table 1). Real GDP (at factor cost) increased by 5.1% in 2002/03 and 6.4%
in 2003/04. This acceleration was led primarily by the manufacturing sector, which grew by
13.4% in 2003/04, as well as by robust performance o f the services sector, which increased by
5.2%.      Gross capital formation rose from 16.7 percent o f GDP in 2002/03 to 18.1 percent in
2003104, and i s projected to increase to 19.4 percent in 2004/05.                `Inflation as measured by
changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained low at 4.6% during 2003/04. However,

' Pakistan's Federal Bureau of Statistics completed in May 2004 a comprehensive revision of the national accounts
statistics. The base year was moved from 1980/81 to 1999/00 and several new sectors o f economic activity were
included. The results of this revision are a nominal GDP for 1999100 and subsequent years that are about 20% higher
than previously estimated levels. This document uses the `hew" GDP series.


                                                          2

strong domestic demand, increased food prices, and relatively loose monetary policy, have put
pressure on prices inrecent months, and inflation i s projectedto increase to 7% in2004/05.

8.      Extemal balances also continued to improve. Due to high levels o f remittances, strong
exports and sizeable extemal support, the current account and overall balance o f payments
improved. Over the past two years the current account tumed in a surplus. Debt re-profiling,
made possible by the current low interest rate regime, availability o f grants and concessional
finance, debt forgiveness and fiscal prudence, resultedin significant reduction o f the debt burden.
As a result, progress inreducing Pakistan's debt burden was substantial with government debt as
a share o f GDP declining sharply fi-om 89% in 2000-01, to 69% in 2003-04. Against the
backdrop o f improved macroeconomic prospects and declining debt burden, Standard and Poor's
credit-rating agency upgraded Pakistan's long-term foreign currency debt rating to "B" with a
positive outlook. These developments bode well for Pakistan's future economic and social
development.

9.       Fiscal outcomes continued to improve in FY03 and FY04. The fiscal deficit fell from 5.5
percent o f GDP in FY02 to 3.7 percent o f GDP inFY03, and to 2.4 percent in FY04. While tax
revenue collections, one o f Pakistan's key macroeconomic weaknesses, increased by 16% and
10%innominal terms respectively inFY03 and FY04, the tax to GDP ratio remained low, rising
from 10.9%inFY02 to 11.2% o f GDP inFY04.

10.      Aggregate expenditures have remained in check, with increased allocations provided to
PRSP expenditures, lower than projected interest payments, and higher defense expenditures
resulting from military activity on the Afghan border. Monetary aggregates grew rapidly inthe
first nine months o f 2003/04, reflecting the strong economic recovery, low interest rates, and
ample liquidityinthe banks.

 11.     The easy monetary stance of SBP during the last few years started yielding results in
FY04, kick starting the economy. SBP has been successful in inducing an increase in aggregate
demand leading to increased capacity utilization especially in the manufacturing sector which
helped realize a real GDP growth o f over 6 percent and a record growth in net private sector
credit, Albeit, this also contributed to a rise in inflationary pressures. Thus, FY04 witnessed a
gradual shift in monetary policy, as rising inflation became a source o f concern. While SBP
signaled bottoming out o f Rupee interest rates as early as August 2003, it started moving interest
rates gradually upwards only during the last six months when both inflation and exchange rate
pressures started to surge.         On aggregate, SBP used monetary policy to stimulate economic
activity inthe country, and it i s likely to continue balancing between the objectives o f sustaining
the growth momentum, managing the pressures on the exchange rate and containing inflation
through FY05. This i s implicit in SBP's FY05 (July -Dec.) monetary policy statement.

 12.     IMF'sninthand final review o fthe PRGFrecently completed (October 2004)* concluded
that Pakistan's economic performancewas much stronger than at any time duringthe past decade.
Tighter macroeconomic policies and structural reforms have resulted in a stronger external
position, a lower public debt burden, renewed access to intemational capital markets, and a
revival in growth, albeit accompanied lately by some increase in inflation.                       The strong
macroeconomic performance i s expected to continue at least inthe short term.

                                  111.        FINANCIAL SECTOR OVERVIEW

A.         The FinancialSector

13.        For a low-income country, Pakistan has a well-developed, diverse, and sophisticated
financial market. The sector i s dominated by commercial banks which account for nearly 73
percent o f the financial system's assets - see Annex 2 for financial sector's asset structure. The
State Life Insurance Company, with Rs.86 billion ($1.5 billion) in assets as o f December 2002 i s
among the few non-bank institutions inPakistan that comes close to the scale o f the major public
and private banks. The equity market, however, i s one o f the largest relative to GDP amongst the
peer group, exceeding Sri Lanka - the highest per capital income country inthe region, (although
falling short o f the standard set by India). International comparison o f financial sector indicators
i s provided in Annex 3. Equity market capitalization reached US$24.4 billion as o f end June
2004, equivalent to about 36 percent o f GDP. In addition, there are a large number o f mutual
funds, anascent corporate debt market, and a developingcontractual savings sector.

14.        Pakistan's capital markets have grown but remain relatively narrow and small. SECP has
adopted a number o f measures to reinforce market integrity while more systematic efforts are
planned to curb market abuse. There are three stock exchanges Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE),


                                                                    4

Lahore Stock Exchange (LSE) and Islamabad Stock Exchange (ISE). The KSE i s the most active
and includes almost all LSE & ISE listed companies. Inrecent years, Pakistan has been one o f
the world's best performing equity markets with KSE-100 index up 21% inthe first halfo f 2004,
more than 65% over 2003 and 112% in 2002. There has been a revival o f new listings in 2004,
comprising bothprivatization and private sector offerings, with 12 listings by end of August 2004
versus 6 in2003, the highest number in seven years.

15.      There i s also a growing futures market, with 15 one-month single stock futures contracts
traded on the KSE. The SECP has approved regulations for an over-the-counter market but this i s
not yet operational. There i s a National Clearing and Settlement System (NCSS) and a Central
Depositary Company (CDC) through which virtually all the actively traded securities are settled.

16.      The corporate bond market remains small but shows significant potential for growth.
There are 57 listed corporate bonds (known as Term Finance Certificates, or TFCs) with a total
face value o f Rs.31 billion or about $530 million (less than 1percent o f GDP). Until recently,
development of the bond market was hampered by distortions caused by high yields on NSS
instruments, which effectively served as a benchmark for the corporate bond market.            The
prohibition on institutional investment in the NSS resulted in a significant increase in corporate
debt issuance in 2002-2003. New activity has since slowed, as excess liquidity in the banking
system has resulted in increased availability o f relatively inexpensive loans from commercial
banks. There are two registeredrating agencies and all corporate debt issues have to be rated.

17.      The mutual fund industry i s growing in line with the development o f the capital markets.
There are eleven open ended and fifteen closed end mutual funds, managing assets worth over
Rs.48 billion ($820 million); the vast bulk o f investment being from institutional sources. The
industry,which dates back to the 1960's, was dominatedby two public sector fund managers, ICP
and NITL. The management rights for 26 ICP funds have now been sold to private investors and
the government is inthe process ofrestructuringandprivatizingNIT the largest open-end mutual
fundinPakistan.

18.       The leasing sector continues to grow in assets, increasing by 16% to Rs.52.3 billion or
about US$900 million but remains highly concentrated with more than half o f sector assets held
by 3 o f the 29 active leasing companies. Although recent regulatory changes and increased
capital requirements have led to consolidation within the financial sector and are likely to
increase competition for the leasing industry.

 19.      Contractual savings remain underdeveloped. Both insurance and pensions are relatively
small and have traditionally invested in government securities. Insurance penetration i s very low
relative to other countries at Pakistan's income level, reflecting a history o f nationalization and
instability, weak consumer protection and awareness. Recent growth rates have demonstrated the
scope for substantial development within an appropriate regulatory framework. The Government
intends to improve the law and strengthen regulatory powers as well as capacity o f the SECP. In
addition there are plans to introduce a private pension system in order to protect pension savings
o f individuals.

B.        The BankingSector

20.      The Pakistani banking sector consists o f the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) - the central
bank, and one large and one small state owned commercial bank (National Bank o f Pakistan and
FirstWomen Bank), 4 privatizedbanks - Habib, United, Muslimand Allied, 17 private domestic
banks, and 13 foreign commercial bank branches. In addition, there are 3 small state owned


                                                  5

specialized banks and 2 small provincial banks. Domestic banks dominate the share o f total
assets and liabilities o f the banking system. Their performance in terms o f mobilization o f
deposits and extension o f credit has further increased while the market share o f foreign banks has
declined in recent years. This was basically due to the shifting o f Foreign Currency Deposits
(FCDs) into local currency with the restriction on withdrawals in foreign currency, increased
competitiveness o f the local banks and the decision o f several foreign banks to discontinue
operations in Pakistan mainly as a result o f their global strategy. Details o f the sector's structure
are provided inAnnex 4.

21.     Prior to 2000 Pakistan had an extensive network o f Government-owned commercial and
various specialized banks as well as development finance institutions. All were characterized by
corruption, mis-management, and inefficiency resulting in high N P L s and negative net worth.
Under the Government's reformprogram, some o f the large commercial banks were privatized, a
number o f Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) have been closed or merged, and others are
being restructured.    The remaining state-owned development finance institutions           -  SMEB,
HDFC, and ZTBL are mandated to provide funding to the areas underserved but at the same time
are beingrestructured to operate on commercialbasis.

22.     A challenge faced by the sector inrecent years was the decision o f the Supreme Court o f
Pakistan in December 1999 and extended for one year in 2000, required transforming the
financial system to operate in accordance with the Shariah.            The precise nature o f this
requirement was challenged and still remains under legal review, leaving ambiguity regardingthe
status of Islamic banking. However, the Government's declared policy i s to let the market
determine the relative sizes o f traditional and Islamic banking. To promote Islamic banking in
response to market demand, SBP has since been pursuing a three pronged strategy, which
included: (i)licensing o f full fledged Islamic banks that transact only in Shariah compliant
products and services; (ii)allowing conventional banks to carry out Islamic banking through
separate dedicated subsidiaries; and, (iii)     permitting existing commercial banks to set up
dedicated branches for Islamic banking. In April 2004 the Shariah Board o f the SBP also
approved Islamic modes o f financing to ensure compliance with minimum Sharia standards by
banks conducting Islamic banking.         Once fully approved, the guidelines will function as
prudential regulations for Islamic banks.       As o f June 2004 one bank (Meezan Bank) was
operating with 10 branches in 5 cities as a full-fledged Islamic bank. In addition, 5 local and
foreign banks have been issued licenses to operate 12 dedicated Islamic Banking Branches o f
which 10 branches were already operational.         SBP has also given in principle approval for
opening 12 additional Islamic banking branches during2004. Some o f the banks are also offering
Islamic bankingproducts through their existing conventional branches.

23.     At the Country's request, a joint Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) was recently conducted (April 2004). Overall assessment o f the FSAP was quite positive
and the findings highlighted the banking sector reforms undertaken to have been effectively
implemented in the context o f broader macroeconomic stabilization, providing an essential
foundation to financial sector recovery.

24.     The FSAP highlighted the transformation o f a predominantly state-owned and weak
banking system into a healthier, market-based system, owned primarily by the private sector,
noting that the efficiency o f the banking systemhas been enhanced substantially by restructuring
o f major banks. The Assessment found the results o f the reform efforts in the banking sector
manifested in improving financial soundness indicators, greater resiliency to credit, market and
liquidity risks, and good compliance with international supervisory standards - see Annex 5 for
financial soundness indicators. The study went on to observe that the strengthened financial


                                                   6

position o f banks, coupled with increased liquidity in the sector form a strong balance o f
payments. The release o f institutional funds from the National Savings Scheme, have led to a
sharp increase in credit to the private sector, both in aggregate terms and to a wider range o f
smaller borrowers. The expansion o f credit to previously underserved markets has led to strong
gains in consumer, housing, SME, and agricultural finance over the previous two years.    Credit
to these market segments, once the quasi-exclusive domain o f public DFIs and specialized banks,
i s now being provided by a broad range o f financial institutions.     Progress was made on
improving financial market infrastructure and practices.

25.     The reforms, however, did not equally advance across all segments o f the financial
sector. Insurance penetration remains very low relative to other countries at Pakistan's income
level which can be improved through further consolidation and liberalization o f the industry as
well as more market/solvency-based regulatory structure.

26.     The key FSAP recommendations on the banking sector (Annex 6) and their status i s
discussedbelow:

(a) Revise the SBP Act and the Banking Companies Ordinance to address the concerns noted in
the Basel Core Principles assessment, especially ensuring legal authority of the SBP to conduct
consolidated supervision. This i s beingpursed by the Banking Law Review Commission set by
the Government with help from the Bank under the Banking Sector TA Project.

(b) Continued supervisory vigilance and efforts tofurther strengthen the system. This is being
supported under the Banking Sector TA.

(c) To broaden access to financial services in a sustainable and cost-eflcient manner to the
previously underserved markets will require some adaptation of relevant regulations. SBP has
issued revisednew regulations for corporate/commercial consumer and SME financing supported
through this operation.

(d) Adopt market risk-related capital charges and consider tightening speciJic provisioning
requirements.   SBP has introduced market risk-related capital charges in line with Basel 2
requirements.   On provisioning requirements, SBP has required the banks to make general
provisions o f 5% for unsecured and 1.5% for secured loans - this i s in addition to specific
provision already inplace.

(e) Develop a strategy to privatize NBP and continue divestiturefrom the capital of other banks.
NBP has been restructured by the government, has sold twenty three percent shares through the
stock market, and plans to complete its privatizationby 2010. The remaining government shares
inother banks will also be offloaded gradually either via stock market andor sale o f shares. The
specialized banks are being restructured under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) program and
are plannedto be privatized over the medium term.

                    IV.     PAKISTAN'S BANKINGSECTORREFORMS

A.      Background

27.     The banking system was on the verge o f crisis in the mid nineties. By the end o f 1996,
non-performing loans had reached alarming proportions.           Liquidity problems had begun to
emerge as dis-intermediation spreads and banking losses mounted. Most cases o f loan defaults
remained unresolved in an ineffective court system. These were manifestations o f deep-seated
problems rooted in a failure o f governance and lack o f financial discipline. Political interference
had vitiated the financial intermediation function o f the banking system and borrowers expected
not to repay loans, especially from the Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs) and DFIs. NCBs
and DFIswere major sources o fbad loans, accounting for 90 percent o f the bad loans inthe entire
system and were the main loss-makers. Overstaffing and over-branching and undue interference
by labor unions in bank, personnel and operations resulted in large operating losses. Poor
disclosure standards abetted corruption by window-dressing the true picture o f banks. The
authorities realized that, while these deep-rooted problems would take time to resolve, immediate
measures were needed to arrest the deterioration and prevent a banking crisis, especially since the
country was facing a difficult external position. Inearly 1997, the State Bank o f Pakistan and the
MinistryofFinance designedandstartedto implement a "home-grown" bankingreformprogram.

28.      Over the three phases as discussed earlier, the first generation reforms were based around
four pillars and aimed to strengthen the sources o f governance and financial discipline for the
banking sector, namely bank regulators, markets, the courts and bank owners by enhancing the
authority and the ability of the central bank to supervise banks and enforce regulations. The
program sought to promote market discipline, improve the legal and judicial processes for
enforcement of financial contracts and initiated corporate governance reforms in the NCBs and
DFIs.

B.       PhaseI   - Reforms  Supportedby BankingSector Adjustment Loan

29.      The 1997 BSAL supported implementation o f major short-term measures designed to
arrest the flow of bad loans, curtail loss-making, and conserve the assets o f the NCBs and DFIs.
Prudential regulations and financial disclosure standards were brought to international levels
increasing transparency. Market distortions were reduced to increase the efficiency o f financial
intermediation.    Legal and judicial processes were strengthened to enable a more effective
enforcement o f financial contracts.      Management and boards o f the NCBs and DFIs were
replaced and the law was amended to insulate the appointment process from political interference.
Improvement in corporate governance was to be sustained through a well-structured privatization
program. The NCBs and DFIs were to be sold to reputable strategic investors with integrity,
capital, banking expertise, management and technology to run these institutions prudently and
efficiently. These reform measures were not only critically needed to stop the hemorrhage o f the
banking sector, they were also needed to lay the basis for the implementation o f a medium-term
program that would deal with the stock o f bad loans, strengthen banking supervision, and build
the capacity o f the legal andjudicial system for loan recovery.

30.      The program helped the Government realize these objectives and by the end o f 1999,the
banking sector had improved by most benchmarks compared with the situation in 1996. In the
three-year period, cash recoveries against non-performing loans totaled Rs.70 billion, or a third o f
the stock o f loan defaults. The NCBs stemmed operating losses through staff rationalization -
nearly 30 percent of the workforce and closing 500 loss-making branches. The new banking


                                                   8

court system processed 22,000 out o f 52,000 loan default cases at an unprecedented rate.       The
level o f non-performing loans started to stabilize due to better lending practices and intensified
loan recovery, work-out o f problem loans as well as take over o f large NPLsby the Corporate and
Industrial Restructuring Corporation - setup by the Government as an instrument to deal with the
stock problem and to clean up the balance sheets o f NCBs and DFIs. These measures helpedthe
banking system achieve improvements in capital adequacy, asset quality, efficiency, and
profitability. These improvements were despite more stringent disclosure standards in 1998 and
1999 than those of 1996- improved disclosure being part and parcel o f the reform program itself.
See Annex 7 for BSAL policy reforms matrix- the specijk measures implemented and their
outcomes.

31.      While B S A L was successful in supporting the policy reforms and first level o f
operational restructuring, the reform program was far from complete. As the crisis eased and
financial institutions started to recover, the reform process slowed down. Interference in the
banking system restarted by mido f 1999, through new centrally mandated credit programs. Loan
recovery slowed, except for the dramatic gains as a result o f the accountability campaign initiated
by the new military Government that took over inOctober 1999. Loan collateral foreclosure and
bankruptcy procedures were not strengthened as planned. Market reforms to reduce segmentation
were not completed. Most importantly, bank privatization did not materialize as planned due to
weak market conditions, the country's deteriorating foreign investment climate, faltering resolve
and also because o f the distressed conditions o f NCBs - highcost structures and depleted balance
sheets, which did not attract quality buyers.

32.      As it was believed that privatization was the only sustainable solution to the country's
banking sector problems, there was need to ascertain what was required to attract suitable
investors and complete privatization. Market feedback at the time highlighted that quality
acquirers were reluctant to dedicate substantial management time, as well as assume political and
social risks, o f further restructuringnecessary to bringthe operating structure o f the NCBs closer
to international norms. Moreover, the significant cost o f these restructurings, especially when
added to the cost of required balance sheet restructuring, was beyond the capacity o f any
domestic financial institution. To assist the Government with further operational restructuring o f
the NCBs and strengthening o f the policy environment the Bank in 2001 prepared BSRPP as an
investment operation.

C.       Phase I1 Reforms Supported by Banking Sector Restructuring and Privatization
                     -
         Project

33.      The BSRPP was planned to help the Government with second level o f operational
restructuring o f the NCBs inpreparation o f their privatization as well as for improving corporate
governance o f the partially privatized banks by divesting the remaining government shareholding
and allowing complete control of the private sector owners. In addition, the project sought to
address the problems o f the specialized financial institutions by reducing their number to three
(catering to small industry, housing finance and small agriculture), and amalgamating the largest
DFI-NDFC, into the National Bank o f Pakistan. Details o f the policy and institutional reforms
carried out are discussed below. See Annex 8for specijk reform measures implemented under
BSRPP and their outcomes.

34.      Policy Reforms: The first generation policy reforms implemented under the BSAL were
short term innature and were able to stabilize the financial sector by addressing some o f the core
issues and thereby create a platform for longer term reforms. These second-generation reforms
were aimed at achieving a permanent resolution through genuine privatization and improving the


                                                   9

overall banking environment.      The latter required tackling the NSS that were the cause of
significant dis-intermediation, rationalizing the taxation structure, resolving the problems of
enforcement of financial contracts and improving the environment for bank operations.

35.      Institutional investment inNSS was banned, tax advantages were removed, and the rates
lowered and linked with comparable market rates. Removing these distortions enabled the banks
to realize considerable growth indeposits. Liberalization of bank branchingledthe privatebanks
to expand their networks while the NCBs rationalizedtheirs. There was also major expansion in
ATMs improving access to banking services. Reduction in tax rates from 58 percent to 47
percent in 2003 improved margins and profitability of the sector. Further reductions were
approved which would bring downthese ratesto 35% by 2007. Additionally, income tax law was
improved and past tax disputes of the bankmg sector were resolved. The reforms had a positive
impact in improving the market structure, reducing the cost o f financial intermediation, and
deepening the market.

36.      The improvements in the regulatory and legal environment along with the passage of
Financial          Recoveries
Ordinance      2001     had  a
significant      impact     on
reducing the overall level o f
N P L s     and     improving
recoveries. Cash recoveries
of the NCBs increasedby 32
percent in a single year
(from 2000 to 2001).       The
total recoveries by the NCBs
during the last three years
reached Rs.69 billion and were about Rs.89 billion including all private and public sector banks
and DFIs (chart 1) The FRO also provided the banks with powers to foreclose without court
interference. This provision, however, was recently challenged inthe highcourt on constitutional
grounds. If the provision i s upheld, the usage and deterrence value o f the law would increase
significantly. Inaddition, the Corporate and Industrial restructuring Corporation (CIRC) helped
restructure the balance sheets o f NCBs and DFIsby takingup their non-performing loans of over
Rs.10 million. With special legal powers, CIRC was more successful inliquidating and disposing
o f assets than the banks. However, to avoid premature re-capitalization of the NCBs and DFIs,
the CIRC law provided for
replacement of loans only at
the time o f privatization or      loo1             Chart- 2: Net NPLs of Banks

a period of four years.

38.       Operational Restructuring: The NCBs underwent extensive operational restructuringand
with the start of the BSRPP program in 2001, a total of 11,000 staff were separated through


                                                10

voluntary separation programs (see chart 3).               Staff rationalization, de-layering coupled with
branch rationalization where 800 branches (majority urban) were closed, reduced the high cost
structure o f NCBs, and brought their costhcome ratios (chart 4) closer to the international
benchmark o f 0.50.

The cost reduction brought about by staff and branch rationalization enabled the banks to invest more and faster in
technology, increasing staff productivity and improving work culture.

39.    Preparing. NCBs for Privatization and Disinvesting. Government Shareholding. in Partially
Privatized Banks: Finally and most importantly, the ultimate goal o f reforms implemented under
BSRPP was to bring a permanent change incorporate governance. With the experience o f MCB
and ABL (sold in 1991), the Government adopted a different approach for the privatization o f
UBLandHBL. The policy reforms and operational restructuring carried out under BSRPP ledto
earlier than expected privatization o f both the institutions. UBL was successfully sold to a
consortiumo f foreign and local investors in October o f 2002 followed by HBLwhich was sold to
the Agha Khan Fund for Economic Development in January 2004. As the cost of operational
restructuring was less than expected, BSRPP was recently modified to allow it to partially support
the cost o f balance sheet restructuring carried out at the time o f privatization. However, as the
available funds were insufficient, the proposed credit and loan would augment Bank's support
towards the requiredbalance sheet restructuring.

40.      The Government successfully divested its shareholding in M C B and off-loaded 23
percent o f its shares in NBP through the stock market. This strategy achieved the objective o f
market deepening and improved disclosure, and has provided some measure o f market discipline
for NBP. In addition, the State Bank managed to bring a change in management and ownership
inABL through sale ofadditional shares inthe bank.

D.       PhaseI11 Reforms Supportedby the ProposedCredit andLoan
                      -
41.      The proposed BSDPC supports phase I11o f the first generation reforms that are fully
aligned with FSAP recommendations and the Government's PRSP and include: (i)                       improving o f
sector governance through privatization o f UBL, HBL and resolution o f ABL; (ii)                     developing
effective regulatory and supervisory capacity at SBP through changes inbanking regulations; (iii)
enhancing transparency though greater public disclosure; and (iv) preventing possible use o f the
banking system for money laundering. With implementation o f phase 111, the Government has
reached a near conclusion of the first generation reforms and has concurrently embarked on the
second-generation reforms discussed in sub section `F' o f this Section under the Government's
medium term reform strategy. Phase I11reforms are discussed in detail in Section `V' o f the
ProposedCredit and Loan.

E.       Cost of BankingReforms [1997 -20041

42.      The banking reforms that were initiated in 1997 have cost the Government about US$2
billion, nearly 2.8% o f GDP. The costs include capital injections, voluntary separation programs
for downsizing and bringing the cost structure o f public sector banks in line with intemational
norms and other outstanding claims o f the banks on account o f state owned enterprises and tax
settlements. The costs of operational restructuring o f the banks were partially supported by the
Bank under B S A L and BSRPP. However, the operational restructuring cost incurred under
BSRPP was less than expected and the project was modified recently to allow it to support the
cost o f balance sheet restructuring. The proposed credit and loan supplement Bank's support
towards balance sheet restructuring - details o f the costs incurred for the reforms carried out since
1997 are provided inthe table below.

F.       Governments'MediumTermReformStrategy3

43.      Government's medium term strategy covers the second-generation reforms to consolidate
the gains realized thus far and to build on the strengths o f the financial system for expanding
access to financial services. The strategy i s aligned with the recommendations o f the FSAP and
i s also discussed in the Government's LDP. Specific outcomes are provided in Medium Term
Outcomes Matrix attached as Annex 9. Bank support for these second-generation reforms would
be through several instruments including the PRSCs, the ongoing Baking Sector Technical

  ADB is also supporting financial sector reforms through their programs for capital markets, specialized banks and
DFIs as well as SME development.

Assistance Project, IDF for SECP, the Second Poverty Alleviation Fund Project, technical
assistance for housing finance, pensions and debt market reforms as well as a possible TA for
capital markets development inpartnership with other donors particularly ADB.

44.      Improvingthe environment for financial intermediationand completingthe process
of restructuring and privatizationof the remaining state owned financial institutions. The
Government in the budget FY05 announced restructuring o f NSS, transforming it into a
corporation to operate on commercial lines. The corporation would offer mutual funds managed
by professional asset management companies and would assist in increasing coverage and
availability o fresources for investment. This area was also highlightedinthe FSAP and the Bank
assistance on debt management strategy, reorganization and risk management i s underway. The
Government has gradually been reducing the taxation on banking and aligning it with the
corporate sector as stated policy for providing a level playing field.        It is also moving to
rationalize the tax structure for private companies to encourage registrationand to avoid listing o f
companies purely for tax advantages. Inaddition, to reap the benefits o f an efficient and effective
private banking system, the Government and SBP would continue their efforts for disinvesting
state ownership in the remaining public sector banks, DFIs and non-bank financial companies.
The Government has already disinvested 23 percent o f its shareholding in NBP, the only
remaining NCB, through stock market and i s in process o f amending the Nationalization Act,
1974 to allow voting rights to minority shareholders and to continue further dis-investment. The
plans include complete privatization o f NBP by 2010. The Government has initiated operational
restructuringof the ZTBL, SMEB and HBFC andplans to privatize these institutions once private
sectors credit i s largely able to meet the demand o f these sector that have traditionally remained
underserved. IDBP and NIT - the largest open-end mutual fund, are being restructured for
privatization.    There are also plans to restructure and privatize the state owned insurance
companies over the medium term.            Restructuring and privatization o f DFIs, NBFCs, and
insurance companies has support from ADB.

45.      Improving the legal framework and judicial process for enforcement of financial
contracts. The Government has already initiated the work for review and consolidation o f the
banking laws through the Banking Law Review Commission. This would include review o f the
SBP Act for purposes o f strengthening SBP's autonomy as well as o f the banking laws for
implementation o f Real Time Gross Settlement System and for sharing o f credit information to
facilitate private sector credit bureaus. In addition, there are plans to review and improve the
Public Debt Act, Insurance Ordinance, as well as laws pertaining to insider trading and take over
o f companies in line with best practices. Draft laws for bankruptcy/insolvency, and AML/CFT
have already been prepared and are currently in their final stages before being presented to the
Parliament for approval. SBP has also organized training o f banking court judges and i s raising
awareness amongst stakeholders for improving implementation o f FRO 2001.

46.      Strengthening and further deepening capital markets. SECP has made reasonable
progress during the last few years with the support o f ADB, however, a number o f areas remain
weak and were highlighted in the FSAP. The Government and SECP have already started to take
these up and plan to address them over the medium term for the capital markets to play their due
role in development. The main focus areas include: (i)      development o f a legal and regulatory
framework for private pensions; (ii)    rethinkingthe role and devisinga strategy on that basis for
state owned insurance companies; (iii)development o f rules and gradually introducing margin
financing to replace COT; (iv) training o f adequate level o f resources for supervision and on-site
inspection o f entities regulated by SECP; (v) skill development and capacity building o f SECP
and the exchanges; (vi) putting in place adequate systems and resources for market surveillance

and supervision o f market intermediaries; and (vii) strengthening investor protection and taking
additionalmeasures for expanding services and improving investor education.

47.      Improving financial markets infrastructure and access to financial services. The
Government and the SBP have taken concrete steps to improve the legal and regulatory
framework for improving access to finance for the micro, SMEs, and consumers and new
prudential regulations for these sectors have been introduced. As a result, private sector credit
through the banking system has considerably increased. In the last year alone, private sector
credit witnessed a growth o f more than 30 percent. In addition, the Government has initiated
operational restructuring o f the ZTBL, SMEB, and HBFC to improve service delivery to small
farmers, consumers, homeowners, and small businesses. There i s already sizeable rise in the
share o f agriculture financing by private commercial banks from the year before. Performance o f
HBFC has improved and along with that there are 19 other institutions engaged at some level in
providing loans for housing, thereby increasing the outstanding o f this segment to Rs.22 billion
(Dec 2003). Along with these positive developments, SBP and SECP are placing emphasis on:
(i)encouraging businesses to improve record keeping and transparency in operations; (ii)
promoting expansion o f private sector credit information services; (iii)equipping financial
institutions with necessary tools for a risk based environment; (iv) innovatiodproduct
development for borrowers as well as savers; and (v) focus on technology.


                         V.      THE PROPOSEDCREDITAND LOAN

48.      Duringthe course of reforms it was recognized that the NCBs would require substantial
balance sheet restructuring to attract quality investors and provide the basis for genuine
privatization. Details o f these reforms supported by B S A L (1997) - Phase Iand BSRPP (2001) -
Phase 11, are discussed insection N.

49.      Rationale: Bank privatization supported by the proposed Credit and Loan has been
undertaken in the context o f Government's overall banking reform strategy as spelled out intheir
Letter o f Development Policy. Earlier operations have supported operational restructuring in
order to facilitate privatization, however, the Bank had linked any re-capitalization support to
successful privatization. With the completion o f privatization o f UBL, HBL and resolution o f
ABL, IDA Credit of US$lOO million equivalent and IBRD of US$200 million are proposed to
support the program.

50.      Rationale for Prior Actions: Reform o f corporate governance was considered the most
critical for sustainability of the complete reform program and to ensure its irreversibility. Other
actions were included with a view to improving the overall environment for banking. The
Government has already completed the required actions for corporate governance and handed
over the three banks to qualified foreign and local investors. In addition, the Government has
taken steps to further strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework for banking,
improving transparency and disclosure and preventing the possible use o f the banking system for
money laundering. The Government i s also committed to continue with the second-generation
financial sector reforms as part o f its economic growth and poverty reduction strategy and its
objectives and strategy are explained inthe LDP.

A.      Prior Actions

51.     Privatization of HBL. The Government carried out extensive operational restructuring
o f HBL since 1997 with support under B S A L and BSRPP. To enable its sale, government also
had to address the bank's negative capital position.          These efforts paid off when HBL was
successfully privatized in January 2004. A strategic equity stake o f 51 percent was sold to the
Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development for a total bid price o f Rs.22.40 billion (US$390
million) and the hand over o f bank's management was completed inFeb. 2004.

52.      In 1998, the Government agreed to re-capitalize the bank and injected Rs.9.7 billion
which was followed by another injection o f Rs.8 billion (a total o f about $275 million) initially
given as an advance against rights issue in 2000. The amount o f Rs.9.8 billion ($172 million)
was also provided in the form o f bonds in 2003 in recognition o f previously unrecognized
expense. Another Rs.2.2 billion ($39 million) were given in bonds against the bad debts dating
back to 1992/3 and Rs.1.2 billion ($20 million) transferred to the CIRC.

53.      The process o f HBL'sbalance sheet restructuringhas cost the Government an amount o f
Rs.30 billion (excluding the costs o f VRSs) or approximately US$500 million. The total cost o f
restructuring comes to US$270 million after taking into account the sale proceeds of 51 percent
shares. Privatization will, however, result in additional revenues for the Government once it
disinvests the remaining49 percent shares sometime inthe future.

54.      Privatization of UBL. The Government also initiated restructuringUBL for its ultimate
privatization from 1997. Despite facing a more challenged financial situation at the outset, the
restructuring o f UBL proceeded at a faster pace (in part due to the unquestionable need to take
drastic measures at the very outset o f the rehabilitation exercise).            As a consequence of the
rigorous approach which was adoptedwith regards to UBL,in October 2002 the Government was
able to sell a 51% shareholding in the bank to a consortium of a UAE bank (which already had a
Pakistan presence) and a reputable UK businessperson o f Pakistani origin.                       However, the
proceeds o f $177 million received for the 51% stake do not come close to covering the costs
incurred by Government inthe restructuring process. Similar measures were appliedto those that
were later used for HBL, including a total o f almost Rs.26 billion ($530 million) in capital
injections (commencing with Rs.21 billion re-capitalization in M a y 1998), tax refunds o f Rs.5.4
billion ($91 million), transfer o f NF'Ls and other operational restructuring actions. With UBL's
sale inOctober 2002, the total cost to the Government o f UBL was about $630 million.

55.       Change of Ownership and Management in ABL.                          For the last few years, the
Government and SBP were making efforts to resolve the complex legal and transactional issues
which had been a challenge from the time o f SBP intervention. The transaction was not a typical
privatization exercise. It required creative structuring to resolve the situation for handover o f
A B L ' s management and ownership to a strong and credible private owner.

56.       Considering ABL's precarious financial position with a negative equity o f Rs.3.97
billion, SBP structured sale o f additional shares o f 75.35 percent o f the aggregate paid up capital
through a limited public call for offers.

57.       To realize the sale, SBP invited offers from seven private sector parties that had indicated
interest in acquiring the institution through submission o f Expression o f Interests (EOIs). Five
investor groups were pre-qualified for bidding which was held on July 23, 2004. ABL was sold
to the highest bidder at a price o f Rs.14.2 billion ($240 million) which included a per share
premium o f Rs.33.7 over par value. The Government issued its notification authorizing the sale
o f additional shares to the Group on July 24, 2004. With the payment in full, ABL was handed
over to the consortiumo f M/sIbrahim Group/Leasing.

58.       With these recent successes inprivatizationnearly eighty percent o f banking sector assets
i s in private hands - the table below provides the distribution o f assets, deposits and equity

59.       Developing effective regulatory and supervisory capacity at SBP. The SBP has
introduced a new system o f monitoring, surveillance, and supervision, institutional Risk
Assessment Framework (IRAF). This i s aimed at ensuring a cohesive and proactive monitoring
through preparation o f risk profiles o f individual institutions and taking prompt corrective action
as and when called for.         In addition, separate sets of regulations have been introduced for
corporate finance, SME finance, consumer finance, micro-finance, NBFCs, and insurance
companies. The aim i s to bring about a more systematic and risk-focused supervision and
regulation o f financial institutions. Finally, the SBP has issued guidelines on risk management
for banks/DFIs in order to ensure a more effective system o f risk identification, assessment,
measurement, monitoring, and mitigating/controlling all risks inherent inthe business o f banking.

60.      Promoting transparency and disclosure. The SBP has taken a number o f steps to
promote transparency and disclose through issuance of a master circular containing consolidated
instructions on financial disclosure. Banks have been asked to publishfinancial statements every
quarter. New formats for reporting o f financial information have also been circulated and
enforced. The formats are based on I A S to avoid miscommunication and bring standardization.
These guidelines have brought about improved disclosure and full compliance with prudential
regulations.

61.      Prevention of the possible use of the banking system for money laundering,
financing for terrorism, and transfer of illegalhll-gotten money. The SBP has taken steps to
prevent the use of banking channels for the purpose o f money laundering. The measures include
the establishment ofAML Unit,andissuance ofprudentialregulations, The Unitis entrustedwith
the responsibility o f bringing rules and regulations in line with international best practices and
developing an effective regulatory system that minimizes the possibility o f money laundering and
financing o f terrorism. The SBP has also issued minimum guidelines to be followed by banks
while opening and dealing with accounts o f the customers.             The SBP has issued prudential
regulations on Know Your Customer, Record Keeping, and Reporting o f Suspicious
Transactions.

B.        Bank Groups' CAS and the Government'sPRSP

62.       Based on the Government's strong progress inimplementing reforms, Pakistan CAS fully
recognizes and supports the banking sector reforms and i s aligned with the Government's Poverty
Reduction Strategy. The Government regards the financial sector reforms as central to its poverty
reduction and growth strategy and the PRSP clearly states the Government's medium term
strategy on the financial sector.           The vision being o f a financial sector that intermediates
effectively and caters to all segments o f the society thereby contributing to increased growth and
reduced poverty inthe long run.

63.       The broad PRSP objective for the financial sector i s to improve governance through
restructuring, privatization, and strengthening banking supervision. Specific areas o f importance



                                                      18

within the sector include: integration o f NSS rates with rates o f comparable market instruments;
rationalization o f taxation on banking; privatization o f NBP; bringing the three restructured DFIs
to the point o f sale or closure; restructuring o f SME Bank and ZTBL; implementing Anti Money
Laundering legislation and preparing bankruptcy legislation, further developing the pension and
insurance systems and improving the overall framework for contractual savings.          The Poverty
Reduction Structural Credit (PRSC) which supports the PRSP was recently approved by the
Board.

64.      Inline with CAS and PRSP, the Bank has continued its support to Pakistan's financial
sector reforms through FSDIP, BSAL, and BSRPP. The Banking Sector Technical Assistance
Project, approved in July 2002, supports further strengthening o f the SBP and the SECP. The
recently approved 2"d Poverty Alleviation Project also aims to enhance access to finance for the
poor. Future assistance will focus on consolidation of,existing reforms and further deepening o f
the financial sector.

65.      The size o f the proposed credit i s in line with the 2002 Country Assistance Strategy and
reflects Pakistan's growing need for external financing support.        The CAS Progress Report
indicated that the Banking Sector Development Policy Credit (BSDPC) would total $175 million
in IDA with the Government of Pakistan assuming a larger share of the total costs of balance
sheet restructuring. However, this size was recently reduced to $100 million because o f lack o f
availability in IDA resources. In addition, since the summer, the current account and federal
budgethave experienced pressure from the rise ininternational oil prices. While the Government
i s considering a number o f measures to address this issue- including adjusting prices to avoid
pressures on the budget it expressed its desire to reduce the share o f total bank re-capitalization
                           -
costs financed fi-om the budget. Therefore, duringnegotiations it has requested additional support
from the Bank, i.e. $200 million in IBRD financing, to be added to the $100 million IDA. Even
with this additional support from the Bank, the Government o f Pakistan is bearingthe majority o f
the costs o f bank restructuring and privatization, which overall have cost the Government about
$2 billion since the reform program was initiated in 1997. This level o f IBRD financing i s
consistent with the original CAS high-case lending program which foresaw IBRD adjustment
lending o f $600 million over FY04-05 - total IBRDborrowing over this period i s now expected
to reach $400 million ($50 million inFY04 and $350 million inFY05).

66.      Both the PRSP and CAS recognize the importance o f financial sector reforms for
accelerating economic growth and reducingpoverty.

C.       Partnerships with other Donors and Agencies

67.      The Bank has worked closely with ADB and the Fundinpolicy dialogue and reforms o f
the financial sector.    The ADB has focused on strengthening of capital markets and has an
ongoing Financial (Non-Bank) Markets and Governance Program. Inaddition, the ADB, Bank,
and the Swiss Development Corporation have supported development o f the regulatory
framework for micro-finance. The EU in coordination with the Bank has provided budgetary
assistance for the Financial Sector Services Reform Program for efficient regulatory framework
and improved financial services to rural areas. UNDP has also supported capacity building
initiatives o f SECP and SBP. In addition, the Bank and the Fund have worked and recently
concluded a country Financial Sector Assessment Program. Inpreparation o f BSDPC there have
been regular coordination meetings with other donors and in particular the IMF due to the
budgetary support nature o fthe program.

D.       FinancialAccountability and FiduciaryEnvironment

68.      Quite apart from the significant reforms already beingregistered in the area o f corporate
governance and specifically inthe regulation and enforcement mechanisms inthe Banking sector,
Pakistan has achieved some considerable improvement milestones in the public financial
management and accountability reform agenda.             The CFAA, delivered in December 2003
highlighted a series o f required actions by the government to further improve on the
accountability framework in the public sector. The report dilated on the specific weaknesses in
the budget formulation and execution, accounting, internal control and financial reporting,
external audit, and legislative oversight at all levels o f government. It however concluded that,
notwithstanding the ongoing reforms and a series o f other actions required to further improve the
accountability framework in Pakistan, the fiduciary risk to Bank funds and other donor funds
managed through mainstream government systems i s minimal.                It cited improvements in
expenditure tracking and concluded that adjustment loans disbursed and managed through
reliance on government-own financial management systems have shown satisfactory outcomes.
The report however highlighted the need to register incrementalprogress inbuildinginstitutional
and personnel capacity in order to engender increased comfort and support the transition to full
reliance on government systems, controls and reporting.

69.      Integrating the financial accountability and management reforms in the PRSC reform
actions engendered positive outcomes.              The government introduced new reforms and
consolidated and entrenched ongoing reforms in financial management and procurement areas
with a view to enhancing the effectiveness, transparency, and accountability inthe management
o f public finances.

70.      Specifically, the initiative to launch a review o f obsolete government treasury rules and
design and implement a comprehensive reconciliation o f accounts framework, with the earlier
expectation o f completion in FY 2005 shall now be completed in FY 2006; the PIFRA project
which i s in its last year o f the first phase has produced, so far, 16budgeting and accounting sites,
all operating on the new chart o f accounts using the new accounting model; as a result o f the
progress now being achieved in the implementation o f PIFRA, the federal and NWFP
governments have prepared their budgets solely on the basis o f the new chart o f accounts and are
executing their budgets on that basis. The Sindh and Punjab governments however prepared their
respective budgets on a parallel basis (both new and old charts) but have presented to their
assemblies only on the old chart o f classification. The Balochistan government prepared its
budget only on the old chart o f classification. As o f FY 2006 however, the whole federation is
geared to preparing their budgets solely on the basis o f the new chart o f accounts. This would
indeed be a formidable achievement and a basis point towards preparation o f the federation's
accounts consistent with internationalstandards.

71.      Hitherto, the lack o f timeliness in rendering annual accounts for audit has been a factor
that hindered the timeliness o f audit and presentation o f those accounts to the legislature.     At
present, the Controller General o f Accounts complete the preparation of the federal government
accounts within 6 months o f the end o f the fiscal year and presents the accounts to the Auditor
General for audit. It is, currently, only the provincial accounts which suffer some delay o f up to
an additional period o f 2 months before they are presented for audit. Dialogue with the Office o f
the Controller General to ensure timely completion of all accounts o f the federation is signaling
some positive outcomes.




                                                     20

72.      The first phase o f PIFRA, designed to cover core transactions o f central, non-
departmentalized accounts, strengthen the bifurcation o f the accounting and auditing functions
and introduce a new model o f accounting using a new chart o f accounts, i s expected to be
succeeded by a follow-on project (PIFRA 11). The preparation o f PIFRA I1i s currently being
finalized. It i s designed to extend PIFRA Isites to the remaining 75 district accounts offices, 140
line ministries,     departmentalized accounting agencies,      and provide a comprehensive
computerized budgeting, financial accounting and reporting environment in the government o f
Pakistan.    By these means, the reliability, comprehensiveness, timeliness, and accuracy of
financial and fiscal data for the whole o f the government o f Pakistan will be assured upon the
completion o f the program.

73.      External auditing conducted by the Auditor General o f Pakistan covers the entire
federation.    The timeliness o f audit has been a factor that impaired the financial reporting
outcome.     However, pursuant to the reform actions identified in the CFAA as well as the
measures supported by PRSCI (amplified in the proposed PRSC II), capacity o f the Auditor
                                                                       the
General's Office i s being enhanced under the PIFRA initiative to improve on the quality and
timeliness o f audit through improvements in audit methodology and introduction o f modem
approaches to regularity audit, performance audit, and value for money audit.               A major
component in the proposed PIFRA I1project i s directed to these issues which encompass the
systematic training o f auditors in the use o f computerized auditing and audit management
modules.

74.       Progress has been achieved, since'PRSC I,  inthe establishment and improved functioning
of Public Accounts Committees (PACs).          All provinces and the federal government have
established PACs.       Although there are mixed results in the progress o f individual PAC
deliberations, the federal government, Punjab, NWFP and Sindh governments are making
tremendous progress in dealing with reviews o f audited accounts and audit reports despite
significant backlogs since the Ad Hoc PACs (established after the change o f government but now
defunct). With the approval o f an IDF Grant to support the strengthening o f the federal PAC, the
effectiveness o f the federal PAC will be enhanced when the project becomes effective. This will
be a source o f inspiration to other provincial PACs to improve on their legislative oversight
functions.

 75.      In general, the PRSC is used as the vehicle for initiating financial management action
triggers for advancing on this sector development policy lending. The government's commitment
to improving on the achievements inthe area o f financial management i s more or else resounding.
PIFRA constitutes the core thrust o f the financial management agenda in Pakistan.               The
 government's ownership o f the project as well as its pursuit for a follow-on project to complete
 fundamental reforms initiated and implemented during the first project i s a solid pointer that
reforms are indeed working and, overtime, Pakistan could become proud o f a system that can
pass the test o f time.

E.        Credit andLoanAdministration

 76.      The Government of Pakistan shall establish a Special Deposit Account with the State
Bank o f Pakistan (SBP) into which the proceeds o f the Credit and Loan will be disbursed on a
 single tranche basis. The Rupees equivalent o f the funds inthe Account will, within two working
 days, be transferred into the Consolidated Fundo f the Government o f Pakistan (Account No. 1)
held with the SBP. Disbursements from the Consolidated Fund for activities to be financed under
the Program by the Government o f Palustan shall not be linked to any specific purchases, and no
 special procurement requirement shall be needed. The proceeds o f the Credit and Loan shall,


                                                 21

however, not be applied to finance expenditures in the negative list as defined in Schedule 1 o f
the legal agreements.     If any portion of the Credit and Loan is used to finance ineligible
expenditures as so defined in the DCA, the Bank shall require the Government to reimburse the
amount to the Special Deposit Account to finance eligible expenditures or refund the amount to
the Bank. The SBP, on behalf of the Government, shall maintain an appropriate accounting
system in accordance with generally acceptable accounting principles. The Bank may request an
audit to be carried out, with a view to providing a `special opinion' as to the receipt o f funds into
the special deposit account and the eventual transfer o f the local currency equivalent o f such
funds into the ConsolidatedFundAccount ofthe Government o fPakistan.

77.      Since all prior actions have been completed, the Credit and Loan will be available for
disbursement in a single tranche upon effectiveness.

80.      Profitability and liquidity indicators for the commercial banks have shown a marked
improvement. The returns for the sector also improved despite the decline in the interest rate
environment and reduction in interest margins.          Profitability was helped by cost reduction
measures o f the banks as well as improved economic activity and growth. Liquidityincrease was
a result o f higher remittances and additional flows due to N S S reforms and has led the banks to
diversify their product base. Overall, bank's lending to SMEs and the consumer sector increased
considerably during the last few years - the share o f personal loans (including auto loans),
mortgages and credit cards, which were negligible in the mid 1990s, reached about 15 percent o f
total bank credit flow as o f June 2004.

81.      The banking sector has also become considerably more competitive and responsive. The
Herfindahl index4reflects the decreased concentration and increased competitiveness, particularly
in the field o f advances, where the index level of 780 reflects a relatively high degree of
competition.      The extensive branch networks and government relationships o f the current and
former NCBs has left them with a more dominant position in the market for deposits, hence
greater concentration in this field. A further reflection o f the increased freedom to compete
allowed to the banking sector i s shown in the rapidly improved use o f automation and
information technology in recent years, whereby the number o f online branches increased five-
fold injust three years and the number o f ATMs almost tripled.

82.      Risks: The risks o f the program credit and loan are low with the completion o f all prior
actions. Improvement in financial services and access has contained the political backlashagainst
privatization. However, there i s a risk o f policy reversal, in the medium term, if access to
financial services does not expand further to the rural areas and other traditionally underserved
sectors. Also, NBP still remains under majority state ownership and leaves a window for future
interference, though under the program the Government has committed to preserving its
professional private sector board and management. The Government has listed the bank on the
stock exchange and sold 23 percent o f its shares to the general public which has brought greater
transparency and also plans to privatize the bank over the medium term. N o w that the financial
system that was at the brink o f a crisis in 1996 has been turned around, broader access to finance
by society i s the focus o f further reforms. The Government and SBP have taken concrete steps to
improve the legal and regulatory framework for improving access to financial services for
consumers; micro, small, and medium size businesses. New prudential regulations for these
sectors have been recently introduced. Inaddition, the Government has initiated restructuring o f
the SMEB, ZTBL and HBFC retained under state-ownership, for improving service delivery and
credit flow to the underserved sectors. Privatization o f these institutions would be crucial as the
share o fprivate sector credit to these sectors grows.

 83.     The significant growth in credit to the consumer markets, however, poses a risk and
requires strengthening o f credit appraisal systems and risk management by the banks as well as
strong monitoring by the regulator.              SBP has already issued risk management guidelines,
restricted financing for purchase o f plots alone unless they are accompanied by construction o f


  Herfindahl Index is defined as sum of squares of the market share o f all banks. The maximum value that the index
can assume i s 10,000 i.e. only one bank holding 100 percent market share - absolute concentration. The index i s used
by authoritiesiregulators to measure and control market Concentration. An index value below 1,000 reflects relatively
limited concentration and above 1,800 significant Concentration.

house to control speculation o f land prices, and increased the provisioningrequirements o f banks
including 5 percent general reserves for unsecured and 1percent for secured consumer lending.

84.     There have also been initiatives to promote and expand credit information services inthe
private sector, improving governance and transparency, as well as the legal andjudicial processes
for insolvencyhankruptcy. These initiatives are likely to have a positive impact on improving
access and mitigating risks. Development o f Islamic financing/Islamic banking can also go a
long way inexpanding access inparticular to the segment o f society that has remainedoutside the
banking system for religious reasons. The Islamic system i s based on profit and loss sharing and
requires reliable and transparent information o f income and accounts.     Inthe Pakistani context
where only one percent o f the population actively files income tax, this caries inherent risks.

Strong deposit growth together with the easy
monetary stance o f the SBP contributed to a sharp
decline in domestic interest rates with T-bill rates
reaching all time lows inNovember 2002 matched
by lending rates dropping into single digit for the
first time in nearly thirty years.         The large
reduction in interest rates initiated a resurgence o f
credit demand, taking the FY03 net credit
expansion to an Rs.33.2 billion, over three times
higher than the corresponding FY02 figure. While
a part o f the higher FY03 credit probably reflects
the exploitation of interest rate arbitrage available through NSS instruments, evidence clearly
points to a strong contribution o f increased economic activity as well as the aggressive marketing
o f consumer credit by the banks.

Banks continue to make progress in the recovery o f classified loans. Non-performing loans
(NPLs) fell from Rs.247 billion annually to Rs.222.7 billion (US$3.9 billion) on December 30th
2003. Total cash recovery against NPLs in2003 amounted to PRs 32.2 billion, or 14.5% o f total
N P L s heldby banks, according to SBP data. Provisionsheld by banks rose to 64.3% o f the entire
stock of NPLs, from 60.7 at the end of 2002. Despite low interest rates on bank deposits, they
grew by Rs.150 billion, or 9%, between July 2003 and February 2004, to reach Rs.1800 billion
(US$31 billion).    During this
period the average deposit rates       Table 4: Changes in Selected Banking Sector Indicators

While not o f the same scale as the challenges faced by the NCBs, some o f the local private banks
have also emerged as problem banks, largely due to financial indiscipline and poor corporate
govemance. SBP intervened firmly to address the problems in four private banks, only one of
which now remains as a problem bank. Under the reform program the SBP has introduced a
number o f measures to maintain standards in the private sector, these have included "fit and
proper" tests for directors and senior management, enhanced disclosure requirements and
directives relating to the responsibilities o f directors and risk management guidelines, in addition
to enhanced onsite and offsite supervision.

                  Key BankingSector Recommendations(of FSAP)

Address issues identified in the Basle Core Principal (BCP) assessment, including: revision
and strengthening SBP Act o f autonomy from the Government; clearly define the rules for
acquisitions and major investments o f banks; enactment o f market risk-related computations,
capital charges and a clear definition o f "connected or related parties"; and provision o f legal
authority to SBP to conduct consolidated supervision.         Special consideration to tighten
provisioningrequirements especially inthe light o f recent rapid credit expansion.

Government and SBP should develop a strategy to privatize NBP and continue divestiture o f
capital from other banks.

The authorities should continue phased reduction and alignment o f taxation o f banks and
authorize tax deductibility o f mandatedprovisions for NPLs.

The authorities should address the shortcomings inbanking supervision identified by the BCP
assessment. Inparticular, the missionrecommends:

    i)toamendtheSBPActtostrengthentheautonomyoftheSBPfromthegovernment
         (BCP1(2));

    ii)todefinerulesfor acquisitionsandmajorinvestmentsofbanks(BCPS);

    iii)toenactmarketrisk-relatedcomputationsandcapitalcharges(BCP6);

    iv) to provide a clearer definition o f "connected or relatedparties" (BCP10);

    v) to set out requirements that banks have information and management systems that
         allow for proper identification, monitoring, and collecting o f country and transfer
         risk;

    vi) to give SBP the legal authority to conduct consolidated supervision o f banks
         (BCP20 and BCP24).

Government and SBP should develop a strategy to privatize the remaining public sector
commercialbanks (especially NBP) and continue divestiture from the capital o f other banks.

The development of Islamic financial institutions and to closely monitor the risks associated
withthem.

BSD should continue working on the design o f the stress-testing framework, and use the test
exercise on a routine basis.

Consideration may be given to tighten provisioning requirements, especially in light o f the
recent rapid credit expansions.

On December 1, 2004 the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Pakistan.'

Background

Pakistan has successfully emerged fkom crisis. By 1998199, foreign exchange reserves had virtually run
out, public debt obligations were not being met, and economic growth had slowed to an average o f below
3 percent in 1996197-1998199. In response, the government and the State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP)
implemented a strong macroeconomic stabilization program in the face o f a severe drought and the
adverse post-9/11 environment. These policies are now bearing fruit. Real GDP growth accelerated to 6%
percent in 2003104 (July-June),             driven by exports, investment, and consumption. Inflation has been
contained to 4.6 percent in2003104, though, more recently, 12-months inflation has accelerated, reflecting
supply side factors as well as easy monetary conditions. Foreign exchange reserves have reached 6.2
months o f next year's imports of goods and nonfactor services.

Significant fiscal consolidation has been achieved largely by savings on the interest bill and increases in
revenues. The resulting fiscal space was used to reduce govemment debt while raising social- and
poverty-related spending. In2003/04, the budget overperformed, and the overall deficit (excluding grants)
was limited to 2.4 percent of GDP. Strong revenue collection reflected the buoyant economy and
administrative efficiency gains. Support to public enterprises, and particularly power utilities, was
reduced, due to better financial performance by these entities.


  ' Under  Article IV o f the IMF'sArticles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
  staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
  developments and policies. On retum to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
  Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman o f the Board, summarizes the views
  o f Executive Directors, and this summary i s transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views o f the
  Executive Board as expressed during the December 1, 2004 Executive Board discussion based on the staffreport.

The SBP has started to tighten monetary policy. Rapid growth of broad money in 2003/04 has been
driven predominantly by private sector credit growth in an environment o f low interest rates and ample
liquidity. In response, the SBP has raised treasury bill cut-off rates in recent months. However, policy
makers resisted market pressures to tighten more quickly inan effort to balance their inflation and growth
objectives.

The external position remains comfortable. The current account registered a small surplus in 2003/04,
despite high imports, reflecting strong domestic demand and rising international oil prices. The
government and other entities prepaid some relatively expensive external debt, taking advantage o f the
favorable exchange rate and reserve inflows. SBP foreign exchange reserves increased to $10.6 billion at
end-June 2004. The real effective exchange rate appreciated somewhat since the beginning o f 2004, given
inflation differentials with Pakistan's trading partners and efforts by the SBP to smooth exchange rate
volatility.

There i s no clear evidence yet on poverty trends due to a lack o f comparable current data. Encouragingly,
per capita GDP has grown significantly. However, real wages inthe manufacturing sector have declined
by 7% percent in real terms since 2000/01. Real per capita health expenditure grew on average by 5
percent, and real per capita education expenditure by 10 percent since 1999/00, albeit from low levels.
This should at a minimum establish the preconditions for sustained poverty reduction in the future.
Pakistan i s still ranked low inthe 2004 UNDP human development index.

Structural reforms aimed at establishing a modern economy were successful in many areas. The banking
sector i s more competitive and efficient following restructuring and privatization, as well as the
strengthening o f supervision and prudential regulations. The revenue system has benefited from
administrative reforms, elimination o f exemptions, as well as reductions and rationalizations o f customs
tariffs and tax rates. Pakistan has liberalized its trade regime substantially inrecent years, reducing tariffs
and removing nontariff barriers, and now has one o f the most liberal trade regimes in South Asia.
Reforms in the power sector are advancing with the unbundlingo f the Water and Power Development
Authority into generation, transmission, and regional distribution companies.

The role of the state inthe economy has diminished and governance improved. Governance in fiscal and
 financial management has been strengthened, but wealmesses remain in the energy sector, tax and local
administration, and the police. Regulatory agencies to protect the consumer and ensure stability have been
 established in many areas. However, government intervention continues to be evident in the wheat and
 cotton markets and inthe pricing o f petroleumproducts and electricity, which has undermined the budget.

ExecutiveBoard Assessment

 Executive Directors noted that Pakistan has successfully recovered from the 1998/99 crisis. Growth has
rebounded in 2003/04, and fiscal adjustment, supported by official inflows and debt relief, has led to a
 substantial improvement in public and external debt indicators. Reflecting strong export growth and
remittances, the balance o f payments has strengthened and international reserves now cover over
 five months o f imports. Directors attributed Pakistan's recovery to the steadfast implementation o f sound
 economic policies and broad-based structural reforms, while noting that external support has also played a
part.

 Directors observed that, notwithstanding these significant achievements, poverty remains widespread and
 social indicators are weak in Pakistan. Thus, they considered that the key policy challenges for the
 medium term are to maintain strong economic growth and to ensure that this i s translated into a
 significant reduction in poverty. In this regard, Directors supported Pakistan's ambitious growth targets,
 but cautioned that these would be realized only if the reform agenda laid out in the Poverty Reduction

Strategy Paper i s fully implemented and external factors are favorable. In particular, Directors
emphasized the need for deepening structural reforms to improve the investment climate and governance,
including through continued privatization and trade liberalization. At the same time, they noted the
importance o f enhancing human capital and labor productivity through greater and more efficient
spending on health and education, Directors also underscored that accelerating growth will require the
continuation o f sound macroeconomic policies. They encouraged the authorities to take advantage o f the
current favorable conditions inpursuingthese challenges.

Directors viewed Pakistan's near-term economic outlook as positive. They thought that broad-based
growth of over 6percent could be maintained in 2004/05, and considered the projected shift in the
external current account to a small deficit appropriate given Pakistan's development needs. They urged
the authorities to resist any pressures for easing financial policies.

Directors commended the authorities on the progress made with fiscal consolidation. They noted,
however, that Pakistan's debt burden i s still relatively high. Inthis context, Directors viewed the fiscal
policy stance in 2004/05 as appropriate, as it ensures both a further reduction in the public debt burden
and an increase in social and development spending. The highoil prices represent an important risk to the
budget, however, and Directors stressed that the rise in international oil prices should be passed on to
domestic consumers to safeguard fiscal targets.

Directors agreed with the authorities' medium-term fiscal strategy. They welcomed the planned increase
in social spending, which they considered a necessary condition to move toward the Millennium
Development Goals. Directors emphasized that raising social spending while lowering the still high debt-
to-GDP ratio i s possible only if the targeted increase in the revenue ratio i s realized. In this regard,
Directors encouraged the authorities to pursue more ambitious revenue targets and to expand the tax base
further into the services and agricultural sectors. Directors expressed concern about the new tax
exemptions granted in the 2004/05 budget and urged the authorities to safeguard the integrity o f the tax
system, which has been strengthened over the last years through hard-earned reforms. Directors also
noted that the fiscal strategy calls for subsidies to the energy sector to be reduced significantly. They
regretted the recent delays in implementing energy sector reforms and urged the authorities to speed up
the reformprocess, inclose coordinationwith the World Bank.

Directors noted that the provincial and local governments will now have the main responsibility for the
provision o f social services. This step should, however, be followed up by administrative and financial
 devolution and also be supported by measures to enhance accountability, so as to enable the lower levels
 of government to carry out their increased responsibilities more effectively. Inthis context, and given the
lack o f recent poverty data, Directors welcomed the launching o f recent household surveys that are
expected to provide insights into poverty incidence and trends. They also welcomed the authorities'
intention to deepen the poverty and social impact analysis o f their policies.

Directors considered Pakistan's prospects for achieving external debt sustainability to be good. K e y
 indicators o f external indebtedness are projected to decline significantly over the next several years.
Nonetheless, given the still high external debt burden and the dependence on external nontax revenues
and grants, it will be crucial to limit the budget balance, excluding grants, to about 3 percent o f GDP over
the mediumterm, as envisaged inthe fiscal strategy.

Directors expressed concern about the increase in inflation over the past year. They welcomed the recent
increase in interest rates, but urged the authorities to tighten monetary policy promptly and more
 forcefully to avoid inflationary expectations becoming entrenched. They recommended that monetary
policy be focused primarily on maintaining low inflation. Directors noted that a further tightening of
monetary policy will also alleviate recent pressures on the exchange rate. Directors considered the level of

the real exchange rate to be broadly appropriate, but noted that external competitiveness needs to be
monitored closely inview o f the uncertainties facing Pakistan, particularly stemming from the removal o f
quotas on textile and clothes imports by industrial countries. Directors emphasized that competition-
enhancing structural reforms are the most effective approachto maintaining Pakistan's competitiveness.

Directors were o f the view that financial reforms have resulted in a more efficient and resilient financial
system. However, they cautioned that banking supervision needs to be vigilant to ensure that rapid private
sector credit growth does not weaken banks' balance sheets. Directors encouraged the authorities to
continue their reform strategy and follow up on recommendations o f the Financial System Stability
Assessment, including strengthening the pension and insurance system. Moreover, Directors urged the
authorities to divest remaining public ownership o f commercial banks. Directors looked forward to the
early passage o fnew anti-money laundering legislationinline with international standards.

Directors welcomed the authorities' efforts to improve the quality, timeliness, and reporting o f
data and Pakistan's participation in the General Data Dissemination System. They looked
forward to further steps to address weaknesses that hamper the analysis o f economic and social
developments to further improve Pakistan's statistics, with a view to subscribing to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard.
