Several lessons were cited:\n            1. To ensure that the banking sector privatization runs\n            smoothly, the government  has to \"own\" the\n            initiative. Setting conditions alone id insufficient; the\n            government has to comply with the spirit of the agreement.\n            2. To ensure a smooth transition from a nationalized to\n            privatized bank, ipublic sector banks need to undergo cost\n            and operational restructuring before privatization. 3.\n            Cultural change in the organization must be inculcated prior\n            to privatization. 4. A public sector bank should be\n            recapitalized before privatization or at the point of sale\n            so that it will be able to meet the central bank's\n            minimum capital requirements. Under no circumstances should\n            the supervisory authorities allow regulatory forbearance for\n            the newly privatized bank. 5. Government-related business\n            should not be conveyed to the privatized bank as it is\n            important that the bank begins its operations on a level\n            playing field. 6. The government can expect higher bids for\n            the bank sale if the payment for the bank's shares is\n            injected right back into the bank rather than given to the\n            government as consideration for its existing shares in the\n            bank. 7. Enhanced regulatory and supervisory capacity serves\n            to improve the efficiency of banks and enhances competition\n            among them. Foreign banks and the National Bank of Pakistan\n            (which is still majority government-owned) should be subject\n            to the same regulations as domestic private banks, creating\n            a level playing field in the banking sector. 8. The higher\n            value of the shares in a privatized bank and the broader\n            range of financial products at competitive prices usually\n            offset part of the restructuring costs. 9. Reforms in the\n            rest of the financial sector should keep pace with those in\n            the banking sector. 10. Irrespective of costs, restructuring\n            is necessary to restore the safety and soundness of the\n            financial system."}, "docdt": "2006-01-17T00:00:00Z"}
