LIAODONG BAY PETROLEUM APPRAISAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(Loan 2708- CHA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Liaodong Bay
Petroleum Appraisal and Technical Assistance Project in China, for which Loan
2708-CHA in the amount of $30 million was approved on July 1. 1986. The loan
was closed on schedule on December 31, 1989. Loan savings of $15.9 million
were cancelled. The last disbursement was made on January 16, 1990.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Energy and Industry Division of
the Asian Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and
the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's PCR mission in
April 1990, and is based, inter alia, on the President's Report; :he Loan and
Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and
the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

LIAODONG BAY PETROLEUM APPRAISAL AND TECHNlCAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(Loan 2708-CHA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Obiectives
1.       The objectives of the project were to assist BOC in:  (a) an
appraisal of the JZ 20-2 structure, its first oil/gas discovery in Liaodong
Bay; (b) a review of the regional geological prospects; (c) the planning and
financing of an optimum program for oil/gas development, including foreign
equity participation; (d) developing BOC's technical, financial and managerial
capabilities in offshore petroleum operatio-.s; this would in turn help
strengthen its position as a joint venture partner in these activities (Part
I, para. 3).
Implementation Experience
2.       The project was implemented successfully, on schedule and within
budget. During the course of project implementation, the project scope was
modified as more data on the reservoir became available (Part I, paras. 7-10).
In particular, the structure turned out to be more complex than anticipated
and the number of appraisal wells was increased in order to prove up more
accurately the reserves. Moreover, the reservoir proved to be primarily a
gas/condensate field rather than an oil field. In light of the high economic
and environmental costs entailed by flaring gas during production testing, and
the prospectiveness of the surrounding area which could be used as a backup
for gas supply, BOC decided, in consultation with Bank staff, to combine the
production testing with the first phase of gas development which is beyond the
scope of this project.
3.       Of the six studies provided under the project, four were completed
satisfactorily while the remaining two studies were no longer necessary (Part
I, para. 20). Of the original Bank loan of $30 million, $15.9 million
(53 percent) were cancelled as a result of foreign exchange savings and sub-
stitution by grants from donor countries and international oil company (Part
I, para. 12).
Results
4.       The project objectives have been largely met.  Specifically,
appraisal of the JZ 20-2 structure as well as a review of the regional geolo-
gical prospects in Liaodong Bay were completed efficiently. The objective of
transfer of specialized technology and institution building was largely
achieved through on-the-job training by international consultants and contrac-
tors for the various studies and well services, by importation of modern



- iii -
equipment and related training by the suppliers, as well as by overseas train-
ing. E,wever, the Bank's original objective to promote private equity finan-
cing and limited recourse debt financing for the eventual development of
JZ 20-2 structure did not materialize since the oil reserves proved to be too
limited to be economically developed. In sum, the results of technical assis-
tance and training were mixed but largely positive in enharcing BOCs capabil-
ity in offshore petroleum technology, which in turn strengthened its effec-
tiveness as a joint venture partner with IOCs in these activities.
Sustainability
5.       There is a reasonable chance that the rotential benefits of field
development could be sustained. The gas prospects in the surrounding area are
expected to provide backup gas supply. thus minimizing the risk of any gas
supply shortfall at later stages of field development. BOC has developed
local capabilities which can now handle the construction of offshore struc-
tures and development/operation of offshore petroleum projects with limited
external assistance.
Findings and Lessons Learned
6.       The significant variance between appraisal and latest estimate of
petroleum reserves demonstrates the geological risks associated with all
petroleum operations, particularly at an early stage of exploration (Part I,
para. 16). Such risks and uncertainty were recognized at the time of project
appraisal, and the project had been designed to minimize potential risks and
investments. In particular, exclusion of eventual development investments
from the scope of a petroleum appraisal project, proved to be prudent and
appropriate (Part I, para. 5).
7.       This was the fifth Bank-financed petroleum project in China and, as
such, the formulation of project organization built on the lessons learned
from earlier petroleum projects. In particular, in order to avoid delays in
procurement, BOC was given the autonomy to undertake procurement directly
instead of procuring through an agent. Such streamlining of procurement
responsibilities proved to be efficient and effective, thanks to the good
project management of BOC and assistance provided by Bank staff.
8.       As exemplified by the fact that about half of the loan was cancelled,
BOC was not highly dependent on Bank financing of the project. Nevertheless,
the Bank did play a significant catalytic role in technology transfer and
institution building through the various technical assistance and training
components built into the project design. In general, the Bank performed
well, assisting BOC at all stages of project preparation and implementation.
However, Bank efforts in supervision of the gas utilization study appear ina-
dequate mainly due to staff constraints (Part I, para. 29). In retrospect,
more attention should have been paid to the balance of specialization repre-
sented in supervision missions in order to ensure that the various multidisci-
plinary components of the project would be supervised adequately and the rela-
ted objectives would be achieved.

PART I. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
A. Project Identity
Project Name: Liaodong Bay Petroleum Appraisal and Technical Assis-
tance Project
Loan Number : 2708-CHA
RVP Unit    : Asia Region
Country     : China
Sector      : Energy
Subsector   : Petroleum
B. Background
1.       In line with China's plans for continued economic development, oil
and gas production is targeted to increase significantly from the present
level. Since natural production decline has already set in for most of the
major oilfields in the country, efforts to attain the long term production
targets call for major new initiatives to accelerate exploration both onshore
and offshore. In recognition of its technological and financing constraints,
China began to open up the offshore acreage to international oil companies
(IOCs) in 1979 and over forty contracts were concluded with IOCs during the
last decade. In addition, China is continuing on its own a relatively small
offshore exploration program, mainly in Bohai Gulf off the northeast coast of
China. In 1984, the Jinzhou (JZ) 20-2 structure was discovered by the Bohai
Oil Corporation (BOC), a subsidiary of the China National Offshore Oil Corpo-
ration (CNOOC). This was the first oillgas discovery in Liaodong Bay of Bohai
Gulf; other prospective structures have bince been found by BOC in the sur-
rounding offshore region (IBRD Map 19503R).
2.       In 1985 BOC requested for Bank assistance in the appraisal of the
JZ 20-2 structure. However, given the relatively high risks of exploration,
Petroleum Lending Guidelines (OMS 3.82) specify that the Bank would not nor-
mally finance appraisal drilling by a national oil company alone. Neverthe-
less, after extensive deliberations during project processing, Bank presence
was considered justified in this case in view of the following: (a) most of
China's offshore acreage was already opened to IOCGs participation; (b) BOC
had already undertaken a substantial portion of the exploration risk in the
structure to be appraised. Based on the limited reservoir data available at
that time, it was unlikely for BOC to be able to attract a private partner on
terms which would be in its financial interest. On the other hand, BOC had
indicated its intention to seek foreign equity financing in the development
stage and completion of the petroleum appraisal program would be the requisite
first step; (c) the Bank's objectives to assist BOC in its endeavor to attract



-2-
foreign equitv, in technology transfer and institution building; and (d) the
project was appropriately designed to minimize potential risks and related
investments.
C. Proiect Obiectives and Description
3.       The objectives of the project were to assist BOC in:  (a) an
appraisal of the JZ 20-2 structure; (b) a review of the regional geological
prospects in Liaodong Bay; (c) the planning and financing of an optimum pro-
gram for oil/gas development, including foreign equity participation;
(d) developing BOC's technical, financial and managerial capabilities in off-
shore petroleum operations; this would in turn help strengthen its position as
a joint venture partner in these activities.
4.       The project comprised:  (a) processing and interpretation of some
5,000 km of 3-D seismic data acquired ir. the project area; (b) drilling and
testing of five appraisal wells and installation of offshore facilities to
enable a long-term production testing; (c) provision of equipment to
strengthen BOC's data processing facilities, well testing and core analysis
capabilities; (d) carrying out special tests, laboratory work and six studies
to assist in the evaluation and future development of the discovery; and
(e) training of BOC geologists and eagineers in offshore operations among
other special petroleum industry topics.
D. Proiect Design and Organization
5.       BOC's original request for Bank assistance covered both appraisal and
development of JZ 20-2 structure in Liaodong Bay. Taking account of the pre-
liminary nature of the reseivoir data at that time, the Bank suggested that a
two-stage approach be adopted whereby immediate assistance would be provided
for the appraisal of the petroleum resources, design of its development and
related studies and training, to be followed by future Bank assistance, if
warranted, in the full-scale development of the field. This approach, which
was accepted by BOC, proved to be prudent and appropriate in light of the
significant variances between appraisal expectation and actual well results
and consequent development plan (para. 16).
6.       The project was implemented by BOC, with the assistance of local and
foreign consultants/contractors. This was the fifth Bank-financed petroleum
project in China and, as such, the formulation of project organization built
on the experiences from earlier projects. In particular, considerable delays
in procurement were initially encountered by onshore petroleum projects mainly
due to lack of experience with Bank procedures and insufficient coordination
among the various entities concerned. In order to avoid the above problems,
BOC set up a special project implementation team to coordinate the project.
Moreover, unlike the onshore petroleum bureaus which had to procure through a
procurement agent for Bank-financed goods/services, BOC was given the autonomy
to undertake procurement directly. Such streamlining of procurement responsi-
bilities proved to be efficient and effective, thanks to the good project
management of BOC and assistance provided by Bank staff.



-3-
E. Proiect Implementation
7.       The project was implemented successfully, on schedule and within
budget. During the course of project implementation, the project scope was
modified as more data on the reservoir became available. These modifications
were generally appropriate and were made after consultation with Bank
missions.
8.       Appraisal Wells.  The results of the appraisal wells drilled under
the project indicated that the structure was more complex than had been anti-
cipated and the number of appraisal wells was increased from five to eight in
order to delineate more accuratel, the reservoir and prove up the petroleum
reserves.
9.       Long-Term Production Testing.  This component aimed at reducing the
geological/economic risks of subsequent field development. At the time of
project appraisal, the structure appeared to be a potential oil and gas field
and the long-term testing component was designed for determining more
accurately the deliverability of oil/gas. However, the well results indicated
that the recoverable oil reserves would be too limited for commercial produc-
tion, and the structure could only be developed as a gas/condensate field. Ir.
light of the high economic and environmental costs entailed by flaring gas
during long term production tests, the good results obtained during drill stem
tests of the well3 drilled, and the prospectiveness of the surrounding area
which could be used as a backup for gas supply, BOC decided to combine the
long term production testing with the first phase of gas development which is
beyond the scope of this project.
10.      Studies.  Of the six studies provided under the project, four were
completed satisfactorily, although the scope of three of these studies were
modified from the appraisal scope. The remaining two stuadies were no longer
necessary and were not carried out under the project. Ftrther discussions on
these studies are in para. 20.
Proiec.. Costs
11.      The actual financing requirements (including interest during con-
struction) amounted to $68 million equivalent, as compared against the
appraisal estimate of $84 million equivalent (Table 5A in Part III).  The
share of foreign exchange components were sharply lower than expected (26 per-
cent vs 59 percent); higher than expected local costs were more than offset by
the foreign exchange savings, resulting in an underrun of $17 million or
20 percent of the total financing requirements. The significant cost savings,
in US dollar terms, could be attributed to the following reasons: (i) devalu-
ation of the Yuan--the actual project costs were close to appraisal estimate
in Yuan terms; (ii) depressed market conditions in the petroleum industry
worldwide, which resulted in keen competition among bidders; (iii) reduced
scope of studies and more than expected input from CNOOCIBOC and local consul-
tants in carrying out the studies; (iv) exclusion of the facilities for long-
term production testing (estimated at about $3.5 million); (v) exemption of
import duties and taxes which were included in the appraisal estimate ($3.6
million); and (vi) significantly lower interest during construction mainly as
a result of sharply reduced borrowing for the project.



-4-
Project Financing
12.      Of the original Bank loan of $30 million, $15.9 million (53 percent)
were savings as a result of the foreign cost underrun and substitution by
grants from donor countries and international oil company (Federal Republic of
Germany, UK, Shell International). BOC requested the Bank to consider the use
of the above savings to help finance the development of JZ 20-2 structure.
However, in light of the uncertainties relating to gas reserves estimate (para
16) and the economics of gas field development (para. 23), the proposed use of
savings did not appear to be sufficiently justified; furthermore, the project
description in the Loan Agreeme. t would have to have been modified signifi-
cantly. Instead, the Bank suggested that consideration could be given to
utilizing the savings to support appraisal of other structures in Liaodong
Bay. BOC then decided to cancel the above savings under the loan. Sepa-
rately, $15 million of foreign exchange costs originally expected to be funded
by the Export-Import Bank of Japan were financed by BOC's own resources
instead. A comparison of actual project financing with appraisal estimates is
set out in Table SA, Part III.
Disbursements
13.      Disbursements in the first year were close to the apprai;al esti-
mates. However, 4isbursements became slow as substantial foreign exchange
savings were realized. After cancellation of savings under the loan, dis-
bursements were completed as originally scheduled. Indeed, the disbursement
profile was close to appraisal estimate after adjustment for loan cancella-
tion. A comparison of actual disbursements with appraisal estimates is pre-
sented in Table 3, Part III.
Loan Allocation
14.      The original and actual loan allocation is shown in Table 5,
Part III. Significant underrun in the goods, consultants' services and train-
ing categories reflect the cost savings noted above.
P. Project Results
Proiect Obie_tives
15.      The project objectives have been largely met.  Specifically,
appraisal of the JZ 20-2 structure as well as a review of the regional geolo-
gical prospects in Liaodong Bay were completed efficiently. The objective of
transfer of specialized technology and institution building was largely
achieved through on-the-job training by international consultants and contrac-
tors for the various studies and well services, by importation of modern
equipment and related training by the suppliers, as well as by overseas train-
ing. However, the Bank's original objective to assist BOC in the mobilization
of foreign equity financing for the eventual development of JZ 20-2 structure
did not materialize when oil reserves proved to be too limited to be economic-
ally developed. In sum, the results of technical assistance and training were
mixed but largely positive in enhancing BOC's capability in offshore petroleum
activities, which in turn strengthened its position as a joint venture partner
in these activities.

Petroleum Reserves and Production
16.      The significant variances between appraisal and latest estimate of
petroleum reserves demonstrates the geological risks associated with all
petroleum operations, particularly at an early stage of exploration. At the
time of project appraisal, recoverable reserves from JZ 20-2 structure were
roughly estimated by BOC at 7 million tons of oil and condensate and 5.7
billion m3 of gas. If proven, the annual production rate was projected to be
750,000 tons of oil and condensate and 600 million m3 of gas, for a period of
about 10 years. However, the actual appraisal results indicated that recover-
able oil reserves would be less than 1 million tons and thus uneconomic to be
developed. On the other hand, the structure proved to be a gas field rich in
condensate. According to BOC's estimate, recoverable reserves would amount to
10 billlion m3 of gas and 1.2 million tons of condensate. However, the
consultant for the reservoir study [para. 20(b)) estimated that the
recoverable reserves would be significantly lower, amounting to 6-7.35
billion m3 of gas and 1.26-1.4 million tons of condensate. Based on the
consultant's and BOC's reserve estimates, planned annual gas production of 500
million m3 from the Js 20-2 structure could be sustained for 12-15 years and
20 years, respectively.
3-D Seismic Survey
17.      Foreign consultant and BOC processed 5,600 km of line in two parts,
covering the north and south of the survey area respectively. The results
were good and were used during the appraisal drilling program to delineate the
structure and to locate the welis.
Seismic ProcessinA Center
18.      BOC's seismic processing center has been upgraded by the addition of
two computers, and three seismic interpretption work stations. The center is
now operating at full capacity and processes some 60,000 km of standard line
in 2-D and 3-D models each year.
Ice Sampling Tests
19.      This program is being implemented jointly by BOC and German experts
with grants from the Federal Republic of Germany ($1.04 million). Although
further field testing will be carried out in the 1990 ice season and the
report is not yet finalized, the interim results were used during the design
of the offshore facilitie- for the JZ 20-2 development program.
Technical Assistance and Training 11
20.      Studies.
(a) Regional Petroleum Geological Review. This was originally intended
to be a study which would synthesize the geological data accumulated
by BOC. However, taking into account the large quantity of data, BOC
i/ Includes selected comments in Part II PCR prepared by BOC.



-6
and Bank staff decided that it would be more efficient and cost
effective for the foreign consultants to conduct a review of BOC's
geological results rather than a study. Separately, at BOC's
request, with which the Bank concurred, the scope of the review was
extended to cover SZ 36-1 structure, which is in the vicinity of
JZ 20-2 structure.
Foreign consultant reviewed BOC's regional geological study results
of Liaodong Bay, and made a compilation report giving advice on
improving the methodology and introducing new techiiques in geologi-
cal evaluation. According to BOC, some useful ideas and suggestions
from the consultant have been utilized in BOC's subsequent explora-
tion studies and operations.
(b) Reservoir Study. This study was completed by foreign consultant. In
parallel, BOC carried out its own independent assessment. The afore-
mentioned differences in BOC's and the consultant's estimate of
reserves arise mainly because BOC used the seismic resvlts to define
the reserves of the structure whereas the consultant used seismic,
geological and well results. The interpretation of the well logs and
seismic results is inherently difficult and subjective; the
consultant and BOC estimated different gas zone thickness determined
from the well logs. It appears that BOC is optimistic, while the
consultant is conservative in its interpretation for determining
proven reserves.
The differences in reserve estimate notwithstanding, BOC expressed
its appreciation of the consultant's efforts with respect to on-the-
job training for local counterparts, as well as induction of reser-
voir engineering techniques.
(c) Field Development and Engineering Study. At the time of project
appraisal, this study was to include both conceptual and detailed
engineering design for an early oil production scheme which would
allow for long-term testing. However, as noted above, planned oil
production did not materialize and the detailed engineering design
for field development was excluded from the project. This was the
major reason for the significant cost underrun in consultant ser-
vices. Separately, since project appraisal, BOC secured UK grants
($100,000) to finance training and this component was also exc.uded
from the scope of the Bank-financed study.
The conceptual and basic engineering designlspecifications were car-
ried out jointly by foreign and local consultants. The work was
performed with competence and generally in conformity with interna-
tionally accepted standards. This study would form the basis for the
subsequent detailed engineering design.
(d) Gas Utilization Study. This study was originally intended to extend
beyond the JZ 20-2 structure with a view toward formulating a strat-
egy and investment program for future exploration and development in
Liaodong Bay and assessing the potential gas market in the surround-
ing onshore region. However, the actual scope of this study was



-7-
reduced to cover only the projected gas supply and demand for JZ 20-2
structure.
This study was carried out by CNOOCIBOC rather than by foreign con-
sultants (as intended at the time of project appraisal). While the
recommendation of the study regarding gas utilization is reasonable,
the study only included financial analysis of the i'- estments for
which BOC is responsible (viz gas production, trans ission and pro-
cessing) and omitted the end-user investments (fertilizer plant). As
such, the study did not carry out an economic evaluation from the
country's viewpoint whereby the overall gas development economics
must include both gas production and its end users. This issue was
raised by earlier Bank supervision mission. However, pursuance of
the Bank's objective to strengthen regional gas planning which inte-
grates upstream and downstream activities was apparently hampered by
fragmentation of responsibilities in the sector and inadequate
follow-up efforts by Banik staff.
*d) Computerization Study. Since appraisal, a computerization study was
completed by Shell International for CNOOC and its four subsidiaries
(including BOC) as part of Shell's agreement with CNOOC for an off-
shore concession. This effectively made a separate study by BOC
redundant and was thus excluded from this project.
(e) Feasibility and Financing of Development Study. This study was
intended to assess the economic feasibility of various phased field
development scenarios, and optimal financing arrangements available
to BOC, including private sector equity 2/ and limited recourse
financing. However, since gas in relatively limited quantities was
found instead of oil, it is not likely to attract private sector
equity or limited recourse financing. To develop the structure as
part of a regional development, BOC has obtained, through CNOOC, debt
financing from the international financial market. BOC thus consid-
ered that this study was no longer necessary and Bank staff con-
curred.
21.      Training.  BOC recognized its inexperience in gas/condensate fields
and expressed its appreciation of the Bank-financed study tour on the subject.
In addition, BOC staff received on-the-job training by Bank-financed
consultants and contractors for studies and well services (coring, testing,
seismic and computer center operations). However, overseas short courses of
two to three months were not well received by BOC mainly because of language
problems. Thus, short-term overseas training was reduced sharply from the
training program agreed with the Bank at negotiations. On the other hand, the
longer term training of 23 students on degree courses in petroleum related
subjects (financed by grants and BOC's own resources) proved very effective,
as was the on-the-job training provided by contractors and suppliers of equip-
ment. In addition, overseas training was complemented by considerable local
training carried out with BOC's own resources.
2/ To facilitate this process, a post-appraisal mission held detailed
discussions with CNOOC on the practices customarily followed in the
petroleum industry, and illustrative examples of contracts for various
forms of equity participation were provided to CNOOC for reference.

Economic Evaluation
22.      Successful completion of the appraisal program under the project
brought the level of knowledge about JZ 20-2 structure to the point where a
development decision could be made by BOC. Moreover, the level of information
about the overall prospectiveness of the Liaodong Bay area has been enhanced
under the project. However, given the preliminary nature of the reservoir
data available at the time of project appraisal, it was not possible to quan-
tify the expected appraisal results with any precision. As in the case of
other exploration projects, no economic rate of return was calculated for the
project. Instead, the economic analysis at project appraisal focused on risk
analysis, concluding that there was a reasonable chance of economically recov-
ering oil and gas in the event of development.
23.      Based on BOC's latest development plan of JZ 20-2 structure, the
potential economic benefits which could be reaiized would be critically depen-
dent on the quantity of recoverable gas and condensate reserves (Annex 1).
According to BOC's and the consultant's reserves estimates, the potential
economic rate of return which could be realized from field development is now
estimated at 14 percent and 10-12 percent, respectively. Since any shortfall
in gas supplies that might occur in the later stages of production could be
made up from neighboring gas prospects, it is reasonable to expect development
of JZ 20-2 to yield an acceptable, albeit not high economic rate of return.
Financial Performance
24.      The Bank's objective to promote prudent financial management was
achieved through BOC's compliance with the financial covenants which included
(a) extension of financial planning horizon and furnishing the Bank with a
five-year rolling plan, and annually reviewing such plans with the Bank; and
(b) two financial performance covenants, including debt service coverage and
debt/equity ratios. BOC's finances have remained satisfactory over the past
five years. Salient features of BOC's finances over the period 1985-89,
including both appraisal estimates and actual results, are summarized in
Annex 2.
25.      As in the case of other exploration projects, no financial rate of
return was calculated for the project, for the same reasons noted above for
not quantifying the project economics at the time of project appraisal. Based
on BOC's and the consultant's reserves estimates, the potential financial rate
of return which could be realized from field development is now estimated at
9 percent and 4-6 percent, respectively. The relatively low financial rate of
return reflects the fact that domestic prices are significantly lower than
border prices.
Environmental Impact and Safety
26.      The offshore work in drilling and construction has been carried out
in accordance with internationally accepted norms of safety and environmental
concerns. The wells on JZ 20-2 structure were located in 20 m. water depth,
about 40 km. from shore. BOC took due care in the disposal of drilling mud
and chemicals to avoid pollution hazards. During the short term testing of



-9-
the wells, natural gas and condensate (which did not contain any sulphur) were
flared offshore in accordance with offshore platform safety standards.
Finally, the recommendations emerging from the ongoing ice sampling tests will
enhance the environmental and safety aspects of offshore operations in the
Liaodong Bay area.
G. Proiect Sustainability
27.      There is a reasonable chance that the potential benafits of field
development could be sustained. As noted above, the gas prospects in the
surrounding area are expected to provide backup gas supply, thus minimizing
the risk of any gas supply shortfall at later stages of field development.
BOC has developed local capabilities which can now handle the construction of
offshore structures, and the company can now develop and operate the offshore
area with a minimum of external help.
H. Bank Performance
28.      As demonstrated by the fact that about half of the loan was can-
celled, BOC was not highly dependent on Bank financing of the project. Never-
theless, the Bank did play a significant catalytic role in technology transfer
and institution building; Bank staff assisted BOC in diagnosing its technolo-
gical gap and in designing the various technical assistance and training com-
ponents built into the project. In general, the Bank performed well, assist-
ing the borrower at all stages of project preparation and implementation.
During project supervision, Bank staff assisted BOC with timely procurement
activities and mobilization of consultants, and exchanged views with BOC in
the review of seismic results, well location selections, well results and
various technical studies. Given the contingency nature of certain project
components, the Bank was flexible in varying the scope of the project, as
warranted, when the appraisal results differed significantly from those envis-
aged at the time of project appraisal.
29.      Whereas staff inputs were below Bankwide coefficiei.t for project
preparation, staff inputs for supervision were above average (Table 8,
Part III). This is largely due to the nature of the project whereby (a) the
reservoir data were still preliminary at the time of project appraisal; during
supervision, significant Bank intervention was required as the project scope
evolved with the appraisal drilling results; and (b) the project design cov-
ered multidisciplinary components. Most of the supervision inputs were from
procurement and technical staff while inputs from financial/economic staff
appeared too limited. This apparently contributed to inadequate follow-up
efforts in the supervision of the gas utilization study [para. 20(d)]. In
retrospect, there appears to be scope for improvement in the balance of spe-
cialization represented in supervision missions in order to ensure that the
various multidisciplinary objectives of the project would be achieved.
I. Borrower Performance
30.      BOC formed and maintained the project implementation unit which
worked well throughout the project. Indeed, the fact that the project was
completed successfully on schedule and within budget reflects BOC's good proj-
ect management. Notwithstanding the Bank's reduced financial participation,



- 10 -
technology transfer and institution building objectives were largely met. BOC
deserves much credit for this achievement; it was receptive to the Bank's
recommendations and assistance, and it took initiatives to secure alternative
grant funding to finance selected aspects of technical assistance and train-
ing.
J. Project Relationship
31.      The Bank, BOC and its parent company CNOOC, developed a good working
relationship in the course of project preparation and implementation.
K. Consultant Services
32.      The consultants performed well and their reports were largely well
received by BOC. Moreover, local counterparts who worked with the consultants
received valuable on-the-job %raining.
L. Proiect Documentation and Data
33.      Both the President's Report and Loan Documents provided an adequate
framework for project implementation. Supervision reports provided an ade-
quate review of the progress of the project. The BOC contribution to the PCR.
and their provision of documentation during the PCR mission, was useful for
completing the PCR.

PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE 3/
1.       The encouraging drilling results of JZ 20-2 in 1984 prompted BOC to
stimulate petroleum exploration in Liaodong Bay. World Bank involvement in
Liaodong Bay petroleum appraisal began in September 1985 when a Bank mission
visited Tanggu to assess the possibilities of developing the JZ 20-2 struc-
ture. BOC was very interested in Bank assistance for the preparation and
financing of such a project, and as a result, a close working relationship was
developed.
A. Project Achievements
2.       The project was essentially completed in early April 1989 when the
basic design for development engineering was accomplished. From the effective
date of the Loan Agreement to the completion of basic design took 2.5 years.
3.       Around $14 million was disbursed form the $30 million loan.  During
project implementation, BOC's technical and equipment strength was further
improved. The major achievements were as follow.
4.       Seismic Processing and Interpretation.  A total of 3,000 km of 3-D
seismic data were processed and interpreted.4/ The results were used in the
reservoir evaluation. The BOC's staff who worked with the supervision group
were trained on the job in seismic processing and interpretation.
5.       APpraisal Well Drilling.  Logging, well testing and core analysis
services were provided for the eight-well drilling program. The data gathered
were used in the reservoir evaluation. The results from the appraisal well-
drilling program completed the delineation of the JZ 20-2 structure.
6.       Study and Desijgn.  The following studies and design works were under-
taken including: Liaodong Bay regional geological study review; SZ 36-1 oil
reservoir preliminary evaluation; JZ 20-2 reservoir evaluation and development
engineering conceptual and basic design. These studies were carried out as
follows:
(a) A foreign consultant was engaged to review BOC's Liaodong Bay
regional geological study results. The consultant gave advice to BOC
based on their foreign experiences and practices. Some useful ideas
and suggestions from the consultant have been utilized in BOC's
subsequent exploration studies and operations.
(b) A reservoir mapping expert was engaged to work jointly with a team of
BOC's geophysicists, to integrate all well data and seismic data from
the SZ 36-1 structure and accurately define the shape and limits of
each sandstone bed in the oil accumulation.
3/ Abridged version of BOC's write-up. A copy of BOC's original version
of Part II is in the project file.
4/  By foreign consultants.  In addition, BOC processed and interpreted
some 2,600 km of 3-D seismic data.



- 12 -
(c) The JZ 20-2 reservoir evaluation and development engineering design
was entrusted to a foreign conrultant due to BOC's limited experience
with offshore gas/condensate production. BOC simultaneously carried
out a parallel study for both reservoir evaluation and development
engineering design. By comparing the results of the foreign
consultant and the domestic studies, BOC was able to take a final
decision on the completion of the project.
7.       The consultants provided good on-the-job training and ensured the
transfer of technology to BOC's technicians.
8.       Equipment Procurement.  Project procurement comprised eight contracts
for technical services and 19 contracts for the purchase of equipment and
materials. Except for claim adjustments on completion of contracts, there
were no undue problems with contractor performance. In general, procurement
under the project was satisfactory.
(a) BOC's original computer was replaced by a new 3-D computer processing
system and interpretation stations. The new computer and work
station play a very important role in BOC's ongoing 3-D seismic
processing and interpretation.
(b) The reservoir engineering study was digitalized using the new reser-
voir application computer and software. This software is now in
routine use by BOC's technical personnel.
(c) A development laboratory was established using laboratory instruments
imported under the project.
(d) A drilling shot tool was completed using an imported electronic mul-
tishot survey instrument.
(e) A field production test team was established to use the imported
downhole test tools.
(f) A radio installation for the communications between BOC headquarters
and the JZ 20-2 gaslcondensate field was installed.
9.       Proiect Training.
(a) A study tour financed by the World Bank loan was conducted in Septem-
ber 1986. Gas/condensate fields of four oil companies in the United
States were visited. BOC was satisfied that the results of this
study tour were a major achievement in training the participants.
(b) Five groups of 27 technicians were sent to consultants' overseas
offices for supervision and interim review meetings, and three groups
of 13 foreign experts were invited by BOC to attend the reservoir
study and and engineering design. It gave BOC's staff a chance to
contact foreign experts directly, and gave both the opportunity to
work together and learn from eachother. This was good on-the-job
training and helped in technology transfer. It also provided a good
opportunity for BOC's staff to seek different opinions, discuss new
technology and methodology, as well as to learn the current trends in
research in the international petroleum industry.



- 13 -
(c) The training items involved in the 18 procurement contracts cost
$498,000, that is around 7.1 percent of the total contract price.
Trainees were selected by BOC from all levels of operators who were
familiar with the basic skills required and had a sufficient
knowledge of the foreign language to derive full benefit from the
training. Through training courses, all trainees have learned
operation skills and routine maintenance of the advanced equipment.
10.      Management Improvement.  BOC's staff received training under the
supervision and assistance on technical, financial and institutional subjects
from the World Bank. The main achievements were as follows:
(a) staff from component projects had learned the procedures and methods
of international competitive bidding; and
(b) financial and planning departments learned the methods used in prepa-
ration of project financial analysis and rolling long-term financial
planning. This assisted BOC in improving planning and financial
management.
B. Evaluation of the Roles of the World Bank and BOC
11.      The Role of the World Bank.  The World Bank's role was especially
important in the gas/condensate project in the light of BOC inexperience with
this new resource. From project identification through project implementa-
tion, World Bank staff made a significant contribution to the project.
(a) The World Bank served as a source of impartial advice in technical,
financial and institutional matters.
(b) World Bank staff's knowledge and experience helped to expedite the
decision-making process.
(c) World Bank experts helped BOC's staff to prepare Terms of Reference
for consultants and provided technical assistance to the project
progress, which helped in the satisfactory implementation of the
project.
(d) The World Bank's help in reviewing technical specifications for
equipment procurement, and in providing guidance in the bid
evaluation, helped in making procurement activities more efficient.
12.      The Bank's efforts were particularly effective in the project proces-
sing.
13.      Role of BOC.  In developing an effective relation..hip between the
Bank and BOC, BOC main contributions were as follows:
(a) Before project appraisal, BOC tried to evolve a clear idea of how the
project would be implemented, and to prepare fully the relevant
information in conformity with international practice and the Bank's
special requirements, and to give the Bank missions a thorough



- 14 -
understanding of the project so that they could then help BOC to
determine the scope of the project in accordance with BOC's
capabilities, and strengths and local specific conditions.
(b) BOC was authorized by CNOOC to implement the project, and to contact
the Bank directly on matters of project implementation. This
authorization made it possible to simplify the procedures of project
implementation and contributed to the working efficiency of the
project.
(c) A loan project team was established under the direction of the Deputy
General Manager of BOC for exploration and development. This team
coordinated and supervised the execution of the project.
(d) Drilling progress reports, procurement progress reports and other
project execution status information were regularly provided to the
Bank. A quarterly progress report was submitted to inform the World
Bank of the project implementation status and of any existing
problems.
(e) The project team ensured that the terms of the Loan Agreement, Proj-
ect Agreement, Negotiation Minutes, 'Guidelines' and other documents
related to the Loan were observed and that project implementation ran
smoothly.

ted. Consequently, the number of appraisal wells were increased
from five to eight under the project. This in turn contributed to
the delays in completing certain components under the project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Gas Utilization and Economics
1.       The higher valued components of the gas--ethane, propane and butane
will be extracted from the wet gas at the planned gas processing plant. The
condensate (natural gasoline) will be refined domestically. All the remaining
dry gas will be used as feedstock for fertilizer production.
2.       For the purposes of calculating the economic rate of return for the
development of JZ 20-2 structure, upstream and downstream incremental costs
and benefits from 1989-2011 have been taken into account (Attachment). Since
the decision to develop the structure was made in 1989, all expenditures
incurred prior to 1989 were considered sunk costs. Shadow pricing, the impact
of which is expected to be minimal, has not been applied to the estimate of
ERR.
3.       The quantified benefits have included:  (a) substitution of imported
fertilizers; (b) production of ethane as feedstock for the domestic petrochem-
ical industry; (c) production of propane/butane/LPG as domestic fuels; and
(d) stabilized natural gasoline (from condensate). The economic life of the
gas development, based on BOC's reserves estimate, would be 20 years, with
cumulative gas production of 10 billion m3. The base values of these benefits
are in 1990 prices as follows:
Urea (CIF prices)                          $147/ton      (Y 695/ton)
Ethane                                     $0.12/m3      (Y 0.57/m3)
PropanelbutanelLPG (FOB prices)            $130/ton      (Y 615/ton)
Condensate                                 $155/ton      (Y 733/ton)
4.       Escalation of the prices of urea and the various gas products are
based on the Bank's latest commodity price forecasts (02/08/90) for urea and
crude oil respectively.
5.       The economic cost stream has included both the capital and operating
costs for upstream and downstream, including offshore gas field development
(in three phases) and related infrastructure facilities, gas processing plant
and fertilizer plant.
6.       Detailed economic analysis is set out in the attached tables.  The
results of the economic analysis are summarized as follows:

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Financial Performance
1.       A comparison of appraisal estimates and actual results of BOC's
financial performance is highlighted in the attached table.
Revenue Position
2.       Over the past five years, BOC's operating revenues have mainly been
derived from the contracting of petroleum services to foreign contractors, and
to a far lesser extent, sale of crude oil. While BOC secured a higher volume
of contracting services than anticipated, the profitability thereof was lower
mainly due to sharply higher local inflation rates. On the other hand, deval-
uation of the Yuan allowed BOC to report significant foreign exchange gains
from its substantial US dollar deposits.l/ For these reasons, BOC was able to
maintain a positive revenue position, although its net income is rather vola-
tile in nature due to the uncertainties of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
Funds Flow
3.       BOC's actual capital expenditures were close to appraisal estimates
for the period 1985-87. However, starting from 1988, its capital expenditures
were curtailed sharply from the appraisal estimates, in part because the plan
to develop JZ 20-2 structure as an oilfield did not materialize as the
reserves proved to be too limited to be economic. On the other hand, BOC's
foreign debt service was significantly higher than anticipated mainly due to
devaluation of the yuan. Nevertheless, with the exception of 1988, BOC's
annual internal cash generation was sufficient to meet the debt service cover-
age covenant in the past five years (viz no less than 1.2 times in 1986187,
and 1.5 times thereafter). In 1988 BOC prepaid a substantial portion of its
Japanese loan with its US dollar savings in order to reduce its foreign
exchange exposure. Thus, the actual debt service for that year was abnormally
high and the debt service coverage ratio amounted to only 1.2 times. Should
the loan prepayment portion be excluded, BOC would have met the covenanted
debt service coverage of no less than 1.5 times.
Canital Structure
4.       Throughout the past five years, BOC met the covenanted debt/equity
ratio of no more than 60140. However, its total liabilities/equity ratios
were higher than the appraisal estimates, reflecting substantial short term
1/ The receipts from contracting petroleum services to joint venture
operations are in US dollars.

financing for its capital expenditures as well as increased liabilities on
long-term foreign loans attributable to yuan devaluation. The substantial
mismatch in the maturities of BOC's investment and financing is highlighted by
its weak current ratio, which deteriorated to below 1.0 times since 1988.
BOC's management is aware of this problem and is in the process of restructur-
ing a major portion of its short-term debt into long-term borrowings with the
assistance of its parent company, CNOOC.
Proiect Finances
5.       Based on BOC's and the consultant's reserves estimates, the potential
financial rate of return which could be realized from field development is now
estimated at 9 percent and 4-6 percent, respectively.  The domestic prices
assumed for the various products are as followst
Urea                      Y 6501ton
Ethane                    Y 0.57 In3
PropanelbutanelLPG        Y 5251ton
Condensate                Y 568/ton
6.       A 5 percent sales tax has been assumed in estimating the financial
rate of return. Capital and operating costs are the same as those estimated
for economic evaluation (the project is exempted from import taxes and
duties).
