Economic Crisis, with particularly negative impacts on rural employment and
deteriorating health indicators. In 1999/2000, the country was also undergoing a political
transition and adopted a decentralized and demand-driven approach for the delivery of
basic services, including in the rural water and infrastructure sectors. Indonesia had
experienced successes with the World Bank and donor projects in the years before, and in
the light of the 1997/1998 financial crisis, had the necessary preconditions to become the
recipient of new loans.

The 1997/98 crisis created the need for measures that would provide short-term
employment for returning urban-workers in selected rural areas and maintain the flow of
budget funds to social services and support for the poor. Yet it was projected that
Indonesia would resume the path towards growth and development over the following
five years, and attention in the longer term should be directed to equity needs and growth
in community demand for higher quality social services. Therefore, the challenge at that
time was to design policies, programs and projects that would meet the short term needs
while maintaining progress towards the longer term development goals.

Sector Background
In terms of the water and health sectors in the late 1990s, there was an ongoing dialogue
on the evolving national policy framework for rural water supply and sanitation, and on
the need to address basic infectious and childhood diseases, especially water borne
diseases. In spite of the health gains over the previous 20 years prior to project appraisal,
a core of basic infectious, childhood, and pregnancy related disease problems remained
priorities. The national infant mortality rate (IMR) was higher than expected for
Indonesia's level of economic development at that time. There were many rural areas and
regions where the priority disease profile included diarrhoea, intestinal worms, water
related diseases (including malaria and dengue), macro and micro nutrient deficiencies in
children and pregnant women, low quality of prenatal care and birth, and skin diseases.
These are problems that are most efficiently met with preventive interventions and
selected cost-effective treatment.

The government of Indonesia had taken the lead in successfully addressing these
concerns through the implementation of the first Water and Sanitation for Low Income
Communities (WSSLIC) project which was implemented between June 1993 and
November 1999. During this period, the Bank was an important financial and technical
contributor to integrated water, sanitation and health programs in Indonesia (through both
the Third Health [HPIII] and WSSLIC projects). Consequently, the aim of the second
project, WSLIC II, was to continue to support this process of integration and the delivery
of water, sanitation, and hygiene services to improve Indonesia’s health indicators
through disease prevention. Important lessons learned from the first WSSLIC were taken
into account in the design of the WSLIC II, most notably a reduced project complexity,
direct fund channeling and independent project administration, and strong community
participation.

The project was fully consistent with the then CAS by supporting further decentralization
through increased autonomy and accountability, improving infrastructure services and
public sector efficiency in remote rural areas, and enhancing equitable development. The
project was also aligned with the government’s strategy by conforming to the strategic
trend toward decentralized, demand responsive approaches, community participation, and
streamlined funds channelling and project administration. Government policies and
programs in the health and rural water and infrastructure sectors emphasized
decentralization and demand responsiveness rather than a supply driven approach to the
provision of services. Experience in Indonesia and globally has demonstrated that active
involvement of communities in the planning and design of development activities, and
their control over decision-making, leads to higher levels of demand responsiveness and
hence to more sustainable water and sanitation systems. Women are essential contributors
to community activities and programs related to water. The project conformed to these
strategic directions and recognized the important role of women and emphasized their
involvement.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
 The objectives of the project are to improve the health status, productivity, and quality of
life of poor communities in under-served rural villages in the project provinces. This will
be done by improving the health behavior and health services of the communities related
to water borne diseases; providing safe, adequate, cost effective, and easily accessible
water supply and sanitation services; and developing sustainability and effectiveness
through community participation.

The key-indicators at approval were not changed. Baseline, target and end-line values are
provided in section 3.2 and detailed in annex 2. These indicators included: the targeting
of poor; community participation and capacity building; completed functioning water and
sanitation systems; cost per WSS system and per capita served; knowledge and practice
of good hygiene and health; reductions in disease rate.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

No changes were made in the PDO, but KPI targets and timeframe were revised to reflect
an increased project scope (Schedule 5 of the Credit Agreement was amended in Credit
Agreement Amendment No. 1). Changes in KPI were driven by an increase in the
number of provinces resulting from the division of provinces, which increased the need
for facilitators; monetary gains from exchange rates fluctuation also allowed an increase
in the number of targeted villages.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The main beneficiaries of the project were households in low income rural communities;
the aim was to reach 2000 rural communities with a total population of 3.5million people
who would gain access to more convenient, higher quality, and more accessible water
supply and improved community sanitation services. The project’s recipient provinces
and districts were determined by the Ministry of Health through a ranking system based
on a scoring system made up of a composite of several indicators; poverty, water supply
and sanitation coverage, water/sanitation-related disease prevalence, and presence of
other water and sanitation focused projects.
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
Component 1: Community and local institutions capacity building (34.2 million) The
aim of this component was to assist communities, through service contracts with local
firms, NGOs or academic institutions, to organize effectively and also to obtain the
technical capacity to plan, manage, and sustain water programs, sanitation and
community health. This component was designed so that the participatory methods
employed at the community level would be closely intertwined with hygiene and
sanitation promotion.

Component 2: Improving Health Behavior and Services (13.9 million) The objective
of this component was to improve hygiene, health behavior and community management
of health services related to water borne diseases. Two sub-components comprised a
school health and hygiene program and a community health program. A core part of the
component was the adaptation and implementation of PHAST to be used in communities
and schools. Diarrhoea, skin diseases and worms in children were the special focus of the
component.

Component 3: Developing Water Infrastructure (53.2 million) The aim of this
component was to provide communities with accessible, convenient, and clean water in
adequate quantity in response to demands expressed by them. A demand responsive
strategy was used, requiring community bidding for project participation and community
co-financing (at least 4% in cash and 16% in kind). Communities will have direct control
over sub-project financing through block grants, and control over sub-project design,
providing a choice among a variety of appropriate technical options.

A fourth component Project Management component was estimated to cost 5.4
million.
1.6 Revised Components
There were no components revised in this project.
1.7 Other significant changes
There were several changes made to the project design and timeline during the life of the
project. These changes were mainly borne out of external circumstances triggered by
developments in the international and national water and sanitation sector, lessons
learned alongside project implementation or advantageous currency exchange rates. None
                                           3
of these changes required an actual increase of the initial project funds. Due to certain
flexibility in the original design of WSLIC II, the project could react to these
circumstances and adopt the following changes:

 A participatory monitoring and evaluation system that allowed the project to
  particularly assess the extent of sustainability it was achieving. (see section 2.3 for
  further details)
 The expansion of the project target areas from initially four to eight provinces,
  leading to a 15% increase in the number of target villages together with a substantial
  expansion in the number of community facilitators; changes to the village grant
  guidelines including an increase of the average allocation per village as well as the
  extension of the village grant implementation period; all these changes ultimately
  contributed to achieving 116% of the initial project target.
 The introduction of the community-led total sanitation approach (CLTS) to the
  project, gradually replacing the initial concept of a revolving credit to village
  households that had turned out to be of limited success. Adapting and testing this
  sanitation approach within WSLIC II has substantially contributed to GoI’s decision
  to further develop the CLTS approach to a comprehensive community-based total
  sanitation (STBM) strategy that was subsequently adopted as a national program in
  2008 (see section 2.2 for further details).
 The development of comprehensive impact assessment studies including (a) a post
  construction census (PCC) of completed project villages, (b) a post project household
  survey, (c) an institutional impact study and (d) a health impact study. These studies
  complement the project success of reaching implementation beyond the initial project
  target and provide some wide-ranging findings not only concerning physical
  infrastructure, but also health and hygiene promotion, community management and
  finances and institutional arrangements.
 The extension of the Credit Agreement Closing Date from 30 June 2009 to 31
  December 2010. The main reason for the extension was (a) to support the
  implementation of STBM strategy, and (b) to provide an adequate timeframe to
  conduct various parts of the impact assessment studies. The extension did not require
  any additional funding but in fact included the cancellation of a portion of the Credit,
  which was a surplus despite additional activities.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

Quality at entry was satisfactory. The project was well grounded in the analysis of past
and other similar projects and of both key sectoral and policy issues. Risks were well
identified and risk-minimizing measures were adequately put in place. Especially robust
and innovative was the community participatory process, which resulted in strong

                                            4
manifestation of client ownership for the project. The project design benefitted greatly
from earlier experiences with the first WSSLIC project and in fact was designed as an
improved follow-on.

Focus was given to reduced project complexity. The first WSSLIC project was
chronically hampered by its complex funds channelling, multi-agency administrative
arrangements, and intensive requirements in procurement and administration due to
separation of technical and non-technical contracts. WSLIC II implementation was
designed to have only one line agency execution, the Ministry of Health, with direct
funds channelling and a decentralized implementation plan. This feature not only
improved the design, but was also in line with the new government decentralization
policy.

Project design included concepts of community participation, control, and
willingness to pay. Following the lessons from the first WSSLIC project and other
experiences much attention was given to community participation and innovative
approaches were introduced. Informed choice: the design of WSLIC II included field-
based technical assistance for communities to ensure they have access to the information
they need to make informed choices. Willingness to pay (rooted in the idea of
management of water and sanitation as an economic good): Projects supported by CARE
Indonesia as well as the first WSSLIC demonstrated that even poor households and
communities are willing and able to contribute to both the capital and maintenance costs
of water and sanitation. Rural communities also demonstrated a willingness to support
poorer members through cross-subsidies. The WSLIC II design included a minimum
community contribution requirement (4% of capital costs in cash, 16% in kind) together
with a grant ceiling rule based on the experience of the first WSSLIC. WSLIC II design
ensured communities had control of decision making so that the services provided were
the ones they actually needed and were willing to pay for. WSLIC II incorporated lessons
from earlier projects by developing a funds channelling method that gives communities
control for construction financing and selected health interventions. The WSLIC II
design also ensured space for community capacity building so that all community groups
could have an equitable voice in decision-making. The latter also helped assure sufficient
financial and technical management to operate water and sanitation systems on a
sustained basis.

The Project identified and addressed through mitigating measures several critical
risks, including the key risks pertaining to sustainability. During appraisal the risk
that communities would not perform system maintenance, would not be able to replace
depreciated equipment, or the community and health centers would not sustain the health
component because of the indirect nature of some benefits and the variability of
supplemental budget were highlighted. WSLIC II design addressed these concerns
through the above-mentioned intensive support to community participation and project
ownership, control over resources and attention to coordination with the health sector.
See next section on how these measures played out during implementation.

2.2 Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory

Project implementation was shaped mainly by decisions taken in relation to national
sector policy arrangements, project management arrangements, community
empowerment, developments in the rural sanitation sector and original project features
including a trust fund.

Policy and sector management arrangements
Flexibility and strong integration into government structures allowed the project to
react well to policy changes in the national WSS sector. WSLIC II was planned and
designed in a period shaped by significant transformation and progress in terms of the
national sector policy. A key factor that contributed to the success of the project was its
clearly defined PDO and KPIs, which at the same time allowed sufficient flexibility to
adjust the project’s main approaches to ongoing changes in Indonesia’s dynamic water
supply and sanitation sector. The National Policy for Community-based Water and
Sanitation was a work in progress during the project preparation, and WSLIC II became
the first major CWSS project to be implemented under this new policy, significantly
contributing to operationalize the policy.

Operationalization of the policy was achieved by setting up inter-agency technical
working groups at local level. Together with the help of the AusAID funded Indonesian
Water Supply and Sanitation Formulation and Action Planning facility (WASPOLA),
technical working groups on WSS (POKJA) became a permanent institution both at
national as well as local government level. These POJKAs not only served as newly
established joint, multi-sectoral institutions to oversee the implementation of water
supply and sanitation strategies, but also fostered ownership of the national policy at the
local government level. WSLIC II contributed and benefitted from this development by
successfully consolidating the national policy in the project provinces and districts by
building the capacity of POKJAs. Ultimately, this became a key feature of the
sustainability of the project’s investments and replicability of approaches.

Beyond the technical working groups, several other institutions formed within the
project supported a successful implementation. Village level management structures
evolved, in consultation with relevant government agencies such as MOHA and other
projects, like WSP’s Multi Village Pooling project (MVP) which was exploring and
testing options for strengthening community management and service delivery. At the
district level, these village management groups formed associations which have
demonstrated success in many areas such as (a) advocates for community management
groups in discussions with local government; (b) in the provision of technical assistance
to resolve technical planning, design, operations and maintenance issues; (c) centralised
procurement for key equipment items such as water meters; (d) financial management
advice, for example on tariffs; and (e) in conflict resolution.




                                            6
Project management arrangements

Apart from adjusting to ongoing policy developments, the design of the project
management arrangements was key to successful implementation. Set up in the midst
of the government’s decentralization efforts, WSLIC II needed to find its place within
new emerging responsibilities, administrative authorities and institutional roles. To
achieve this, MOH successfully established a project management structure at all levels
of government. Overall responsibility for project implementation rested with the Project
Steering Committee which comprised senior level representatives from associated
ministries, chaired by BAPPENAS. The Central Project Management Unit (CPMU) in
MOH provided technical guidance to sector agencies, monitored results and advocated
for the project’s integration into local government investment programs. At the province
level, Provincial Coordination Teams headed by BAPPEDA played a useful role in
facilitating coordination between districts themselves as well as between districts and the
CPMU. By delegating management responsibilities to Local Project Implementation
Units (DPMU) within district health agencies, decision-making and transparency at the
lowest appropriate level was increased.

Similar to the POKJAs, project structures needed a mechanism of bringing national
policies and decisions to the district level, building ownership and engagement. In
the beginning, a complex organizational structure and centrally produced detailed
guidelines caused some confusion about roles and decision-making processes. These
guidelines created the perception that WSLIC II was more of a national rather than
district owned program. Hence, strong emphasis was given to close interaction between
central and district level. Through field visits, regular national and local coordination
meetings and a joint annual review meeting, a strong district level ownership could be
fostered. The local government engagement further depended substantially on the
commitment of local government leadership (Bupati) as well as the heads of local health
agencies. Project experience shows that a strong support from these persons enables
DPMUs to function more effectively by guaranteeing the necessary policy and budget
support and inter-sectoral coordination.

Besides committed local leaders, it was critical to have well trained community
facilitators to achieve sustainability of the project at the community level. These
community facilitators are ultimately the project’s daily interface between the
government and the community. Recruiting locally based new university graduates turned
out to be a successful strategy as most of them were willing to live in the villages, work
irregular hours and were less likely to be seen by the communities as ‘government
representatives bringing a project’. This strategy further contributed to capacity building
of these community facilitators who often were subsequently recruited as local public
servants or by the private sector. There were, however, challenges as many of these new
graduates lacked the experience to deal with a variety of issues beyond their job
description, such as dealing with social change strategies, providing mentoring or having
budget for travelling to villages.




                                            7
Community empowerment, poverty and gender

The project’s participatory approach with a focus on gender and pro-poor issues
was key in reaching the community. Through the emphasis on community ownership,
contribution and management, the project received wide recognition for pursuing a strong
participatory approach that was specifically enshrined in an explicit pro-poor and gender
process. Village heads, for example, were required to gain broad community agreement
prior to submitting an expression of interest to be involved in the project. Planning and
design of WSS facilities was then undertaken by the communities themselves, supported
by trained facilitators who helped them analyze their preferences for WSS options. Cost
sharing ensured that the selected facilities were appropriate and affordable and direct
channeling of funds to the villages promoted local control and ownership, which
translated into a higher willingness to collect fees for O&M. Village implementation
teams and post construction WSS management groups were set up to ensure
sustainability beyond the project’s intervention. Challenges regarding this participatory
approach arose due to processes that took too much time during the beginning of the
project.

The project’s gender-related performance was rated as moderate. Despite the fact
that the project used several approaches to strengthen the participation of women and the
poor, a study on gender equity conducted by the Bank found mixed performance for
WSLIC II. The quota system ensured an average participation of 30% women in the
village implementation teams, varying between 16% and 56%. However, heads/deputies
of these teams were usually men, and the report also illustrated that technical, financial,
procurement roles or construction supervision were occupied by men. To enhance
women’s participation a number of approaches were used, such as separate women’s
meetings, ensuring that the poor were informed about community meetings, or social
mapping of the village to ensure transparent decision-making. Reaching women and the
poor worked best through word of mouth while information boards were not very well
noticed by the poor.

Sanitation approaches

Sanitation related activities showed greater success after some changes were made
to the original approaches. Sanitation activities and associated health behavior change
approaches in WSLIC II were generally less successful than the water supply activities,
and only improved performance after some changes were made in a later stage of the
project. The original design of a revolving fund system for household sanitation was
changed to the community-led total sanitation (CLTS) approach, which had been newly
developed and was trialed in some project communities before it was finally adopted
project wide. The success of CLTS within the project also contributed substantially to the
government’s decision to adopt their community-based total sanitation approach (STBM),
an extended version of CLTS.

The original sanitation revolving fund system was not working well in most project
villages. The system comprised loans that were given to individual households for the

                                            8
purpose of constructing sanitation and hygiene facilities. The loans were given to the
households by the villages from a block grant provided by the project in order to finance
initial capital. Repayments by the households were then due over a relatively short
timeframe. This system did not work well in many districts and villages for various
reasons:
 Due to inadequate training of the community facilitators, the communities themselves
   did not understand the revolving fund system very well. This resulted in limited
   interest of households to obtain a loan.
 As the total allocation of funds was limited and managed by the village
  implementation team, it often resulted in very substantial loans being given to a
  limited number of not so poor households.
 There was no medium term planning for sanitation required by project guidelines,
  which is why continued operation of the revolving fund system post construction was
  problematic or failed in a number of villages.
In 2005, some changes were made to the initial project guidelines, requiring a medium
term plan to achieve 100% sanitation access, limiting the amount of fund allocation per
household to IDR 200,000, and introducing a range of technologies as sanitation options
to choose from.

At the same time the CLTS approach proved to be a successful way of changing
communities’ behavior of defecating in the open and creating demand for sanitation
and hygiene facilities at household level. In close collaboration with the World Bank’s
Water and Sanitation program, WSLIC II started field trials of CLTS in a number of
villages from 2005, and finally adopted this approach project-wide. Compared to the
revolving fund (and other conventional ways of improving access to sanitation in rural
areas), several aspects were key for the success of the CLTS approach.

 CLTS focuses on changing people’s behavior related to sanitation and hygiene aspects
  rather than constructing toilets. This creates an actual demand for toilets and increases
  the chance of people using latrines properly.
 The community as a whole works towards achieving 100% open defecation free
  (ODF) status. Through peer pressure and addressing collective feelings of shame and
  disgust, this approach works better than addressing individual households.
 No household subsidies, either in cash or in-kind are involved in the CLTS approach,
  leading communities to take over more ownership over their facilities.
 Communities choose their preferred latrine option individually according to their
  preferences and affordability. Options range from very basic latrines constructed of
  locally available material to more sophisticated, innovative options.

The introduction of CLTS in the WSLIC II design happened in several stages, as
additional socialization, training of government staff as well as community facilitators
were needed to make the approach fully functional.



                                            9
Based on the positive results of the CLTS approach within WSLIC II, the GOI
developed a new strategy of Community-based Total Sanitation (STBM) as national
approach for improving access to sanitation in rural areas. STBM is based on CLTS
but broadens the structure to five pillars: (1) ending open defecation, (2) hand washing
with soap, (3) safe water management at household level, (4) safe wastewater
management, and (5) safe solid waste management. By changing the sanitation approach
from the revolving fund to the CLTS approach, the government demonstrated a strong
commitment to finding and establishing a new way of improving sanitation in rural areas.
However, the approach required the provision of consultant facilitators, and building
capacity to support local governments. This was one of the reasons why it was finally
decided to extend the implementation timeframe for the project from June 2009 to
December 2010. Further lessons learned are described in section 6.

AusAID Trust Fund

Combining the loan with a more flexible trust fund turned out to be a flexible
arrangement for adjusting implementation to arising needs. The AusAID trust fund
of AUD 11,133 million was essential to the success of the project as it was used for
technical assistance and capacity building to the CPMU or community facilitators. Being
independent of government procedures and regulations, the trust fund provided certain
flexibility to undertake activities, which might have been more difficult to realize in the
given timeframe under a loan, for example, hiring an international specialist to prepare an
impact assessment strategy and substantially overview its implementation. This was not
outlined in the original PAD but contributed substantially to GOI’s knowledge for
planning and implementation of future programs.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The project monitoring system was very well developed, with monthly reporting and
computerized analysis. A major component of the overall M&E design included three
inter-related approaches of participatory monitoring, process monitoring, and
sustainability monitoring. Communities monitored the progress of implementation
through the village implementation teams, while the project management through the
DPMUs and District Coordination and Technical Teams monitored the quality of
implementation to identify emerging issues and bottlenecks that indicated flaws in
processes and approaches. The participatory monitoring strategy was designed to collect
data at different points in the project cycle and would enable project units to assess the
extent to which the project was achieving sustainability. The data was obtained through
observations, household visits and focus group discussions. The approach to community
empowerment used in project implementation for assessment and planning became
known as MPA PHAST, an amalgam of two separate approaches to community
participation adapted to water and sanitation. In general terms the project was successful
in developing, implementing and to a certain extent institutionalizing this approach. Some
argue too much time and attention was spent on this aspect of the program which, as it
was new, tended to dominate the initial years of implementation. Efforts did pay off as
thousands of communities and hundreds of community facilitators have been trained and


                                            10
have used the approach successfully. Institutionalization was foreseen and with some
adjustments in approach and reallocation of responsibilities was achieved.

The strong monitoring system not only helped project management to keep a close
watch over implementation, it also helped policy makers adopt new policies. The
results from the implementation were so clear that changes to national policies were
introduced and adopted. A good example of this adoption is the change in approach to
sanitation at the village level, which shifted from use of revolving funds to the so-called
Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) or STBM approach. STBM ensures the
sustainability of the gains in community sanitation through an effective behavior change
approach in its Open Defecation Free campaign. See section 2.2 for more details.

The project included a world-class end-line rigorous impact evaluation, which is
being disseminated widely. Despite an excellent monitoring system, the data by
themselves were not sufficient to be used for impact evaluation; however, baseline and
end line surveys were used to evaluate impact. A rigorous comprehensive impact survey
was therefore included as well. The baseline survey was of lesser quality than expected
and a mid-term survey was never undertaken. This created initial obstacles and need for
additional studies at end line, but the end results were world-class thanks to the high level
attention from the GoI and excellent choice of experts and survey firm. The results are
already being used in international seminars and are helping convince other countries to
adopt similar methods, especially to sanitation. Although the baseline survey was of a
lower quality than the end line, the creative use of the monitoring data and the additional
efforts made for the end line, ensured impact was measured and results can be attributed
to the project activities.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Environmental and Social Safeguards
The project was rated Category B, triggering the following safeguards policies:
1.     Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01)
2.     Natural Habitats (OP 4.04, BP 4.04, GP 4.04)
3.     Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)

As discussed in the PAD, there was no need for in-depth or large-scale
environmental impact assessments or environmental management and monitoring
plans due to the small and low-impact nature of the sub-projects. Instead net
environmental benefits from the improved sanitation projects were expected. The project
has instituted organizational structures through the Community Facilitation Teams that
would address the environmental aspects of the project. During implementation no
safeguard issues were triggered. During supervision, much attention was paid to the
safeguard issues and when needed immediate follow up was given. For example, pointing
out the need for more quality control of water where pumps were built close to fields that
were fertilized. Supervisions also found potential contamination of water sources due to
left out paint cans next to wells. Pointing out the dangers related helped raise awareness
among villagers. No indigenous peoples were severely affected by project or the sub-
projects.

                                             11
The project’s financial management performance is satisfactory. Despite some
challenges early on in the project, the financial management overall is satisfactory. This
is a result of (a) timely submission of the project financial monitoring reports and audit
reports; (b) adequate internal controls at project level and also at community level in
general; and (c) prompt response in resolving issues noted during supervision missions.
The challenges during the initial implementation period were related to (a) delays in the
approval of annual budget; and (b) delays in follow-up actions of long outstanding audit
findings. The budget delays issues were resolved from 2008 onwards, when the budget
documents were issued on time. The challenges related to follow up actions and audits
were affected at the start by the very nature of a community approach. Follow-up actions
of audit findings can be challenging when the community groups’ activities have been
completed for some time.

Procurement encountered issues but overall satisfactory, especially in the last years
of implementation. Particularly, the procurement of technical assistance and service
contractors (consultants) were very significant in terms of management effort and
together with budget issues they had a major impact on project implementation.
Procurement performance from both the GOI and the Bank side varied significantly over
the implementation period. In addition to the central level procurement of technical
assistance and service contracts, there were about 2,300 contracts between the local
government and participating communities.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The GOI developed the Third Community Based Water Supply and Sanitation
Program (PAMSIMAS), the official successor of WSLIC II , after the salient features of
WSLIC II, basically utilizing the same approach but this time expanding coverage to
urban sites and requiring replication in other sites that are funded with local budgets. Out
of the eight WSLIC II provinces, PAMSIMAS is engaged in 5 (Sumatera Selatan,
Sumatera Barat, Jawa Barat, Sulawesi Selatan and Sulawesi Barat). The experience in
these 5 provinces is of great importance as PAMSIMAS rolls out in its 15 targeted
provinces.

Moreover, and a very strong sign of ownership over the project approach, several
districts have allocated their own funds for starting projects utilizing the WSLIC II
model in non-project communities in their respective catchment areas. In some provinces,
the district level associations (HIPPAMS) have been organized under an umbrella
organization to provide support for each other while in some districts, formal
organizations like cooperatives had been established to provide sustained technical and
logistical support to the village water committees.

Sustainability of WSLIC II investments in infrastructure and behavior change have
been issues of major attention throughout the implementation of the project.
Supervision missions spent considerable time discussing sustainability at all levels and
often found clear evidence of strong management and sustainable operation at the village
level as well as an ongoing commitment to continue efforts in key behavior change areas,
particularly eliminating open defecation. The emergence of non-government

                                            12
organizations (associations or cooperatives) at the district level served as vehicles for: (a)
sharing experiences between communities; (b) providing political advocacy for village
level organizations responsible for water supply and sanitation; and (c) providing a range
of technical and capacity building services to community management organizations,
were successful and widely shared among districts as good examples.

Further studies such as the Post Construction Census and an Exit Strategy were set
up in order to ensure sustainability of the project. The Post Construction Census
(PCC) and the Capacity Building for Post Construction Sustainability (Exit Strategy) was
designed to provide a realistic assessment of the status of the completed WSLIC II
villages (water & sanitation coverage, functionality if water supply infrastructure, status
of village management organization and their operations, participation of women and the
poor in WS&S management, level of satisfaction of villagers), as a basis for district level
planning for enhancing long term sustainability. The results of the 2010 PCC showed
excellent results with a high level (>85%) of continued functionality of physical
infrastructure and the continued functioning of village management organizations.

The installation of sustainable tariff systems that allow full cost recovery has
remained a big challenge. At the same time though, less than 50% of villages have
implemented tariff systems that meet the minimum routine operation and maintenance
costs and less than 10% that meet the project guideline requirements of providing for
operation, maintenance and long-term asset replacement (depreciation). Levels of full and
partial satisfaction by the community are often less than 50%. It is encouraging that the
results also indicate substantial continued improvement in sanitation after the handover of
assets to the community.


3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory

Project Objective and Design Relevance: High
The project’s development objective remains relevant to the GOI and the Bank. This
is the case even as the project has gone through several CASs (FY 2001-2003 and FY
2004-2008) and CPS (FY 2009-2012). It continues to be an important contributor to the
attainment of the MDGs on water and sanitation. The approach the project took is in line
with the government’s program of community-based and community-driven initiatives to
alleviate poverty and improve village conditions, and project results have been used to
change government policies, evidence of high relevance. According to the Bank’s CAS
for FY 2004-2008, the community-driven development portfolio performed satisfactorily
in improving access to community level infrastructure and services. The WSLIC II
experience is utilized by the GOI and the WB in their continuous development of the
National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

Considering overall progress and the performance indicators, the project has
satisfactorily achieved its project development objective improving the health status,
productivity and quality of life for poor community members in underserved rural
areas. This was to be done by enabling the selected villages to improve their domestic
water supply services, sanitation and hygiene in a sustainable manner and in such a way
that safe water and individual household toilets near the homes would become accessible
for all. The approach empowered village women and men to identify their problems and
plan, implement and sustain village water services and sanitation and hygiene programs
solutions with the help of participatory methods. Local schools were assisted to install
water supplies, toilets and hand-washing facilities and promote good hygiene habits in
school.

The project overachieved in terms of numbers of villages and beneficiaries reached.
A total of 2,294 villages benefited from the program, amounting to 115% compared to
the original project target of 2,000 villages. As such, the project reached a total of about 5
million beneficiaries, which represents a significant increase of 43% on the original
beneficiary target of 3.5 million. At the end of the project period, WSLIC II had attained
the following outputs (see Annex 2 for more details):
1. 2,294 villages provided minimally 80% of their population with improved water
   services (exceeding targets by 12%);
2. all villagers in these villages were trained to plan and implement their own sanitation
   program aiming at ending open defecation and achieving access to and use of safe and
   sanitary household toilets;
3. the project had built the institutional capacities of gender-balanced Village Water,
   Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) committees to manage the water supplies, continue
   village sanitation and hygiene promotion and serve equitably the interests of all
   households, including the poor ones; and
4. some 6,164 village schools obtained varying combinations of a school water supply,
   toilets and hand washing facilities and hygiene promotion activities.
5. By the end of the project, 78% of poor households has access to clean water compared
   to 17% at the beginning of the project; and 33% of poor households has access to
   sanitation compared to 12% at the start of the project.

Together, these outputs led to the following outcomes, which show statistical significance
in comparisons between treatment (project) and non treatment villages (see for detailed
data-tables annex 5):

Water use
A larger share of households in the project areas uses improved water supply
sources. Although the outcome remains marginally below the international standards of

                                             14
75-80% use (at which point it will affect health outcomes) the project at end-line
evaluation had an average of 74% in the dry and 77% in the wet season. There was a
significantly greater shift to house water connections, including among the poor (36%),
even though these connections were financed by the users themselves. This was not better
in the project villages than in the control villages in spite of the project being pro-poor.
There was a significant decrease in water collection distance, especially for the poor (43
meters). The impact was further significant for time- and energy savings for the poor
(50%) and the better-off, with a stronger impact for the better-off because of the house
connections.

Sanitation
Access to household sanitation is significantly better for both the poor and the better
off in project areas. However, this is only the case after the project approach of the
revolving sanitation fund first was adjusted to be more pro-poor focused in 2005, and
after the CLTS approach was adopted in 2008. Most toilets (85%) were fully self-
financed. The shift was significant for toilets with water seals, which prevent flies’ spread
feces-related diseases. Significant net reported shift away from open defecation by
project households for all members (adult women and men, girls and boys). Hand-
washing behavior improved significantly with mothers, girls and boys reporting washing
hands with soap after defecation and mothers, both poor and better-off, who reportedly
did so now before handling food. The project had a significant greater impact on access
to hygiene promotion (66%) on both poor and better-off mothers, but interestingly only
on poor fathers.

Sanitation in schools
The project had a significant impact on the presence of sanitary school toilets (96%).
And although more toilets are available for girls, only 15% of toilets were exclusively for
girls, while almost one in three girls in age group 9-11 said to have started menstruation.
A significant higher % of schools had hand washing stations (80% of project schools) but
only 28% of the schoolchildren interviewed said they always had soap to wash hands.
There was no significant impact on school water supply.

Improved access to water and sanitation, improved use of water sources, more time to
spend on other activities, such as active feeding of children, helping and encouraging
children with homework etc, will have positive effects on health outcomes and quality of
life. This is not easy to measure, but the impact evaluation team made extra efforts to
look for impacts.

Health impacts and quality of life
Mothers in the project sample reported a significantly higher reduction in child
diarrhea than mothers in the control group. Due to the problems in diagnosis,
recording and interventions in the control group, as well as issues with the baseline data
and lack of data at health facilities, no comparison between control and treatment could
be conducted to confirm the findings statistically. Scale scoring of post- and pre-
situations, however, showed significant impacts on workload reduction, water availability
for drinking and cooking, hygiene and domestic productivity, and a reduction in poor
sanitation and its related social problems such as privacy and safety for women. There
                                             15
were also significant positive impacts for reduced WASH-related tensions between the
sexes over water collection. Poor women noted a significant difference in their
knowledge about the local WASH management and who to contact when needed.

Remaining areas for improvement as recognized by the project and communicated
in the final aide memoires and evaluation reports include:

1. Continue emphasizing the need for better access to water in order to achieve the
   international standards at which point health outcomes are positively affected;
2. Regarding sanitation, the same issue is noted, with average coverage levels (62%) still
   below the standard of 75% to 80% for a ‘critical mass’ to contribute to health, and still
   far from access for all. Also, the average reported use of toilets by the different
   household members was never above 60%, still too low for a critical mass.
3. Management of waste is an area of concern. For those who have direct latrine pits,
   mothers said they would either abandon filled-up toilets and face the investment costs
   for new ones, or practice unsanitary emptying and end-disposal, since no sanitary
   services are available from the private sector. Only one-third said they would bury the
   contents.
4. Hygiene promotion in schools had also not improved significantly and needs more
   attention.
3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Satisfactory

An economic rate of return study of four programs applying the community
empowerment approach, including WSLIC II, shows positive economic impact with
significant improvement to community welfare and local economy activities. The
EIRR calculation result for WSLIC II showed the average of EIRR discount rate value
above 12% (between 12.33% to 87.40%, average of 32%). The main benefits calculated
are; (i) time savings due to better access, and (ii) cost savings due to ease of transport. For
EIRR calculation, time savings was converted into “labor time savings”, to look into time
used in general to collect water previously. The benefit of the water and sanitation project
for the people is considered very high. Prior to the project, villagers had to walk between
500 metres to 2.5 km and spent an estimated 15–90 minutes of their time to reach a water
source. After the project, villagers only took about 2 to 5 minutes to better access to water
installation, equal to 13-55 minutes of time savings.

A General Income Multiplier analysis was used to assess the broader macro-
economy impact of the funds spent to build water sanitation installation. The
analysis indicates on general money circulated within the village, by estimating
disposable incomes and spending pattern of key groups within the community. General
Income Multiplier is also used as economy activities indicator or value added such as
direct cash income from WSLIC II, which stimulated and supported the village economy.
The cash injected into the 35 WSLIC II villages generated additional values equivalent to


                                              16
Rp 911,022,771. When compared to the total value of all 35 projects (including the value
of village contribution, or Swadaya) this amount is very significant.

The recosting analysis to compare project expenses was performed for every village.
It was undertaken with a reference to government standard unit cost and contractor fee by
the local government in the same year of project. This method is considered the most
accurate and objective way to compare the project expenses of WSLIC projects, had it
been constructed by government. It should be noted that additional value from swadaya
contribution (in a form of working labor) represented the very basic savings. In some
cases (such as NTB and Belitung) the government had difficulties hiring contractors due
to the remote location, materials were purchased at twice the market price, and different
on-going design modifications made it difficult for contractors to compete with CDD
model programs.

Average cost per beneficiary amounted to the average sum of $11.98 per beneficiary.
The average cost varied considerably between districts, though, ranging from $4.54 to
$30.78. This calculation includes the community contribution (cash and in-kind) of 20%.
The total cost also includes the cost of the CAP sanitation and capacity building activities
(including health promotion), which are about 15% on average.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating is Satisfactory on the basis of high relevance, satisfactory
achievement of PDOs and efficiency.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The project design and implementation strategy included clear targeting criteria for
a focus on poverty, both in terms of provinces and eligible district. Within districts,
low-income communities were selected. The project focused on the poorest provinces,
especially their rural areas. The beneficiary population included all households in low-
income communities.

The project design emphasized gender aspects by increasing gender equity through
insurance of women participation in the decision making process and throughout
implementation. Women are traditionally the ones that collect and handle water, carry
most of the burden of caring for children (including when they are ill and suffering from
diarrhea and other sanitation and water related diseases) and as a result, much of their
time is taken away from other productive endeavors. Therefore, women’s participation in
the decision making process in this area is crucial. During implementation, several
approaches were used to strengthen participation of women and the poor including
separate women’s meetings were deemed necessary and ensuring the poor were informed
about community meetings (and in some cases providing transport to bring them to
meeting venues). The project monitoring system indicated that on average, 26% of
women participated in the village decision-making process. The variation between

                                            17
provinces is very high, ranging from only 4.5% participation of women in South Sumatra
to 77% participation in South Sulawesi. In most provinces, about 40% of women
participated.

Social mapping of the village was done to ensure transparent decision making about
the location of public water points to ensure the poor would benefit. There has been
widespread recognition of the project’s participatory approach as fostering community
ownership, contribution and management. The principle of beneficiary ownership was
enshrined in an explicit pro-poor and gender process - MPA/PHAST - designed to
promote community participation and management. This process emphasized that the
needs of the leaders or decision-makers were not always the same as those of poor and
marginalised groups. This principle was articulated in the project design and supporting
materials and promoted to all stakeholders during the initial Road Shows while village
heads were required to gain broad community agreement prior to writing an expression of
interest to be involved in the project.

Community ownership and participation was highly encouraged throughout the
project. Communities planned and implemented WSS improvements of their choice
supported by trained CFs who helped them to analyse their preferences for WSS options
(including size and total investment cost, construction inputs and location) using
Informed Choice Catalogues and to establish their management systems. Cost sharing
encouraged appropriate and affordable water supply schemes and, together with direct
funds channelling to the village, promoted local control and ownership that generated
willingness to collect fees for operation and maintenance (O&M). Community
contribution was also instrumental in demonstrating to the community its capacity to
generate sufficient funds for O&M. Village implementation teams and post construction
WSS management groups were also established in all villages (the latter was a condition
of final tranche payment from the project).

The Capacity Building (Exit Strategy) resulted in the establishment of WSS
technical working groups (POKJA). These POKJAs have become a permanent
organization to oversee all activities related to community based WS&S – not just for the
WSLIC II project. An effective POKJA AMPL is a key mechanism to ensure the
cooperation of all relevant agencies to respond to sector challenges including
sustainability and continued development. One excellent example was found in Cirebon,
which developed an exit strategy that includes a plan to build capacity of the Puskesmas
Sanitarians to be able to act as the first line responders on water & sanitation in the
villages. A budget of IDR 200 million for this activity has been included in the 2009
district budget.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
Community empowerment approaches, as implemented by WSLIC II, have positive
impact on community capability to further village development. The creation of the
village water systems gave rise to the creation of village water and sanitation
management units, as foreseen in the project design, which enabled the communities to
actively operate and maintain the water and sanitation systems. These groups did not

                                           18
exist prior to the project and contributed to the overall improvement in village
participation by number and gender of people involved. See under earlier sections for
details on sustainability.

Conducting ‘roadshows’ and providing skilled implementers to assist the
communities facilitated project acceptance in the communities. There was a rapid
initial increase in the number of participating LGUs during its early implementation
phase. The number of participating villages continued to increase to the desired levels
throughout the rest of the project’s lifespan. The requisite and additional trainings were
implemented, albeit delayed at the onset and suffered delays caused by other reasons.

The pride that the community water management committees had in their capacities to
undertake their new roles and responsibilities could be attributed to the strong support
that they had received from the project. Such confidence in their capabilities was
manifested by their outright manifestation of being able to help other villages accomplish
what they had in their own villages. This would not have come about if not for the huge
impact that the project had in the communities.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
No unintended outcomes or impacts were observed.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Quality of Life of community as program beneficiaries
Results of the economic internal rate of return survey (EIRR) were positive for 34
out of 35 villages. The survey included a beneficiary assessment using a Quality of Life
Indicator to identify tangible or intangible benefits accumulated after the infrastructure
finished. The target groups interviewed included (i) the local village organizer team and
the village head; (ii) the villagers actively involved in the projects and their wives; and
(iii) the villagers active in economic productivity such as traders or successful farmers
that could give information about current commodity prices, business tendencies and
other village development issues. Results of interviews from 35 villages indicated that in
20 villages water sanitation projects were considered as “strongly felt” or very positive;
in 14 villages, the projects were considered “felt” or positive and only in 1 village it’s
considered “barely felt” or no effect. Details are included in the economic analysis in
Annex 3.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low

The gains achieved by the project are very likely to be sustained beyond the life of
the project. The PCC bears that fact in its report. The institutionalization of STBM as a
nationwide approach to rural sanitation increases the possibility that the momentum will
still be present beyond the villages’ interactions with government at all levels. The
PAMSIMAS follow-on project is currently operating in at least half of the WSLIC II



                                            19
project sites. This would ensure continuity of the supervision of the project’s outputs and
outcomes.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Bank’s highly satisfactory performance during the design and entry of the
project set the basis for the key success elements of the project. The Bank has
demonstrated that it had properly identified the project together with GOI as a logical
next step to the existing WSSLIC project. It facilitated the preparatory steps in the
project’s development and appraised the project in its entirety ensuring that it would meet
its development objective and planned outcomes. The Bank ensured that the project was
highly relevant for the GOI and to the prevailing CAS. It further ensured that the
technical, fiduciary and economic aspects of the project were well taken into
consideration. It also ensured that the poverty and gender aspects of the project would be
given emphasis and were attuned to the GOI’s priorities.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank conducted regular supervision missions and produced the required aide
memoires for each supervision mission. The aide memoires reflect the prevailing
conditions at the time of the supervision mission and brought out issues that needed to be
addressed in order to facilitate project implementation. Throughout these missions, the
Bank kept in mind the project’s development objective and the necessary outputs and
outcomes to be achieved. The Bank properly identified issues and resolved threats that
would hamper project implementation and the attainment of its objectives. The Bank
consistently emphasized its fiduciary role and oversight on the project and dealt with
issues and threats expediently.

The monitoring and supervision undertaken in the project was satisfactory. Findings
in these supervision missions resulted in appropriate actions in most cases. All the critical
changes in project management approach and guideline formulation were brought up in
the supervision mission reports and acted upon accordingly by both the Bank and the
GOI. The willingness of the project to take on new approaches (i.e. CLTS and STBM)
that would address its limitations is laudable and has proven to be quite effective. The
PCC and capacity building for PCC are two other activities that ensure the project’s
outcomes’ sustainability.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory



                                             20
The Bank’s overall performance was Satisfactory due to its highly satisfactory
performance on ensuring quality at entry and satisfactory performance on supervision.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Government performance was satisfactory. During preparation, the government was
driving the process and open to changes based on lessons learned from earlier operations.
The project was developed at the time that government was pursuing to expand its CDD
approach and was pursuing its decentralization of services. The Government was keen on
making this second project even more successful than the first and was engaged
throughout implementation. Important decisions regarding implementing agency, flow of
funds and disbursement were taken timely and with project objectives in mind. Full use
by government of the project generated data contributed to the decision to try alternative
methods of achieving the development objectives. Monitoring results were shared,
discussed and used to make decision about changes and adaptations. The government
utilized the project as a vehicle to try out new approaches in its bid to improve
communities’ access to water and sanitation. This decision was the right one in the right
direction as evidenced from the results of the monitoring and evaluation activities
undertaken by the project. Throughout project implementation, high-level MOH staff was
accessible, engaged and result-driven which caused the successful implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly satisfactory

The decision of having one implementing agency instead of several, as promoted by
the lessons learned from the first WSSLIC project, turned out to be a very correct
decision, which explains in part the success of the project. The main implementing
agency was the Ministry of Health through the Directorate General of Disease Control
and Environmental Health. The CPMU was established within this office. This agency
took the lead in the development and implementation of the project. During the life of the
project, MOH was the driving force for all its activities. The CPMU established within
the MOH had staffing problems at the start, delays in replacing vacated positions,
changes in organizational structure, lack of adequate project knowledge of key people
hired, which affected the initial pace of project implementation. Procedural processes like
procurement/contracting of consultant firms/consultants also proved to be difficult at
times. Some additional setbacks were: the hiring of firms with poor financial
management performance and delayed payment of consultants for months. Despite these
challenges, MOH managed to comply with all the project reporting and fiduciary
requirements as well as project audit reports were always positive.

During the second half of the project, the implementing agency under the MOH
showed excellent capacity, swift action following monitoring results and undertook
very regular field visits. From supervision missions it was clear that the district and
province levels management units were very engaged and highly appreciated the central
level engagement and support. An AusAID funded Trust Fund was instrumental in

                                            21
providing additional expertise in technical areas and management from which all levels
of implementing agencies benefitted.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Overall rating for borrower performance is highly satisfactory based on the above.
The project received high-level political support throughout implementation. Much
attention was given to have capable management structures in place without interruptions,
especially during the second half of the project. There was excellent buy in and strong
commitment from all stakeholders. To the MOH’s credit despite its initial difficulties, it
did not shy away from trying to improve its performance by taking on new strategies that
it felt would enhance achievement of its goals. Its strong push to test CLTS and
eventually adopt STBM for its project sites demonstrates its commitment and readiness to
achieve its objectives. This bold move coupled with a desire to be able to objectively
determine its accomplishments through the implementation of several monitoring and
evaluation tools, certainly paid off in the end.


6. Lessons Learned

Experiences from previous projects have contributed to the successful project
design of WSLIC II. During two years of extensive project preparation, which included
hiring a local NGO with experience in community work, WSLIC II was designed by
drawing on a range of lessons learned from its predecessors. The decision with the
possibly highest impact on the successful implementation of the project was to keep the
project responsibility with only one agency, the Ministry of Health. The experience
stemmed from the first WSSLIC project, whose project design was set up in a
decentralized way, but ultimately resulted in a focus on constructing infrastructure.
Despite construction progressing well, it did not match perfectly with the original project
objective of improving livelihood and health of people in a community-based way. Hence
by attributing all implementation responsibility to MOH at national level, and district
health offices at local level, the community-based character of WSLIC II with the
objective of improving public health could be maintained and community participation
turned out to be higher than during the first WSSLIC project.

Setting up a reliable and comprehensive M&E system contributed significantly to
government ownership of the project. Based on previous experiences, a comprehensive,
participatory M&E system was created using the MPA-PHAST methodology: During
engagement sessions with communities, health related indicators (such as
water/sanitation coverage, diarrhea prevalence, etc.) would be discussed and
consequently entered into the monitoring system by project staff. The data collected was
highly appreciated by local governments who used it to create awareness for project
related health issues, mobilize funds and allocate resources to the project. Despite the
excellent results of the M&E system, it remains to be discussed whether the time and
effort spent was needed altogether, or if a simpler system would have given similar
results.
                                            22
Replication of the project’s approach by government, however, remains low and is
still facing a number of challenges. LG have shown reluctance to adopt the project’s
M&E system, despite its importance and recognition for it. Reasons for that are, amongst
others, the project related focus of the M&E system, which favors more individual
champions as drivers than building an actual M&E system within the government
structures. Another reason for limited replication of the projects approach by LG can be
attributed to the limited capability of governments’ administrative systems to channel
funds directly to communities, as the project used to do it. Only one district, Pamekasan
in East Java, has found a way of successfully replicating the project’s approach to more
villages: The local government created a grant which allows them to transfer funds
directly to the communities. This would have been possible in other local governments,
too; the difference, however, was that in Pamekasan former WSLIC II facilitators were
still available to explain the grant system to the communities and help them participate.

It was crucial for the project’s efforts in sanitation to be able to adjust its
methodology to new findings and philosophies in the international sanitation sector.
Since the mid-2000s, there has been increasing evidence about the success of the CLTS
approach in other large Asian countries. At the same time the project’s initial approach of
financing access to sanitation facilities through a revolving fund showed only limited
success. It was therefore decided to trial the CLTS approach in some project villages as
first overall introduction of CLTS to Indonesia. The successful trial then lead to adopting
the CLTS approach project-wide and subsequently assisting the national government in
adopting an extended version of the approach (STBM) as national program to scale up
access to sanitation in rural areas. The project’s sanitation goals were slightly altered by
the introduction of the new approach, e.g. by now including ‘open defecation free’ status
in villages before actual toilets were constructed. The aforementioned community-
focused character of the project was an essential prerequisite for this new sanitation
philosophy, which is now considered as one of the most successful approaches to
improving access to rural sanitation and ultimately reaching the sanitation MDG.

The establishment of district level associations proved to be a very valuable source
of support for community organizations. Having community organizations manage
their own water schemes imposed certain challenges in terms of procuring material,
consultants, or conducting maintenance works. From the beginning, the project therefore
stimulated the formation of district level associations as an extended arm of the local
health department. These associations provided very valuable support to the communities
by assisting with collective procurement and assistance to technical problems during
construction and maintenance. Having this support available, many villages developed a
strong own initiative to upgrade their systems and were also able to maintain these. E.g.
from basic, gravity-fed systems to more complex piped systems, or initiating water
meters for their piped systems.

Having a trust fund available to complete the loan turned out to be one key factor to
the flexibility and success of the project. While a loan demands quite rigid criteria to
implement activities, trust fund money can be used in a more flexible way to serve needs

                                            23
as they arise. Within WSLIC II, the trust fund was used especially to strengthen capacity
at all levels in technical and management areas. The trust fund further allowed the
introduction of innovative approaches and helped greatly to introduce the new approaches
to sanitation. It is without doubt the TF contributed to the overall success of the project.

Government wide arrangements of community-based approaches is an important
element of reaching projects goals related to soft targets such as behavior change.
The project’s approach towards behavior change in hygiene and sanitation was based on a
non-subsidy based system that relied on triggering the communities’ own demand rather
than stimulating it through external subsidies. This approach usually has a good success
rate, but can also be easily compromised by offering subsidies alongside. During project
implementation, conflicts arose in some provinces between WSLIC II’s non-subsidy
approach and other Bank financed projects such as PNPM (as well as some smaller
NGOs' and some local government programs). The latter programs provide sanitation
subsidies to households, which undermined the message of WSLIC II that stated
subsidies are not necessary. This is issue was raised during the implementation phase and
was discussed between all stakeholders.

One weakness of WSLIC II was the tariff structure based on purely social
considerations. Adopted through participatory approaches, communities determined the
level of their tariffs themselves, mainly basing it on purely social considerations. The
project’s consultants assisted communities with this exercise, but many of them were also
no trained economists, and were therefore not able to focus on economically sustainable
tariffs.

Another weakness was some of the language used throughout the project, starting
already with the project’s name. Referring to ‘low-income communities’ in the
project’s name, contributed to the people’s perception that the beneficiaries are in fact
poor. Hence, they should therefore not be requested to contribute anything from their part.
Further, the language used throughout essential community discussions also contributed
to misunderstandings in some cases. Talking about prices of one cubic meter of water, for
example, is a very abstract thing to understand for many people, if it is not made clear
through concrete examples to relate to. It is therefore recommended to use units that are
common within the community, given that community ownership is a key element of
reaching the project’s objectives.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The overall rating of project implementation is satisfactory bordering on highly
satisfactory, as the project has reached more villages and substantially more
beneficiaries than it foresaw at appraisal without increasing the funding sources.
Overall village water supply and sanitation interventions were implemented in 2,294
villages reaching a total of 5 million beneficiaries. This represents a significant increase
of about 15% on the original Credit Agreement target of 2,000 villages, and an increase

The results are satisfactory. The design of Component 1 emphasized the development
and use of participatory approaches to be employed at the community level to assist them
in making informed choices about the water, sanitation and health interventions to be
funded by the project in their communities. This approach became known as
MPA/PHAST. It envisaged an integrated or holistic approach to analysis and planning by
the communities. This approach demands intensive training and facilitation.

As a result of a strong focus on this approach in the early years of the project, thousands
of communities are aware of MPA/PHAST and hundreds of facilitators are trained in its
use. The preparation requirements were very substantial and the time required for the
detailed development and documentation of community processes was underestimated
and skilled trainers were in short supply. Although the MPA/PHAST approach initially
was very ambitious, comprehensive and at times thought too ambitious, the project
successfully managed to achieve its outputs. Successful facilitation at the district and
village level led to the development of community action plans in all villages, very few
drop outs, and most villages finalized the three tranches of block grant within the project
period and achieved official hand-over status (table below).

Component 2: Improving Health Behavior and Services (13.9 million) The objective
of this component was to improve hygiene, health behavior and community management
of health services related to water borne diseases. Two sub-components comprised a
school health and hygiene program and a community health program. A core part of the
component was the adaptation and implementation of PHAST to be used in communities
and schools. Diarrhoea, skin diseases and worms in children were the special focus of the
component.

The results are satisfactory. Throughout the project implementation, most attention was
spent on the planning phase which included sanitation and behavior change but during
implementation, most attention tended to be given to ensuring water supply first. As a
result, only in the latter years of the project sanitation became more visible. This was also
the result of an important shift in approach to behavior change for sanitation improvement,
away from subsidies for individual household toilets to the now widely accepted CLTS –
STBM approach.



                                                 27
The school and other institutional sanitation facilities were funded from the village grant,
however, for the household toilets constructed under the community sanitation component
the toilets were funded in one of three ways: under the RF approach (a) some households
received a loan which was to be repaid to the fund; while (b) others funded their own
toilets directly using their own funds (swadaya). Under the CLTS approach (c) all
households funded their own toilets although there was some cross funding/subsidy
between households usually for the very poor, widows etc.

After having undertaken the CLTS approach in all project districts between 2006 and
2009, the project adopted the more comprehensive STBM (Community Based Total
Sanitation) approach (extending the CLTS approach by some further components).
Triggering has been undertaken in 385 villages and 1,066 hamlets with already 371
hamlets (dusun) and 69 villages declared ‘Open Defecation Free’ to date. Further, strong
local ownership and support for the STBM program can be noted in most of the districts.
Moreover, field data generally indicates a continuously improving access to sanitation by
the villages’ own efforts in the majority of the villages receiving village grants. This is a
very important proof of ownership and a further step towards the sustainability of the
project. Tables below show the outputs.

Component 3: Developing Water Infrastructure (53.2 million) The aim of this
component was to provide communities with accessible, convenient, and clean water in
adequate quantity in response to demands expressed by them. A demand responsive strategy
was used, requiring community bidding for project participation and community co-

financing (at least 4% in cash and 16% in kind). Communities will have direct control over
sub-project financing through block grants, and control over sub-project design, providing a
choice among a variety of appropriate technical options.

The results are highly satisfactory. The project target was to achieve improved access to
water in 80% of participating villages. As shown in the below tables, household access to
clean water in project areas reached 80% for all households and 78% among poor households.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

A study analyzing the economic impacts of WSLIC II, CERD, P2D and UPP (Urban Poverty
Project) was undertaken to shed light on the economic rate of return (ERR) of the
implemented interventions and compare results with the estimated ERR at appraisal. The
analyses focused on: (a) calculating the EIRR of the project’s investment in roads & bridges,
water supply and irrigation; (b) analyzing the macro economic impacts of benefits resulting
from various infrastructure and activities designed to support development and village
community empowerment; and (c) re-costing projects to inform future investments. The
study analyzed 4 programs, only the relevant parts for the WSLIC II program are included in
this summary.

The study objectives are as follows: (a) demonstrate the economic impacts of CDD-
empowerment programs on group welfares; (b) demonstrate the efficiency of CDD
approaches compared to other development mechanism carried out by Local Government
through direct contractors; (c) show the contribution of the economic impacts of CDD
programs to the higher program targets of poverty reduction; and (d) demonstrate the
benefits of the CDD empowerment program as a learning program for communities to
participate in development process.

To undertake the study, a number of sample villages were defined. A total of 120 villages for
all programs: (i) 29 villages UPP, (ii) 36 villages P2D, (iii) 20 villages CER0; and (iv) 35
villages WSLIC II. Unfortunately the effects are difficult to disentangle for each program
separately. They were selected for one study based on the CDD approach commonality.

Findings WSLIC II EIRR

In WSLIC II project, funding allocated for the water sanitation comes in a range of 130
million rupiah to 250 million rupiah, which consisted of 104–167 million rupiah grant, 26–
83 million rupiah in a form of local contribution (swadaya). The grant is from the Central
Government, there are not necessarily to be returned by the district government, meaning it’s
not a loan or debt term. EIRR analysis for water sanitation infrastructure in WSLIC II aimed
to measure the benefit felt at the cost of the project. It is assumed that the average of project
operational life is close to 10 years. The main benefit calculated are; (i) time savings due to
better access, and (ii) cost savings due to ease of transport. For EIRR calculation, time
savings was converted into “labor time savings”, to look into time used in general to pick-up
water previously.

Prior to the project, villagers had to walk between 500 metres to 2.5 km and spent an
estimated 15–90 minutes of their time to reach a water source. This had significant negative
impact towards local productivity, due to reduced local labor in the field, reduced time for
woods and cattle gathering, and reduced school attendance for children or absenteeism. After
the project, villagers only took about 2 to 5 minutes to access a water installation, equal to
13-55 minutes of time savings. This was especially true in villages which used pipe-systems
to connect their houses to the newly built village public tap.


                                               30
Before this project, villagers didn’t have any expenses for water as they collected water from
a source such as a spring or a river, however, after the water sanitation project, in general
villagers have to pay between Rp.500 – Rp.15,000 for the maintenance of the infrastructure.
This feature illustrates the embedded willingness to pay and to use water and sanitation
services when available. The quality of life indicator which parallel with the EIRR analysis
could be seen at this table 1 that shows general estimation of every district EIRR’s.

The EIRR calculation result showed the average of EIRR discount rate value above 12%
(between 12.33% to 87.40%). This means the benefit of water sanitation project for the
villagers are very high.

There are 9 projects that reached EIRR above 50%, out of the 35 water sanitation project
samples. Table 2 provides an explanation on the reason why these projects reached such high
EIRR.

                                      distance about 12 minutes and more for queuing. Bathing only
                                      once per day. After the project, access to water is only 3 minutes.
                                      Majority of villagers work at palm-oil plantation (previously PIR

General Income Multiplier

General Income Multiplier analysis was used to assess the broader macro-economy impact
of the funds spent to build water sanitation installation. The analysis indicates on general
money circulated within the village, by estimating disposable incomes and spending pattern
of key groups within the community. General Income Multiplier is also used as economy
activities indicator or value added such as direct cash income from WSLIC II, which could
stimulated and moved the village economy. Table 3 shown the analysis average of money
circulated calculated in every district.

The cash injected into the 35 WSLIC II villages generated additional values equivalent to
Rp.911,022,771. When compared to the total value of all 35 projects (including the value of
village contribution, or Swadaya) this amount is very significant. It also showed that the
worker rarely spent their money to buy food or households needs in local warung (store).
This is shown by the multiplier value of 5% to 18%. In other words, most of the project cash
had been spent outside the villages. Most of the income might be used outside village for
house need and considered “leakage” in village economy.

In community empowerment project, local materials for infrastructure such as sand, stones
and woods should be collected from inside the village, but in reality it didn’t appear as so.
Almost 80% of all materials needed for WSLIC II, such as cement, iron frame, pipe and
pipe-fitting was only found in sub-district stores, or even materials store in district level.

In Solok and Belitung District, local materials purchased with the project money were higher
than other area. Cash equivalent value from multiplier compared to other expensed average
on 25%.

Project re-costing

The recosting analysis was performed for every village with government standard unit cost
and contractor fee by the local authority/ Pemerintah Daerah (Pemda) in the same year of
project. This method is considered the most accurate and objective way to compare the
project expenses of WSSLIC projects, if it had been constructed by government.

It should be noted that additional value from swadaya contribution (in a form of working
labor) represented the very basic savings. In some cases (such as NTB and Belitung) the
government had difficulties on hiring contractors due to remote location, materials purchased
that cost twice market price, different on-going design modification that makes contractor
difficult to compete with CDD model programs (CDD).

Quality of Life of community as program beneficiaries
Quality of Life Indicator is used to identify if tangible or intangible benefit existed once the
infrastructure is in place. It is a simple indicator that illustrates the economy chain effect in
every village where new infrastructure was built. The key factor is to select as accurately as
possible the first benefit that occurred within the cause-effect chain. Once the first benefit is
found in the indicator list. other benefits could arise as good progress of community quality of
life in a village. Simple scoring system built was based on number came up into the project

                                               34
score with column such as “Ada/Present” and “Diharapkan/Expected” combine with Degree
of Importance of a project which was combined in every indicator chosen for interviews.
Based on this system a project that reached 76%-100% should be rank as “Impact Strongly
Felt”. Rank between 51%-75% in a category of “Impact Felt”. between 26%-50% “Impact
Barely Felt” and rank 0%-25% should be “Impact Hardly Felt”.

Target groups needed to be interviewed: (i) The village Local Organizer Team/Tim Pelaksana
Kegiatan and village-head; (ii) the villages actively involved in the projects and their wives;
and(iii) villagers actively in economy productivity such as traders or successful farmer that
could give info on current commodities price. business tendency and other village
development issues. Result of the interviewed in 35 villages indicated that water sanitation
projects existed in 20 villages was considered “strongly felt”. In 14 villages it is considered
“felt” and only in 1 village it is considered “barely felt”. Table 6 shows the degree of
importance felt by the community as impact of the projects in the village.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Counterpart comments received from WSLIC II CPMU. Ministry of Health related to
the project. A Borrower’s implementation report is being finalized and a draft has been
shared.

1. The government has developed a MDG National Action Plan (NAP) including MDG 7c. All
provinces and local governments are preparing a local MDGs Action Plan (RAD) as part of the
sustainability strategy;

2. The Ministry of Health has set promotion and prevention policy as priority in the health
development strategy. As reflection of the policy, fund is being channeled as Health
Operational Support (BOK) through Health Centers in order to support the five prevention
promotion activities, including environmental health, which is used to trigger STBM
throughout the village;

3. The government has adopted CLTS as a national approach through its STBM Program
(CLTS was tested in WSLIC II activities);

4. The government has adopted the WSLIC II approach / concept in a variety of similar
programs. such as NICE. CWSHP. MCC, including the Ministry of Health budgeted programs
related to the development of water and sanitation;

5. WSP support in providing technical assistance to the Government has been very influential
to the success of WSLIC II, including the support for WSLIC II sustainability in East Java
through TSSM;

6. The adoption of the WSLIC II approach is occurring both in WSLIC II and non-WSLIC II
provinces and local governments like Sumenep, Sumedang, Bangka Districts; and provinces
like Lampung. NTB and Riau. These governments are allocating budget for WSS activities
adopting / replicating WSLIC II;

7. Increasing the capacity of NGOs in WSLIC II activities; Many NGOs who are currently
engaged in WSS programs understood WSS community strengthening approaches including
CLTS / STBM, which is a great support to the government in accelerating the program;

8. HWWS PPP development with the support of WSP as a form of collaboration among multi-
parties in the program's sustainability.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments from AUSAID

We have no comments on the structure of the report but have some minor editing suggestions
in the documents.

Overall. AusAID concur with the findings from the ICR mission. We would like to comment
particularly on the aspects that were observed during the ICR mission and previous supervision
missions, where AusAID’s representatives were involved. These aspects includes the outputs
and outcomes relating to increased community and local institution capacity to plan, manage
and sustain water programs, sanitation and community health, improved hygiene practice,
provision of accessible, convenient and clean water in adequate quantity for the low income
communities.

In the WSLIC II locations visited during ICR and previous supervision missions, we have seen
evidence of sustainable operations of the water supply facility at village level, good
management of the water facilities by the village level water management unit and strong
commitment from the communities to continue promoting better hygiene practice and achieve
open-defecation free status.

Functionality of the water systems is high and pro-poor targeting is effective with poor
households benefit most from program.

Emergence of associations or cooperatives with support from district governments indicated
that the water management units are evolving to address increased demand for water supply
service which is a good sign of sustainability.

Project stakeholders demonstrated understanding of the mechanism and there is good
collaboration between project stakeholders at different levels. In most locations visited, there
is strong leadership from district health agencies to continue the effort to accelerate and
achieve health quality objectives after the project finishes.

More broadly on the program itself, we would like to note that the collaboration between the
World Bank, Australia and the Government of Indonesia in the implementation of WSLIC II
has been effective. Each part has taken up their respective role effectively and there has been
good communication between the Bank and AusAID in the implementation of the program.

Project management unit at both central and sub-national levels are responsive in dealing with
problems and issues that hinder the achievement of project objectives.

An area that we would like to suggest for consideration going forward is for the Government of
Indonesia to invest in making the effort in sharing the lessons learned and experience gained
from WSLIC II implementation to the water and sanitation stakeholders in Indonesia. The
lesson learned for example about successful CLTS implementation and sustainability of water
management unit at village level are important aspects that are worth to share and could help to


                                              47
improve effectiveness of other community-based water and sanitation program either funded
by Government of Indonesia or by other donors.

WSLIC II now have abundant data collected from the post-construction survey and impact
studies. It would be useful if findings of the impact studies can be presented in a much concise
format, using simple language that is accessible to the broader stakeholders/general public that
have interest in water and sanitation issues.
