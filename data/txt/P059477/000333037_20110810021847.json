Some lessons learned\n            included: having community organizations manage their own\n            water schemes imposed certain challenges in terms of\n            procuring material, consultants, or conducting maintenance\n            works. From the beginning, the project therefore stimulated\n            the formation of district level associations as an extended\n            arm of the local health department. Adopted through\n            participatory approaches, communities determined the level\n            of their tariffs themselves, mainly basing it on purely\n            social considerations. The project's consultants\n            assisted communities with this exercise, but many of them\n            were also no trained economists, and were therefore not able\n            to focus on economically sustainable tariffs. During two\n            years of extensive project preparation, which included\n            hiring a local NGO with experience in community work, WSLIC\n            II was designed by drawing on a range of lessons learned\n            from its predecessors. The decision with the possibly\n            highest impact on the successful implementation of the\n            project was to keep the project responsibility with only one\n            agency, the Ministry of Health. The experience stemmed from\n            the first WSSLIC project, whose project design was set up in\n            a decentralized way, but ultimately resulted in a focus on\n            constructing infrastructure."}, "docdt": "2011-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
