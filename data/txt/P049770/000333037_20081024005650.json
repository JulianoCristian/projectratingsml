Some\n            lessons learned included: upfront consideration must be\n            given to a transition strategy for World Bank projects\n            supporting  Renewable Energy (RE)/Energy Efficiency (EE)\n            lending thorough a specialized financial institution to\n            address the future commercial bank competition that will\n            inevitably arise from successful project implementation.\n            Future challenges often include both direct financial\n            challenges as the commercial market is often able to provide\n            lower cost funding at more flexible terms, capacity\n            challenges including how to retain public sector staff once\n            the private sector enters the market, and institutional\n            challenges, as new directions are needed once original\n            objectives have been met. In order to adequately scale up\n            lending for renewable energy and energy efficiency, the\n            local banking sector must be an active participant.\n            Technical Assistance (TA) support can increase knowledge of\n            the technical, policy, and regulatory aspects of this market\n            to allow improved understanding of sector risks when\n            providing debt financing for such projects. Therefore,\n            awareness and capacity building of commercial financial\n            institutions for clean energy market development projects\n            should be incorporated into initial project designs, even\n            when primary lending activity is channeled through a single intermediary."}, "docdt": "2008-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
