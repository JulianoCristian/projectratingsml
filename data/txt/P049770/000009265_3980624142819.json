The project has three components. The first\n            finances small hydro investments by the private sector in,\n            for example, canal-based and dam toe (sic) schemes,\n            run-of-river schemes, rehabilitation and/or upgrading of old\n            plants, use of tail ends of cooling water systems of thermal\n            power plants, and stand-alone micro-hydro schemes. The\n            project designs rural energy initiatives that feature\n            partnerships between private investors and user communities.\n            The second component helps design, develop, and implement\n            integrated energy management services operated by service\n            companies and end-users on a performance guarantee basis;\n            purchases and installs energy-efficient and/or load\n            management devices and systems; produces energy-efficient\n            equipment; and encourages end-user participation in the\n            state energy board and other utility-sponsored DSM programs.\n            The third component finances pre-investment activities that\n            develop a sustainable pipeline of energy-efficient\n            investments and standard bidding document preparation;\n            establish in-house capacity within IREDA (the Indian\n            Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited) to appraise,\n            supervise, and promote energy efficiency services and\n            schemes; assist in promoting end-use efficiency; and train\n            officials and staff."}, "docdt": "1998-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
