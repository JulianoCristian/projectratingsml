1.      Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives and Design:

1.1     Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for
Bank assistance):

1.1.1 Country Background           By the second half of the 1990s, India's reforms in the areas of investment,
trade, and finance, initiated in response to the 1991 crisis, had helped stimulate the economy. During the
period 1994- 1997, the country experienced high average rates of economic growth of 7 percent. The 1997
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) document proposed Bank group assistance in reducing infrastructure
bottlenecks and promoting private sector participation across sectors. The India Compact also called for the
Bank to assist the Government to implement priorities identified in its National Environmental Action Plan
(NEAP 1993), including development of the Alternative Energy Plan.

1.1.2 Sector Background            At the time of project design, India's power industry was characterized by
inadequate and inefficient power supply with peak capacity and energy supply shortages exceeding 20
percent and 10 percent, respectively. On the demand-side, inefficient pricing and a variety of market and
non-market barriers contributed to the overall inefficient use of electricity and thermal energy, exacerbating
the energy shortage and leaving a large unfulfilled market for financing investments in projects that could
cost-effectively reduce energy costs in industrial units.

The Government of India's (GOI) response to the continuing power sector shortages was to provide
additional support to states who were undertaking power sector reforms and to encourage entry of private
sector investments in the sector. These reforms included unbundling of previously integrated State
Electricity Boards (SEBs) and the establishment of independent regulatory agencies who worked at creating
appropriate enabling environments to encourage private sector investment in power generation. The
accelerated development of the country's renewable energy resources and of energy efficiency programs
was a priority thrust area under India's NEAP, as the government was aware of the benefits of increased
levels of environmentally sustainable energy investments.

At the national level, the government had a long record of support to Renewable Energy, including the
establishment of a Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources (DNES) and the establishment of the
Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) in 1987, under the administrative
purview of the DNES. IREDA was given the dual mandate of promoting renewable energy technologies
and of providing financial support to investments in the sector. The DNES was later elevated to the status
of a ministry, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), earlier called the Ministry of Non
conventional Energy Sources (MNES), which has administered one of the largest renewable energy
programs amongst developing countries. As part of its efforts to promote renewable energy, the Ministry
issued guidance on appropriate power purchase tariffs which could be adopted by the states which
recognized the positive externalities from renewable energy.

At the state level, each state adopted its own policies, but central government guidance was a key factor in
establishing a supportive enabling environment for private sector development of renewables. Several
Southern states adopted various policies in the early to mid 1990s to attract private sector development of
small hydro and other small-scale renewable energy power facilities, including wheeling, banking, and third
party sales arrangements. In contrast, the regulations in the Northern states were not as supportive of
renewables, and the level of private sector SHP development remained low despite relatively high resource
potential figures. Most of the small hydro projects in the Northern areas were primarily undertaken by
public sector entities.

At the time of project appraisal, GOI support for energy efficiency was focused on provision of support for
energy audits and information dissemination programs in the industrial sector by public sector institutions
including the National Productivity Council, the Petroleum Conservation Research Association, the
Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) and the Energy Management Center (EMC). These efforts



                                                       13

lacked a unified approach to overcome market barriers to energy efficiency, especially on financing
identified efficiency investments. The passage of the energy conservation act and the creation of the Bureau
of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in 2001 was a major step forward by the Government in advancing its energy
efficiency strategy and signified the beginning of a comprehensive approach to address this important topic.

The Government's emphasis on clean energy development including both efficiency and renewables has
increased since the time of appraisal. This is evidenced by the findings of the Planning Commission's
Integrated Energy Policy Report (2006) and the renewable energy and energy efficiency missions presented
as part of the National Climate Change Action Plan (2008).

Rationale for Bank Involvement            The first line of credit to IREDA under the India: Renewable
Resources Development Project (CPL-35440; COFN-03220; TF-20339; TF-28633) successfully facilitated
early private sector interest in renewable energy development. A second line of credit to IREDA was
considered appropriate for broadening the impact of the program and supporting the development of SHP in
other areas of high potential throughout the country.

Additionally, a line of credit for energy efficiency was considered to be an appropriate complement to the
renewable energy program given the unmet financing needs of industrial and commercial end-users who
paid relatively high power prices but under-invested in energy efficiency. While the technical and
economic potential for improving energy efficiency and thereby reducing carbon emissions in India was
sizeable, several market barriers prevented realization of these savings. At the time of project appraisal, it
was felt that IREDA could take a leadership role in implementing activities to overcome energy efficiency
market barriers.

e.       Main Beneficiaries:

Beneficiaries of Small Hydropower Component              Private SHP developers were the direct beneficiaries
of the Bank project in terms of funding for investments and building institutional capacities. The project
paved the way for emergence of a new breed of entrepreneurs engaged in generation of power from SHP
facilities. Many such developers in the southern states, who were introduced to the business through the
first LoC to IREDA, expanded operations into some of the Northern states, notably Himachal Pradesh. State
power distribution utilities which purchased electricity from small-hydropower plants and electricity
consumers at large were the indirect beneficiaries of the Bank project. With augmentation of generation
capacity (nearly 96 MW for 34 commissioned projects) and increased availability of power (estimated at
402 million units per annum ­ valued at over US$50 million annually at prevailing diesel-based generation
costs - for 32 of these projects), the economy as a whole benefitted, especially in view of the prevailing
acute power shortages. By mobilizing private sector capital and management expertise into the power sector
the project helped diversify energy sources and moderately reduce heavy reliance of the power sector on
fossil fuels.

Beneficiaries of Energy Efficiency and DSM Component: The main project beneficiaries were the
industries, commercial establishments, communities and other electricity consumers who realized energy
cost savings and productivity gains as a result of energy efficiency and DSM investments. The state
distribution companies and the economy as a whole were the indirect beneficiaries of the reduced peak
demand resulting from the implementation of the EE projects.

Beneficiaries of Technical Assistance: The project supported numerous training and capacity building
activities for energy efficiency stakeholders including central and state government officials, commercial
banks, EE consultants, businesses, universities and research institutions and non-governmental organization
(NGO) groups. The awareness building activities carried out under the project also impacted end-users and
helped in raising energy efficiency awareness to a broad section of the population. Institutional
strengthening initiatives directly benefited IREDA which had no previous experience with lending for
energy efficiency but is now well placed to continue providing finance for these types of investments.


f.       Original Components (as approved):

Part A: The Small Hydro component built upon IREDA's experience with the first Renewable Resources
Development Project. It was designed to finance 200 MW of small hydro capacity developed by the private
sector. The target was revised to 153 MW after cancellation of US$26 million of IBRD proceeds which
were unlikely to be utilized by the time of project closure.1 The project was designed to support a range of
eligible small hydro project types including (i) Canal-based and dam toe schemes; (ii) Run-of-river
schemes; (iii) Rehabilitation and/or upgrading of old plants; (iv) Use of tail ends of cooling water systems
of thermal power plants; and, (v) Stand alone micro-hydro sub-projects of up to 100kW each. Over 80


1Partial cancellation of funding was undertaken twice during project implementation ­ US$ 18 million in June 2005,
and US$ 8 million in November 2006. The closing date of the project was extended by one year on each occasion.


                                                         15

percent of the sub-projects were expected to be categories (i) and (ii) projects, ranging in sizes from 1 MW
to 25 MW. It was recognized during project preparation that some of these categories represented greater
risks and would be less economically attractive to developers, but the experience gained would be an
important input in mapping out future strategies for promotion of decentralized generation of power.

Part B: The Energy Efficiency/DSM component was designed to provide financing for energy efficiency
as a new line of lending business that would complement IREDA's renewable energy financing activities.
The component would cover a wide array of approaches including: (i) design, development and
implementation of integrated energy management services operated by ESCOs and end-users on a
performance guarantee basis; (ii) end user purchase and installation of energy efficiency and/or load
management devices and systems; (iii) production of energy efficient equipment; and, (iv) end-user
participation in SEB and other utility-sponsored DSM programs.

Part C: The Technical Assistance component was designed to support IREDA's efforts in the new area of
energy efficiency by financing: (i) pre-investment activities to develop a sustainable pipeline of energy
efficiency investments, preparation of standard bidding documents for procuring ESCO services,
operational and business development modules and information dissemination; (ii) establishing in-house
capacity within IREDA to appraise, supervise and promote energy efficiency services and schemes; (iii)
assisting participating states in promoting end-use efficiency including development of appropriate policy
incentives; and, (iv) training of public and private sector energy and industry officials and staff on energy
conservation and DSM.


g.      Revised Components:

The components were not revised.


h.      Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, and funding allocations):

There were no significant changes in project design during implementation. However, the scale of the
project was reduced following cancellation of a part of the IBRD loan. The project closing date was
extended by two years.


b) Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

a.      Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Soundness of Background Analysis           This project was prepared as a follow-up to the India: Renewable
Resources Development Project which was instrumental in initiating private sector investments in
renewable energy development and in strengthening IREDA's capacity. The second renewable energy
project was specifically focused on providing continued support to the nascent private sector market for
small scale power generation, particularly in the Northern states, and to build capacity within IREDA to
finance energy efficiency projects.

The prevailing situation where industrial and commercial end-users paid high electricity prices but were
unaware or unconvinced of the potential savings through investments in energy efficiency was correctly
diagnosed at appraisal. Accordingly, a key project component was to catalyze an energy efficiency services
industry in India by addressing market development barriers and helping develop entrepreneurial initiatives
including support for the formation of Energy Service Companies (ESCOs). Background analysis also
correctly identified the need for overcoming market barriers by strengthening institutional capacities,
creating awareness and conducting appropriate studies to support pilot interventions in the area of energy



                                                       16

efficiency. Accordingly, these activities were supported through a Global Environment Facility (GEF)
grant.

Assessment of Project Design        The project design incorporated lessons from the implementation
experience of the first Bank project with IREDA, such as development of a sufficient sub-project pipeline
upfront and better estimation of civil works and interconnection costs. The project also incorporated lessons
from the Bank's EE DSM experience as part of the power sector reform loans which identified the need to
develop capacity in an Indian financial institution to appraise and finance energy efficiency investments.

The design of all the three components was found to be adequate. First, the small hydro component allowed
IREDA an opportunity to enhance private sector project development capacities, develop new small-hydro
project models and diversify its geographical outreach by reaching to the Northern and Eastern states.
Second, the decision to include energy efficiency as a component was appropriate as many of the market
barriers to energy efficiency are similar to those for renewable energy. The flexibility adopted for types of
energy efficiency interventions eligible for support proved to be a crucial factor in allowing for
implementation of approaches that worked in the Indian context. Third, the TA design was appropriate for
enabling greater awareness about energy efficiency in the Indian industry, examining/testing different
approaches for financing efficiency investments, and in creating and strengthening capacities in the market
at large and in IREDA to finance efficiency investments. The TA design was revised at mid-term review to
focus on near term market opportunities and reduced its emphasis on certain policy aspects, given the
creation of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) who assumed the lead role in Indian Energy Efficiency
Policy work.

Adequacy of Client Commitment at Entry             At the time of appraisal, IREDA had already built a large
pipeline of sanctioned loans to be financed under the project. IREDA had also started building an energy
efficiency pipeline in anticipation of a 1998 start date. This early start in project preparation allowed
IREDA extra time in building a portfolio of loans in the new field of energy efficiency.

Assessment of Risks      The assessment of risks at the time of appraisal was moderately satisfactory. While
the risk from changes in government policy incentives for renewables was seen as low at appraisal, its
actual impact during several years of project implementation was substantial with the lapse of the MNES
tariff and the passage of the Electricity Act of 2003. Additionally, the risks emanating from multi-year
variations in hydrology were not envisaged at appraisal, though such risks had a significant financial impact
on loans for the sub-projects in Andhra Pradesh. The assessment of risk was appropriate regarding the
nascent stage of ESCO based energy efficiency models and in the case where the demand for energy-
efficiency investments did not materialize (or did not translate into bankable projects). Indeed, the project
was seen as mechanism which could adequately assess and address the risks inherent in implementing such
approaches.


b.       Implementation (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project
at Risk status, and actions taken, as applicable):

Initial Delays: The project was initially prepared in 1997-98 but the Board presentation was delayed due to
prevailing international sanctions against India. The project was finally approved by the Board in June 2000
and became effective in January 2001. In the interim period, some of the identified sub-projects were
funded through IREDA resources and the ongoing first World Bank line of credit. However, disbursements
under this second project were slow until the first line closed in December 2001. The slow initial off-take
combined with factors mentioned below affected implementation and eventually led to cancellation of part
of the proceeds.




                                                       17

Impact of Change in Policy and Regulatory Environment:              The lapse of prevailing government
guidelines1 for renewable power purchase tariffs created significant challenges for SHP developers. Under
the Electricity Act 2003 which was adopted several years after project effectiveness, the mandate for
Renewable Energy tariff policies was given to state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs). However,
in the absence of clear central policy guidelines and inadequate tools to determine the economic cost of
renewable energy vis-à-vis conventional power, most states could not swiftly issue new policies, leading to
significant regulatory uncertainty for new project developers who were unable to get approval for proposed
power purchase agreements (PPAs) for their potential plants. Several states took this opportunity to
terminate and renegotiate existing PPAs to lower levels. This situation represented significant risk for SHP
developers and lending institutions such as IREDA. Investment decisions and requests for disbursement
against previously approved loans were frequently delayed until the regulatory uncertainty was removed.
This problem was slowly resolved on a state-by-state basis over the course of the following three years.
Project development and consequent disbursement by IREDA against the WB LoC increased once future
revenue streams, as determined by state-specific regulatory PPA policies, became more secure.

Competition from Commercial Banks ­ Development of a Wider Market: During implementation IREDA
faced increasing competition from commercial banks which were now more interested in financing small
hydro and energy efficiency projects. At the time of project appraisal, commercial bank interest,
experience, and comfort in these types of investments was quite low, but the demonstrated financial
viability of the IREDA investments changed this perception. The credibility of IREDA's expertise in
appraising potential projects became increasingly recognized by the financial sector over the course of the
project, and several project developers who had initially applied for IREDA loans were able to obtain
financing from other commercial sources with loan applications made stronger by the fact that IREDA
sanctioning approval had been obtained. A total of thirty five sanctioned small hydro and energy efficiency
projects representing loans of more than US$ 136 million were dropped from the IREDA sanctioned
portfolio during implementation. Most of these projects obtained financing from other sources and have
since been commissioned. This is evident from a sample analysis undertaken as part of the final evaluation
of the project, which revealed that 15 out of 19 of these projects were commissioned, with one additional
SHP project currently under construction. Additionally, several loans were prepaid by project sponsors
who were able to obtain lower cost financing than could be provided by IREDA.

While this clearly signaled the "success" of the project in achieving overall goals of lowering barriers for
private sector development of EE and RE and in mainstreaming financing for such projects in local
commercial banks, it negatively impacted the disbursement of IDA/IBRD funds under the LoC, ultimately
leading to partial cancellation of US$ 26 million of the IBRD proceeds which were not likely to be used by
the time of project close. IREDA increasingly lost market share of a growing total market for RE and EE to
other competing financial institutions who were able to offer more flexible products and services from local
branch offices and who were not bound by many of IREDA's procedural processes. These processes were
criticized by some developers as too cumbersome and bureaucratic. This experience tested IREDA as an
institution, and proved ultimately useful by forcing IREDA to take several steps to improve the
attractiveness of its loan offerings, such as revising loan terms and conditions, implementing several actions
to streamline its business procedures and reducing documentation requirements.

Institutional and Governance Challenges: For a significant part of the project duration (about two and a
half years) the position of Managing Director (MD) of IREDA was vacant. This affected the overall
governance arrangements at IREDA, hampering institutional responsiveness in an increasingly competitive
market. However, in June 2007 the MD post was elevated to that of Chairman and Managing Director
(CMD) and the acting MD was formally appointed to this post. Soon after, the vacant post of Director
(Technical) was also filled, and three Independent Directors were appointed to the IREDA board which was


1The MNES guidelines were issued in 1994 and recommended a set rate of Rs. 2.25 per unit with a provision for
escalation of 5% per annum for 10 years.


                                                        18

a positive step in increasing IREDA operational independence from the Ministry of New and Renewable
Resources, which continues to be the principle shareholder of IREDA. With these changes IREDA
governance structure is much improved and oriented in a more commercial fashion.

Impact of Natural Causes: Natural causes also had a negative impact on the project. Six hydro sub
projects were implemented in AP, a state which faced drought conditions for three years from 2001-02 to
2003-04. Consequently, these projects experienced a severe decrease in available discharge levels, leading
to severely reduced opportunities to generate power, earn revenue and service debt. Not surprisingly, all of
these projects were soon classified as non-performing assets (NPAs). In 2001-02, IREDA funded interest
requirements and added the interest funded to the principal outstanding for these projects and revised their
loan repayment schedules. The drought conditions persisted through 2002-03 and 2003-04. As a result of all
of these events, IREDA came up with a restructuring package for these projects in 2005/6, and now all of
the project sponsors are now servicing their loans in a timely manner. This temporal concentration of NPAs
is a not unexpected outcome for a non-banking financial institution which is insufficiently diversified across
sectors and geographic locations. While increased IREDA lending in other states and for other types of
projects such as wind and energy efficiency will help mitigate future portfolio risk, IREDA will always
carry higher levels of exposure to natural disasters due to the composition of its lending portfolio which
supports its mission.

Implementation of the GEF TA Program (TAP): The GEF Technical Assistance Program (TAP) was
closely monitored and modified to respond to changing conditions, most notably the formation of the BEE
and the reduced prospects for utility-led DSM. With the establishment of the BEE, initial TAP work was
undertaken to support BEE policy activities such as technical support for issuance of new codes and
standards. As the BEE become more established, this policy support was no longer identified as a priority,
and TAP activities were refocused on other EE market and pipeline development tasks, including an
increased focus on increasing financial sector capacity to lend for EE. The GEF TAP also provided support
to IREDA for a package of strategic assignments in the areas of new business development for IREDA,
resource mobilization and organizational restructuring to enable better response to increasing competition in
the Indian market for clean energy financing.


c.       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E Design       The M&E plan for the project comprised of targets that were linked to achievements of
different project outputs. This included a capacity addition target of 200MW of small hydro sub-projects
(revised to 153 MW); commissioning energy efficiency sub-projects that had measurable energy and
capacity savings; and developing a sustainable energy efficiency portfolio and institutional capacity through
the TAP. This plan focused on monitoring and regular reporting of the progress in achieving the PDOs and
project outputs through quarterly progress reports (QPRs) from IREDA, annual reports, energy audits, and
direct feedback from relevant stakeholders.

During the mid-term review and in subsequent missions the M&E design was further strengthened to
include additional key indicators, as targets were not specified for some of the key project objectives.
Measurable indicators for the TA component were designed and an accompanying implementation plan
with expected outputs and timeframes was agreed on. In addition, it was agreed to strengthen and
streamline the information provided in the QPRs by adding an analysis of the critical areas of concern and a
detailed implementation plan to address these. IREDA built and strengthened its overall M&E systems
during the course of the project.

M&E Implementation: Targets for some of the project outcomes were not clearly defined at the beginning
of the project. This was addressed by laying out action plans with timeframes. Corrective actions were
taken when needed to revise action plans and timeframes for delivery.




                                                      19

M&E Utilization: QPR formats were revised during implementation to improve their effectiveness and
identify the need for corrective action. M&E information from QPRs was used to provide feedback to
IREDA on issues pertaining to project implementation, sectoral performance, contribution of the projects to
the installed capacity of hydro projects, development of capacity in the energy efficiency sector, and to
review outcomes of the project. This information helped IREDA/GoI and the Bank team maintain focus on
key outstanding issues and their timely resolution, which enabled successful achievement of project
development objectives.


d.       Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as
applicable):

Environmental Safeguards:          The primary focus of safeguard compliance for the small hydropower
(SHP) sub-projects was managing adverse impacts on the water environment and sensitive areas such as
forests. The potential negative impacts on air quality was the key issue to be addressed for the energy
efficiency projects. Another common theme during implementation of subprojects in both types of projects
related to ensuring sufficient worker and site safety. IREDA sub-projects were fully compliant with
environmental safeguards and it is noted that IREDA proactively improved its internal systems to ensure
compliance.

A separate environmental audit of the small hydro projects was undertaken during implementation and key
recommendations of the audit were adopted by IREDA through the development of a more streamlined
project appraisal process. Though this system could not be used on any of the sub-projects under the
operation as they were developed before the audit was completed, the system will be a very useful tool for
IREDA in the future especially as larger hydropower projects are pursued as part of the new business
strategy. Pre-disbursement (post-sanction) inspections were used to encourage the project developers to
improve on-site environmental management. In several small hydro locations, good practices on
environmental management were noted indicating sensitized project developers. Some of the observed
developer practices included tree plantations within the project sites, innovative arrangements for debris
disposal, and changing design of intake weir to have better control on minimum downstream flow
requirement. Common shortcomings included limited attention to workers' safety during implementation
and delays in obtaining regulatory clearances, especially from pollution control boards.

Social Development aspects:        Overall, the approach of SHP developers in encouraging effective
community involvement has been positive. Provision of employment opportunities for local people, tree
planting, provision of education, and support for recreational activities have been undertaken by several
SHP developers as part of their business practices. Proactive efforts to enter into active partnerships with
local communities fully respecting their needs is noted as a positive attribute of several of the SHP
developers. Land acquisition for SHP involving common lands has been a bottleneck issue, particularly in
states like Himachal Pradesh, and has been highlighted as an area requiring policy level attention.

Financial Management:              FM arrangements from a fiduciary perspective under the project were
implemented in a satisfactory manner. The project management report (PMR) formats designed at the
appraisal stage were found to be cumbersome during implementation and were therefore refined in the
second year. Thereafter, these were submitted on a regular basis, albeit a little delayed in a few instances.
Entity audits were regular and did not contain any major accountability issues. Project audits for the IDA
credit, GEF grant and IBRD loan were also submitted in time. Consolidated reporting for the three funding
sources (IBRD, IDA, GEF) was done for the financial statements from 2006-07 onwards.

Procurement:              Procurement undertaken by IREDA and its borrowers under the project was largely
satisfactory. Procurement of TA services and goods under GEF funding was also satisfactory, although
several activities experienced long procurement-related delays. There was considerable delay in awarding
the contract for the installation of an improved FM system and loan accounting system for IREDA. This




                                                      20

was due to several reasons cited in the aide memoires, and at the end of the project this activity still remains
incomplete.


e.      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase (including transition arrangement to post-
completion operation of investments financed by present operation, Operation & Maintenance
arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up
operation, if applicable)

Sustainability of sub-projects funded under the project:            Of the 44 SHP sub-projects funded under
the World Bank LoC, 34 have already been commissioned and the remaining 11 are expected to be
commissioned by March 2009. Of the 12 energy efficiency sub-projects supported, 11 have been
commissioned and the remaining one sub-project is expected to be commissioned by December 2008.
Despite the cost and time escalations in several cases, and lower capacity utilization factors due to vagaries
of hydrology in hydro sub-projects, it is seen that financial rates of return based on actual cost and
generation data is higher than the cost of capital. The private developers have an adequate incentive to
ensure appropriate operations and maintenance of these sub-projects. As a result, no significant post-
completion operational issues are anticipated.

Institutional and Financial Sustainability of IREDA: IREDA has matured as a financial institution
during the course of implementation of the two Bank projects, having financed over 200 projects in
renewable energy and energy efficiency. IREDA is the lead "green energy" financial institution in the
country and has won both regional and international recognition. IREDA's institutional capabilities have
been enhanced significantly during this period in resource mobilization, disbursement and maintaining
portfolio quality (as further detailed in Annex 10).

As a result of the strategic change consultancy studies, IREDA has a clear business development strategy
which has been approved by the IREDA Board which, if successfully implemented, will allow IREDA to
continue its leadership role in promotion and development of the RE and EE sectors. In additional to
expanding lending in familiar areas such as small hydro and wind, IREDA will also pursue financing
opportunities for medium sized renewable energy projects, supply-side efficiency, niche end-use energy
efficiency projects (such as waste heat recovery), biomass gasification for thermal applications in industries,
and solar photo voltaic projects.

As recommended in the strategic change studies, IREDA is also engaging with other financial institutions
for consortium financing of larger projects. Increased outreach to other specialized financial institutions
such as Power Finance Corporation (PFC) has helped forge new partnerships. While IREDA was not
successful in sourcing additional low cost funds from the domestic market, new resources are being
mobilized from international sources, including Asian Development Bank (ADB), European Investment
Bank (EIB), KfW and others. As a result, the institutional gains over the course of the Bank-financed
project are expected to sustain and expand going forward.

Next Phase / Follow-up Operation:

Rising global and local environmental concerns together with recent rapidly escalating fossil fuel prices
have led to increased support for energy efficiency and renewable energy development and consequent
increased demand for financing of these investments. The Government of India has also made a clear and
strong commitment to support scaling-up of renewable energy and energy efficiency, most recently as part
of the special missions under the National Climate Change Action Plan (2008). In this context, the enabling
policy and implementation environment for clean energy is likely to become increasingly stronger, further
supporting IREDA's future prospects for lending.

As a market leader in renewable energy financing, IREDA has built a unique capacity in this growing
market that sets it apart from other financial institutions now entering the field. IREDA has also built up its
capacity in energy efficiency financing and is also developing in-house carbon financing knowledge and


                                                        21

skills. IREDA has recently signed partnership agreements with larger institutions such as the Power
Trading Corporation (PTC), Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and the Infrastructure Development Finance
Company (IDFC) to structure and co-finance projects, which represents further evidence of the value these
institutions place on IREDA's capacity and experience.

IREDA had previously focused on financing smaller sized projects (1-10 MW) but is now focusing its
attention on larger projects as well, as was suggested by the outputs of the WB-supported strategic change
TA provided under this project. Among the recent new flagship projects is the loan for the 100 MW Tata
Power Wind Project, co-financed by IREDA and the private sector operations arm of the ADB.

There is a need for further financial support to IREDA at this critical juncture as it forges new partnerships
and pursues larger projects, which could be an opportunity for a new engagement between the World Bank
and IREDA. While the Indian market for commercial finance of clean energy investments has experienced
rapid expansion, there remain several areas which are not being served by the commercial finance market.
These areas including geographic zones such as in the Northeast where the level of private sector
investment in RE and EE is low, new business models that have the potential to become commercial, and
more complex project and financial structures. The ICR team recommends that the Bank engage with
IREDA and the Government to discuss and develop possible options for a new operation aligned to the new
IREDA business strategy and changing investment climate for clean energy. This recommendation is
consistent with recent CAS discussions on the sustainable growth pillar, whereby the Bank has stated that it
will assist the GOI to access additional funding for measures that further reduce GHG emissions.


c) Assessment of Outcomes

a.       Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

The project objectives and design are considered to be highly relevant to the current national priorities and
the Bank assistance strategy. The Government of India has placed a strong emphasis on clean energy
development and climate change as evident from the passage of the Energy Conservation act of 2001 and
the recently announced "National Action Plan on Climate Change."

The objectives of the project are fully consistent with Bank's 2004 CAS that supports partnerships for
Global Environment and promotes private sector led growth by provision of infrastructure. The project also
supports Millennium Development Goal 7: Ensuring Environmental Sustainability.


b.       Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environmental Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 4):

PDO-(a): Augment power supply through environmentally sustainable small hydro investments

The project was successful in augmenting power supply through environmentally sustainable small hydro
investments and mobilizing private sector investments in renewable energy power projects. The World
Bank has supported 45 sub projects with an installed capacity of 158.25 MW through the second line of
credit. Of these, 34 sub projects have been commissioned with installed capacity of 95.65 MW and 11 sub
projects with installed capacity of 62.60 MW are expected to be commissioned by March 2009.

During the project a number of regulatory developments at the central and state levels occurred that now
provide a good enabling environment for the development of SHP. Nineteen states have specific policies for
SHP, 10 states have notified feed-in tariff orders for SHP, and MNRE has announced a new capital subsidy
scheme to further support SHP. The total SHP capacity in the country exceeds 2100 MW as of March, 2008
and the target for capacity addition of SHP for the Eleventh plan is 1400 MW.


                                                       22

Out of the total capacity of 536.7 MW installed during the Tenth plan, this project directly supported 95.65
MW. Sub-projects that dropped out of the project but were completed with financing from other sources
contributed another 38 MW. Hence, the project supported about 25 percent of the planned SHP additions
during this period.

PDO-(b): Mobilize private sector investments in renewable energy power projects

Emergence of a Strong Segment of Private Sector SHP Developers: The project provided lending to 23 SHP
entrepreneurs at a time when funding from other sources was not readily available. The successful
implementation of these projects has led to some of these entrepreneurs leveraging their initial success to
then set up multiple projects in the same location. It has also instilled confidence by certain developers
previously only focused on local prospects to implement projects in new states, as was demonstrated when
entrepreneurs from Andhra Pradesh successfully set up SHP plants in Northern states. In some cases large
SHP players have also used the second LoC to develop expertise in project implementation and plant
management.

Increased Development of SHP sub-projects by Private Sector: Initially, all most SHP projects were in the
public sector in India. IREDA was a pioneer in fostering private sector based hydro development and, at
present almost all such projects are developed by private sector developers.

Increased Financing of SHP sub-projects by Commercial Banks: The sub-projects funded under Bank line
of credit took loans from IREDA at commercial terms or higher, and did not crowd out financing from the
commercial market. In fact, the success of World Bank-IREDA funded schemes aroused greater interest
from commercial banks, leading to the gradual emergence of a more competitive market for funding SHP
schemes. As noted earlier, some of the project developers originally assisted by IREDA took up additional
schemes with funding from other commercial sources. IREDA, however, is still widely recognized for its
strength in appraising SHP sub-projects and a number of the commercial banks do not have the required
expertise. Therefore, larger financial institutions have started partnering with IREDA through consortium
financing to utilize IREDA's expertise in evaluation of projects which combines well with their larger loan
limits and lower costs of funds. This has allowed IREDA to finance medium and large scale hydro projects.

PDO-(c): Promote energy efficiency and demand-side management (DSM) investments

Energy Efficiency Investments under the Project: The project was also successful in promoting energy
efficiency and demand-side management (DSM) investments which further augmented power supply.
Seventeen energy efficiency projects included in the portfolio at the time of project close are in various
stages of implementation, financed by the project and IREDAs own resources representing over 90 MW in
additional capacity / avoided peak demand. These projects have been financed by over US$ 36 million
directly disbursed for EE investment at the time of project close. The total amount of investment for
IREDA's energy efficiency loan portfolio, including sponsor's equity contributions and other cofinancing,
will exceed $74 million1 once final commissioning is complete. Twelve of these projects have been
commissioned by project close, and the estimated savings projected for these projects is 249 million kWh
equivalent per year.

Commercial Bank lending in Energy Efficiency: Based on IREDA's experience in energy efficiency
financing, several local banks have also launched loan programs for energy efficiency. Five banks,
namely State Bank of India, Canara Bank, Union Bank, Bank of Baroda and the Bank of India,
have launched new lending schemes for energy efficiency.




1A fixed exchange rate of Rs.44.83 per US $ was used to calculate US $ contributions made by borrower/project sponsors across
the project timeline.



                                                              23

Enhanced Policy Environment and Institutional Support for Energy Efficiency The Energy Conservation
Act, 2001 was a critical milestone for energy efficiency in India. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE)
was established as a statutory body under the Ministry of Power to plan, implement and monitor the various
programs under the Act, including standards and labeling programs, certification and accreditation for
energy managers/auditors, energy efficiency policy research, awareness and development and
implementation of energy efficient building codes, among other activities.

Increased availability and utilization of energy efficiency interventions: Successful lending for EE sub-
projects by IREDA demonstrated the financial viability of such investments, leading to increased
acceptance and financing by both the concerned industries and by the commercial banking sector. For
example, waste heat recovery systems were few in India prior to the implementation of the investments
under the project. However, this option is now widely accepted as viable throughout the industry. Annex
11 presents a good example of how financially sick enterprises units can be revived with effective
deployment of energy efficiency measures. Many activities supported under the GEF TAP provided support
for the increased use of EE in numerous sectors through market awareness and demonstration activities

GEO: Enhance and sustain improved end-use energy efficiencies with consequent reduction in
carbon emissions

The activities supported under the GEF TAP were able to successfully provide institutional development
support to IREDA to create and expand the new line of business of energy efficiency lending, increase
broader awareness and capacity for EE, and increase market development for increased energy efficiency
investments, by both IREDA and the commercial banking sector.

While the initial project included a specific focus on ESCO development, this mechanism has not achieved
widespread success in the Indian context. ESCOs in India face a number constraints including inability to
prepare bankable projects, limited legal and contractual capabilities, poor contract enforcing environment,
poor balance sheets and limited experience and expertise in structuring projects with adequate payment
structures. Nevertheless, the ESCO activities under this project have provided valuable initial experience,
and will support future BEE programs in this area.

The total estimated energy and CO2 savings which will be achieved assuming successful commissioning of
the projects under implementation is 6.70 million tons of CO2 reduction.


c.       Efficiency (Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate
norms, least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return):

SHP Sub-projects

Financial Analysis: At appraisal, the FIRRs of 14 sub-projects in the project pipeline were calculated to be
in the range of 22.0 to 40.1 percent. On project completion, FIRRs for 24 of the sub-projects funded under
Bank line of credit (for which actual generation data could be obtained) were found to range between 15
and 51 percent. The FIRRs for the same sub-projects at the time of loan sanction were calculated to be in
the range of 15 to 56 percent. Project unit costs for eighty percent of the projects ranged from US$ 960/kW
to US$ 1526/kW but there were projects with costs as low as US$607/kW and as high as $1857/kW as well.
The wide variation in unit project costs is on account of the locations and types of SHP projects
implemented and to a small extent on exchange rate discrepancies.


Economic Analysis: At appraisal, the EIRRs of 14 sub-projects in the project pipeline were calculated to
be in the range of 20.5 to 51.3 percent. On project completion, EIRRs for 23 of the sub-projects funded
under Bank line of credit (for which actual generation data could be obtained) were found to range between
27 - 224 percent in all cases higher than the hurdle rate. The EIRRs for the same sub-projects at the time of
loan sanction were calculated to be in the range of 21 to 47 percent.



                                                       24

EE Sub-projects

Financial Analysis: At appraisal, the FIRRs of 16 sub-projects in the indicative pipeline were calculated to
be in the range of 26 to 158 percent. On project completion, FIRRs for 5 of the sub-projects funded under
Bank line of credit (for which actual generation data could be obtained) were found to range between 11
and 91 percent. The FIRRs for the same sub-projects at the time of loan sanction were calculated to be in
the range of 26 to 51 percent.

Economic Analysis: The Economic rates of returns (EIRRs) were calculated for a sample of projects and
found to range between 53 and 238 percent. Although a one on one comparison with appraisal estimates
was not possible due to the rapidly changing portfolio, this compares well with the appraisal estimates of a
range of 26-155 percent for a different sample of projects.


d.       Justification of Overall Outcome and GEO Outcome Rating (combining relevance,
achievement of PDOs/GEO, and efficiency):

The project was and remains highly relevant to GoI priorities, and was successful in achievement of the
development objectives. The project has had a positive impact in increasing private sector financing of
renewable and energy efficiency projects.

Rating: Satisfactory


e.       Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered
or to amplify discussion above):

Emergence of a wider market for financing RE and EE projects                IREDA's pioneering role in
financing private sector renewable energy and energy efficiency projects has been instrumental in
stimulating the interest of other commercial financial institutions to enter this sector. Numerous
commercial banks are now active in financing renewable energy and energy efficiency projects through
existing financial products, and five have launched new specific schemes to finance energy efficiency
investments in SMEs.

IREDA's internal procedures in issuing new loan products are often less flexible than those utilized by the
domestic financial market participants, although IREDA has been able to increase the variety and
competitiveness of its loan products and has streamlined its procedures. However, as a publicly owned
nonbanking financial institution, it will be extremely challenging for IREDA to match the offerings and
flexibility of the commercial financial markets. IREDA must therefore focus on areas where it has
comparative advantages.


Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Employment: Almost all of the hydro sub projects employ workers from neighboring villages. Because
these sub projects are located in remote areas where fewer avenues for regular employment exist, they offer
the local people one an attractive employment opportunity. These projects can offer unskilled labor wages
of up to Rs. 3,000 per month, Rs. 4,000 per month in case of semi-skilled and up to Rs. 5,000 per month for
highly skilled workers. The SHP portfolio provided direct employment to approximately 700 people.

Tree Plantations: Most SHP projects located in the hills require some cutting of trees during construction.
Although the SHP developers pay compensation to the Forest Department, many also plant additional
saplings as part of project construction. Afforestation not only improves the aesthetics of the project site, it
also reduces the frequency of land slides. Once developer has planted more than 3500 trees over the past 3
years and has plans to add another 1000 by the end of 2008.



                                                      25

Education: Provision of support for education as a local contribution to the community is quite common for
SHP developers. This can include support to local village schools through infrastructure provision, supplies
for poor children (books and uniforms), or other contributions such as direct contributions or sponsorship of
events.

Roads: Since most of the SHP sites are located in remote areas, there was a need to construct roads to
transport materials and equipment to the project sites. This has benefitted the local communities by
increasing accessibility. Forty four sub projects contributed to the development of almost 90 km of roads
and bridges, further improved accessibility to neighboring villages. This has had a positive developmental
impact, as some of these villages, especially in the hilly areas of Himachal Pradesh, were completely
inaccessible before.


Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development):

The World Bank loans have assisted IREDA in establishing itself as a leading Indian institution providing
financing for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. In particular the Technical Assistance Plan
has enabled IREDA to strengthen its capacity in knowledge management and improved IT systems, energy
efficiency knowledge, procurement and safeguards, and evolution of a corporate strategic vision through the
strategic change consultancy. A credit risk rating system was also designed and implemented under the
TAP to allow for improved risk based evaluation of proposed projects.

IREDA now has a much stronger governance framework with post of Managing Director elevated to
Chairman and Managing Director, appointment of Director (Technical) and three Independent Directors,
and the strengthening of audit committee.

Most of the recommendations of the strategic change consultancy are being implemented by IREDA. These
include increased business focus on consortium financing, medium hydropower projects, waste-heat
recovery projects. While IREDA was not able to source low cost funds from the domestic market, new
sources of financing have been identified from bilateral and multilateral sources. As a result of these
initiatives as well as addressing some of the key gaps in its operations, IREDA has been able to improve its
overall financial and operational performance. Its disbursements have shown about 35 percent growth for
the last two years and Non-Performing Assets have been reducing, leading to better profitability.


Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

Local Area Benefits of SHP Sub-projects:          Almost all of these sub projects are located in remote areas
and have a positive impact on the local economy through net cash inflow into the region whereby the local
population gets more livelihood opportunities and the local businesses are called onto deliver more services
for construction, and logistical support and material for regular O&M.

Rating for Risk to GEO Outcome: Low

The overall risk to the development outcome and the global environment outcome is rated low on the basis
that the project sub-projects components have been successfully commissioned.


e) Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design,
implementation and outcome issues)
a.       Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

Rating: Satisfactory

The project was, and remains strategically relevant to Government priorities including reduction of
infrastructure bottlenecks and the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency in the country.
Quality at entry was satisfactory and the implementation arrangements building on lessons learned from the
Renewable Resources Development Project were appropriate and consistent with the Bank's fiduciary role.
There were minor shortcomings associated with the approval of the second project while the first was still
effective, which led to low initial disbursement under the second line.

Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies):

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank team played an active and effective role in the supervision of this project during the course of
implementation, and proactively provided support to address implementation problems as they arose,
including disbursements concerns, changes in IREDA management structure, and support for IREDA
Strategy & Action Plan study which helped define IREDA's future role, financing strategy and improved
organization structure /business processes. At least eleven supervision missions were undertaken by the
Bank. Corrective actions were taken when needed to ensure achievement of the PDOs, including partial
cancellation of the IBRD loan, realignment of the GEF technical assistance component to meet changing
needs and refining project monitoring indicators. A number of field visits were undertaken to ensure
compliance with safeguards, and to verify physical progress and achievements. The Bank's input to the
Strategy and Action Plan was highly valued by IREDA, and has led to institutional improvement and robust
prospects for continued IREDA lending to RE and EE beyond the project close date.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

For the above cited reasons, the overall rating of the Bank performance is rated Satisfactory

b.       Borrower Performance

Government Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The performance of the government counterpart Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) was
moderately satisfactory. The power sector in India underwent dramatic change during the project
implementation period with the passage of the Electricity Act and the establishment of SERCs. Prior to the
passage of the Act, the Ministry had issued recommended guidance on state-level power purchase prices for
grid-connected renewable energy, guidance which expired in 2004. No additional central guidance was
given to the individual SERCs who were reexamining their policies on grid connected renewables. As a



                                                       27

result, developers were subject to significant new regulatory risks as new PPAs were not approved and
several states began reexamined existing PPAs. This negatively impacted the project as developers who
had sanctioned or signed loans from IREDA delayed their project construction schedules until their PPAs
were approved. Numerous projects were delayed or dropped due to this change in the enabling
environment. The project was also affected by the two plus year delay in filling the vacant position of
Managing Director of IREDA which negatively affected the decision making capacity and strategic vision
for the organization.

On the positive side, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) was established by Ministry of Power after the
project had been effective, and while it was not a formally a project counterpart in project design, it did
provide effective coordination and collaboration with relevant EE activities supported by the GEF TAP.

During the last two years of implementation, the MNRE provided significantly improved levels of support
to IREDA and to the World Bank project. The governance arrangements at IREDA have been strengthened
under the direction on MNRE, the strategy and action plan for IREDA has been accepted by the ministry
and IREDA has been extended support on various steps towards implementing its plan.

Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

IREDA consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to fulfilling the project development objectives and
provided adequate internal staff and resources to ensure implementation success despite the difficult
enabling environment changes which were outside of its direct control. It complied with all Bank loan
covenants and discharged its fiduciary duties in a satisfactory manner. The quality of supervision support
by IREDA technical officers was high, and their intensive efforts in following up with the individual
promoters was a key factor for ultimate project success. IREDA was able to alter its policies and lending
norms to adapt to changing market conditions, although this was done at a pace that could not match the
changes in the local financial markets, and several sanctioned projects ultimately were taken up by local FIs
which could offer more competitive projects. IREDA has adopted many of the recommendations from the
Strategic Change Consultancy, which has improved its prospects for the future. The major shortcoming of
IREDA during project implementation was the slow pace of reimbursement processing and the slow pace of
procurement per WB guidelines for activities funded by the GEF TAP, although this showed some
improvement by the time of project close.

· Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Per the World Bank ICR Ratings guidelines, the overall borrower performance is rated as moderately
satisfactory.


f) Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

Overall Lessons: Need for Transition Strategy of Supported Institutions if Project Goal includes increased
commercial finance

Lesson 1: Transition Strategy Upfront consideration must be given to a transition strategy for World Bank
projects supporting RE/EE lending thorough a specialized financial institution to address the future
commercial bank competition that will inevitably arise from successful project implementation. Future
challenges often include both direct financial challenges as the commercial market is often able to provide
lower cost funding at more flexible terms, capacity challenges including how to retain public sector staff
once the private sector enters the market, and institutional challenges, as new directions are needed once
original objectives have been met.


                                                       28

Lesson 2: Technical assistance to commercial financial institutions is an important element of building
institutional capacity to mainstream knowledge regarding clean energy market development:            In order
to adequately scale up lending for renewable energy and energy efficiency, the local banking sector must be
an active participant. TA support can increase knowledge of the technical, policy and regulatory aspects of
this market to allow improved understanding of sector risks when providing debt financing for such
projects. Therefore, awareness and capacity building of commercial financial institutions for clean energy
market development projects should be incorporated into initial project designs, even when primary lending
activity is channeled through a single intermediary.

Lessons on Renewable Energy (SHP) Development:

Lesson 3: A predictable policy and regulatory environment is a critical precondition for private sector led
RE development:          Having a supportive policy environment, including transparent, predictable feed-in
tariffs and policy decision making, is critical for private sector led development of small-medium
hydropower projects. Other favorable policies which could further support the development of the RE
sector if adopted include facilitation of developer access to land, and adoption of transparent and timely
technical and environmental clearance processes by local regulators.

Lesson 4: Economic Valuation of Renewable Energy vis-à-vis Conventional Energy can provide
significant policy and regulatory insights.          Establishment of a suitable policy and regulatory
environment for renewable energy can be hampered due to the lack of adequate tools and skills in assessing
the full economic value of renewable energy power provided to the grid. In addition to the direct power
benefits, renewable energy can also produce other benefits such as local and global environmental benefits,
improvements in energy security, fuel risk mitigation through diversification, technology development, and
modularity that need to be fully understood in the Indian context. Projects which provide financing for RE
projects would be well served by providing complementary analytic support to regulators to strengthen
policy making and the resulting enabling environments.

Lesson 5: Development of adequate power evacuation infrastructure is essential.              One of the most
crucial issues and/or potential barriers in the scaling up development of large and small hydro plants is the
interconnection between the plant and the nearest grid point to maximize the power usage. Providing grid
extension up to the SHP plants based on an integrated basin development approach is one solution which
should be considered when encouraging hydropower development.

Lesson 6: Inherent risks in SHP sub-projects need suitable mitigation measures               SHP sub-projects
can be extremely vulnerable to unforeseen variations in hydrology, especially in the first few years of
commissioning. Adequate risk coverage/insurance products could be built in the business model to mitigate
such risks for both the developers and lenders.

Lesson 7: SHP entrepreneurs are eager to expand in scale as well as geographically and can do so if
given sufficient support          Significant entrepreneurial capacity for SHP sub-projects has been
developed during the two World Bank renewable energy projects in India. The twenty three SHP
developers supported under the second project have gradually increased both their number of plants in
operation and the average size of their newly constructed plants. This increased private sector capacity has
produced many indirect benefits, and can be further harnessed for future efforts in the country. Demand
remains strong only for grid-connected run-of-river and dam-toe business models and there is limited
private sector in other models.

Lesson 8: Scaling-up manufacturing and turnkey EPC contracting capacity is crucial This was noted as
a bottleneck for small hydro development in India and developers have started importing equipment as the
delivery time offered by Indian manufacturers is excessive. In India in the hydro sector, there are very few
integrated EPC contractors. Contracts are usually split between civil construction and plant and machinery
installation, which makes negotiation of EPC contracts relatively complex. Therefore there is a need to




                                                        29

address functional, technical and price related aspects across contracts. Otherwise, developers may face the
risk of time and cost overruns and lower profitability.

Lesson 9: Developing Capable Institutions is a time-intensive process and once developed they should be
leveraged to achieve greater impact       Bank support to IREDA in course of this and the previous project
has helped develop IREDA into one of the strongest renewable energy development institution in the
country and in the region. The Bank's support in strengthening fiduciary and safeguard functions,
governance arrangements and strategic vision for the institution, especially towards the later half of this
project, have further strengthened IREDA. The GoI can now leverage the institutional capacities and sector
development vision offered by IREDA to further the renewable energy development and climate change
mitigation objectives in the country.

Lessons on Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management:

Lesson 10: Financial Intermediation projects which fund EE should allow for development of different
business models            Different energy efficiency business models should be tried out to allow maximum
flexibility in achieving desired outcomes given the constant shifts in market conditions. In India, end-user
implemented approaches have been more successful when compared to ESCO and DSM type projects. The
flexibility in project design enabled numerous types of EE eligible products to be financed under the LoC,
which also let IREDA focus its efforts on more promising market segments, such as waste heat recovery
and cogeneration, while shifting time and internal resources from sectors where business was less likely to
materialize.

Lesson 11: Smaller EE projects face different market barriers and may be best reached through
alternative instruments:           Large companies with access to information, technical consultants and
finance find it less difficult to implement EE projects either with IREDA financing or through other sources
when compared to the SME sector. SMEs face several additional market constraints and barriers. The lack
of local branch offices of IREDA made communication with smaller SME units difficult under the project,
and relationships were often complicated by the presence of existing SME lending relationships with local
banks. Future efforts designed to finance EE at SMEs should work through local financing institutions
which may be better placed to expand EE lending to this sector.

across the project timeline. World Bank contributions, however, are based on actual US$ disbursements made throughout the
project, in real terms.
3Estimate for EE is higher than originally projected because the EE portfolio included more projects than originally envisaged, and
commercial banks took up some projects for which initial disbursements were made.
4During the period of implementation of this project, other donors financed a large number of activities (in particular USAID),
reducing the identified requirements. Notable is the USAID's Energy Conservation and Commercialization Project that provided
US$ 25 million in assistance during 2000-08.

The project objectives were satisfactorily achieved, although the project required two one-year extensions
and a partial cancellation of IBRD funds. While the outputs under the different project components were
fully satisfactory, the implementation of the project was affected by extraneous factors which resulted in the
cancellation of part of the proceeds. The allocations for small hydropower sub-projects and energy
efficiency sub-projects were notional in the project design as where the allocations for the different SHP

Forty-five sub-projects were supported out of which 34 sub-projects have been commissioned with a total
installed capacity of 95.65 MW.

Contribution of Small Hydropower Development during the Tenth Plan: The project made a significant
contribution to the Tenth Plan target of 550MW capacity addition of SHP development. Out of the total
capacity of 536.7 MW installed during the Tenth Plan, the Bank's LoC directly supported about 96 MW of
commissioned projects. Projects which dropped out of the Bank's LoC but were still completed during this
period contributed another 38 MW of SHP capacity. Hence, the Bank's LoC directly and indirectly
supported approximately 25 percent of the capacity addition in the SHP sector during this period.

While costs of certain sub-projects were higher than specified at appraisal, the economic rate of return
(EIRR) ranged between 27 percent and 224 percent. The unit project costs showed a wide variation. Eighty
percent of the projects ranged from US$ 960/kW to US$ 1526/kW but there were projects with costs as low
as US$607/kW and as high as $1857/kW as well. The wide variation in unit project costs is on account of
the locations and varying types of SHP projects implemented and to a small extent on exchange rate
discrepancies.

The final evaluation report on the Second Renewable Energy LoC, conducted by PwC on behalf of the
borrower, shows that the performance of the projects is uneven and on average below the appraisal
estimates. Projects were supposed to generate 426.2 MUs annually at an aggregate CUF of 54.4 percent.
However, based on available generation figures for 32 sub-projects, 402.38 MUs are projected to be
actually generated every year in FY08 and beyond. Table 2.3 highlights the current generation status:

Component B: Energy-Efficiency Investments:                  Seventeen EE projects included in IREDA's energy
efficiency portfolio at the time of project closure are in various stages of implementation. These are
financed by the Bank's LoC and IREDA's own resources, representing over US$ 36 million disbursed for
EE investment at the time of project closure. The total amount of investment for IREDA's entire EE loan
portfolio, including sponsor's equity contributions, is over US$ 74 million. These projects represent 90 MW
of new capacity/avoided peak demand.

The share of the Bank's disbursement directly financed under the second LoC is US$16.93 through 12 sub-
projects. All but one sub-project financed directly by the Bank have been commissioned. The last project,
Shri Venkateswara Sponge and Power is under implementation, and initial disbursements were made under
the second LoC.

The twelve EEC projects directly financed under the second LoC will save approximately 249 million kWh
of energy per year.

The total estimated CO2 savings which will be achieved, assuming successful commissioning of the projects
under implementation, is 9.43 million tons1 over the life of the investments.

IREDA consultants prepared an analysis of the cost over-run of the EEC projects which indicates that the
cost over-runs were within 10 percent.

Component C: Technical Assistance: The GEF-financed TA supported numerous activities to
promote EE and DSM investments. Initially, the TAP focused on: (i) capacity and institution building
support at IREDA; (ii) implementation support for EE lending activities; (iii) policy support; and (iv)
market awareness. The program of activities was closely monitored during implementation, and was
revised numerous times to better match activities with needs.

These four main areas were divided into 12 discreet tasks supported by the TAP, and included the following
specific activities:

1 Advisory Services for ESCO Mechanism:                  This activity included: (i) analytical work on the Indian
experience with the ESCO mechanism in the public sector, to support BEE-ESCO programs: and (ii) pilot
handholding to support the design and procurement of ESCO-delivered efficiency services in eight hospitals
and government buildings. As of project close date of March 31, 2008, all baseline audit work was
completed and Request for Proposal (RFP) documents were issued, but none of the ESCO contracts have
been successfully awarded.


1This is based on the assumption of a project lifetime of 20 years.


                                                             35

2 Project Monitoring and Verification:            IREDA was provided support in the development of: (i)
monitoring and verification (M&V) protocols for efficiency projects; (ii) preparation of a project
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) manual; (iii) concurrent auditing and monitoring of IREDA- financed
projects; and (iv) post commissioning and evaluation of EE projects.

3 Policy Support Initiative:      Analytical work was undertaken to support: (i) BEE's development of EE
codes and standards for certain equipment; (ii) Preparation of a directory of consultants and energy auditors;
and (iii) production of investors' manuals for EE.

4 Knowledge Management Plan:              The activity focused on improving IREDA's institutional capacity
and portfolio management capability by providing assistance for upgrading hardware and software, to
strengthen IREDA's internal operational performance in EE and RE lending.

5 Energy Efficiency Capacity Building Initiative:          This activity included training and capacity
building of IREDA and various stakeholders (industry, government and the financial sector) on EE.
Training programs were also conducted on environmental and social impact assessment issues.

Support was also provided for the strategic change consultancy under this activity. The strategic change
consultancy influenced the current business plan of IREDA and included three main pieces: (i) the
"Strategy and Action Plan;" (ii) the "Resource Mobilization Plan" and (iii) "Reviewing Systems and
Procedures of IREDA for its Lending Operations and Developing a Suitable Action Plan for Organizational
Restructuring." The final piece on reviewing systems and procedures was not completed by project close,
and remaining work on this piece was supported by IREDA's internal resources

6 Project Development Sub-Projects: This activity provided an additional grant incentive for select new
lending products.

7 Procurement Advisory Services:          This task provided specialist services to IREDA to support
procurement of goods, works and consultancy services in a timely manner as per the World Bank
guidelines.

8 Performance Evaluation of the World Bank LoC:            Independent evaluations were undertaken for both
the mid-term and final review of the project.

9 Project Partnership Program:            This activity provided funding for IREDA's business development
associates to generate new projects and to maintain EE information centers. It also provided ground-level
support for the ESCO's activities included in activity 1.

10 Market Awareness and Outreach: This activity included numerous tasks designed to increase
awareness of EE and to increase demand for EE lending. Numerous unique marketing products were
created, and disseminated through media outreach and targeted marketing through conferences and business
meetings.

11 Creative Market Development Initiative:        SME cluster-based activities were undertaken in the
textile, hotel, cement and paper sectors to increase lending for EE. Eleven projects were implemented,
although only one ultimately took a loan from IREDA.

12 Support to Commercial Banks:           This activity supported analytical work to increase Indian bank
lending for EE, market support for bank sub-projects for EE for SMES, and a small grant program to
partially cover energy audit costs undertaken through SBI Project Uptech for EE.

Financial Analysis

At appraisal, the FIRRs of 14 sub-projects in the project pipeline were calculated to be in the range of 22.0
percent to 40.1 percent. On project completion, FIRRs for 24 of the sub-projects funded under the Bank's
LoC (for which actual generation data could be obtained) were found to range between 15 percent and 51
percent. The FIRRs for the same sub-projects at the time of loan sanction were calculated to be in the range
of 15 percent to 56 percent. Scheme-wise details of FIRRs are provided in Table 3.1.

Key Assumptions / Data:
    (a) Actual project data on costs (including escalations) have been obtained from IREDA. For all
        projects, project construction period has been taken as 1-3 years. The debt-equity ratio has been
        assumed to be 70:30.
    (b) Sale price used in the calculation is as per the appraisal note. However the sale price may have
        changed over the years. For instance, for Himachal Pradesh, the PPA price earlier was Rs. 2.5 per
        kWh, which has been revised to Rs. 2.87 per kWh.



                                                       38

    (c) It is assumed that O&M cost of any plant is approximately 2.5 percent of the total project cost for
        year-1 and further escalated by 5 percent annually for all projects. Actual O&M costs were not
        available for each of the sub-projects.
    (d) Subsidy figures used in the FIRR calculation have been provided by IREDA. The subsidy amount
        is entirely accounted for in the cash flow of the first year itself.

Reasons for Deviation from PAD Estimates
The financial analysis of the portfolio indicates that for majority of the projects, the actual FIRRs are below
the estimates prepared at the feasibility stage. The difference between FIRRs at appraisal, detailed project
reports (DPRs) and project completion is on account of the following reasons:
        Pipeline of sub-projects was changed during the period between appraisal (July 1997) and approval
        (June 2007) owing to a delay in the Bank's approval on account of international sanctions against
        India at that time. Therefore, this is not strictly a one-on-one comparison.
        The prevailing government policy at the time of appraisal provided a 10 percent annual increase in
        tariffs for generation from RE schemes, and high FIRRs were therefore only to be expected. With
        the introduction of the new Electricity Act, 2003 and lapse of the earlier government policy, the
        mandate for determination of tariffs for RE projects was given to state electricity regulators (SERs).
        As a result, there were significant changes in tariff determination approaches across states, which
        impacted several sub-projects funded under the Bank's LoC.
        Implementation of the sub-projects also faced cost and time overruns due to factors such as natural
        calamities, inflation in commodity prices, unforeseen civil works, delay in statutory clearances, and
        poor performance of contractors (see Text Box-3.2).
        The capacity utilization factor (CUF) of the projects have also varied due to decreased flows, silting
        and low grid availability (see Text Box-3.1).
However, revised estimates of FIRR are greater than cost of capital in all cases, and therefore all these SHP
sub-projects are financially sustainable.



                                                  Text Box- 3.1

                           Factors affecting Capacity Utilization of SHP Schemes

        Variations in Rainfall and Inconsistent Hydrology: SHP sub-projects are affected by variations
        in flow of water caused by changes in rainfall patterns. For example, the Lodhama hydro project
        in West Bengal experienced 20 percent lower discharge in the lean season.

        Silting of Rivers: In addition to a large amount of silting inherent to the Himalayan rivers,
        generation from some SHP sub-projects is also affected by silting from upstream mining and
        construction activities. For example, the Maujhi-I scheme has been affected by silting from slate
        mining on slopes above the power plant site.

        Breakdown of Transmission Infrastructure and Grid Failures:            Another key factor affecting
        the capacity utilization has been the failure of the electricity system in project areas causing plants
        to stop operations. For example, the Hanuman Ganga scheme lost a substantial amount of
        generation due to persistent grid failures. As against a projected CUF of 78.7 percent, the scheme
        achieved only 63.2 percent in 2006-07 and 57.5 percent in 2007-08. Similarly, transmission
        breakdown in case of the Lodhama Hydro Electric Station affected generation.

                                                  Text Box-3.2

                        Factors leading to Time and Cost Overrun of SHP Schemes

   Of the 33 sub-projects commissioned under the project (for which actual data was available), 15 have
   a cost escalation of 5 percent or less. The other 17 sub-projects have escalation in the range of 15
   percent of the original cost estimates. In general, cost escalation of about 15 percent is seen as
   acceptable for SHP sub-projects keeping in view high implementation risks, long construction period
   and increase in cost of raw materials. About two-thirds of all projects were implemented within six
   months of projected commissioning. Broadly the reasons for time and cost escalations in case of SHP
   sub-projects are as follows:
       Delay in Statutory Clearances: Delay in obtaining the required environmental, land and other
       statutory clearances result in implementation delays for projects such as Neora SHP and
       Birsignhpur SHP scheme.
       Impact of Natural Calamities: Natural calamities such as floods and landslides have also
       impacted project implementation, causing time overruns. For example, the Bonal Mini SHP was
       delayed by almost 44 months largely because of recurring floods in the area. Similarly, power
       house construction in case of Jiwa SHP was affected by cloud bursts.
       Delay in Implementation of Evacuation System: In some projects located far from the grid,
       implementation was impacted due to delays in the construction of the transmission system.
       Unforseen Civil Work: In some projects, unexpected additional civil work needs delayed project
       implementation. For example, rock structures and the presence of hard rock caused delay in the
       Balaji energy SHP project.
       Price Inflation for Raw Materials like Cement and Steel: Projects also faced increase in costs
       due to increase in prices of raw materials such as cement and steel.
       Non-performance of Contractors: Developers also cited poor performance of contractors as a
       reason for cost and time overrun of projects.
 In some cases, cost escalations are on account of changed specifications of the scheme, leading to
 increased generation capacity.



Economic Analysis
At appraisal, the EIRRs of 14 sub-projects in the project pipeline were calculated to be in the range of 20.5
percent to 51.3 percent. On project completion, EIRRs for 23 of the sub-projects funded under the Bank's
LoC (for which actual generation data could be obtained) were found to range between 27 percent and 224
percent, in all cases higher than the hurdle rate. The EIRRs for the same sub-projects at the time of loan
sanction were calculated to be in the range of 21 percent to 47 percent. Scheme-wise details of EIRRs are
provided in Table 3.2.

Key Assumptions
In addition to the relevant assumptions already mentioned in the financial analysis, the following
assumptions have been used for economic analysis of SHP schemes:
    (a) Cost of diesel-based generation has been estimated at Rs.10 per kWh. This is also consistent with
        the revised maximum unscheduled interchange (UI) rate of Rs. 10.00 per kWh provided by the
        Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC). The prevailing capacity and energy deficit
        scenario in India is likely to continue in the medium term and therefore the cost of diesel-based
        generation is a suitable measure of economic benefit of the project.
    (b) Economic costs of sub-projects were derived by adjusting the financial costs for taxes by applying
        the standard conversion factor of 0.9.

Reasons for Deviation from PAD Estimates
        As mentioned in the financial analysis section, the sub-projects at completion are different from
        sub-projects in the pipeline at appraisal.
        Several of the sub-projects have been affected by cost and time overruns, including the impact of
        commodity inflation.
        However, the most significant reason for increase in economic return from almost all sub-projects
        despite cost and time overruns and lower than expected capacity utilization in several cases, is the
        increase in cost of diesel-based generation. At appraisal, the cost of diesel-based generation was
        estimated at Rs.3.38 per kWh, whereas at completion this has been estimated at Rs. 10 per kWh
        (global petroleum prices have increased even further since this analysis).


II. ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Financial Analysis

At appraisal, the FIRRs of 16 sub-projects in the indicative pipeline were calculated to be in the range of 26
percent to 158 percent. On project completion, FIRRs for five of the sub-projects funded under the Bank's
LoC (for which actual generation data could be obtained) were found to range between 11 percent and 91
percent. The FIRRs for the same sub-projects at the time of loan sanction were calculated to be in the range
of 26 percent to 51 percent.



                                                       41

Actual FIRRs could be calculated and compared with appraisal estimates only for a sample of sub-projects
(five in number) owing to difficulties in obtaining data. Table 3.3 illustrates the comparison of FIRRs for
these 5 sub-projects. For calculating the actual FIRR, the following assumptions were used:
         (a) Actual project cost (including cost escalations) have been used in the FIRR calculation.
         (b) It is assumed that increase in O&M cost of any plant which has implemented EEC project
         involving installation of EE equipment is almost negligible.

    Mahendra Sponge & Power (P) Ltd.                     46                   22                  20
    Arunachalam Sugar Mills Ltd.                         26                   12                  25

The FIRR in case of GMR is very high as the actual energy savings are 3.62 million kWh/annum against
the projected 2.46 million kWh/annum. However, FIRR in case of Anand Tissues Ltd. is negative because
the actual energy savings are just 0.65 million kWh/annum against the projected value of 2.197 million
kWh/annum, although there is some uncertainty related to this figure which was not independently verified.

Economic Analysis

The EIRRs were calculated for a sample of projects and found to range between 53 percent and 238 percent.
Table 3.4 illustrates the calculation of actual EIRR. Although a one-on-one comparison with appraisal
estimates was not possible due to the rapidly changing portfolio, this compares well with the appraisal
estimates of a range of 26 percent to155 percent for a different sample of projects.

 The Line of Credit included an IDA component US$ 50 Million, IBRD Component of US$ 80.00
 Million and GEF component of US$ 5.00 Million whereas IREDA has to bring counterpart funding of
 US$ 2.00 Million, only for GEF. The IDA and IBRD components are poised for project funding while
 the GEF and IREDA's Counterpart are assigned to support the Technical Assistance / Capacity
 Building objectives to remove market barriers to delivery of Energy Efficiency Services and products.

 The loan agreement was executed on 11th August 2000 and made effective from 31st January 2001.
 The closing date of LoC was fixed for 31st March `2006.

 During the course of implementation a number of policy issues etc., beyond the control of IREDA and
 the sub-project promoters, had come up, affecting timely implementation/ progress of the project.
 Therefore, the matter was taken up by IREDA with the WB through GoI which was considered and
 accordingly, on 24.06.2005 World Bank approved extension of the closing date of the LoC up to
 31.03.2007 with a reduction of US$ 18 million from IBRD allocations. Subsequently, a second
 extension in closing date up to 31.03.2008 was also considered by WB on 20.11.2006 with an
 additional reduction of US$ 8 million in the IBRD component in the trail.

World Bank through the second LoC has supported 45 SHP sub projects; out of which 12 projects are
under IBRD and 33 under IDA Line of Credit. 35 sub projects have been commissioned with installed
capacity of 100.15 MW by July, 2008. The remaining 9 projects aggregating to 57.90 MW are expected
to be commissioned by March, 2009. The total installed capacity of all projects when commissioned,
will be 158.25 MW. 1 project of 0.4 MW capacity stands abandoned.

Implementation of Energy Efficiency Projects

World Bank through the second LoC has financially supported 12 sub projects in EEC sector. Out of this
11 have been commissioned and one is expected to be commissioned in December, 2008. Majority of the
projects are for installation of energy conservation equipment except two projects which are for setting
up of captive power plant.

The industrial plants in sponge Iron, cement, steel and sugar sectors were able to purchase and
demonstrate new technologies with excellent energy efficiency norms. The success stories developed
under WB LoC has paved the way for advanced energy efficient technologies in many of the Indian
industrial plants e.g. the cement plants, the energy efficiency norms are comparable to the best energy
efficient plants in the world. Further, some of the steel plants and sugar plants are already undergoing
process of modernization and adopting more energy efficient practices. BEE's recent study of the pulp
and paper sectors has indicated that these sectors have also responded positively and implemented
technology upgradation plans. Use of fluidised bed boiler, variable frequency drives, energy efficient
pumps, fans, compressors and cooling towers are widely employed in Indian industries. Interactions with
industry experts indicate that over the years, there has been a significant reduction in investment costs of
these equipment given their increased demand and scale of manufacturing.

Implementation of Technical Assistance Activities

Overall 12    TAP activities were implemented. Several activities have been designed and completed
under the Line of credit to overcome various market barriers in implementation of Energy Conservation
Act, 2001.

The funded projects were aimed to showcase techno-economic viability of EE investments by IREDA to
other financial institutions and Commercial banks through developing their capacity to design bankable
EEC project packages and also build the capacity of associated stakeholders.

Technical Assistance support was provided in standardization of project appraisal formats; developing
pre and post project monitoring and verification protocols for sugar, cement and steel sectors and
marketing of EE loan schemes. Capacity building programs for commercial banks and ESCO companies
were undertaken to enhance technical and financial capacity for developing EE loan schemes and
marketing techniques.

The activities like preparation of investor manual, EE information manual and development of codes and
standards for performance evaluation of industrial equipment aimed at identifying the potential areas in
energy intensive sectors that need to be targeted for energy efficiency. They also contributed in
developing the strategic plan for implementation of Energy Conservation Act, 2001.




                                                   49

  Technical Assistance was also provided to ESCO's in developing projects in Government buildings,
  hospital buildings, and industrial clusters. Some of the activities undertaken under TAP focussed on
  development of consultant directory, database on EE product equipment, list of ESCO companies and
  EE equipment manufacturers.

  IREDA also utilised the knowledge gained under TAP activities to develop their portfolio in EEC
  financing. IREDA has financed 11 projects in industries like cement, pulp and paper, sugar, steel in this
  LoC. Additionally, IREDA has also financed one project in hotel industry outside the LoC, base work
  for which was undertaken in TAP.

  EEC projects financed under LoC with reduced interest rates encouraged the industrial sector like
  cement, pulp and paper, textile and Hotels to improve their existing technology and profitability with
  achievement in reduction in overall specific energy consumption and emissions.

4.1.1     Bottlenecks for Small Hydro Development
  Hydro power projects are location specific, varying significantly in costs and feasibility depending upon
  topography, hydrology, geology and accessibility related factors. The cost of SHP projects (per MW)
  ranged from around Rs. 40 million to Rs. 100 million. The main reasons for this are that the investment
  costs of hydro can vary significantly due to terrain and access difficulties as most of these projects are
  located in remote hilly areas. Besides the transmission of power to load centres, away from the source,
  necessitates investment in construction of transmission networks on difficult terrain.

  In India in the hydro sector, there are very few integrated EPC contractors. Contracts are mostly split
  between civil construction and plant and machinery installation, which makes negotiation of EPC
  contracts relatively complex. Therefore there is a need to address functional, technical and price related
  aspects across contracts; else developers may face the risk of time and cost overruns and lower
  profitability.

  SHP developers have highlighted lack of adequate land and freedom to develop the land and the
  infrastructure as a key bottleneck. In hilly states, delays in obtaining land/forest clearances have
  substantially delayed project implementation. This is a major problem being faced by a number of SHP
  developers as once local residents know that a SHP plant is coming up in an area, they either refuse to
  sell the land or ask for exorbitant prices.

  One of the most crucial issues/ barriers in the scaling up of hydro plant (large and small) is
  interconnection between the plant and the nearest grid point to maximize the power usage from these
  sources. In a number of cases it has been seen that SHP plants are situated in locations far away from the
  transmission network. Therefore providing grid extension up to the SHP plants introduces an additional
  financial burden either on the licensee or the developer and in cases where funds for development of this
  infrastructure are limited; it severely hampers the process of hydro development in the region and state.

  Hydro is a relatively expensive renewable energy technology due to its high upfront costs from detailed
  engineering requirements, remote locations, synergising civil and electromechanical works and also the
  high risks of Force Majeure events which sometimes further drive up the costs making these projects all
  the more unattractive for private developers.




                                                       50

  Differing policies across states lead to concentration of projects in States which have the most investor
  friendly policies. At the same time different States have different policies for the awarding projects,
  variations in feed in tariffs and capital costs allowed which again promote non uniform hydro power
  development and consequent excess capacity in some States and supply constraint in others.

  Lack of adequate financing also discourages developers especially the first generation entrepreneurs in
  the development of Small Hydro Projects. Financial Institutions, such as public/ private banks are still by
  and large unconvinced of the success of Small Hydro Projects.

  Financial institutions are unlikely to finance small first time developers who cannot put up enough
  collateral.

  With an approximate cost of about Rs. 50 million a Megawatt, developing a 5 MW plant would entail an
  expenditure of anywhere between Rs. 200 - 250 million of which a minimum equity an entrepreneur
  would have to put up would be Rs. 50 million. Most banks request developers to either furnish
  guarantees or provide adequate collateral as a financial institution which very few developers are able to
  comply.

  Despite detailed S&I, project development in the Himalayan Region is prone to geological surprises
  during construction. This can at times cause delay and add to the estimated project cost. It is necessary to
  ensure that commercial agreements, such as the Project Implementation Agreement, signed with the
  State Government recognize such surprises and provide for consequent extension of Commercial
  Operation Date in case such surprises emerge during the construction period.

  Technical- Economic Clearances (TEC) on an average adds between one to two years to the
  development time of the project.

4.1.2     Barriers to EE in India
  The projects financed under this World Bank Line of credit targeted to address the three primary
  stakeholders in EE and ESCO business, namely the end-use industry, energy auditors, and the banks and
  financial institutions. Banks and state-level financial institutions usually finance the SMEs and municipal
  corporations. While awareness about EE opportunities is gradually increasing among SMEs, municipal
  corporations and commercial building from last five years, there has been no concrete effort to expand
  EE project financing. The issues on EE from the perspective of each of the stakeholders are discussed in
  brief in the following section:

  Large companies with access to information, technical consultants and finance have found it less
  difficulty in implementing the EE projects as compared to the SME sector, who have not undertaken
  energy efficiency initiatives on account of several issues and constraints. These include:

            o Lack of data on energy consumption, including measurement and verification (M&V)
                 available with SMEs;

            o Lack of trust on technical capabilities of external energy auditors (we know our plants
                 better attitude);

            o Lack of either guarantee from the consultants for minimum savings or absence of
                 demonstration of savings in other similar types of plants in vicinity;




                                                      51

            o Non-availability of turnkey solutions from concept to commissioning from one single
                 source;

            o Non-availability of simple financing schemes for implementing EE projects on normal
                 terms, preferably from the same bank from which it has availed working capital
                 requirement;

            o Last but not least, the burden of upfront transaction cost of carrying out energy audits.

Impact of World Bank 2nd Line of Credit

Small Hydro Power

Most of the Small Hydro developers are either first generation entrepreneurs in energy sector or small and
medium enterprises. However the impact their investment and work has had on society especially the local
communities and the local environment is noteworthy.

One of the biggest impacts and learning's from the second LoC has been the understanding of the key role
this programme has played in making clean energy sources like small hydro commercially attractive and
viable.

         · The second LoC provided an opportunity for developers and entrepreneurs interested in setting
            up SHPs to come forward, plan and execute these projects with funding from IREDA when no
            other financial institution was ready to provide funding to these projects.

         · The second LoC provided access to funds for first time entrepreneurs. As they successfully
            executed projects, other FIs gained confidence and gave them the funds to scale up and invest
            further.

19 states namely, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir,
Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil
Nadu, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have announced policy for setting up commercial SHP
projects through private sector participation. The facilities available in the states include wheeling of power
produced, banking, buy-back of power, facility for third party sale etc.

The conducive policy in many states particularly due to Renewable Energy Purchase Obligation (RPO) and
successful project implementation of projects from 2nd LoC from World Bank, have generated many
projects. There are now ample number of Small Hydro projects in pipeline in IREDA which also includes
one project of 100 MW capacity which will require consortium financing.

Energy Efficiency & Conservation

Most of the EEC sub projects developers went for installation of energy efficiency equipment in the
existing plants and as such these measures do not have any direct impact on the local community.

Under the Energy Conservation Act, 2001, 9 energy intensive industrial sectors are defined as Designated
Consumers i.e. thermal power stations, fertilizer, cement, iron and steel, chlor-alkali, aluminium, railways,
textile and pulp & paper. Specific energy consumption (SEC) norms for each designated consumer were
emphasized to be adhered after five years. It is observed that there is a wide band of energy efficiencies in



                                                      52

different units, some units would be able to comply and some will be unable to achieve the target of SEC.
Issue of Energy Savings Certificates to those Designated Consumers who exceed their target SEC reduction
may be a mechanism whereby certified excess saving may be traded amongst companies to meet their
standards compliance requirement, or banked for the next cycle of energy savings requirements.

The progress of energy efficiency has not achieved the required pace in India due to barriers of:

          · Lack of awareness
          · Higher upfront cost of energy-efficient technologies
          · Lack of access to innovative financial instruments and
          · Asymmetry in sharing of costs and benefits from the technology



Success of most of the projects funded under LoC has proved that the financing EEC sub projects is a viable
option and not a risky proposition. Financing of EEC sub projects was a new experience for IREDA at the
start of this LoC but now IREDA is strongly placed to finance similar projects. Foreclosure of the loans by
some of the projects funded under this LoC has shown that the implementation of EEC projects is even
more profitable than what they had expected during proposal stage.

On supply side energy efficiency has a lot of potential in optimisation of performance of power plants. To
promote energy efficiency / conservation in energy consumption and to promote optimum performance of
the power plants with a view to improve environment and climate protection by involving agencies that has
responsibilities of outputs and activities as per their field of expertise.

Energy Efficiency in buildings offers an enormous potential for reducing energy consumption. Whether in
existing housing stock or in newly constructed units, energy efficiency constitutes a savings potential that is
still far from being fully utilised.

Conclusion

2nd line of credit wherein 45 small hydro projects were funded has enabled IREDA to take up financing of
small and medium hydro projects with a better prospective of barriers in development and to factor in risks
and its mitigation associated with development of SHP.

Further, this has also helped IREDA build up relationship with SHP entrepreneurs and who are now taking
up small and medium Hydro projects in various states enabling IREDA to increase its outreach to various
states and promoters.

Similarly for Energy Efficiency projects inclusion of enhanced energy efficiency as one of the eight
National Missions recently announced by the Government have brought the sector on forefront. A number
of schemes and programmes have been initiated and it anticipated that these would result in a saving of
10000 MW by the end of 11th Five Year Plan in 2012.

The World Bank Line of credit for energy efficiency and particularly capacity building of various
stakeholders through TAP activities have resulted the importance of enhanced energy efficiency.
During the period of Line of Credit, IREDA had a very active interaction with all the stakeholders
including other commercial banks and Bureau of Energy Efficiency. Power plants efficiency
improvement, Energy Efficiency in industry and end use, development of programmatic CDM and
Energy Efficiency in public and private buildings are the focus areas emerging in the near future.

                           Annex 10. Institutional Development of IREDA

During the course of two World Bank engagements with IREDA, several initiatives have been taken to
strengthen the institutional capacity of the organization and establish it as the premier renewable energy
financing agency in India as well as in the South Asia region. Some of the key initiatives taken over the last
few of years, and the improved corporate performance achieved as a result are discussed below.

Improved Corporate Governance Arrangements

IREDA has taken a number of initiatives to strengthen corporate governance. After more than two and a
half years of vacancy, the position of MD has been filled, and elevated to Chairman and MD. This has
enhanced the autonomy in decision making and allowed the organization greater flexibility as a financial
institution in responding to the market. Vacant positions on the IREDA Board have been filled and three
independent Directors have been appointed to the Board in 2008. The independent directors are
distinguished people, including the former Chairman of the Central Ground Water Board (Ministry of
Water Resources), a distinguished professor from the Indian Institute of Technology (IITK) / Indian
Institute of Management (IIMB) who is also the founder director of the Indian Institute of Information
Technology (IIIT), and the former Member (Finance) of the Department of Telecom.

IREDA has placed a strong emphasis on greater transparency and accountability and has put measures in
place to achieve this. It has appointed an audit committee to review internal systems, financial performance
and management, and risk management policy. An external consultant has been hired to review systems and
procedures of IREDA's lending operations and to develop a suitable action plan for organizational
restructuring through the strategic change consultancy exercise under the Bank's LoC.

Improved Corporate Financial Performance

IREDA's financial performance, which had deteriorated significantly during 2003-05 due to the change in
enabling environment, compounded by natural events (droughts in Andhra Pradesh ­ see Text Box 10.1)
and the company's inability to swiftly respond to changing interest rate regime in the country), has been
improving consistently over the last three years.

Loans Portfolio: IREDA's loan portfolio has been
greatly expanding over the last several years.
Disbursements in FY07 increased by more than 36                Text Box 10.1: Impact of Andhra Pradesh

percent over FY06 to about Rs. 410 crore. This                  Drought on Small Hydro Power projects

increased by a further 34 percent in FY08. Increase in        Andhra       Pradesh    faced    drought   like

Pradesh were affected by drought for a consecutive three-year period, which resulted in a high accumulated
funded interest liability, making it difficult for developers to make full and timely payments on a sustained
basis. In addition, a change in accounting standards, which required NPAs to be recognized with a lag of 90
days instead of the previous 180 days also contributed to higher NPAs. To address this concern IREDA
initiated actions for recovery from NPAs through various instruments including: (i) one-time settlement
(OTS); (ii) Reschedulment; and (iii) SARFAESI Act, which resulted in recovery of written-off loans of
Rs.14 crore and Rs.12 crore each in FY06 and FY07 respectively, thus enhancing IREDA's revenues and
profitability. As of FY08, IREDA's net NPAs stood at 11.25%.1

Support from GOI in raising more capital:               IREDA's ability to fund a larger RE project is limited by
the size of its net worth. GOI has increased the authorized share capital of the company from Rs.400 crore
to Rs.1000 crore to allow IREDA to raise more equity from government sources as well as from the market.
MNRE has advised IREDA to explore opportunities for broad basing its equity base.

Strategic Outlook of IREDA

The World Bank project assisted IREDA in undertaking a set of three strategic consultancy studies which
aimed at developing a strategic vision and addressing some of the key challenges faced by it. The three
studies were:

           1. Strategy and Action Plan for Adapting to the Changing Business Environment
           2. Resource Mobilization Plan
           3. Reviewing Systems and Procedures of IREDA for its Lending Operations and Developing a
                Suitable Action Plan for Organizational Restructuring

The key recommendations of the first two studies (the third study is currently in progress) as well as the
steps being taken towards implementing them is provided in Table 10.1:

                 Sample Energy-Efficiency and Renewable Energy Investments1

A few sample projects are highlighted below to provide a flavor of the investments that were undertaken
under this operation. The samples include: (i) one EE project in waste-heat recovery (WHR), which is
likely to become a key niche business area for IREDA moving forward; (ii) one innovative canal-based
hydro project that was built utilizing the head available within the water circulating system at a thermal
power plant; and (iii) one run-of-river (ROR) sub-project that showcases exemplary social and
environmentally sensitive development.

Mahendra Sponge & Power (Pvt) Ltd. ­ Energy-Efficiency Project

Mahendra Sponge & Power (P) Ltd. (MSPPL) was incorporated as a private limited company on July 23,
2002 to manufacture sponge iron, steel and power. The company has a capacity to manufacture 200 TPD
with two kilns of 100 TPD each. The first kiln was commissioned on November 26, 2003, while the second
kiln was commissioned on October 23, 2004. MSPPL declared profits during the first year of operation.

The company proposed to set up a 8 MW WHR-based power plant, from the waste heat released from the
two kilns, to meet the entire power requirement of its sponge iron plant and the power requirements of its
group units (within the same complex) that manufacture MS ingots and TOR Steel. MSPPL approached
IREDA to part finance a Rs. 275 million proposed investment in a power plant based on waste heat from
sponge iron kilns and an additional atmospheric fluidized bed combustion (AFBC) boiler. A DPR was
submitted with an application for a loan of Rs. 192.5 million. The loan was subsequently approved by
IREDA and was shared equally between IREDA and the Second Renewable Energy Project funding that is,
Rs. 96.25 million each. The project implementation was smooth except for a delay of four months due to
the late shipment of the AFBC boiler from the supplier, Citar Vessels. Though originally planned to be
commissioned in October, 2006 it could only be commissioned in February, 2007. There was a cost overrun
of Rs. 20 million due to additional expenses on civil and erection works but all the additional expenses were
provided from the internal accruals of the company.

MSPPL completed the installation of the power plant in February 2007 and started commercial production
in March 2007. The plant is also recording the data with regard to the auxiliary power consumption which is
around 14-15 percent of the generated power. The major portion of the power produced is used for captive
generation for the sponge iron plant and the two induction furnaces of 8 T capacity each. For the rest of the
power, MSPPL has signed a PPA with the Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board, which is to the tune of 3
MW (average PLF 80 percent).

This project has set the benchmarks and standards for pursuing WHR boiler-based power plants for other
sponge iron units. MSPPL was the first plant in an industry cluster in Siltara, Raipur which installed
captive power plant using waste heat from the sponge iron kilns. The success of MSPPL in running this
plant has influenced four additional sponge iron plants to install captive power plants. As such, MSPPL has
become the trendsetter in that area and more WHR power plants are expected in the remaining 18-19
sponge iron plants in the cluster.



Birsinghpur - Small Hydro Project

The Birsinghpur project is located in the Umaria District, about 180 km northeast of Jabalpur in the eastern
part of Madhya Pradesh. The project is located within the premises of Sanjay Gandhi Thermal Power
Station (SGTPS) which is owned and operated by the Madhya Pradesh Power Generating Company Ltd.
(MPPGCL), formerly Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board (MPSEB). SGTPS is located on the Johilla
River and has four operating units of 210 MW each. SGTPS operates on the lake cooling system in which,
the water is conveyed in a canal to the circulating water pump house. The water is then circulated through
the cooling condensers of the steam generating units by the circulating water pumps. After cooling the
steam in the condensers, the water is discharged to the seal pit. The water then flows back to the reservoir
by gravity through the return canal. About 30,000 cubic metres per hour (m3/hr) of water is required for
cooling the condensers. Three pumps, each having a discharge capacity of 10,000m3/hr at 25 metres head
are employed to draw water from the lake.




                            Figures 3& 4: Seal Pit and Bypass Gate of the Plant

The difference in elevation between the water level in the seal pit and the water level in the return canal
provides the head for the Birsinghpur mini-hydro project. The quantity of water discharged from the seal pit
provides the flow. The available head and flow for the project activity are relatively constant, with the head
being about 8.7 M and the available flow for each unit of about 8.3 cubic meters/sec for a total flow of
about 33 m3/sec. The feed-in tariff for the project was set at Rs. 2.25 per unit as per the MNRE policy that
was applicable when the project was commissioned. A 30-year PPA was signed with MPSEB, however,
sale to third parties was also allowed under the PPA and at present 100 percent of generation from the mini-
hydro project is sold to Indore and Ratlam-based third parties at a mutually decided rate (between Rs. 3.85
and Rs. 4 per unit). As the thermal plant is operational year round, except for disruptions due to R&M or
technical problems, the hydro project is also operational throughout the year. As a result, the project has

achieved a CUF of 95 percent, which is higher than the projected CUF in the DPR of 86.6 percent. While
this hydro project was innovative, it has high replication potential at other thermal power plants across the
country.



Dehar - Small Hydro Project

The Dehar SHP is a 5 MW plant at Bithal village of the Sihunte Tehsil in Chamba District of Himachal
Pradesh. Although the project was executed on time there was an escalation in civil cost as some structures
had to be rebuilt due to landslides. As a result, the projected cost (as per the loan agreement) of Rs. 248.5
million escalated to Rs 256.10 million. The project was primarily funded by IREDA but a loan of Rs. 19
million was also taken from another financial institution (UCO Bank).

The developers of this project have implemented a number of exemplary social and environmental
initiatives as part of the project. Some of these initiatives are outlined below.

Livelihood Opportunities: To enhance community relations and provide livelihood for people living in the
surrounding villages, the project developers have decided to provide a job to at least one person from each
household in Bithal village. This has had a very positive impact on the image of the project and local
villagers speak highly of the work undertaken by the project developers.

The project has also taken up the initiative of providing 10 kg of rice per month to 100 households below
the poverty line located in the surrounding area. These households were selected based on consultations
with the local panchayat.

The project also provides livelihood opportunities for others from Himachal Pradesh. Barring one
supervisor (a diploma holder) from Andhra Pradesh, all personnel working at the plant were from Himachal
Pradesh, including districts that are far away from the project site.

Connectivity and Community Development: The project
developer had constructed a three-kilometre long dirt road for
the project that now provides very good connectivity for the
Bithal village to the nearest road head at Tikri. The project
developer has also constructed a small temple near the project
site for the villagers and a small Dharamshala (with four rooms
and associated infrastructure) at the Chumali Mata Mandir, the
local deity's shrine. In addition, the developer has also
constructed a playground for the local school.

Minimizing environmental impact and construction costs:
The project developer has constructed a ropeway of                      Figure 5 ­ Road built with temple in background

approximately 0.5 km which was used for transportation of all
construction material to the channel and fore bay tank to reduce the number of trees that needed to be felled
during construction. In addition, the project undertook afforestation on 6.0 hectares of degraded land at
Jaiaru N-DPF-I as compensation for the trees that were cut during construction and also paid Rs. 0.2.million
for soil conservation as mandated by law.

Maintenance of the Irrigation and Public Health Department (IPH) water and irrigation supply weir:
The project developer undertook the maintenance of an IPH's (Irrigation and Public Health Department)
weir located adjacent to the site (weir is located below the projects fore bay tank). This weir invariably gets
damaged during the rains every year and the project has an understanding with the IPH and the local people
that the repair work for the weir is the responsibility of the project. Annually, the project developer spends
up to Rs 0.3 million on repair work. The weir services a kul (a water channel) which is almost 7 km long
and is the longest in Asia.

In addition to the above initiatives this small hydro project was also the first hydel project in India to sell
CERs. The project sold 23,000 CERs during the first 17 months of project implementation to KfW.
