Project includes: (a)\n            construction of water supply systems via household\n            connections and standpipes; (b) construction of individual\n            waste disposal solutions; (c) implementation of a community\n            health education program; and (d) implementation of\n            technical assistance and training program for SENASA. The\n            main risk is related to the still limited implementation\n            capabilities of SENASA. However, SENASA's record under\n            the previous project has been improving at a satisfactory\n            rate and the risk in question is not excessive. To hold it\n            to a reasonable level, a strong technical assistance program\n            is included."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
