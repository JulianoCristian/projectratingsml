I. THE SETTING
A. The Economy
1.01      Although highly dependent on earnings from oil production (93% of
export earnings during the first half of 1977), the Federal Republic of
Nigeria is characterized by a varied natural resource base, an extensive
domestic market, and a large labor force. Natural resources consist of
largely unexploited agricultural potential and minerals. Nigeria has the
largest population in Africa; the current official estimate is 77 million
with an annual growth of 2.5%. Income per capita was US$340 in 1975.
Recent economic developments are described in the Bank's latest economic
memorandum on Nigeria, dated December 23, 1977. 1/
1.02      After rapid growth starting in 1973 based on oil receipts, Nigeria
is entering a period of reduced resource availability. Oil revenue has not
kept pace with projections or the country's absorptive capacity and new
sources of capital must be located to meet development needs. A program of
external borrowings has begun. The Third National Development Plan (1975-
1980) which emphasizes infrastructure, social services and manufacturing, is
not likely to be fully implemented reflecting the change from a capital sur-
plus environment to one of financial constraints. -
1.03      Real growth in GDP averaged 8% between 1970 and 1976.  As illus-
trated in the following table, however, structural changes owing to different
subsectoral growth rates have been significant. Agriculture expanded hardly
at all, while construction, public utilities and services grew rapidly. The
construction sector, in particular, has undergone a tremendous expansion and
has absorbed a large number of unskilled workers.

B. The Industrial Sector
1.04      Despite real growth in the manufacturing sector that averaged 12%
over 1970-1976, the overall contribution of manufacturing to GDP remains
small (8%). Under the Second and Third Development Plans, Government indus-
trial strategy concentrated on infrastructure investment designed to ease
transport congestion in Lagos and to disperse industry, indigenization
of management and ownership, and sectoral diversification with emphasis on
intermediate goods. New public-sector manufacturing investment under the
revised Third Plan is expected to amount to N 5.5 billion (13% of total
public investment), mostly for import substitution industries. Nigeria has
so far been successful in its indigenization efforts. One of the results has
been a sharp increase in public ownership to 38% of total equity capital in
1975 from 27% in 1965.
1.05      As in many African countries, manufacturing in Nigeria is dominated
by the traditional sector in terms of employment and by the modern sector in
terms of output. In 1972 (the latest year for which reasonable data are
available), the modern sector (establishments employing 10 or more workers)
accounted for about 6% of the manufacturing workforce and about half of its
output. Small-scale establishments, mostly traditional, but partly modern
in structure, accounted for another 9% of manufacturing employment. The
balance of 85% of employment takes place outside formal establishments, in
traditional activities. Since 1972 rapid growth in the modern sector has
probably increased its share of employment to about 8%, but has not funda-
mentally changed the sector's structure. Modern industries were historically
dominated by large foreign-owned and managed firms; as a result of indigeni-
zation efforts, this has recently begun to change (para. 1.09). Neverthe-
less, relatively few indigenous entrepreneurs have made their way from the
small-scale and informal sectors into modern, medium- and large-scale manu-
facturing.

1.06      Modern-sector output continues to be dominated by production of
consumer goods for the local market (foods, beverages, tobacco and textiles
still accounted for one-half of output in 1976), although the share of
intermediate goods has risen modestly in the 1970s. There are indications
that the share of processing local resources (vegetable oils, wood, food
processing) in total manufacturing output is low. Infrastructural problems,
particularly in transport and power generation, and the incentive system
(para. 1.10) adversely affect the efficiency of local industry but protect
it from imports. This has helped to create a local sellers' market. As a
result of the attractions of the domestic market, exports of processed
agricultural products have virtually ceased.
1.07      Industrial Investment.  As shown below, net investment in the
manufacturing sector increased immediately after the Civil War, but slowed
in 1973 and 1974. The share of net capital expenditures in manufacturing
dropped from 7% of gross domestic capital formation in 1970 to only 3.2% in
1974. Although data are unavailable, investment probably remained modest
in 1975 and 1976. Three reasons explain the low level of manufacturing
investment. First, Government investment centered on infrastructure as
a priority; second, the program of indigenization discouraged foreign in-
vestors; and third, public funds for manufacturing investment did not com-
pensate for the redirection of private sector capital from new investment
to the purchase of existing foreign owned enterprises as part of indigeni-
zation. Recent growth in output is thought to be the result of improved
capacity utilization. According to a recent ILO survey, manufacturing firms
are operating at 83% of their full capacity and even more in larger plants and
especially for capital intensive ones.

1.08      Industrial Location.  Despite some dispersion of industry to the
north, the unbalanced geographic distribution of industry remains a serious
problem and is an important preoccupation of Government.  Particularly
troublesome is the dominance of Lagos State, the concentration of investment
in just two northern states (Kano and Kaduna) and the dearth of investment
in the eastern region and parts of the north. In recognition of this problem,
Government has made a conscious effort to locate many of its public invest-
ments outside the Lagos area. It has also commissioned a study of the impact
of incentives on industrial location in order to devise appropriate policies to
encourage further decentralization (para. 1.10).

1.09      Indigenization.  Beginning in 1972, and amended in 1977, the Fed-
eral Government of Nigeria began actively to enforce Nigerianization of firms
operating in Nigeria. The purpose of these efforts is to promote and protect
Nigeriar ownership and management of firms. Depending on the sector, an en-
terprise may be reserved for Nigerian owners or required to have a minimum
of 40% to 60% Nigerian equity. In some cases there are minimum levels of
Government participation required as well. In addition, individual firms are
assigned expatriate quotas establishing the maximum number of non-Nigerians
who may work in the firm. The resulting indigenization, although smoothly
carried out, has probably resulted in a decline in foreign investor interest
in Nigeria and, in some cases, reduced operating efficiency of existing firms
as new staff was introduced.
1.10      Industrial Incentives.  Policy tools used by Government affecting
the industrial sector are the classical ones of trade restrictions, taxation,
price control, exchange rate control and special fiscal incentives. Among
these tools trade restriction, especially protection from imports, is the
most important. To help understand the impact of its policies, Government
asked the Bank in 1976 to supervise a Government-financed study that analyzed
incentives to industry, social (or economic) efficiency and industrial dis-
persal. A team of consultants was in Nigeria from July to September 1977.
Preliminary conclusions indicate that the incentive system paradoxically
provides the greatest incentives to low-priority industries (import-intensive
industries) and the smallest incentives to high-priority industries (primary
processing, intermediate and capital goods). They also found that, despite
this distortion, two-thirds of Nigerian industry operate efficiently although
performance varied widely by industry group and for individual firms. The
least efficient industries were mostly consumer good producers using imported
raw materials or components. Another major finding was that the incentive
system, by favoring import-intensive activities, inhibited regional dispersal
away from Lagos (favored by the size of its market and by its port facilities
for import-intensive production) towards those areas specializing in primary
processing. These conclusions fit well with Government's wishes to stimulate
processing of local primary goods; the final report will be the basis of Bank
discussions with Nigeria concerning incentives.

C. Financial Institutions
1.11      Nigeria is well served by a variety of financial institutions many
of which, despite a heavy concentration in Lagos, have an extensive branch
network extending to all 19 states. There are 18 commercial banks, many of
which have a special regional focus. As of mid-1976 Nigerian commercial banks
had combined assets of almost N 3 billion, 80% of the assets of the financial
community. Insurance companies and pension funds (15%) and development banks
(5%) comprised the balance. Commercial banks in Nigeria do very little term
lending except to preferred clients; Nigeria's six merchant banks, however,
are more active. The function of the merchant banks includes wholesale
banking, leasing, medium-term lending and underwriting debt and equity
issues. The Lagos Stock Exchange, which was founded in 1961, provides an
active market for the shares of 36 companies.
1.12      Government Institutions.  The Federal Government controls directly
five financial intermediaries: the Federal Savings Bank, the Federal Mort-
gage Bank, the Nigerian Agricultural Bank, the Nigerian Bank for Commerce and
Industry (NBCI), and the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB), the sub-
ject of this report. The latter two have similar structures and objectives as
both provide term financing to industry. NBCI, however, also lends to services
and does commercial lending. Being a newer institution, NBCI is thought to
be weaker in terms of staff, outstanding portfolio and procedures. 1/
1.13      In addition, there are three interstate development banks in the
north, center and west areas of the country and numerous state institutions.
Typically, these institutions finance state sponsored investments as well as
small-scale private investments. Their performance to date has varied: most
are dependent on public sources to fill their resource needs.
D. Financial Policies
1.14      The financial sector and the policies governing it are receiving
close scrutiny, following publication in late 1976 of the report by the ad
hoc Financial System Review Committee. The thrust of the Committee's num-
erous recommendations is to speed indigenization of the financial sector,
to rationalize the structure to avoid overlapping institutions, to achieve
greater mobilization of savings and to assure that investible funds flow to
high priority areas. Most, but not all, of the Committee's recommendations
were accepted by Government and the financial sector is in a state of tran-
sition. Specific policies to implement the recommendations, however, are yet
to be formulated.
1/   NBCI was established in 1973, primarily to provide term resources to
private Nigerians engaged in buying out foreign investors, and also
to provide a complete range of term lending and commercial services.
NBCI's paid-in capital is N 10 million; and as of October 31, 1977, NBCI
has 119 loan and equity commitments amounting to N 146 million with
about N 47 million outstanding. NBCI's resources, which have in the
past been provided exclusively by Government, recently diminished, and
it now faces a resource gap of approximately N 100 million.



- 6 -
1.15      A particular problem has been that the respective roles of state
and federal institutions, and particularly those of NIDB and NBCI, have not
always been clear. In response, the Review Committee recommended, first,
that the two federal institutions become financial-channels ("apex" banks) to
the state banks and, second, that fields of intervention of NIDB and NBCI be
carefully delineated. Specifically, it proposed NIDB as the apex institution
for lending to large-scale industrial enterprises and NBCI for lending to
small- and medium-scale investments. As apex institutions, both NIDB and
NBCI would be expected to take a leading role in industrial financing. This
was to be achieved by the two federal-level banks refinancing and cofinancing
with state banks, and by assisting state banks develop appropriate training
programs, policies and procedures. State-level banks would deal primarily
with small-scale industries with special advisory agencies created in each
state to provide technical assistance to entrepreneurs. Although these
suggestions were in principle accepted by Government, it is still not clear
precisely how they are to be implemented. Discussions among Government, NIDB
and NBCI are taking place to clarify precisely their respective roles.
1.16      Interest Rates.  Reflecting high liquidity in the economy, in 1976
the Government enforced a general reduction of interest rates on loans from
the range of 7 to 12% to 6 to 9%. In 1977, the range was broadened to 6 to
11%, but interest on loans to productive sectors retained a ceiling of 8%.
By the end of 1977 there was a strong upward pressure on rates, reflecting
the higher international cost of capital and reduced levels of domestic
liquidity. Moreover, in the April 1978 budget speech, higher interest rates
and a slower pace of credit expansion were announced. The new interest rates
are more in line with the international cost of capital and represent a
significant increase in certain categories although still well below domestic
rates of inflation. Proposed lending rates to productive sectors range from
9% to 10.5%, up from 8%. Commercial and merchant banks are restricted to a
maximum rate of 9% on loans to productive sectors, while NIDB and NBCI may
lend at rates as high as 10.5%.
1.17      Inflation.  Although historically inflation has not been an impor-
tant problem in Nigeria, the rapid expansion of government expenditures has
contributed to a high rate of inflation in recent years. Price increases
have averaged 26% p.a. for the last three years with a high rate (33%) in
1975 and lower rates (22%) for each of the past two years. Nevertheless,
Government has sought to moderate inflation by a variety of means including
price controls, reduced tariffs and increased allocation of foreign exchange
for imports. It aims to reduce inflation to 10% in 1978. This will be dif-
ficult to do, however, requiring much better control of aggregate demand and
more effective planning and programming of public expenditures.
E. Prospects and Constraints
1.18      Immediate prospects for investment in the industrial sector are
generally good although federal and state government development expenditures
will necessarily slow as a result of new fiscal constraints. Public external
borrowings will help offset shortfalls in oil revenues and, in the private
sector, business confidence is high. Nigeria offers the largest and poten-
tially richest market for manufactured goods in Africa. Firms are running at



- 7 -
near full capacity and there are shortages of goods. With some restriction of
imports, the demand for consumer goods and building materials will continue to
be strong. In addition, agro-based industries and food processing should get
renewed interest. Finally, private investment which lagged, or may have been
crowded out by public investment in recent years, may pick up any slack
resulting from the anticipated public sector slowdown.
1.19      Nigeria is, however, facing certain constraints to its overall de-
velopment effort and for investment in the industrial sector in particular.
First, resources are tight and, especially in the industrial sector, effective
allocation of available resources must be improved. Industrial investment
has not been decentralized to reduce congestion and to achieve regional
balance; capital costs per job are high; and the economic justification of a
number of prestige projects appears questionable. Inadequate public services,
bureaucratic delays, transportation bottlenecks and insufficient numbers of
managers and skilled workers hamper efforts to establish a more effective
industrial structure. As a result, implementation is slow and cost overruns
prevalent. Operating efficiency is reduced by insufficient supplies of local
as well as imported materials and shortages of power and water. In the
financial sector, low interest rates have artificially cheapened capital at
the expense of labor and prevented the use of interest rates as an allocation
mechanism.
1.20      The major issues confronting further development of the industrial
sector are the need to stimulate investment beyond the present relatively low
level, the need to expand transportation and infrastructure facilities in
order to improve operating efficiency, and the need to revise the present
incentive system to encourage economically efficient industries. The Govern-
ment is moving on a number of fronts to resolve these issues. Revisions in
the incentive system should be forthcoming as a result of the Bank-supervised
study on incentives. Infrastructure investment to ease transport congestion
remains a high Government priority. New investments are planned in port, air
and road facilities and to expand available power and water supplies. Infra-
structure development will necessarily take several years to implement and,
despite the costs incurred, new industries are likely to continue to develop
standby electricity and water supplies and buildup of sizeable stocks and
inventories. Government also continues to provide support for industrial and
management training to ease the constraint on skilled manpower. In the
meantime, quotas for expatriate assistance are being filled without much
difficulty.
1.21      Government's industrial plans include a few projects (steel, petro-
chemicals, pulp and paper, fertilizer) which may no longer go forward as
planned; nevertheless, many projects should still be implemented. Under the
Third Development Plan about 10% of Government's planned industrial investment
was to be channelled through NIDB. Recognizing NIDB's ability to mobilize
resources on its own, Government is now encouraging NIDB to turn to the
private financial markets thereby supplementing public funds. As a result,
Government expects NIDB to play a more substantial role in public industrial
financing in the future. In the financial sector, the immediate goals are a
gradually rising interest rate regime coupled with declining rates of infla-
tion and prudent rationalization of the financial structure so that available
resources are allocated efficiently.



- 8 -
1.22      One particular issue in the industrial sector, which so far has not
been given much consideration, is capital intensity and employment generation.
Employment generation was not an important policy objective in the recent
past since unskilled labor was quickly absorbed in the booming construction
sector. With a slowdown of construction very likely, employment considera-
tions will no doubt gain more attention in the near term and in the long
term could become a pressing problem. Government is aware of the need to
develop an employment strategy and has begun discussions with the Bank on a
small-scale enterprises project. This proposed project would focus on labor-
intensive investments and thereby complement NIDB's activities which are ty-
pically capital intensive. In addition, it would be another way to strengthen
local management skills and to stimulate wide geographic dispersion of indus-
try. Preparation of such a project will take time, however, since the exist-
ing institutional framework supporting SSE is generally weak and a focal point
at the federal-level, through which to reach state organizations, is lacking.
Moreover, adequate infrastructure must be developed simultaneously since SSE
are not likely to be able to invest in their own facilities as larger firms
presently do. In addition, macro-economic policies can strongly affect the
cost of job creation: the alleviation of factor-price distortions, which are
caused by low interest rates, the current value of the Naira and the incentive
system, would contribute to reducing the average cost. The Bank's involvement
in both NIDB and the planned SSE project, reflecting a balanced approach to
the industrial sector, will provide the opportunity to increase the apprecia-
tion of Nigerian officials to the issue of capital intensity.
1.23      Performance Under Previous Loans.  The World Bank's previous loans
in the industrial sector were two loans to NIDB: Loans 588-UNI and 705-UNI
of $6 million and $10 million, respectively, in 1969 and 1970. A third loan
was appraised in 1973 but processing ceased, as the Government itself was in
a position to provide NIDB with sufficient local and foreign resources at a
lower cost. The Bank Group's association with NIDB, however, dates back to
1964 when IFC took a share in NIDB's equity. NIDB's performance under the
first two Bank loans was assessed as part of the Project Performance Audit
Report, dated October 10, 1977. The recommendations made in the audit report
generally pertain to the environment faced by NIDB in the period 1970-75 and,
as a result, are less useful now given NIDB's present situation. OED, using
Nigeria as one example, has encouraged the use of primary development banks
as channels to reach state and regional banks, thereby broadening the institu-
tional impact of DFC projects, particularly in large countries. This strategy
can be usefully applied in the case of NIDB which, over time and as its
institutional capacity is strengthened, can fulfil that role in Nigeria.
1.24      The main objectives of the two loans were to meet NIDB's foreign                  *
exchange needs and to strengthen its institutional capabilities. Both of
these objectives were met. NIDB's apprasials improved, and its portfolio
became more diversified in terms of industry groups and client-ownership.
NIDB, however, continually faced personnel shortages, particularly at middle
and upper management levels, and individual subprojects suffered from manage-
ment problems, and to some extent cost overruns. From about 1973, Bank Group



- 9 -
relations with NIDB were less close and many of the institutional improve-
ments, achieved since 1964, have since lapsed for a number of reasons includ-
ing staff turnover, new management and new ownership.
II. THE INSTITUTION
A. Ownership
2.01      The Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB) was formally con-
stituted in 1964 as the successor to the largely British owned Investment
Company of Nigeria Limited (ICON). NIDB's responsibilities in the industrial
sector are growing as Government expects to rely on NIDB increasingly to
mobilize external resources and to act as the apex institution to finance and
assist state development banks. Provision of long-term financing, by way
of loan and equity investments, is the mainstay of NIDB's operations. Through
its affiliate ICON (Merchant Bank) and its subsidiary ICON (Stockbrokers) it
is able to offer its clients commercial banking and other financial services.
Through an internal consultancy service (MCU) it provides clients with general
management advice for a fee.
2.02      IFC assisted in the reconstitution of NIDB in 1964 and purchased $1.4
million (25% of total) of NIDB's equity. The Central Bank of Nigeria also
purchased 25%; other Nigerians, 1% and foreign private shareholders, 49%.
Following the indigenization decree of 1972 Government offered to buy out
all other shareholders at par. Most shareholders including the IFC tendered
their shares. Authorized capital now amounts to N40 million, of which N20.7
million is paid in. The balance is expected to be subscribed by Government
during 1978. NIDB's capital structure before and after indigenization was as
follows:

2.03      Board of Directors.  NIDB's Board, which meets quarterly, consists
of 11 members, 3 of whom are civil servants and all of whom are nominated by
Government. Most Board members are relatively new as a result of changes in
NIDB's ownership since 1975. The managing directors of NIDB and NBCI are
full members of the Board. An executive committee, comprised of five mem-
bers, is empowered to approve loans in amounts below N 750,000. The Managing
Director may approve loans below N 400,000. The Board represents well the
interests of Government and of the private business community.
B.   Organization, Management and Staff
2.04      Organization.  NIDB's basic organization has altered frequently
since 1973 and was changed most recently in July 1977. The present organ-
ization comprises four major departments of which two are operational (In-
vestment Management and Projects) and two support (Administration/Finance
and Research and Manpower Development). Project supervision and management
consulting services are handled by the Investment Management Department,
while project promotion and appraisal are the responsibility of the Projects
Department. NIDB currently has two area offices (Kaduna and Aba) which can
appraise projects and provide supervision support. Further branch expansion
is planned in the future. Important internal committees include the Loan
Application Committee, which screens loan requests, the Investment Committee,
which reviews appraisals, and the Projects Committee, which monitors disburse-
ments and problem projects.
2.05      Management and Staff.  NIDB's managing director, formerly an offi-
cial of the Ministry of Finance, has been in his post for two years. He is
supported by experienced senior staff, who know well the local environment
and development banking. A number of senior staff are fellows of EDI, had
training at the World Bank or attended other external courses. Total staff
of NIDB is 210 of which 70 are professional. Although NIDB's staff is
generally well trained academically, full effectiveness has been hampered by
understaffing, high turnover and poor internal communication. Full staffing
will be more easily achieved in the immediate future once NIDB moves into a
new building but will more importantly depend on NIDB being able to offer more
attractive compensation and career opportunities.
2.06      Turnover is particularly troublesome.  In 1977, 26% of the junior
professional posts were vacated and 40% of individuals at this level had been
on the job one year or less. The reasons for high staff turnover include
poor recruitment, uncompetitive salaries, and inadequate scope for individual
initiative at lower levels. NIDB is acutely aware of these problems and is
attemp.-ng to respond to them; new recruitment policies are being implemented
and tra  ing programs developed.  Much more needs to be done through manage-
ment development especially to ensure that junior professional personnel have
a genui.--e sense of career. Salary levels, which are fixed in relation to
civil servant scales, are relatively low in view of the special qualifications
of NIL3's staff. NIDB is attempting to cope with this by providing additional
staff berafits (housing and medical coverage).  In addition, a thorough study
of salaries and benefits in comparable institutions would be carried out
(para. 3.07).



- 11 -
2.07      Training.  As of December 31, 1977, NIDB's internal training program,
which was interrupted for several years and only recently restarted, comprised
two courses: a one-week introductory course given once a year for new profes-
sional staff; and a two-week course in project financing also given once a
year. These courses, although useful, are limited in size and infrequently
given. The first course gives new employees a general overview of NIDB's
operations and organization. The second is focussed on project appraisal
techniques but, because of time limitations, treats most topics in a cursory
way. The second course is offered to the staff of NIDB as well as outsiders
and demand far exceeds places available. External training takes place on an
unplanned basis. Training needs to be more carefully structured by NIDB. In
order to do so one of NIDB's senior staff has been placed in charge of manpower
development, with responsibility for staff training and course design. In
addition, an external consultant will be recruited to work with the head of
manpower development. An appropriate candidate for this post has already been
identified and will work to establish courses in project analysis, project
supervision, economic rate of return analysis, and management training.
2.08      Policy Statement.  NIDB's policy statement was most recently up-
dated in 1977 following publication of the Financial System Review Committee's
report. NIDB is exclusively oriented toward large- and medium-scale industry,
mining and hotel investments. Maximum exposure in any one project is 75% of
project cost or N 15 million whichever is lower. The N 15 million exposure
limit is too high in view of NIDB's equity base (N 25 million) unless extraor-
dinary guarantees are obtained. NIDB may invest up to 49% of total equity in
any one firm and up to 25% of its portfolio in government controlled enter-
prises. NIDB may not finance working capital: all loans must have terms of
between 5 and 20 years. It is specifically enjoined to strive for the widest
possible geographic distribution of investments (see para. 2.15), and may not
carry foreign exchange risk on its external borrowings.
2.09      Medium-Term Strategy.  On April 27, 1978, the management of NIDB
presented to its Board of Directors a strategy paper covering operations for
the years 1978 through 1981. The paper, which was in large measure accepted
by the Board, describes NIDB's proposed operations in the context of govern-
ment priorities, as well as the existing and prospective investment climate.
The strategy foresees NIDB's commitments growing rather more slowly than in
the recent past, and with a significanit change in emphasis. Industries
utilizing locally produced inputs (especially wood products, sawmilling, brifkP
and glass making and food processing) would be emphasized. Textiles, breweries
and cement would receive relatively less concentration than in the past. As
highlighted in the strategy paper, most of the subsectors NIDB proposes to
focus on are those employing relatively less capital intensive production
techniques and which imply greater regional dispersion. In support of this
operational program NIDB expects to deemphasize resources from government and
to increase its international and domestic borrowings. Training of new and
existing staff and reinforcement of the Investment Supervision Division are
NIDB's primary organizational objectives.



- 12 -
C. Procedures
2.10      Appraisal.  The quality of NIDB's appraisals is generally good
despite some deterioration since the last Bank supervision mission in 1974
and the lack of consistent use of economic analysis. Appraisal techniques are
well laid out in various published guidelines, although there are some lapses
in implementing them. Well documented projects are sent upon receipt by the
Receipt and Preparation Unit to the Appraisal Division while others go to
the Promotion and Development Division. This latter division also seeks out
promoters for projects it thinks are viable although its staff is insuffi-
cient to do so actively. It processes submissions to the level of pro-forma
income statements, at which time they are passed to the Appraisal Department.
Another division, the Research Division, performs the economic analysis and
marketing studies for proposed projects. Up to now, little economic analysis
is done.
2.11      Supervision.  After approval, project responsibility is handled
by the Investment Supervision Division in coordination with the Legal and
Finance departments. For most of its investments, both loan and equity, NIDB
exercises its right to sit on the Board, and for 80% of investments NIDB
receives external audits. Supervision is carried out by the nine man Invest-
ment Supervision (IS) Division, occasionally with the help of NIDB's internal
consulting unit (MCU). The work load for the IS Division, which currently
has 161 projects under supervision, is high. Although procedures exist for
six-month progress reports and project completion reports, these are not
regularly done, owing to a lack of staff particularly engineers who are now
concentrated in the Appraisal Division. Legal, procurement, disbursement and
loan recovery procedures appear sound, if cumbersome.
2.12      Procedural Problems.  Following the reorganization in 1977, NIDB's
procedures are relatively new and yet to be well established. As a result,
there are some delays. Division of responsibility between the Promotion
and Appraisal Divisions is not clear, and the Research Division's economic
and marketing work needs to be clearly integrated early in the appraisal
process. NIDB is aware of these problems and expects to make necessary
adjustments. One exogenous problem for project processing, however, is the
difficulty in obtaining clear title for land used as collateral, particularly
in the northern states where questions of land tenure arise. Another problem
is the way Government-promoted projects are handled. NIDB frequently receives
req'uests to finance these projects at advanced stages when contracts have
already been let, and may find them unacceptable for technical, financial or
marketing reasons. In these cases, valuable time is lost in redesigning the
project to make it bankable. Closer collaboration between NIDB and Govern-
ment, however, is planned to reduce such problems in the future (para. 3.07).
D. Operations and Financial Performance
Characteristics of Operations
2.13      The level of NIDB's financing operations, as shown below, increased
dramatically from 1972 to 1977, reaching approvals of N 69.6 million in loans
and N 4.3 million in equity investment in 1977.

Equity          0.1        2.4         2.2         4.2         5.9        4.3

In terms of number of operations, NIDB approved loan and equity investments
in 24 projects in 1977 as compared to 11 projects in 1972. Average loan size
has grown from N 363,000 to N 2.9 million. NIDB's financing in 1976 and 1977
accounted on average for 17% of total project costs. This figure is biased
by NIDB's low participation in several large projects financed in those years
and also reflects conservative financing plans with substantial contributions
by sponsors and other sources of financing (suppliers' credits and commercial
banks for working capital).
2.14      An analysis of NIDB's recent approvals by sector, type, ownership
and location is presented in Annex 1. In 1976, and 1977, the largest share
of NIDB financing was, by amount, in food and beverages (34%) followed by
chemicals (27%) which includes cement production. Most investments were
for new projects (62%) as opposed to expansion or modernization of existing
enterprises (38%). State and Federal Governments had majority participation
in about 14 of the number of projects representing 51% of amount while pri-
vate Nigerians had majority ownership in 28 projects for 27% of amount. In
line with indigenization policies, foreign investors had majority ownership
in only five cases for 5% of amount.
2.15      The geographic distribution of NIDB's loan portfolio is indicative
the dominant position Lagos State holds in terms of industrial activity. As
shown in the following table, however, NIDB's recent approvals are evidence
of greater decentralization particularly to the western and northern states.
This trend is more pronounced among projects in the pipeline. Nevertheless,
the shift is still modest in the eastern and some of the northern states
where NIDB has few loans outstanding.

2.16      Economic Impact.  NIDB does not routinely calculate economic
rates of return on its investments.  Most investments in 1976 and 1977 have
been for import substitution with substantial local input (clay, limestone,
sugar, wood, cotton, grains); only one has been export oriented (fisheries).
Projects financed in 1976 and 1977, representing total capital investment of
N 788 million, were expected at time of appraisal to result in a total of
21,500 jobs. Average cost per job created was N 36,000 ($55,400) but ranged
from a low of N 3,000 ($4,600) to a high of N 260,000 ($400,400). The high
capital labor ratios relative to other West African countries can be explained
in part by the nature of the investments (intermediate goods such as building
materials which are large scale and typically capital intensive), domestic
inflation, delays in implementation, and the need to invest in stocks and
infrastructure. Moreover, it is not Government policy to expect NIDB to
focus on employment generation. Nevertheless, there may have been a general
tendency in the past to adopt sophisticated technology without concern for
its appropriateness; the present value of the Naira relative to other curren-
cies makes imported capital goods relatively cheap; and, moreover, the low
interest rate structure in Nigeria has encouraged capital formation. Since
conditions have changed (that is, capital is more scarce and interest rates
are rising), NIDB will pay greater attention to the question of capital in-
tensity (see para. 3.07).
Quality of Investment Portfolio
2.17      As of December 31, 1977, NIDB had 141 outstanding loans amounting
to N 89.9 million. The supervision department classifies 64 subprojects as
operating well (46% of amount), 41 encountering some problems (29% of amount),
and 34 still under construction (24% of amount). In addition, 22 subprojects
were approved but no disbursement has taken place. Of the 41 investments
with problems, most were privately owned and were encountering technical and
managerial difficulties. NIDB has in about ten cases put the enterprises
under receivership either to liquidate the investments or to revive operations
under new management. Otherwise, NIDB continues to work with the sponsors
and restructure the investments or to defer repayments to NIDB (seven in 1976
and 1977). In all cases, NIDB's investments are well secured with liens on
fixed assets and land.



- 15 -
2.18      Arrears.  The percentage of NIDB's outstanding portfolio affected
by arrears of more than three months was 14%. As of December 31, 1977, to-
tal arrears in principal amounted to N 3.4 million and arrears in interest
amounted to N 2.0 million. This is a considerable improvement in NIDB's
arrears position since 1973 when the portion of NIDB's portfolio affected
by arrears was 41% and reflects a steady improvement of its arrears position
in recent years. Excluding all loans since 1975 (that is, loans still
likely to be within the grace period) 23% of NIDB's portfolio was affected
by arrears of more than three months which is still adequate performance.
There were arrears of more than 12 months in 30 subloans, representing N 8.4
million in outstanding loans, out of a total of 46 subloans in arrears. Most
of the former can considered chronic and should be the ob4ect of serious
efforts by NIDB to recover its outstanding loans. NIDB, as part of its
normal portfolio review process, has already begun a analysis of these loans.
Nevertheless, a more detailed study, covering individual recovery recommen-
dations and procedures to be followed in the future, is called for (para 3.07).
2.19      Equity Investments.  NIDB has taken small equity participations
(ranging from 1% to 30% of an enterprise's capital) in about one-half of the
enterprises to which it lends. As of December 30, 1977, it had 81 equity
investments amounting to N 13.7 million. In the past, only two equity invest-
ments have been sold as it is NIDB's policy to hold equity investments for
income purposes. NIDB's dividend earnings from its equity holdings reached
a peak of N 1.5 million in 1976, representing an average return of 14% on
investment. In 1977, however, Government restricted dividends to encourage
reinvestment by companies so that dividend earnings dropped to N727,000
representing an average return of 6% on investment.
Financial Performance
2.20      NIDB's financial position is basically sound.  Assets reached N 144
million in 1977, as shown in Annex 2, a five-fold increase since 1973. Total
long-term debt amounted to N 115 million in 1977 of which Government debt
accounted for N 113 million and the two previous World Bank loans for N 2 mil-
lion. With a paid-in share capital of N 30.7 million plus reserves, NIDB's
term debt/equity ratio stood at about 4.5:1 as of end-1977. Liquidity was
ample with net working capital of N 30 million; however, uncommitted approvals
and undisbursed commitments amounted to N 120 million as of December 31, 1977.
Because of the slow legal system and understaffing in NIDB, recent approvals
are not being committed rapidly. More importantly, NIDB does not have suffi-
cient funds to cover new commitments.
2.21      Provisions.  NIDB made annual provisions against doubtful loans,
equity investments and accrued interest of N 1.37 million in 1977. Pro-
visions made against equity investments have accumulated N 533,000 or 4.1%
of total equity investments which is satisfactory. Provisions against doubt-
ful loans amount to N 2.15 million or 2.4% of total outstanding loans. This
level of provisions is up considerably from the 1976 level; nevertheless it
appears low in view of the 30 or so cases that could be labeled as chronic
(see para. 2.18). NIDB has also made substantial provisions, from time to
time, for interest earned but not received. Such provisions were N981,000
in 1976 and N44,000 in 1977. NIDB's auditors (Peat Marwick Casselton Elliott
and Company) annually review NIDB's portfolio on a case-by-case basis and
consider NIDB's level of provisions adequate.



- 16 -
2.22      Profits.  NIDB's profitability, as shown in Annex 3, has been ade-
quate if modest. Profits before taxes and provisions amounted to N 2.6
million in 1976 and N 3.3 million in 1977. Net profits (after taxes and
provisions) of N 1.2 million in 1976 represented a return on average equity of
15%. Net profits after taxes in 1977 were N 1.3 million, a return of 8% on
average equity. The fall in return is accounted for by NIDB's larger equity
base, increased tax liability and provisions against doubtful loans. 1/ The
gross margin on NIDB's operations has averaged 5.8%; it needs, however, about
4% to cover administrative costs and provisions.
2.23      Subsidiaries.  ICON (Stockbroker), a fully-owned subsidiary and
ICON (Merchant Bank), an affiliate, were created in 1973 and 1975 respectively
from NIDB's former subsidiaries. ICON (Merchant Bank) is owned by NIDB (45%),
Morgan Guaranty (25%), Baring Brothers (15%) and National Insurance Corpora-
tion (15%). After a loss in its first year of operations ICON (Merchant
Bank) is running profitably, with assets of N 92 million as of September 30,
1977. ICON (Stockbroker) whose accounts are consolidated with those of NIDB
is managed by the affiliate on NIDB's behalf and is making modest profits
after paying NIDB management fees.
E. Prospects
2.24      NIDB's lending operations, which grew at an annual compounded rate
of 80% from 1972 to 1977, are not likely to grow as rapidly in the future.
Despite slower Federal and State Government development expenditures, pros-
pects for NIDB remain encouraging. It has a pipeline of 43 projects under
consideration by the Appraisal Department, 30 of which are sponsored by pri-
vate promoters. These projects amount to N 377 million in total project cost
and investment by NIDB of about N 103 million. In addition, the Promotion
Department has 46 projects under study representing total project costs of
about N 302 million; however, only 26 of these, largely privately sponsored
and amounting to N 264 million in project costs, are reasonable prospects for
possible financing for another N 106 million. Based on this pipeline, which
NIDB can appraise over the next two years, NIDB expects to approve about N 65
million in financing in 1978 (as compared to N 73 million in 1977) increasing
by 15% each year thereafter. In real terms, this is not likely to represent
a significant increase in lending. A breakdown of NIDB's pipeline of projects
by subsector is presented in Annex 4.
2.25      Resources.  As of December 31, 1977, NIDB's backlog of uncommitted
approvals and undisbursed commitments had accumulated to N 120 million. Less
expected cancellations, NIDB therefore had an immediate need for about N 104
million in resources to cover subloans already approved. The commitment of
new approvals from 1978 to June 1980 is forecast to amount to N 110 million.
As shown below, NIDB hopes to secure resources from a number of different
sources, including contributions from Government, and the proposed loan from
the World Bank. Because of its substantial borrowing needs in 1978, NIDB is
not expected to meet its entire resource needs in that year and must carry
over some borrowings into 1979 and 1980.
1/   NIDB enjoyed a tax shelter on profits transferred to reserves up to
a maximum of N4 million, a level which was reached in 1977.

Resources from Government (N 20 million) for 1978 were made known as part of
the new 1979 budget (starting April 1).  NIDB has asked that the entire
Government contribution be made available as equity. NIDB has good relations
with international creditors and anticipates being able to borrow on the Euro-
currency markets with Government guarantee. Borrowings in addition to the
proposed World Bank loan are under discussion with the European Investment
Bank (EIB) and a consortium of European and American commercial banks. By
offering an attractive return, NIDB is also optimistic that it can borrow
domestically by floating a bond issue to be taken up by local insurance com-
panies, pension funds, etc. ICON (Merchant Bank), which is affiliated with
Morgan Guaranty and Baring Brothers, will manage the issues for NIDB.
2.26      Financial Forecast.  Over the period up to 1982, NIDB's financial
performance is expected to be satisfactory. Assets are forecast to increase
to N 397 million with a concomitant increase of outstanding debt to N 301
million. In order to maintain a reasonable debt/equity ratio of 4:1 a sub-
stantial part of Government's financing should be as equity. Liquidity is
adequate; debt service coverage remains at 1.4 or greater over the forecast
period. After increasing provisions to a prudent level, expanding profes-
sional staff and paying more for its resources, NIDB's profits do not increase
rapidly and are barely adequate. Return on average equity ranges between 2.7%
and 6.9%. Annex 5 provides the underlying assumptions behind the forecast.
Annex 6 provides financial ratios analyzing NIDB's performance.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Concept and Objectives
3.01      The oil boom in 1973-74 enabled Nigeria to embark on a development
plan in which NIDB was to play a key role. Government expected to provide
considerable support to NIDB's lending operations under the Third Development
Plan and channelled N 93 million in loans and N 16 million in equity to NIDB
from 1975 to 1977. By 1977, however, it became obvious that Government could
no longer meet NIDB's demands entirely on its own. Following discussions
with Nigerian officials in September, an identification/preappraisal mission
visited Nigeria in November 1977. Because of NIDB's prior experience with
the World Bank, the project was quickly prepared and the appraisal mission
took place in January 1978.
3.02      Objectives.  Given Nigeria's growing resource constraint, future
industrial development will depend on attracting funds from external sources
to supplement domestic resources and, at the same time, employing available
capital more effectively. To do so, the ability of local institutions such
as NIDB to make wise investment decisions, using sound financial and economic
criteria, must be strengthened. The proposed loan therefore has two objec-
tives. The first is the mobilization of needed foreign resources to further
industrialization. World Bank funds would meet only 20% of NIDB's resource
needs and would facilitate resource mobilization from other sources, parti-
cularly EIB with whom the Bank has had close contact and exchange of informa-
tion.
3.03      The second objective is institution building within NIDB to improve
the financial and economic appraisal of its investments. Although gains
in project appraisal, policies and procedures were made under the first two
Bank loans, the intervening period has reintroduced the need for further im-
provements. There has been substantial turnover in staff. Moreover, NIDB's
orientation has changed considerably from a majority private, foreign-owned
institution lending to private enterprises to one that is majority Government-
owned with mixed operations. Its level of operations has increased over ten
fold straining previously effective procedures and its staff.
B. Description and Main Features
3.04      The project will consist of the financing of about 25 economically,
financially and technically sound investments. Based on NIDB's present pipe-
line of projects, the subloans to be financed under the project are expected
to be in the areas of light manufacturing, construction materials, food and
beverages and hotels. Most are import substitution by nature, aimed at the
local market; a substantial number would involve processing of local raw
materials. Ownership will be primarily Nigerian and a large proportion is
expected to be new investments rather than expansions. Average subproject
cost is expected to be N 5.0 million and average subloan and equity investment
by NIDB is about N 2.1 million of which direct foreign exchange costs are
estimated to be 75% of subloan amounts.



- 19 -
3.05      Terms and Conditions.  The proposed Bank loan of US$60 million
would be applied under the following terms and conditions:
(a) subloans-in the usual areas of NIDB's operations (that is,
manufacturing, construction materials, food processing and
agro-allied industries and hotels) would be eligible for
refinancing;
(b) Bank financing would cover 100% of direct foreign exchange
expenditures of individual subloans;
(c) there would be an individual subloan free limit of $650,000
(N 420,000) and an aggregate free limit of $15 million.
There would be no minimum size of subloan but the maximum
size would be limited to 25% of NIDB's paid-in share capital
and free reserves;
(d) foreign exchange risk on subloans would be borne by subbor-
rowers. To reduce potential discrimination among subbor-
rowers depending on the source of foreign exchange, NIDB
would seek to spread external funds among as many subbor-
rowers as possible; and
(e) NIDB's on-lending rate to clients would be at least 10.5% per
annum consistent with the central bank ceiling and would be subject
to review in light of market conditions, inflation rates and the
need to assure NIDB an adequate spread over the cost of its new
borrowings. This review by NIDB would be carried out at least
annually, and would be discussed by the Bank with NIDB and Govern-
ment. NIDB agreed to raise its commitment fee to 0.75% on the
undrawn balance of individual subloans.
3.06      Other customary covenants and conditions would be included in the
loan agreement. NIDB's debt/equity ratio would be limited to 4:1. A flexible
amortization schedule would apply. The maximum subloan term would be 15 years.
3.07      Special Features.  To reinforce the project's institutional objec-
tives, agreement would be reached with NIDB and Government on the following
concerns:
(a) Economic Analysis. NIDB would agree to calculate economic rates
of return for all subprojects that it finances using a methodology acceptable
to the Bank.  The threshold rate of return for acceptable subprojects would
be reasonably above the opportunity cost of capital. NIDB would agree to use
economic rate of return as a major consideration, in addition to financial
and technical viability, in its investment decision-making.
(b) Staff Recruitment and Training. In order to remedy NIDB's present
deficiencies in staffing, NIDB would focus its recruitment efforts on staffing
the legal, supervision and appraisal departments. These actions would comple-
ment the steps NIDB has already taken to strengthen its in-course training



- 20 -
program (para 2.07). NIDB would also undertake a full review of its compen-
sation policy in comparison to that of similar public and private institutions
(commercial and merchant banks, consulting firms). This study would be
carried out by June 30, 1979; its conclusions would be reviewed by the Bank.
(c) Capital Intensity. Government and NIDB have been alerted to the
Bank's concern over the relatively high cost per job created in NIDB-supported
investments in the past. In many instances, these high costs may have been
justified owing to the nature of the investment and local conditions; NIDB's
role necessarily orients it towards capital intensive industries. It, how-
ever, has not specifically up to now analyzed capital intensity as part of
its subproject appraisal process. NIDB would agree to do so for all subproj-
ects and would specifically address and provide adequate justifications on
choice among alternative technologies and suppliers, the implications of a
given technology on labor and maintenance requirements, and the additional
capital costs incurred by firms to furnish infrastructure (electricity, roads,
water, and staff facilities) in the subproject appraisal report.
(d) Coordination with Federal Ministry of Industries. NIDB's involve-
ment in publicly sponsored projects has necessarily increased its operational
contact with the Federal Ministry of Industries (FMI). FMI and NIDB would
agree to form two working committees. One committee including NIDB's Project
Division and FMI's Project Implementation Unit would deal with all projects
likely to be financed by NIDB and include agreement on terms of reference for
project feasibility studies, choice of consultants, review of studies, and
negotiations with technical partners. A second committee consisting of NIDB's
Investment Management Division and FMI's Project Implementation and Investment
Management Departments would deal with project supervision matters, that is,
after a NIDB loan has been approved. These committees would be established
by December 31, 1978.
(e) Policy Statement. Although NIDB's policy statement is generally
satisfactory, there are two areas where NIDB should encorporate improvements.
Its exposure limit, which is now set at N 15 million in any one enterprise,
should be fixed in relation to the size of its capital base (that is, 30% of
its share capital and free reserves). Guidelines should also be adopted gov-
erning procurement practices specifically requiring international competitive
bidding on large projects. These changes would be adopted by NIDB's Board
of Directors by December 31, 1978.
(f) Loan Recovery. As of December 31, 1977, NIDB had 30 subloans in
arrears by more than 12 months. About half of these subloans have been in
arrears over the past several years without substantive progress in either
rejuvenating their operations or recovering NIDB's loans by legal means.
NIDB has agreed to undertake a full review of all subloans in arrears by
more than 12 months to determine the reasons for non-recovery and to propose
a plan of action to resolve recovery difficulties. This review would be done
by June 30, 1979; its conclusions would be reviewed by the Bank.
C. Project Costs and Financing
3.08      The project is expected to cost US$190 million, inclusive of taxes
of US$9.3 million. Direct foreign costs are estimated to be US$106 million.



- 21 -
The World Bank loan of US$60 million would meet 33% of project cost net of
taxes and 56% of direct foreign costs. Taxes will represent an additional
US$9.3 million. As shown in the table below, in addition to proceeds of the
World Bank loan, NIDB would contribute to local costs of subprojects from
its domestic resources. Entrepreneurs and other sources of funds (supplier's
credit and commercial banks for working capital) would meet the balance of
project costs.

D. Organization and Implementation
3.09      NIDB will be the sole agency responsible for project implementation.
In executing the project, NIDB will coordinate with the Federal Ministry of
Industries (FMI) especially for the promotion, appraisal and supervision of
publicly sponsored projects where NIDB and FMI have mutual interests (para.
3.07).
3.10      Mcnitoring.  NIDB will be required to submit to the World Bank
regular operational and financial reports. These reports will cover usual
dfc information on a quarterly basis (operations, financial statements,
arrears, resource position) and annual independent audits. Operational
reports will also be required on recruitment, staff turnover and training.
3.11      Procurement and Disbursement.  NIDB's subborrowers generally employ
local procurement procedures, which are acceptable to the World Bank, to
ensure that goods and services are suitable and are reasonably priced. As-
surances were received from NIDB that in the case of large projects inter-
national competitive bidding procedures will be followed by subborrowers,
according to its revised policy statement. Requests for disbursement must be
fully supported by invoices and other evidence, following regular dfc practice.
E. Benefits and Justification
3.12      One of the project's goals is to generate institutional improvements
within NIDB. By reinforcing the NIDB's appraisal capability through technical
advice and staff training, the project should result in amelioration of the
overall quality of NIDB's subproject appraisals. The most important project
benefit is likely to be derived from the introduction of economic rate of
return as a major consideration in NIDB's investment decision-making process.



- 22 -
As a result, the economic benefits of NIDB's financing will be a priori ac-
ceptable. Institutional improvements within NIDB are also expected to gen-
erate indirect benefits within other organizations.  It is anticipated that
coordination between NIDB and the Federal Ministry of Industry on large public
investments will encourage the use of economic rate of return analysis at the
federal level, and help overcome processing delays. The strengthening of
NIDB as a sound financial intermediary will enable NIDB to fulfill its role
as apex institution for public, medium- and large-scale industrial investments
and carrying out its responsibility of aiding state-level development banks
by providing advice on lending policies and procedures, assistance in staff
training and eventually resources by refinancing their loans. Finally, by
focussing NIDB's attention on the question of capital intensity, some improve-
ments in this area can be expected.
3.13      In terms of investments, the project is expected to support about
25 subprojects representing investment of N 123 million (US$190 million).
Based on past performance in the modern industrial sector, these investments
would generate annual value-added of N 19 million and create direct employment
for about 3,300 persons. Indirect employment effects, while not measured,
are expected to be considerable especially in construction and agro-allied
areas.
3.14      Risks.  A possible risk foreseen for the project is slow subproject
implementation which could result in cost overruns and deterioration of sub-
project rates of return. This may occur for a variety of reasons including
administrative bottlenecks within NIDB. Under the project, these can be
overcome by bringing manpower strength to an adequate level, improving pro-
cedures and coordination with Government. Other possible causes of such
delays include a cumbersome judicial system, delays in delivery owing to
congestion in transport facilities, and shortages of skilled manpower to
execute projects. These are factors, largely outside of NIDB's control,
which Government policies aim to overcome. No other inordinate risk is
envisaged.
IV. RECOMMENDATIONS
4.01      A World Bank loan of US$60 million to the Nigerian Industrial De-
velopment Bank (NIDB), with the guarantee of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,
is recommended. An appropriate term for the loan is 15 years with an adjust-
able composite amortization schedule.
4.02      During negotiations, assurances and agreements were obtained on
the following points:
(a) on-lending terms to subborrowers, specifically, an interest
rate of at least 10.5%, and foreign exchange risk to be borne
by subborrowers (para. 3.05);
(b) adoption of the economic rate of return as a major criterion
for investment decision-making (para. 3.07);



- 23 -
(c) plans for reviewing salary scales by June 30, 1979, and
recruiting additional staff (para. 3.07);
(d) encorporating capital intensity in the subproject appraisal
process (para. 3.07);
(e) creating working committees with Federal Ministry of Indus-
try by December 31, 1978 to facilitate NIDB's involvement

Summarized Policy Statement
1.          The Company has been established to provide medium and
long term financing to enterprises operating in Nigeria. As an invest-
ment institution it will not engage in operations of a commercial nature
and will not accept time or demand deposits.  NIDB will not finance
working capital requirements.
2.          It will limit  its operations to industrial, mining and hotel
projects. No lower limit is fixed but cottage and small scale industries
are outside NIDB's sphere of operations. It will finance enterprises
which by reason of their size will make a significant contribution to
the economic development of Nigeria.
3.          NIDB may henceforth invest in productive enterprises in which
the Government interest as measured by voting power or control is predominant;
provided that such portion of the portfolio of the NIDB as shall be
devoted to government sponsored or controlled projects shall not exceed
25% of the total portfolio. Provided also that the day to day management
of such projects shall be free from any interference from the Government
and there shall be a specific understanding that the Government shall
ultimately sell its shareholding to Nigerians.
4.          In special cases, where an enterprise is important for
economic development and appears likely to be economically viable but is
unable initially to raise sufficient capital or any substantial capital
from local or foreign private investors NIDB may in association assist
in financing such an enterprise with such a capital structure as seems
appropriate notwithstanding that NIDB's own investment in voting shares
may nitially exceed 25% of the total (but not more than 49%).
5.          It will select projects, subject to sound investment criteria,
on as broad a geographical basis as possible.
6.          It will conduct its operations so as to assist in the growth
of a capital market in Nigeria and improve facilities for marketing of
shares and securities, and will revolve its own portfolio whenever it can
do so on satisfactory terms.
7.          It will finance undertakings which are soundly managed and which
appear, on careful investigation, to be economically viable; it will
watch the operations of such undertakings; and will give technical assistance
to management when necessary.

ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 3
8.          It will build and strengthen its own management and staff
so as to achieve a well-balanced organisation, including financial and
economic analysis, technical, accountancy and legal services, and
supervision of previously concluded investments.
9.          It shall not assume the foreign exchange risk in respect of
relending of any non-Nigerian monies borrowed by it.
10.         Legal mortgages of fixed assets, bank or parent company
guarantees, deposits of Government securities or marketable shares or
any suitable combination of these would be eligible as security for
NIDB loans.
11.         The period of NIDB loans should normally be 12 to 15 years
with exceptions down to 5 years and up to 20 years.
12.         The procedure for disbursement of NIDB loans should ensure
that funds are spent for the specified purposes envisaged.
13.         The Board of NIDB be hereby empowered to fix   the rate of
interest for any loan granted by NIDB as the special circumstances of such
a loan may require, taking into consideration, prevailing rates of interest
in the capital market, the practice of Banks and other financial institutions,
the currency of disbursement of the particular loan and the cost of borrowing
by NIDB.
14.         With effect from the 1st of October, 1970 it shall be a
primary policy of the NIDB that the total financial assistance to a group
of interlocking private companies shall not exceed at any given time 15%
of the aggregate of all outstanding loans and equity investment. For this
purpose the term "group of interlocking private companies" shall mean
all private companies, the management or policies of which, the NIDB,
after thorough investigation, determines to be under the controlling
influence of the same person or group of persons.
15.         Management be hereby authorised to approve investments to
a single company up to a limit of N400,000 and that a report of such
approval shall be presented for the information of members at subsequent
meetings of the Executive Committee and incorporated in the minutes. Its
RESOLUTION set out in minute 253 (2) of the meeting held on 19th August,
1964 which delegated powers to approve sanctions up to the limit of N200,000
to the Executive Committee be amended so that henceforth, the Executive
Committee can approve loans up to N750,000.

16.         The Promoter's contribution to any one project should be
between 20 - 25% of the Capital Cost of the project. The maximum loan
commitment of NIDB in any project should be 75% of the Capital Cost or
N15 million whichever is the lower.
17.         The Management is empowered, where necessary, to involve NIDB
in the Management of client companies either through participation in
the recruitment of suitable persons for key positions or by seconding
members of NIDB staff to such client companies.
