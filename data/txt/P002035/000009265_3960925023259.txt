PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NIGERIA
THIRD NIGERIAN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECT
(LOAN1 1597-UNI)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Nigerian
Industrial Development Bank (NIDB) Project in Nigeria, for which Loan 1597
UNI was approved in the amount of US$60 million. The Loan was appraised in
January 1978, approved on June 15, 1978, and declared effective on October
24, 1978. It was closed on November 26, 1986 (against the original closing
date of December 31, 1984). Total disbursements amounted to $51.1 million.
Preparation of a PCR was initially taken in hand by the West
Africa Projects Department (pre-reorganization) based on the findings of a
Bank mission to Nigeria in October 1983. However, it was decided not to
finalize the PCR because most of the subprojects were still under
implementation at the time and it was not possible to evaluate their
performance.
This PCR has been prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations
Division of the Western Africa Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary,
Parts I and III), and by the Borrower (Part II). It is based, inter alia,
on the! Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan and Guarantee Agreements;
supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower;
internal Bank memoranda and a short mission in May 1990. Data for Part III
of the Report has been provided by the Borrower in May 1990.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NIGERIA
THIRD NIGERIAN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECT
(LOAN 1597-UNI)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.        The Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB) was constituted
in 1964 as the successor to the largely British owned Investment Company Of
Nigeria Limited (ICON). IFC assisted in the reconstitution of NIDB and
purchased 25 percent of NIDB's equity. Following the indigenization decree
of 1972 Government bought out all shareholders at Far, including IFC. NIDB
has received four direct loans from the Bank, the third, approved in 1978,
being the one under review. 1/ However, since this report is being
prepared more than three years after completion of the third loan, and
since the fourth loan is also in its last year of completion the review has
covered over ten years of NIDB's general performance (1978-1989).
Objectives
2.        The basic objectives of the project supported by Loan 1597-UNI
were: (a) to provide NIDB with a portion (about 20Z) of the total foreign
exchange resources needed to finance industrial projects and to facilitate
NIDB's external resource mobilization efforts; and (b) to further
strengthen NIDB's institutional capabilities, particularly in the areas of
financial and economic appraisal of investments. Though not explicitly
stated, another important objective was to promote a closer working
relationship between NIDB and the Federal Ministry of Industries (FMI),
thus enabling NIDB to contribute to FMI's industrial policy decisions and
impact on the Nigerian industrial sector as a whole.
Implementation Experience
3.        The project became effective on October 24, 1978.  The first
year was quite successful with commitments totalling US$20.8 million (35Z)
for six subprojects. Thereafter, progress slowed down considerably, so
much so that by December 31, 1980 (the original terminal date for
subproject approval), only 56 percent of the loan had been committed. At
the request of NIDB the terminal date for subproject approval was extended
three times finally to August 30, 1983 (Part I, para 4.01). As in the case
of commitments, disbursements under the line of credit were also
significantly slower than appraisal estimates (Part I, para 4.02). A total
1/   The experience with the first two loans is reviewed in PPAR dated
October 10, 1977 (No. 1750). The fourth loan is still under
implementation.



- iv -
of US$8.9 million in uncommitted (US$5.3 million) and undisbursed (US$3.6
million) funds was finally cancelled under the line of credit by the loan
closing date (November 1986), per NIDB's request.
4.        On the institution building side, project implementation was
initially slow in the first two years. Staff morale was 'ow and there was
a high turnover resulting from NIDB's relatively low salary scales. This
situation improved significantly when in 1982 a revised salary structure
was approved following persistent efforts of NIDB's management with strong
Bank support. In other aspects of institution-building, e.g., improvement
in project appraisal and supervision capabilities, progress was also rather
slow due to staff turnover and the time needed to train the new staff
appointed to replace the experienced staff (Part I, para 5.03).
Results
5.        The project under review was implemented just after the oil boom
of the 1970s, during the years that the oil market had considerably
weakened but the Government had not fully recognized the gravity of the
economic situation. GDP was sharply declining and industrial activity was
severely affected by the stringent import policies that were followed.
6.        NIDB's overall performance under the loan was mixed.  While
satisfactory progress was made in certain areas, considerable work still
remained to be done in some others. A total of 26 subprojects were
financed under the loan, one more than the 25 expected at the time of the
appraisal. All except one were new ventures. Moreover, as expected at
appraisal, all these projects were majority Nigerian-owned (Part I, para
5.02). There was a fairly broad geographic dispersal of NIDB's assistance
compared with its outstanding portfolio at the time of appraisal. The
subprojects covered a reasonably broad spectrum of industrial activities
(Part I, para 5.11). Performance of subprojects, where adequate
information is available for making a reasonable judgement, appears to be
also mixed (Part I, para 5.16).
7.        Most of the other objectives set out at the time of the
appraisal were realized, in particular the following: (a) upward revision
of salary structure (Part I, para 5.03); (b) resource mobilization (Part I,
para 5.05); (c) geographic dispersal of NIDB's assistance (Part I, para
5.06); (d) increase in NIDB's interest rates, maintaining the minimum 10.5Z
lending rate required under the Bank Loan Agreement (Part I, para 5.09);
and (e) improved working relations with the FMI (Part I, para 5.10).
8.         NIDB has been able to maintain its lending operations with a
consistent, although relatively low, level of profitability since its
inception. However, in the Nigerian economic environment as in many other
countries that suffer from a system of price distortions, profitability
alone cannot be considered sufficient to ensure sustainability in the long
run. NIDB has undoubtedly achieved the basic function of transferring
investment resources to industrial borrowers, but given the high level of
arrears (322 of portfolio as at December 31, 1989 was affected), and the



- v 
poor implementation record and performance so far of many sub-projects,
NIDB's capacity for project selection needs considerable improvement. In
addition NIDB's interest accruals policy and possible under-provisioning of
doubtful debts ma.kes its profitability somewhat illusory (Part I, para
6.09).  While NIDB's sustainability is largely dependent on Government
support, it must be stated to its credit that it has in the recent past
diversified its operations through: (a) mobilization of domestic resources
through debenture issue; (b) undertaking some commercial banking
activities; and (c) establishment of two subsidiaries to carry out leasing
and management consultancy operations.   NIDB management now recognizes the
need to restructure the institution in light of the changed and more open
environment and has recently had a strategic study undertaken, and a
restructuring plan prepared for NIDB by Industrial Credit Corporation of
Ireland, a DFI which has itself undergone a successful restructuring. The
reorganization is presently under implementation (Part I, par& 5.08).
Furthermore, NIDB, after a slow start is now intensifying its loan recovery
efforts through improved supervision and debt collection practices and is
about to initiate on an urgent basis an effective credit risk management
program.
9.        In summary, given the adverse macroeconomic circumstances that
prevailed during the period that the project was being implemented, the
project is considered partly successful.
Findings and Lessons Learned
10.       NIDB has carried out its mandate under difficult conditions.
With Government support, it has been able to overcome many operational and
organizational problems. A few lessons may be drawn from experience with
this Loan. First, the assumption of the exchange risk by NIDB's sub-
borrowers in a context of exchange rate instability (a major devaluation
took place in September 1986 as part of the adjustment process) had
seriously affected their viability and thus undermined NIDB's own portfolio
quality and creditworthiness, although the Government did subsequently step
in to share the exchange losses. This emphasizes the importance of DIIs'
having a reasonable balance between foreign currency and local currency
liabilities (Part I, paras 5.12 and 10.03). Secondly, institution building
is a slow and continuous process, lack of discipline in following sound
banking practices and inadequate commitment to continued staff training
could adversely affect the institutional effectiveness (Part I, para
10.04). Thirdly, the NIDB should have contained to some extent its zeal
for its developmental role and maintained a better balance between
developmental and commercial objectives (Part I, para 10.05). Lastly,
NIDB's experience emphasizes the need for more thorough sensitivity
analyses of all subprojects to take account of the impact of changing
economic situations (Part I, para 10.06).

2. Background
2.01      During the oil boom of the 1970s the Government's objective was
to translate huge oil revenues into investments in social, economic and
physical infrastructure. While there were some successes, gross
mismanagement and corruption led to considerable waste.  The economic
policies pursued also introduced distortions that encouraged imports,
discriminated against local production, and produced an import intensive
and capital-intensive industrial structure that was unsustainable.
Starting mid-1981 as the oil market weakened, the Government responded
slowly and by 1983 sizeable fiscal and external deficits emerged which were
financed by a rundown on international reserves and large public sector
borrowings. Finally recognizing that the situation was unsustainable, the
Government implemented stabilization measures that included slackening of
public expenditure and tighter import controls. The severe import
compression that followed led to low capacity utilization and widespread
plant close-downs.
2.02      The Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) introduced in the fall
of 1986 constituted a radical break with previous economic policies. The
basic features of SAP that affect the industrial sector were: the
introduction of the second-tier foreign exchange murket (SFEM) and later
merging both tiers into one FEM; reform of tariff and export policies;
removal of all price controls to enable producers to operate profitably in
the new environment; liberalization of interest rates; and initiation of a
program of public sector reform including privatization and
commercialization of public sector enterprises.
2.03      The manufacturing sector, although only 1OZ of GDP, occupies a
prominent role in the country's development goals and plans. The sector is
expected to play a critical role in the structural transformation of the
economy through diversification of the productive base, employment
generation, and exploitation of key natural resources. It is also expected



- 2 -
to play a catalytic role in the development of other sectors of the economy
thrnugh backward linkages, skill formation and entrepreneurial development.
2.04      Nigeria has a relatively well developed financial systemr. with an
extensive and growing commercial banking network throughout the country.
The Nigerian financial system has open entry under rather liberal rules and
regulations.   From 14 commercial banks during the late 1970s, by the end
of 1989 there were over 80 commercial banks throughout the country with
about 35 banks opening up in 1988 and 1989 alone. Although the level of
commercial bank term-lending to manufacturing enterprises increased
significantly during the later part of 1970s and early 1980s, this
situation reversed with the growing domestic liquidity squeeze and foreign
exchange shortage. Available data indicates that the manufacturing sector
may have received less than its share of credit over the period 1982-88.
During this period aggregate credit increased at an average annual rate of
14.8 percent compared to 17.1 percent for the government sector and 12.5
for the manufacturing sector. The Nigerian Industrial Development Bank
(NIDB) remains the country's leading development finance institution and
the primary source of term financing for predominantly private industria'l
projects in Nigeria. Another development finance institution, NBCI, which
concentrates on financing small and medium enterprise3, has received a
first line of credit (Loan No.2376 UNI approved in December 1983) from the
Bank for onlending to SMEs. Yet another loan (2995-UNI) for SMEs was
granted to FGN in 1988 which is to be administered by the CBN.
2.05      The project under review was implemented against a backdrop of
sharply declining GDP (1977-78 N32.5 billion vs. 1983 N27.9 billion) and
falling levels of manufacturing outputs in real values in the country. It
was only after 1986 that the economic trends in Nigeria began to show some
improvement.
3. Proiect Obiectives. Description. Design and Organization
3.01      Project Objectives:  The basic objectives of the project were:
(a)  to provide NIDB with a portion (about 20 percent) of its foreign
exchange resources needed to finance industrial projects, while
at the save time playing a catalytic zole by facilitating NIDB's
external resource mobilization efforts from other sources; and
(b)  to furthl r strengthen NIDB's institutional capabilities,
partici'.arly in the areas of financial and economic appraisal of
its investments/loans.
3.02      Though not explicitly stated, another important objective was to
promote a closer working relationship between NIDB and the Federal Ministry
of Industries (FMI), thus enabling NIDB to make contributions to FMI's
industrial policy decisions that impact on the Nigerian industrial sector
as a whole.



-3-
3.03      Project Description:  The project, consisting of a L'S$60 million
line of credit, was expected to assist about 25 economically, financially
and technically viable investments. Based on NIDB's pipeline of projects
at the time of appraisal, the subloans to be financed under the project
were expected to be primarily in areas of light manufacturing, construction
matc-ials, food and beverages, and hotels. Most were to be import
substitution projects aimed at the local market and a substantial number
was expected to be involved in processing of local raw materials.
Ownership of these subprojects was to be primarily Nigerian and a large
proportion was to be new investments rather than expansions or
rehabilitations. Average subproject cost was envisaged to be about N5.0
million, of which NIDB's assistance was to average about N2.1 million.
3.04      To extend the impact of the loan upon a wider spectrum, NIDB was
to spread external funds among as many sub-borrowers as possible. The
maximum amount of all loans to a borrower under the Bank loan was to be
limited to 25Z of NIDB's paid-in share capital and free reserves. Foreign
exchange risk on subloans was to be borne by sub-borrowers. NIDB's on-
lending rate, ir dollar terms, to sub-borrowers was to be at least 10.5%
per annum consistent with the CBN ceiling, subject to review in light of
market conditions, inflation rates, and the need to assure NIDB an adequate
spread over the cost of its new borrowings. The maximum subloan term was
to be 15 years, consistent with the terms of the borrowed funds from the
Bank.
3.05      Project Design:  The conceptualization of the project (mostly
new and import substituting sub-projects, sponsored by Nigerians) appeared
appropriate at the time of project appraisal, given the desire of the
Government and NIDB to induce new N'gerian entrepreneurs into the
industrial fold.  However, NIDB over-emphasized the financing of new
projects by relatively new entrepreneurs. It also failed to carry out an
in-depth appraisal of sponsors' ability to contribute their share of the
investment cost, or to do sensitivity analyses of sub-projects with the
result that slow subproject implementation led to high cost escalations
often beyond the sponsor's capacity to manage. These problems largely
contributed to the limited success of the project. The Bank, at the time
of appraisal, knowing NIDB weaknesses, should have cautioned it in these
areas and urged NIDB to maintain a reasonable balance between financing new
subprojects and existing projects seeking finance for expansion, balancing
or modernization.
Organization
3.06      The Nigerian Industrial Development Bank was established in 1964
as a successor to the Investment Company of Nigeria (ICON). It is Nigeria's
only financial institution specializing in the provision of term finance
(loan and equity) to medium and large scale industrial projects on a
nationwide scale. At first its majority shareholding was privately owned:
IFC 25Z, CBN 252, other Nigerians 12, and foreign private shareholders 492.
Later, it became a wholly owned government institution under the
indigenization policies of the mid-1970s. Since its formation NIDB has



- 4 -
been an important source of development finance for Nigerian industry,
particularly of long-term foreign exchange loans. To enable NIDB to play a
key role in Nigeria's development efforts, the Government provided
considerable support to its lending operations under the Third Development
Plan and channelled N93 million in loans and N16 million in equity to NIDB
from 1975 to 1977. NIDB's authorized and paid-in share capital, which at
the time of the appraisal (January 1978), stood at N40.0 million and N20.7
million respectively have since increased substantially and currently stand
at N400 million and N397 million respectively.
3.07        Bank Group's association with NIDB dates back to 1964 when IFC
assisted NIDB's establishment and took 25 percent share in its equity; this
investment was later sold to FGN when indigenization took place. Bank's
lending involvement in NIDB started with a loan of $5.6 million (Loan 588-
UNI) in 1969, followed by a second one of $6.2 million (Loan 705-UNI) in
1970. These loans provided much needed foreign exchange for industrial
development during the period of post-war reconstruction. 2/ A third loan
was appraised in 1973, but further processing was ceased, as the Government
decided that it was in a position to provide NIDB with sufficient local and
foreign resources from its own substantial oil revenues at a lower cost.
This decision also affected to some extent the close relations that had
evolved between the Bank Group and NIDB, with the result that institution
building deteriorated. At the same time considerable staff turnover took
place due to comparatively low compensation paid by NIDB. By the fall of
1977, however, it became obvious to the Government that it could no longer
meet NIDB's resource requirements entirely on its own. Discussions were
held with the Bank ia September 1977, and an identification/pre-appraisal
mission from the Bank visited Nigeria in November 1977. Because of the
Bank's prior experience with NIDB, the project under review was quickly
prepared and appraised in January 1978 marking the resumption of a long-
standing association between the Bank and NIDB.
3.08      NIDB was to be the sole agency responsible for project
implementation. However, NIDB was to coordinate with the Federal Ministry
of Industries especially for the promotion. appraisal and supervision of
publicly sponsored projects where NIDB and FMI had mutual interests.
4. Project Implementation
4.01      Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up: The project became
effective or. October 24, 1978, in just over four months from the date of
Board approval (June 15, 1978). Commitments began shortly thereafter at a
relatively quick pace, totalling US$20.8 million (35Z) for six subprojects
2/   A PPAR on these two Bank loans was circulated in October, 1977.  The
report had concluded that NIDB performed satisfactorily as an
intermediary in implementing these projects. However, the Bank
should have endeavored to achieve more extensive impact on the
Nigerian industrial sector as a whole.



-5-
during the first year. Unfortunately, this pace could not be maintained in
the following years. The original terminal date for subproject approvals,
December 31, 1980, proved to be too optimistic as by this date only US$33.6
million or 56X of the loan had been committed. The date had to be extended
thrice, finally to August 30, 1983. The rate of cancellations of subloans
under the project turned out to be higher than expected at appraisal, 28
percent actual as compared to 15 percent estimated (Annex 6). Most of the
cancellations were due to: (a) the fast changing economic environment of
the early 1980s, impacting upon viability of many subprojects, and (b) the
inability of some promoters to provide counterpart funds.
4.02      As in the case of commitments, actual disbursements under the
line of credit were significantly slower than appraisal estimates (see
Table 3 in Part III). As of December 31, 1984, (the original date for loan
closing) only 65 percent of the loan had been disbursed. The closing date
was extended twice and the loan was finally closed on November 26, 1986; an
amount of $8.9 million which remained uncommitted and undisbursed on that
date was cancelled. The slower than estimated commitment and disbursement
rates were attributable to a combination of factors, including: (a) general
down-turn in economic activities in Nigeria which affected the level of
NIDB's operations; (b) inadequate staffing situation of NIDB due to
uncompetitive salaries during the early years of project implementation,
which constrained NIDB's project processing capabilities; (c) slow internal
bureaucracy within NIDB coupled with governmental red tape in the issue of
import permits, verification of land-titles and registration of mortgages;
(d) availability to NIDB, at times, of cheaper alternative resources (e.g.,
6Z FGN funds) which meant slower commitments out of Bank's loan; and (e)
NIDB's practice to submit to IBRD only those projects which were considered
by them to have been thoroughly appraised and likely to receive Bank
approval. These factors, coupled with the unusually slow project
implementation pace in Nigeria, affected the rate of disbursement under
this line of credit.
4.03      While variances between planned and actual implementation
stemming from the deteriorating economic situation could not be avoided,
those resulting from institutional weaknesses could have been avoided to
some extent. The appraisal report had correctly identified project risks
of: (a) slow implementation leading to cost overruns and deterioration of
sub-projects' rates of return; and (b) delays resulting from cumbersome
judicial system, transport bottlenecks and shortages of skilled manpower to
execute projects. What the appraisal report did not foresee was the
inability of NIDB's appraisal staff to carry out intensive and in-depth
appraisal/reappraisal of the financial prospects of projects in the
emerging difficult economic situation in the country which had the
potential of making their financial projections unrealistic, and thus
affecting the viability of the projects. Furthermore, NIDB quite often
failed to assess the ability of the project sponsors to invest their share
of the project cost or to have adequate contingency planning for raising
resources to meet cost overruns resulting from slow project implementation,
devaluation and inflation. 'TIDB's organization also lacked coordination
between project appraisal ai.: implementation units. Had these deficiencies



- 6 -
been rectified in a timely way, some of the project implementation problems
could have been resolved and corresponding damage to the quality of the
portfolio avoided.
4.04      Procurement:  NIDB's procurement practices were found
acceptable. Sub-borrowers generally employed local procurement procedures,
which were acceptable to the Bank. NIDB was required to apply ICB for
procurement contracts above US$3 million, and in the case of turnkey
projects US$15 million. These limits were adhered to.
5. Project Results
5.01      Project Obiectives:  Generally speaking, NIDB's performance
under the loan should be rated as mixed: many sub-projects faced
implementation difficulties (including delays in commitments and
disbursements) but at the same time other loan objectives set out at the
time of the appraisal were realized as discussed below.
5.02      The loan financed a total of 26 subprojects as detailed in
Annex 1. All except one were new ventures. As expected at the time of
appraisal, all these projects were majority Nigerian-owned, with 17
projects having full Nigerian ownership, ard others having at least 65
percent or more Nigerian ownership. Privately sponsored projects accounted
for 86 percent (22 out of 26) of the projects assisted under the Loan. Of
the remaining four projects, two had mixed ownership: Government with
private Nigerian parties, and the other two were majority government owned
with foreign shareholding. These projects received only 11.5 percent of
funds disbursed from the Bank loan.
5.03      Institution-buildin:  A necessary condition for achieving the
institutional objective was the need to reduce the high staff turnover
which appeared to charscterize NIDB at the time of appraisal.  The reasons
for high staff turnover included poor recruitment practices, uncompetitive
salaries, and inadequate scope for individual initiative at lower levels.
To emphasize the Bank's concerns in this area, a covenant was included in
the Loan Agreement, requiring the borrower to undertake a study of staff
compensation with a view to setting up a more appropriate salary structure.
NIDB undertook such a study in 1979, and on the basis of its findings, the
management was able to have the salaries of NIDB staff removed from the FGN
civil service salary structure and to have a new and more appropriate
salary structure approved for them. This helped reduce staff turnover
significantly and to improve the staff morale. At the new salary levels
NIDB was able to attract within a short time a good calibre staff, many
with advanced degrees. By providing them with intensive training,
sometimes with overseas institutions, NIDB has been able to improve their
project appraisal skills to some extent. Further training and experience
should sharpen these skills. While economic rate of return analysis was
routinely carried out by NIDB staff, it was done somewhat un-systematically
and was not adequately integrated into the institution's appraisal process.



-7
5.04      NIDB's management effectiveness has been mixed over the years.
There was a change in top management during the implementation of the loan
under review. In some areas the management was very effective,
particularly in obtaining Government approval for the new salary structure
and seeking a massive increase of its paid-in capital. In other areas i.e.
strengthening NIDB's supervision capabilities, establishing an appropriate
management information system, improving cash collection practices, and
introducing a credit risk management program, thie management has been slow.
The perception of NIDB in business circles varies. Many private sector
Nigerians perceive NIDB as slow and having cumbersome procedures, while
others characterize it as a fairly sound and flexible institution,
particularly in view of its recent restructuring program (para 5.09).
5.05      Resource Mobilization:  With Bank encouragement, NIDB made
efforts to mobilize foreign exchange resources from the foreign private
capital markets but could not make much headway because of the country's
balance of payments and external debt problems; however, in 1983 it
succeeded in obtaining a second loan of US$36.8 million equivalent from the
EIB. More recently, in 1989, a third loan of ECU 50 million (US$61
million) has been signed with EIB. The African Development Bank also
approved, early in 1990, a loan of UA 80 million (US$104 million) to NIDB.
In the area of domestic resource mobilization, NIDB successfully floated
its first debenture issue for N15 million (US $20 million) in 1983 on the
local capital market; the coupon rate was 11.5 percent with maturity in
1995. A second debenture issue of about N75 million is being planned for
1990 fall.
5.06      Geographical dispersal of NIDB's assistance:  In addition to
increasing the number of its area offices to five (Kaduna, Akure, Aba,
Bauchi, Lagos), NIDB also succeeded in achieving broader geographical
dispersal of its assistance in general and under the line of credit in
particular. Projects in 14 states were financed under this line of credit
(Annex 4). Overall, there was a fairly broad dispersal of NIDB's
assistance compared to the outstanding portfolio at the time of appraisal,
when 46 percent of the financed projects were in Lagos state lone.
Geographic diversification has continued to take place during the
implementation of NIDB Fourth Loan with loan approvals spread over about
half the states. This responds well to our long expressed concern over the
lack of geographical balance in NIDB's portfolio. NIDB still needs to
diversify further and cover more states to attain a full national profile.
5.07      Enhancement of NIDB's Development Role:  In response to the
Bank's suggestion that NIDB formulate and adopt a strategy to enhance its
economic and developmental impact over the longer term, NIDB prepared a
formal document entitled "Outline of NIDB's Development Strategy for 1983-
1985" which aimed principally at harmonizing NIDB's activities with the
thrust of Government policy for the industrial sector. It also outlined the
following specific medium-term developmental objectives: (a) resource
mobilization; (b) establishment of subsidiary companies to undertake
leasing, merchant banking activities and consulting services; (c) directing
NIDB's lending toward the private sector and priority subsectors such as



agro-industries, intermediate goods and the construction industry; and
(d) expanding NIDB's promotional, research and technical assistance
functions. Furthermore, in keeping with a specific recommendation made in
the Bank's Project Perfcirmance Audit Report for the first two loans, and as
a means of further broadening its intermediation role, NIDB created an Apex
Financing and Management Unit in 1983. Through this unit NIDB has provided
financing from the EIB line of credit to four regional and state-level
development finance institutions in Nigeria for onlending to eleven
industrial projects in a total amount of N 23.5 million. While no
comprehensive evaluation of investments through the state DFIs has taken
place, Bank's discussions with NIDB staff indicate that the performance of
the sub-projects has so far not been very satisfactory.
5.08      In early 1989, NIDB appointed the Industrial Credit Corporation
(ICC) of Ireland (a DFI which has itself restructured successfully) to
carry out a study of NIDB and recommend a strategic restructuring plan that
would outline what role NIDB should fulfil in Nigeria's more open financial
markets in the 1990s. The study has recently been completed with a
detailed set of recommendations and an implementation schedule. ICC has
recommended a more diversified outlook for NIDB's operations through
strengthening of its commercial activities and development of other viable
commercial ventures, in addition to more efficient and financially self-
supporting development banking. It also stressed the inappropriateness of
NIDB's existing organizational structure in relation to its new orientation
and recommended basic organizational changes. NIDB management has accepted
most of the ICC recommendations and retained them to assist in the
reorganization and implementation of the restructuring plan, which began in
early 1990 and is likely to be completed well before the end of the year.
Among other things, the appraisal and supervision staff have been brought
together under one department. This augurs well for a more effective
supervision of projects in future. In addition, two new departments have
been set up for commercial services (including coordination with NIDB's
subsidiaries) and corporate planning.
5.09      NIDB's Interest Rates and Fee Structure:  At the time of the
appraisal of the project under review, the interest rate charged by NIDB
for its foreign exchange loans was 8.5 percent per annum. The Third Loan
Agreement required that NIDB charge a minimum of 10.5 percent per annum in
US dollar terms to subprojects under the Bank loan and pass on foreign
exchange risk to ultimate borrowers. The high liquidity of the banking
sector in 1980-81 resulted in generally low interest rates (averaging 8.5Z
to 9Z), and this coupled with a willingness on the part of commercial banks
to lend in some cases for longer maturities of up to ten years to their
clients, gave NIDB a tough competition in the early years of the project.
However, NIDB was able to maintain the minimum of 10.5 percent, in US
dollar terms, and even succeeded in increasing its interest rate for
foreign exchange loans to 13 percent per annum as from 1982 (The Bank's
fourth line of credit approved in 1984, and by now also fully committed,
required a minimum interest rate of 13 percent per annum in US dollar
terms). These interest rates were considered adequate during the
implementation period of third and fourth loans, when Nigeria had a fixed



exchange rate and low inflation. The current interest rate for sub-loans
given from EIB line of credit is 16 percent per annum; foreign currency
working capital loans are charged 20 percent per annum. Naira term loans
are charged a floating rate, presently 24 percent per annum; and working
capital loans from funds raised from the local capital market are also
charged a floating rate, presently 28 percent per annum. The interest
rates for naira term loans seem about right, as compared to the prevailing
market rate. The interest rates being charged currently are positive in
real terms (inflation rate 152). NIDB has been rather slow in adjusting
its rates in the past. Under NIDB's new management, which is more
commercially oriented than the previous ones, it is expected that a more
flexible posture will be adopted in this area in future. Effective October
1, 1983, a one-time appraisal fee of one-half percent of the loan amount
was introduced. The commitment charge which had earlier been increased
from 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent in line with NIDB's liability to the Bank
under the fourth loan, has recently been further increased to one percent.
5.10      Improved working relationship with FMI:  Since mid-1980 NIDE's
management has been able to establish and maintain a regular working
relationship with the Federal Ministry of Industries. This has been
achieved without undermining NIDB's operational autonomy.
5.11      Subproject Results  The total cost of the 25 subprojects to be
financed from the loan was estimated at appraisal at N123 million. Under
the Loan, 26 subprojects were approved at an estimated total cost of 1153.5
million. The actual cost to date totals about N265 million (Annex 1).
Cost of the individual projects averaged N10.2 million as compared to an
average cost of about N5 million estimated at appraisal and N5.9 million at
the time of subloan approvals. The subprojects received average financing
of N1.8 million from NIDB (loans plus equity), as compared to N2.1 million
envisaged at appraisal. The subprojects covered a reasonably broad
spectrum of industrial activities:  nine sub-projects in food and beverages
received foreign currency sub loans equivalent of N13.9 million, five in
non-metal industries 114.6 million, four in textiles N9.1 million, three in
chemicals 11.8 million, two in iron and steel 12.5 million, one in a hotel
N7.2 million, and the remaining two in miscellaneous industries N2 million.
5.12      Effect of Devaluation:  Under the Bank loan, the sub-projects
were to assume foreign exchange risk. After a long period of almost
constant exchange rate (1978 US$1=N0.65, 1983 US$1=N0.71), a major
devaluation took place as part of the SAP in September 1986 (US$11N4.12).
The effect of this devaluation would have had very serious consequences for
the sub-projects increasing the naira equivalent of their foreign exchange
loans manifold. However, the Government decided to step in and authorized
a favorable exchange rate of US$1=N1.57 for all disbursements made or
letters of credit outstanding as of September 26, 1986. The sub-borrowers
were thus partly rescued; although even at the favorable rate of exchange
the debt-service liability more than doubled in most cases.
5.13      Implementation Delays:  Almost all subprojects faced
implementation delays ranging from nine months to about six years. One



- 10 -
project is still under construction. The typical reasons attributed to
implementation delays are: delay in obtaining import licenses for the
plant and machinery; promoters inability to contribute their equity as and
when required and to mobilize resources to cover higher project costs
resulting from inflation and devaluation; inability of contractors to
mobilize on time; and delays in complying with legal formalities.
5.14      Capacity Utilization:  The subprojects in operation are
producing at levels ranging from 20 percent to over 90 percent of their
capacities. However, most of them are operating in the range of 30-60
percent of capacity which, though unsatisfactory, is consistent with the
capacity utilization rate of other Nigerian-owned projects in the sector.
High cost of imported raw material, difficulties in obtaining import
licenses for raw materials and working capital from commercial banks due to
credit squeeze are stated to be the main reasons for low capacity
utilization.
5.15      Capital/Labor Ratio:  Since capital intensity of NIDB-financed
projects was a major concern at the time of loan appraisal/approval,
special attention was required in subproject appraisals to consider the
choice of alternative technologies. It is estimated that a total of 3391
direct jobs have been created as compared to 3100 jobs envisaged in the
sub-projects, appraisal reports. The jobs have been created at an average
investment cost per job of about N78,000 ranging from a low of N1,037
(textiles) to a high of N579,000 (chemicals). This compares with the
estimated average cost of about N45,000 in 1977-78 and N76,000 at the time
of subproject appraisals. The high capital intensity has been attributed
to: (a) the additional capital cost incurred by projects in order to
acquire the basic infrastructure necessary to undertake the subprojects
(e.g., power generators, access roads, etc.); and (b) delay in
implementation and resulting cost overruns. While these factors were out
of NIDB's control, with proper engineering staff NIDB could have done more
detailed analyses of the appropriateness of technology and its impact on
the project costs, thereby identifying and recommending areas of possible
capital cost savings.
5.16      Performance and Rates of Return:  The ex-ante weighted average
ERR based on NIDB's appraisal estimates was 14 percent ranging from a low
of 9.7 percent (manufacture of disposable syringes) to a high of 38 percent
(brewery company). Since adequate information has not been forthcoming
from the subprojects in operation, only in the case of ten sub-projects ex
post rates of return have been calculated: ERR for three companies and FRR
for seven companies. Of these, four ROR (financial or economic) are fairly
close to or exceed the rates calculated at the time of appraisal, and one,
although below the originally envisaged rate is acceptable at 14 percent.
The other subprojects indicate marginal or negative rates. Annex 2
provides comparative data.
5.17      Subproiect arrears:  Loan principal in arrears for all 26
subloans under 1597-UNI totals #21.2 million and interest and charges in
arrears another N22.5 million. Together these arrears are about 42 percent



- 11 -
of the aggregate principal outstanding as at December 31, 1989 (N104.2
million). Almost 25 percent of the arrears are over two years old.
Comparative data on NIDB's overall arrears situation is provided in Annex 7
and is further discussed in para 6.05 and 6.06. The major reasons for
these arrears are delays in implementation, high leverage and under-
financing of projects. A part of the problem is that NIDB has generally
been over-optimistic regarding implementation schedules and assumptions
underlying financial projections. A survey of selected sub-projects
undertaken by NIDB in 1988 has revealed that many sub-projects have had
poor performance record so far. This has added to the problem of arrears.
6. NIDB Operations
6.01      Operations:  The main trends in NIDB's operations over the
period 1983-88 are set out in the table below:

Source: NIDB and Annual Reports.
6.02      The number of applications received by NIDB has varied
considerably since 1983. The pattern does not seem to have necessarily
followed the macroeconomic performance as the largest number of
applications was received in 1984 and 19'-, years in which there was poor
performance in manufacturing output and GDP. The size of loans approved
rose slowly in the early 1980s but has increased rapidly since then. The
increase reflects both the domestic price inflation and the devaluation of
the Naira. Although the size of loans increased, the numbers approved each



- 12 _
year fluctuated, and in 1988 fell sharply below the trend of previous
years. The average size of a loan has risen from NO.8 million in 1983 to
K8.2 million in 1988. The extraordinary increase in the value of loans
approved in 1987 is partly due to depreciation of the naira and partly to
the financing of short-term loans for working capital (N31 million) from
EIB line of credit. These loans were approved to sustain the commercial
operations of a number of projects which were unable to obtain working
capital finance from commercial banks due to liquidity squeeze and shortage
of foreign exchange for import of raw materials. Disbursements have also
risen sharply since 1986 for the same reasons.
6.03      Until the mid-1980s the number of new projects approved
considerably exceeded that of expansions or additional loans to clients for
cost overruns. As shown in the table below, there has been a significant
reversal of this trend, with loans for expansions and cost overruns
exceeding those for new projects. This trend should help in consolidating
outstanding investments.
New Proiects vs Expansions

Cost Overruns
6.04      While NIDB's area of operation is quite extensive, it generally
operates in manufacturing, non-petroleum mining and hotel sectors. Even in
these areas, some subsectors are now not being supported either because
NIDB already has a substantial exposure in them (hotels, breweries, and
furniture), or adequate capacity exists in the country in these subsectors
(paper conversion, cement blocks, candles). NIDB's portfolio has a heavy
concentration in consumer goods industries including textiles, food, and
chemicals. An analysis of the past six years indicates that over 60
percent of the total approvals made by NIDB in this period has been to
these three subsectors.
6.05      Quality of portfolio and Arrears.  The condition of NIDB's
portfolio has remained in poor shape for the past several years. This
state of affairs is mainly attributable to the following: (a) economic
difficulties (inflation, devaluation) affecting the country; (b) NIDB's
weaknesses in marketing analysis, assessment of project costs,
implementation schedules and poor collection procedures; and (c) inadequate
equity contributions and relatively poor project execution capabilities of
Nigerian borrowers. Annex 6 provides the arrears situation in brief on a
comparative basis for years ended December 31, 1983, 1987 and 1989.
6.06      While NIDB has increased its efforts to collect arrears, the
improvement, as of December 31, 1989 (32Z outstanding loans affected by
arrears) in the portfolio condition over that at the end of 1983 (52X),
appears to be mainly due to the following reasons:



- 13 -
(a)  authorization by the Central Bank of Nigeria in December 1987
that all NIDB's foreign exchange loans for which L/Cs or other
import documents were issued as of September 26, 1986 would be
deemed to have been contracted at a favorable exchange rate of
N1.57=US$1, as against the then prevalent rate of around
N4=US$1. Taking advantage of this decision many NIDB borrowers
paid some of their arrears;
(b)  rescheduling of a large number of loans to projects where
implementation was considerably delayed often for reasons beyond
the borrower's control;
(c)  increases in the naira equivalent of foreign exchange loans
disbursed after September 26, 1986, at the current market
exchange rates while the portfolio affected by arrears
(relating to pre-September, 1986 disbursed sub-loans) remained
the same; and
(d)  transfer of a portfolio of 13 state-owned projects involving an
amount of N84.8 million to a "Managed Fund" approved by the
Government in 1984 on which NIDB was to assume no credit risk.
The improvement of portfolio quality, therefore, is not as significant or
real as the figures in Annex 7 indicate.
6.07      Loan loss provisions have grown from 3.2 percent of the
portfolio in 1983 to 7.5 percent in 1988. The table below summarizes the
trend in the cumulative provisions for the years 1983 to 1988. NIDB's
policy in the past was not to make provisions unless an account went into
liquidation or receivership category, which sometimes took two or more
years after the borrower had stopped making payment of interest or
repayment of principal. Following Bank suggestions, NIDB is now making
provisions for losses on a more conservative basis. NIDB's unaudited 1989
accounts indicate that its cumulative loss provisions would be about equal
to the principal, interest and other charges in arrears of over 6 months.

6.08      Financial Condition:  A summary of NIDB's financial statements
for the period 1979-1988 (and 1989 unaudited) are provided in Annexes 8 and
9. Key financial ratios for the same period are provided in Annex 10.
Briefly, while income from loans and debentures is the major component of
total income it is gradually accounting for a declining share of income; in
1979, it constituted 83 percent of the total income, in 1983, 77 percent
and in 1988 only 54 percent. This reflects NIDB's efforts to diversify its
income base in order to enhance profitability. Income from equity
investment is fairly stable as a percentage of total income at around ten
percent. Since it was established, NIDB has always shown profits although,
as expected, its profitability has been substantially below that of
commercial banks. Return on average total assets has increased from 1.1
percent in 1983 to 2.7 percent in 1988. There has been a spectacular rise
of about 265 percent in profits in 1988, despite an increase of 45 percent
in administration expenses (due to employees receiving substantial pay
increases consequent on revision of pay scales). Interest savings and
earnings from the injection of equity in cash and debt conversion by the
Government (para 6.10), together with a significant growth in loan income
and profits from letters of credit and foreign exchange dealings account
for the profit increase. The unaudited 1989 accounts also reflect a much
improved financial position.
6.09      Earnings and Cash Flow: In the past several years NIDB's
reported income, with interest accruals, has exceeded the actual
collections by a substantial amount - in 1986 it was by about 50 percent
and in 1989 by about 48Z. Bank supervision missions have repeatedly
pointed out to NIDB that its accounting policies in the areas of interest
accrual and provisions for accrued interest on non-performing loans result
in overstatement of NIDB's financial position. Some improvement has begun
to show in the 1990 first quarter's results; cash collection during
January-March 1990 appear to be equal to current interest receivable plus
about 80% of the 1989 interest receivable. Unless improved performance
such as this is maintained in the near future, NIDB's profitability,
described in para 6.08 would be illusory.
6.10      An analysis of the 1988 Balance Sheet indicates a large equity
base as a result of the doubling of NIDB's paid in share capital. The
Government increased it from N199 million in 1987 to N397 million in 1988,
converting its loan of N118 million into equity and injecting an additional
N80 million in cash. This has strengthened NIDB's financial structure
considerably, with a very low debt equity ratio (0.4:1) and a very high
capital adequacy ratio (equity as a percentage of risk assets) of over 100
percent. As pointed out earlier, unless NIDB is able to continue its more
aggressive collection practices followed in the past few months, the
improved cash situation that NIDB is enjoying at present due to the inflow
of new equity funds would only be a short term gain.



- 15 -
7. Project Sustainability
7.01      NIDB was established with a mandate to provide term finance to
medium and large scale enterprises, particularly in the industrial sector.
During the early years it received assistance from a number of
international and bilateral sources who participated in the company's
equity and were represented on its Board. After NIDB became a wholly
Government-owned institution in the mid-seventies, it received considerable
support from the Government in the form of equity and loans to enable it to
carry out its role. While NIDB has managed to maintain its marginal
profitability, it has not until very recently been able to improve
adequately its capabilities in the areas of supervision, loan collections
and organizational co-ordination. These weaknesses have contributed to
accumulation of huge arrears of principal and interest in NIDB's portfolio
which would have impacted adversely on NIDB's viability had the Government
not come forward with a massive injection of equity (para 6.10).
7.02      While NIDB's sustainability so far, and in the foreseeable
future, should be considered to be largely dependent on Government support,
it must be said in its favor that in recent years it has ventured out of
its protective shell and is seeking to establish a niche for itself in the
widening and more open financial market in Nigeria. Some of the measures
taken are: (a) a successful debenture issue to mobilize resourcos from the
domestic market in 1983, with a second one planned for 1990 fall; (b)
introduction of some commercial banking activities like issuance of letters
of credit; (c) establishment of two new subsidiaries to undertake
management consultancy and leasing operations; and (d) commencement of
implementation of the accepted recommendations of a study carried out in
1989 by ICC to restructure NIDB to meet the new challenges.
7.03      In a desire to give NIDB a commercial orientation the Government
has recently taken two important steps. Firstly, in May 1990, it appointed
NIDB's Board with a membership of 13, of whom six represent the private
sector and five represent the banking sector. Secondly, the Government is
keen to divest about 30 percent of NIDB's shareholding to the private
sector. In addition, NIDB is being fully reorganized as discussed
elsewhere in the report. Given these favorable developments, it appears
likely that the Board and the management will be given adequate autonomy to
conduct NIDB's operations without intervention from the Government except
perhaps for broad sectoral policy guidelines.
7.04      In view of the fact that there is still a reluctance on the part
of the commercial and merchant banks in Nigeria to provide medium and long-
term finance for industrial development, except to their well-established
clients, and non-availability of long-term foreign exchange resources to
investors from other sources, NIDB will continue to have an important role
to play. It enjoys strong support from the Government and from some
international institutions. The recent massive injection of capital and
strengthening of management and staffing provide NIDB with a splendid
opportunity to reorganize and establish for itself an important place in
the financial market of Nigeria. However, it is difficult to say at this
stage whether. without Government support, NIDB would be able to mobilize



- 16 -
resources to become a fully sustainable institution in the long-run with a
well-defined role in long-term lending.
8. Bank Performance
8.01      Through the Third NIDB Loan (and more so, the subsequent Fourth
NIDB Loan), the Bank has made a positive contribution to the institutional
development of NIDB, particularly on its financial viability. Bank's
strong support to NIDB during the implementation period of this loan
resulted in the Government taking the necessary actions enabling NIDB to
improve its salary structure, create the Managed Fund (for Government
behest investments) and increase the share capital. On the negative side,
the Bank was somewhat 'ax in not sending a supervision mission for almost a
year after the loan became effective, almost two years from the time the
loan was appraised. The slow start of the project could perhaps have been
improved upon by an earlier field mission.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01      Table 5, Part III provides information on the status of
covenants and reviews performance of the borrower. Except for the delays
in submitting audited accounts, and some minor changes made in operating
policies without prior approval of the Bank as required under the
provisions of the Loan Agreement, NIDB's performance was satisfactory.
Conditions of effectiveness were met in reasonable time and subproject
appraisals began shortly thereafter. However, because of subsequent slow
commitments, terminal dates for subproject submissions and disbursement had
to be extended thrice and twice respectively.
9.02      The borrower has had a very poor collectior. record throughout
the implementation period, which continues to remain highly unsatisfactory
to the present. This has resulted in the continued presence of a hard core
of doubtful loans in NIDB's portfolio. Another area of weakness which
negatively influenced the borrower's performance was that it maintained
separate departments for appraisal and supervision with little exchange of
personnel or contact of the staff in the course of day to day business. As
a consequence, officers involved in project appraisal had little knowledge
of practical problems affecting project implementation. This was reflected
in their project appraisal reports which were overly optimistic in areas of
market assessment and projections of implementation schedules and capacity
utilization. However, this is now being rectified in the reorganization
rurrentiy taking place in NIDB.



- 17 -
10. Findings and Lessons
10.01     NIDB's performance under the loan has been mixed.  During the
implementation of the project Nigeria went through a series of economic
difficulties which severely affected NIDD as well as its clients. It also
brought to the fore NIDB's weaknesses and its inability to cope adequately
with the changing environment. The overall impact of these problems was
that by 1986-87 NIDB's portfolio was in poor shape, i.s staff disgruntled
and without much. incentives, and its finar.cial position threatened as a
result of mounting arrears of principal and interest. It has taken a lot
of commitment and hard work on the part of NIDB management to extricate the
institution from this situation.
10.02     The Bank played an important role in assisting NIDB in this
area. It supported NIDB vis-a-vis the Government in the matter of
improvement of NIDB's salary scales, and the setting up of a "Managed Fund"
(para 6.06).  It also pressed NIDB to carry out a comprehensive review of
its portfolio affected by arrears and to restructure its organization,
policies and activities so as to be able to meet the challenge of survival
in a changing and competitive environment.
10.03     A few lessons can be drawn from the experience of implementation
of this project. Firstly, following the naira devaluations of mid-
eighti4os, the naira equivalent of NIDB's portfolio of foreign currency sub-
loans initially increased many times making it virtually impossible for
most clients, including sub-borrowers under IBRD lines of credit who were
required to bear the exchange risk, to service their debts (para 5.12);
this had implications for NIDB's own credit-worthiness also. Fortunately
for NIDB and its clients, the Government subsequently decided that the
obligations of NIDB borrowers would be fixed at a favorable rate of
Nl.57=US $1, in respect of amounts disbursed or for which L/Cs had been
issued as of September 1986, instead of the then prevailing rate of
N4=US$1; this provided a great relief to NIDB and its borrowers. Had the
Government not come to NIDB's rescue at the time, the excessive risk
exposure of NIDB in foreign exchange would have had grave consequences for
the institution. It is, therefore, important that NIDB maintain a
reasonable proportion between its liabilities in foreign and local
currencies in the future.
10.04     Secondly, institution building is a slow and continuous process
and any slackness or laxity in following appropriate and sound banking
procedures and inadequate commitment to continued staff training, both
formal and job-related, can affect the institution's effectiveness, as
appeared to be the case in NIDB.
10.05     Thirdly, NIDB, like many DFIs, was perhaps over-emphasizing its
developmental role at the expense of commercial considerations and was,
therefore, unable to maintain a reasonable balance between loans for new
projects and those for expansion/rehabilitation; all sub-loans except one
under the project were made for new sub-projects and almost all of them
experienced serious implementation delays. Sound and prudent banking
principles became subservient to the ^developmental' role, which was simply



- 18 -
seen as transferring of investment resources to industrial borrowers
without adequately ensuring that the funds lent would support commercially
and economically viable activities which, in turn would lead to a sustained
process of industrialization in Nigeria.
10.06     Lastly, NIDB's experience under the project emphasizes the
importance of taking a second hard look at project appraisals before
commitment when the economic situation is likely to change to such an
extent that original assumptions underlying projections would no longer
remain valid. In other words, a more thorough sensitivity analysis on all
projects must be undertaken.
11. Project Documentation and Data
11.01     The Loan Agreement in the case of Loan 1597 UNI was quite
adequate and appropriate for achieving project objectives in the key
organizational and financial areas. The appraisal report of the project
provided a useful framework for both Bank and NIDB for review of project
implementation. NIDB provided information and data for this Project
Completion Report.
11.02     NIDB has a computerized data system which prod.ices a fair amount
of information on sub-borrowers' accounts. However, the ouality of the
data is not entirely reliable.  Under the reorganizatir,c  the management is
bringing a Technical Advisor from ICC whose task wou.ld irclude overseeing
the design and implementation of an adequate management in;formation system.

PART 'I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.   Statistical Information
1.01      The loan, NIDB III (Loan 1597 - UNI), which is the subject of
this review, was signed on July 24, 1978 while the closing date for
submission of subject projects was September 30, 1986 extended from
December 31, 1984. The line of credit was for $60 million at the closing
date, $5,265,000 was committed. Whei the disbursement closed on November
26, 1986, a further $3,602,000 was undisbursed. A total of 26 sub-projects
(25 new and one expansion) benefitted from the line of credit.
1.02      The NIDB IV (Loan 2299 - UNI) signed in April 1984 has been
82.5Z ($99 million out of $120 million) as at March 30, 1990.
1.03      Performance of the subjects arose from the following problems:-
(i)       25 out of 26 sub-projects are greenfield projects;
(ii)      they were mainly Nigerian owned and the promoters had
difficulties contributing their counterpart funds;
(iii)     the sub-projects were widely dispersed around the country
the attendant infrastructural deficiencies leading to high
overhead costs for the sub-projects;
(iv)      the pre-mature appraisal of the sub-projects coupled with
weak implementation arising from the above problems.
1.04      The problem resulted in substantial cost and time overrun which
are also indication of poor estimate of cost and poor counterpart funding.
1.05      Two of the sub-projects:-
Veritak Nigeria Limited; and
Life Breweries Limited
have fully repaid their loans. Another, Gldan Haki Limited has been sold
while Super Bottling Company was not fully implemented before its machinery
was sold. The key problems experienced by sub-projects under the NIDB III
are being addressed by the restructuring, reorganisation and
diversification now going on at NIDB.
2.   Project Implementation
2.01      The actual disbursement under the line of credit was slower than
appraisal estimate as a result of a number of constraints: 1/
(i)       Clients or promoters of subjects were aversive to foreign
currency loans at that time and preferred loan currency
loans.
(ii)      Many promoters had no counterpart funds.
(iii)     There was high staff turnover due to the establishment of
first generation of merchant banks in Nigeria (1978-1980)
who drew their foundation staff from NIDB.
l/  (The correction has beea made in Part I.  ed.]



- 20 -
(iv)      There were lack of coordination between appraisal and
implementation within NIDB, which has informed the present
restructuring. Now one Sector/Group is responsible for
appraisal, implementation and supervision.
(v)       Most of the projects were green field and Nigerian owned as
in the approved objectives of the loan project.
(vi)      There are however no sub-project solely owned by Government
as alluded in paragraph 5.02 of Part 1. Some are partly
Government owned.
3.   Project Results
3.01      Economic rate of return analysis were and are still routinely
carried out by NIDB staff. Even though the Economists who did this
analysis, until recently, were in a separate department, the financial
appraisal was the base for the economic analysis. They were systematic and
adequately integrated into the appraisal process whose documents are
considered in detail by management before approval. However, economic
appraisal was a new concept at the start of the NIDB loan III and it took a
while for the modalities to be well developed.
3.02      There was a change in top management early in the project life,
in 1980; but after that there has been stability in the management.
3.03      Diversification into more states or geographical spread is a
valid developmental role, but this will be subject to getting viable
projects in the various states. Now that a marketing department has been
established, NIDB hopes to pursue this idea vigorously. The World Bank on
its part had emphasized the developmental and apex financing role for NIDB
as against the current insistence on commercial activities.
3.04      The appraisal fee charged by NIDB on its sub-projects is 1/4 of
one per cent.
3.05      Even though there are sub-project arrears under Loan 1597-UNI,
NIDB has not been in arrears in the payment of the World Bank principal and
interest. NIDB has infact made some pre-payments in respect of a number of
sub-projects: Super Bottling, Life Breweries, Ikeja Hotels and lle-Ani
Industries, either in whole or in part. Two others, Nigerian Asbestos and
Arabi Bakeries have always paid on schedule. It is, however, important that
the arrears referred to in paragraph 5.16 of Part I should be stated at a
time period.
4.   NIDB Operations
4.01      The NIDB III (Loan 1597 - UNI) became effective in 1978, the
last date for sub-project submission was in 1983 and the date of last
disbursement in 1986. Therefore the period relevant for examining NIDB
operations in 1978 to 1986.

4.02      NIDB's portfolio had been healthy until 1981 when the arrears
became monumental. NIDB has had problems of arrears but the portfolio
could not be said to have remained poor for the past several years as in
paragraph 6.05 of Part I.
4.03      NIDB has always made specific provisions covering all categories
of projects in the portfolio (in operation or under implementation). The
more conservative basis for provision was agreed upon between the World
Bank, NIDB and the external auditors to NIDB. In most cases, the assets of
the sub-projects are highly secured or even over-secured.
4.04      NIDB now maintains a policy of designating some sub-projects as
non-performing loans. These are put in a suspence account and the accrued
interest in such cases are not put into income.
5.   NIDB's Sustainability
5.01      NIDB ceased to get low interest loans from the Government in
1987. Even the increase in equity capital in 1988 was achieved through the
capitalization of past Government loans and not through infusion of new
money. The present restructuring efforts of NIDB and the proposed partial
privatisation will make NIDB less dependent on Government funding. NIDB is
now geared towards private ownership and to operate more competitively.
5.02      Even when Government had 99Z of the share capital of NIDB, there
had been little intervention in the day-to-day operations. Government
influence on the broad policy guidelines of NIDB have already been through
the Board of Directors.
6.   NIDB's Performance
6.01      The audited accounts of NIDB were always submitted to the World
Bank as soon as it was approved by the Board and the Annual General Meeting
of shareholders, in fact, the draft of such audited accounts are usually
made available to the World Bank even before the approval. Similarly, NIDB



- 22 -
have always discussed policy changes with the World Bank before they
implemented.
6.02      The collections (of principal and interest due) by NIDB may be
unsatisfactory; but it was not very poor compared to other development
banks in developing countries. Even then, there has been a considerable
improvement in NIDB Collections in 1989 and 1990 when this report was
prepared.
7.   Findings and Lessons
7.01      NIDB will be making effort to improve the balance between the
foreign and local currency loans. It will depend less on fore:gn currency
by possibly pressurising the Central Bank of Nigeria to move it higher up
in the Foreign Exchange Market (FEM) category for the purpose of foreign
currency investment.
7.02      NIDB's training programme has been a continuous exercise.  There
has been no slacking in its training activities.  The impact is however
hampered by senior staff turnover, which issue is now being addressed.
7.03      All NIDB's sub-projects have always been subjected to through
sensitivity analysis. This will continue as it is found crucial in
predicting potentially problematic sub-project.
7.04      The quality of data prepared by NIDB is considerable.  The data
may not be comprehensive but it is definitely reliable contrary to the
assession in 11.02 c, Part 1.
8.   Relationship Between NIDB and World Bank
8.01      The relationship between NIDB and the World Bank has been
effective, very friendly and cordial. The World Bank, for instance, was
instrumental in convincing the Government of the need to remove NIDB from
the Civil Service Grade and Salary Scale systems.
9.   Relationship with Co-financiers
9.01      The co-financiers with NIDB were mainly commercial banks.  The
relationship of NIDB with them has not been a good experience since most of
them were not able to provide working capital funding as promised to sub-
projects during appraisal period. This has forced NIDB to introduce
permanent working capital loans as a way of over-coming this lack of
cooperation.
9.02      The sub-project promoters themselves often do not have the
counterpart funds to contribute to the sub-projects as agreed during the
appraisal stage. Credit investigations during appraisal were more often
than not stage managed to give the impression that the promoters account
with their bankers were good.

Comments
Main Project Issues and Recommendation:
The final date of subproject approval was extended twice from
October 21, 1981 to June 30, 1982 and then to August 30, 1983. The first
extension was granted to allow NIDB more time to process the projects it
had earmarked for the loan. Because several subprojects previously
approved by NIDB were withdrawn largely due to delays by clients in
fulfilling loan conditions, and given the tight foreign exchange position,
it was agreed NIDB could benefit from the extension. An uncommitted
balance of US$5.3 million was cancelled.
The closing date was first extended from December 31, 1984 to
December 31, 1985. In late 1985, Nigerian commercial banks caused
difficulties and delays in accepting the subprojects' import licenses
because of worries about foreign exchange availability, despite the fact
that these import licenses were backed by Bank loan funds. The extension
was approved with the understanding that import licences would be obtained
particularly for projects reflecting government priority. The closing date
was further extended to September 30, 1986 to allow more time for the
borrower to complete drawing down on loan funds for the remaining
subprojects since NIDB's borrowers experienced delays in delivery of
equipment.

Comments
An extension of the closing date to December 31, 1985 was
granted on the understanding that the Bank would cancel amounts for any
subprojects which had not received import licenses by March 31, 1985.
US$2,848,799.45. which represented the total amount allocated to
subprojects which did not receive import licenses by March 31, 1985, or
subprojects which did not utilize their total allocations, also had to be
cancelled. US$752,865.77, representing the undisbursed balance after all
withdrawal applications had been submitted, was cancelled when the project
was closed. Total cancellations amounted to US$8,866,665.22 including the
uncommitted balance of US$5,265,000.
