IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
AGRICULTURAL FINANCING PROJECT
(Loan 3402-IND)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Agricultural Financing
Project in Indonesia, for which Loan 3402-IND in the amount of $106.1 million was approved
on September 5, 1991, and made effective on March 27, 1992. The loan was closed on January
26, 1999 (shortly after its original closing date of December 31, 1998), with the sum of
$67.3 million disbursed. Sums of $10.8 million and $28.0 million were canceled as of
April 18, 1998, and August 26, 1998 respectively.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Dennis Notley (Consultant Financial Analyst) with the
assistance of Mr. Unggul Suprayitno (Financial Officer) and Ms. Kowsar Parveen Chowdhury
(Administrative Assistant). It was reviewed by Mr. William Cuddihy, Task Manager, Geoffrey
B. Fox, Sector Manager, EASRD, and Mr. Mark Baird, Country Director for Indonesia. The
Borrower provides comments that are included in Appendix 2 to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR is based on the findings of the Bank's implementation completion
mission in February 1999 and on materials in the Bank's files for the project, in Washington and
Jakarta. The borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by offering views reflected in the
mission's Aide Memoire (Appendix 1), and in its own evaluation of project execution
(Appendix 2).

INDONESIA
AGRICULTURAL FINANCING PROJECT (Loan 3402-IND)
Evaluation Summary
Project Objectives
1.    At the time of project formulation, the World Bank saw a favorable economic
environment. In agriculture, Government of Indonesia (GOI) would provide support services,
and intervene less in pricing, marketing, production and trade. In the financial sector major
reforms in 1983 had permitted the entry of new banks, and further reforms in 1990 were to
markedly reduce distortions created by subsidized credit. The Financial Sector Development
Project (FSDP: for which Loan 3526-IND was later approved on November 12, 1992) would
reinforce GOI's efforts to promote an efficient, stable and sound financial sector by
strengthening prudential banking regulations and Bank Indonesia (BI)'s bank supervision
systems. Against this backdrop, the project objectives were to: (a) strengthen the capacity of
participating banks (PBs) to lend on a long term basis at market rates, to private small-and
medium-scale agricultural, fishery and agribusiness enterprises; (b) improve the availability of
term credit to these enterprises during the transition period when the financial system would be
adjusting to the deregulated regime; and (c) finance economic and financially viable, and
environmentally sound investments in agriculture and agribusiness.
Implementation Experience and Results
2.    The financial crisis conditions since early 1998 have affected the banking system
severely. None of the twelve banks that participated in the Agricultural Financing Project (AFP)
continue to have capital adequacy ratios above the (Basle) recommended level of 8 percent; and
only two meet the lower target of 4 percent adopted by BI in late 1998. High interest rates have
presently eliminated demand, and the capacity of PBs to undertake long term loans at market
rates. Because of this and the uncertain financial positions of the participating banks, the World
Bank Loan was not extended beyond its original closing date of December 31, 1998. In total
$38.8 million, or 37 percent of the original loan of $106.1 million was canceled.
3.   Investment Credit Component. The project was to finance about 350 enterprises
having operating assets of not more than $500,000, with a maximum subloan limit of $525,000.
Most subloans-172 with an average value of $290,000 each-clearly went to the target group,
and accounted for 60 percent by value of all subloans granted. The remaining subloans went to
495 small farmers who were contracted to two very large shrimp schemes. This style of subloan
was discontinued as these were considered by the World Bank as not being within the intended
target group because it was not clear whether they were indeed farmers or scheme workers. Four
of the PBs recorded unacceptably high levels of doubtful or bad debts, but the subloans at the
other banks have performed remarkably well, given the severity of the financial crisis.
4.    Technical Assistance Component. Assistance to prospective subborrowers to prepare
proposals was dropped from the Project at the mid-term review, as entrepreneurs were willing to
employ outside experts when needed. The BI Management Information System, MIS for term
credit, which was to include monthly reports on repayments and arrears, was not implemented,



but should have been. Assistance and training on appraisal and loan administration procedures
was judged by PBs to be effective and useful, although most PBs considered that the appraisal
procedures were unduly cumbersome and the approval process too slow.
5.    World Bank Performance. The project was exhaustively debated during preparation.
Issues concerning bank soundness and BI regulatory capability were well known, and
departmental and regional management judged, in view of the forthcoming Financial Sector
Development Project, that the risks associated were acceptable. These substantial risks were not
mentioned in the appraisal report, indeed the report stated that there were no major risks. The
sequencing of AFP prior to enhanced prudential banking regulation and enforcement by BI,
occurred because AFP was considered to be an essential interim operation for the agricultural
sector. In hindsight, it is clear that a delay to enable the planned objectives of FSDP to bear
fruit; an insistence on independent verification of the soundness of the participating banks; and
closer monitoring during supervision of the dependency of this project upon FSDP, would have
been preferable.
6.    AFP gave some warnings of the emerging bank crisis. A year before board presentation,
the task manager reported that the participating banks were worried that delay in AFP could
affect confidence in the financial sector. Early into implementation, the FSDP task manager
raised concerns about the viability of BAPINDO, one of the participating banks. The World Bank
continued to rely on BI to supervise the soundness of PBs, and did not ask for independent
inspections. The signals did not lead to a Departmental review of the early experience in
strengthening BI prudential regulation, upon which the decision to proceed with AFP had been
based.
7.    GOIIBI/PB Performance.  The Indonesian participants in general fulfilled their
respective roles under the Project, albeit with subloans not at the volume hoped for. In particular
the performance of five participating banks, in approving and supervising what have turned out
to be, on the whole, viable subloans, must be highlighted. The MIS, especially repayment
performance tracking, was not implemented.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
8.    Any assessment during the continuing financial crisis must be read with caution. There is
partial confirmation of a 1997 judgement of the World Bank's sector unit that "AFP is making an
important contribution by demonstrating the financial viability of small and medium-size loans
for agricultural enterprises at market rates of interest, and the potential for the commercial banks
to play an increasing role in servicing this emerging market". At the same time, it should be
noted that the World Bank's views on the virtues of market interest rates are not fully reflected in
Indonesian policy, or the practice of other important donors. And the present situation of very
high real and nominal interest rates does not provide a conducive climate for arguing the case
that the project has demonstrated that market rates are preferable to subsidized.



-vi-
9.    Most subloans appears to have been remarkably resilient in the face of the high interest
rates engendered by the financial crisis. Subprojects with an export focus have been protected,
indeed some have clearly benefited from the massive devaluation of the rupiah. Subprojects
processing or transforming agricultural produce for the local market appear to be coping at
present, although the continuance of high interest rates may affect them. The performance of five
of the banks appears to have been satisfactory in terms of subloan quality, three banks performed
less well, while the percentage of doubtful debts and those more than 90 days overdue at four
participating banks was unacceptably high. The lending performance outcome is therefore at best
mixed.
10.   The extent to which PBs have been successfully introduced to term lending to agriculture
is also mixed. The PBs and their term loan customers accept variable interest rates as a matter of
course, an important device for dealing with the mismatch between funds available being at short
term, and demand for long-term loans. Most of the PBs felt strongly that the appraisal
procedures under AFP were unduly onerous, and compared them with lighter procedures under
alternative schemes. Certainly the requirements for economic analysis of subprojects dealing
with commodities benefiting from artificial distortions caused difficulties, including the absence
of applicable correction factors. Requirements for environmental screening also were onerous,
as the banks were not permitted to simply rely upon the Government's own processes, but were
expected to ensure that screening was adequate. And there were mismatches between the
training course material which assumed borrowers could provide reliable financial data, and the
reality that many firms keep only rudimentary records. This posed a challenge to establishing
borrower creditworthiness. While design of any future program should take heed of these
difficulties, the strong appraisal review processes enforced under AFP may well have contributed
to the success of most subloans, and should not be lightly weakened.
11.   The very real demonstration of how some banks unaccustomed to lending in the
agricultural and agro-industrial sectors have been able to do sound business at market interest
rates, with subprojects producing a real development benefit, may be the project's most
important impact. It supports the case for resuming unsubsidized term lending, as the financial
crisis passes. But the longer the crisis continues, the greater the danger that this experience will
be lost, as staff change, and as institutions remain unable to make term loans. It is tempting to
see a half full glass, and rank the project marginally successful. But the fact that all the
participating banks have capital adequacy ratios of less than 8 percent, the fact that some of the
banks performed quite poorly with unacceptably high doubtful debts giving rise to unacceptable
levels of doubtful debts at the overall project level, the shortfall in demand compared to appraisal
expectations, the high number of subloans outside the target group, and the uncertain prospects
of a sustainable impact of the experience and technical assistance, argue for judging the glass
half empty. This ICR therefore ranks the project outcome as unsatisfactory.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
AGRICULTURAL FINANCING PROJECT
(Loan 3402-IND)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
1.    Policy environment: The project objectives were set against a backdrop of a new
environment for agriculture, entailing a changing role for the Government, geared more towards
providing support services, and intervening less in pricing, marketing, direct production and
trade, while addressing the emerging conservation needs. The agriculture sector would rely on
new sources of growth through greater diversification both horizontally (products) and vertically
(services, marketing and agroprocessing). This would require unlocking the full potential of the
private sector. The availability of term credit would play an important role in tapping new
sources of growth and a long-term commitment of resources. In the financial sector, major
reforms in 1983 had permitted the entry of new banks, complemented by a program to strengthen
Bank Indonesia's supervisory capabilities; and further reforms in 1990 were to markedly reduce
distortions created by subsidized credit programs, and to foster further the development of the
capital market. The future agenda included strengthening the supporting infrastructure for the
financial sector such as the legal framework and prudential control and supervision. New
prudential regulations including those related to capital adequacy had been put into effect, and
with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, efforts were
under way to strengthen Bank Indonesia (BI's) supervisory functions.
2.    The World Bank objectives and strategy in the financial sector and agricultural credit
included (a) strengthening the state commercial banks (SCBs) for them to compete in the new
financial environment; and (b) promoting a sustainable flow of commercial credit to the
agricultural sector to replace the old system of subsidized directed credit. The Financial Sector
Development Project (for which Loan 3526-IND was later approved on November 12, 1992) was
to reinforce GOI's efforts to promote an efficient, stable and sound financial sector by (a)
strengthening prudential banking regulations and BI's bank supervision systems and staff skills;
(b) further developing BI's credit information system; and (c) strengthening the capital base of
SCBs to enable them to compete in the deregulated environment. While these measures would
permit the policy environment for resource allocation to improve and the financial system to
become increasingly competitive and sophisticated, as a transitional measure the World Bank
would continue to support efficient delivery of credit to groups of borrowers whose access to
credit was constrained.
3.    Project objectives: In support of Government's policy to eliminate subsidized credit as
a means of promoting agricultural development, the primary objectives of the proposed project
were to: (a) strengthen the capacity of participating banks (PBs) to lend on a long term basis at
market rates, to private small- and medium-scale agricultural, fishery and agribusiness
enterprises; (b) improve the availability of term credit to these enterprises during the transition



-2-
period when the financial system is adjusting to the deregulated regime; and (c) finance
economic and financially viable, and environmentally sound investments in the agriculture and
agribusiness sectors.
4.    The project components were: (a) an investment credit component to finance PBs'
subloans to eligible private, small- and medium-scale investments in agriculture, livestock,
fishery, forestry, and agribusiness; and (b) a technical assistance component to provide subloan
appraisal advisory and Management Information System assistance to the PBs, staff training, and
at the enterprise level, assistance to prospective subborrowers to prepare high quality subproject
proposals. During implementation, the number of participating banks was increased, and the
objectives of the technical assistance component adjusted.
5.    Evaluation of Project Objectives.  The project objectives were ambitious, and
consistent with GOI's financial reform strategies, and correctly accepted the challenge of
demonstrating the viability of market rate lending. Sustainability was dependent upon three
critical factors external to the project: (a) the financial soundness of the participating banks; (b)
the related dependency upon the success of technical assistance under the Financial Sector
Development Project to strengthen BI in its role of determining and enforcing BI's prudential
banking regulations; and (c) the degree to which Government (BI/MOF)-Ministry of Finance)
policies for the financial sector set out above were firmly in place. The appraisal report judged
that there were no major risks, perceived at the time, that could inhibit the attainment of the
project objectives. However the report stated that uncertainties in credit demand and the
participating banks' lack of familiarity with the appraisal and administration of small agricultural
subloans, might lead to slow project implementation and loan disbursements. These risks were
to be minimized by a prudent loan amount and by the selection of participating banks with a
long-term interest in developing the agricultural credit market. The statement that no major risks
were involved was clearly incorrect, and in fact the external risks of bank soundness and the
BI prudential regulatory function had been vigorously debated within the World Bank during
preparation. The risk paragraph should have mentioned them.
6.    The decision to proceed with the project in the face of known major risks needs to be
assessed taking into account the World Bank role to undertake innovative projects with
challenging objectives. The sequencing of AFP as a two-step onlending project, prior to
successful implementation of prudential banking regulation and enforcement by Bank Indonesia,
occurred because priority was accorded to AFP as an essential interim operation for the
agricultural sector. The Agriculture Division argued strongly for the need for AFP focussed
upon agriculture and agro-industry, as it felt that banks would not readily undertake lending for
agriculture without a specialized project. The question that may now be asked is whether this
support to the agriculture sector was sufficiently important to proceed in the face of the known
external risks, or whether on the information known at the time, prudence would have dictated a
delay to enable the planned objectives of the Financial Sector Development Project to bear fruit,
or an insistence on independent initial and ongoing verification of the soundness of the
participating banks. Dealing with such a question would be more appropriately handled in the
context of a wider discussion of the experience of the financial and economic crisis in Indonesia,
and as such is not addressed in this report.
7.    This review also does not deal with how the risks grew into the financial crisis in
Indonesia, which has severely impacted upon bank viability, the exchange rate, and interest rates,
but simply notes (a) the project did not in any significant way contribute to the crisis; and (b) the



-3-
ongoing high interest rates and bank weaknesses may, particularly if they persist, cause problems
for project sustainability.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
8.    None of the 12 banks that participated in AFP continue to have capital adequacy ratios
above the Basle recommended level of 8 percent, and only two meet the lower target of 4 percent
adopted by BI in late 1998. Two banks were forced to withdraw from new lending under the
project during implementation (Bapindo and Pan Indonesian Bank). Bapindo and Bank Ekspor
Impor Indonesia are to be merged, along with two other state banks, into Bank Mandiri. Bank
Central Asia, Bank Danamon and Bank Tiara have been taken over by the Government, and
Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia has failed and been closed, and its affairs are being handled by
the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency. As a result of the uncertain situation for the
participating banks, the loan was not extended beyond its original closing date of
December 31, 1998. In total $38.8 million, or 37 percent of the original loan of $106.1 million
was canceled.
9.   In contrast to the current state of the institutions involved in lending under the project,
many of the enterprises receiving subloans appear to have prospered with the assistance of the
subloans.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
10.  Investment Credit Component. The project was to finance about 350 enterprises
having operating assets of not more than $500,000, with a maximum subloan limit of $525,000.
A major issue arose during implementation with the World Bank considering that the granting of
loans to small shrimp farmers within very large-scale integrated developments was contrary to
the spirit and essence of the project objectives for promoting small and medium enterprises.
After discussion it was agreed that small subloans associated with such very large scale projects
would no longer be supported.
11.   The two large shrimp farm schemes account for 40 percent of disbursements. They
produce export commodities and continue to be viable at present, although under strain from
high interest rates. The high cost of borrowing means that planned expansion of production to
match the large investments in factory and other infrastructure has had to be deferred. At one
scheme, some rescheduling of smallholder debt consequent to technical problems which delayed
production is required and appears feasible. At the other scheme, farmers are up to date in their
loan repayments, but the situation is not yet reflected in their accounts as the bank involved,
BDNI, has closed. The Government has agreed with the owner of BDNI's parent company that
the sub-borrower loans will be assumed by another subsidiary, PT Dipasena, which is the
nucleus processing company to whom the farmers sell their produce.
12.   The performance of the other subloans, which were the intended target group, has proved
more difficult to judge in the absence of statistics from a Management Information System.
The ICR estimates of the overall results of investment credit component is shown in Table 5 in
Part II. Subloans amounting to Rp 206 billion were accorded to 175 target group enterprises, and
804 shrimp farmers. Overall, 8 percent of these subloans were bad or overdue by more than 180
days, and a further 4 percent were overdue by 90-180 days. These are unacceptably high levels,
but the problem was caused mainly by three state banks, and two private banks with particularly
poor lending perfornance. Two other banks also performed less than acceptably and five banks



-4-
performed well. The mission's field visits confirmed the accuracy of reporting for the
subprojects visited, but it is difficult to extrapolate from this small sample, in view of the marked
differences between the performances of different banks, and given the continuing high interest
rates. But on the figures presented, given the severity of the financial crisis, the performance of
the better banks is remarkably good.
13.   Technical Assistance Component.  The first TA  subcomponent - assistance to
prospective subborrowers to prepare proposals-was dropped from the Project at the mid-term
review, in the light of a Bank Indonesia study, which concluded that entrepreneurs were willing
to employ outside experts when needed and that studies by inexperienced young graduates under
the subcomponent often lacked depth. In addition in the light of demand for credit, there was
basically no need for market stimulating measures through this subcomponent.
14.   The second sub-component-the BI MIS for term credit-was reported at the mid-term
review to have been installed, and training conducted, and BI had submitted a report to the Bank
on subloan approvals and disbursements. The appraisal objective was that the system also cover
repayments and arrears, on a monthly basis. As many if not all subloans have no grace period
for interest servicing, and some no grace period for principal repayments, the requirement for
monitoring arrears began immediately on subloan granting. The lack of payment performance
statistics at mid-term was thus not satisfactory. Subsequent supervision missions did not follow
up this matter, despite queries from departmental management, and indeed only reported some
global figures on approvals and disbursements, rather than the detailed tables which had been
appended to the earlier supervision reports. The lack of data impacts upon the quality of project
supervision, and ICR preparation.
15.   The third sub-component-assistance to the participating banks on appraisal and loan
administration procedures, and vetting subloan applications- is seen by the participating banks
as successful. The banks complain however that the appraisal procedures are unduly onerous
and much more so than for other lines of credit available to them. The assistance on loan
administration procedures was not seen by the appraisal advisor as extending to assistance on
monitoring repayments, an understandable view given the lack of attention by bank missions to
the MIS and its requirements for repayment information.
16.   The training given under the fourth subcomponent-training participating bank staff in
assessing subproject viability and risk-has generally been judged by participating banks as
effective and useful. One bank branch commented to the mission that obtaining sound financial
information from prospective clients, as required by the methodology, was often difficult, but
they have made a special effort to check and assess the client by site visits and discussions with
other knowledgeable parties. Interestingly, the same bank found that the detailed appraisal
methodology was useful rather than onerous.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
17.   As indicated earlier, both the situation of banks, and the current high level of interest
rates, make if difficult to forecast an early resumption of the type of lending fostered by the
Project. In any case, some questions must be raised as to the extent to which the Project was
fostering this type of lending, prior to the crisis, and thus assisting Indonesian small- and
medium-scale borrowers with limited access to formal credit. It was assumed that with the
introduction of AFP, and with aggressive marketing of the AFP product, particularly extending
AFP assistance beyond the traditional customers of the respective PBs, the PBs would be able to



-5-
provide term-credit to small and medium scale agricultural, fishery and agribusiness enterprises.
However, despite strong emphasis on this aspects by various supervision missions, personal
contacts between PBs staff and their clients remained the primary vehicle for information on
AFP. At best, project sustainability is uncertain. Bank Indonesia also points out that under ACT
No.23/1999, it can no longer extend credit directly to PBs from an international institution but
must work through another institution chosen by the Ministry of Finance. Bank Indonesia will
therefore have to transfer all its project-financed loans to another institution and this may affect
performance.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
18.   World Bank Performance. The project was exhaustively debated during preparation by
a department financial sector working group, and the views of specialists in the Central
Operations Department were obtained.  As noted in para. 6, the issues for successful
implementation were well known, and departmental and regional management apparently
judged, in view of the forthcoming Financial Sector Development Project, that the risks
associated with bank soundness and GOI regulatory capability were acceptable. The lack of
discussion of these as project risks in the appraisal report, and of the views of other donors on the
issue of subsidized interest, were omissions that should not have occurred.  Competing
subsidized interest rate schemes, both donor and GOI financed, caused some, but not major,
problems during implementation. One aspect of the design which challenged supervision, was
that with the deliberate decision that BI's role was bank supervision, and not an apex institution
for the project, the project had in fact 13 project managers (12 participating banks, and the
Indonesian Banking Institute).
19.   During implementation, three major areas where the World Bank performance was
important can be identified. First, World Bank supervision did not initially raise concerns about
the granting of a group of subloans to some 540 individual shrimp farmers participating in a
large development in Lampung operating under the nucleus-smallholder model. The viability of
the smallholder subloans depended upon the viability of the overall enterprise, and the
development required careful environmental assessment. Departmental management initially
focussed on whether financing small farmers under the schemes were consistent with the project
objectives, and in course, the Department satisfied itself as to the viability and environmental
issues for this and another such scheme, and agreed with Government that farmers under further
very large integrated schemes would not be considered eligible for AFP subloans.
20.   Second, warnings about the emerging bank crisis were signaled by this project. A year
before board presentation, Bank Duta had experienced difficulties, and the task manager reported
that the participating banks were worried that delay in AFP could affect confidence in the
financial sector. The task manager for the Financial Sector Development Project raised concerns
about the viability of Bapindo, one of the participating banks. It was initially decided to continue
to rely on the policy agreed with Government, that BI would notify the World Bank if any bank
participating in the project were no longer judged by BI to be sound (sehat). It was agreed
shortly after that BAPINDO would withdraw from new lending. Apparently not sufficiently
questioned were: (a) whether the agreement to rely on an initiative by BI to declare a bank no
longer sehat, rather than insisting upon an independent judgement by the World Bank or
qualified auditors outside Government, continued to reasonable; and (b) whether the warning
signal should have led to a review by the Department of the early experience in strengthening the



-6-
B3 regulatory process, upon which the decision to proceed with Agricultural Finance Project had
been based.
21.   Third, the project's MIS, including tracking of repayments, disappeared from the Bank's
radar scheme shortly after the mid-term review. A query from departmental management about
repayment performance should have triggered a new focus by the task manager on the MIS
system. However, with a change of task managers, supervision concentrated on visiting
subprojects, which had earlier been neglected, in an effort to identify any problem areas which
had not been apparent in the appraisal reports for subprojects. Both the MIS and routine project
reporting were lost sight of. This was unfortunate, as the MIS would have been a key
supervisory tool for the participating banks, for BI prudential supervisors, and for World Bank
missions.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
22.   GOI/BI/PB  Performance.  The Indonesian participants in general fulfilled their
respective roles under the Project, albeit with subloans not at the volume and quality hoped for.
In particular the performance of six participating banks, as far as the project is concerned, in
approving and supervising what have turned out to be, on the whole, viable subloans, must be
highlighted. However, as with the World Bank (para. 16), it might be argued that discussion of
the issues surrounding the large integrated shrimp farms, and later, other integrated schemes, was
initially unduly influenced by a focus on whether the projects complied with the AFP rules for
individual smallholder participants, rather than looking at the substance of the overall situation,
and assessing the overall financial and environmental risks. Nevertheless, the issues were
ultimately dealt with, and additional very large integrated schemes not permitted under the
Project. The MIS, especially repayment performance tracking, was not implemented. Issues
concerning the effectiveness of Bank Indonesia prudential supervision are not dealt with in this
review, although it may be noted that one of the AFP participating banks financed not only the
farmers associated with one of the large shrimp schemes, but also the main development, which
was undertaken by a company within the same group. This at the time may have been in
violation of BI rules, but in any case the BI supervisory process was not effective in preventing
violation of these rules. The bank concerned has now been closed by the Government, with the
inter-group lending restrictions being an issue in the closure.
23.   The overall performance by the Borrower was satisfactory. An interesting point is that
before appraisal, BAPPENAS queried the principle of the Government incurring extent debt for
passing on to private banks. The World Bank was focused on using private banks rather than
state banks, and the issue does not appear to have been considered for its own sake, rather a
compromise of half state and half private banks was agreed. The PBs considered AFP guidelines
for subloan appraisal too complicated and too detailed for the size of subloans. There were also
complaints about the inordinate delays in the disbursements of approved subloans by the
Ministry of Finance. These factors, in addition to, the deviation from following the guidelines to
offer loans to small- and medium-size enterprises, created delays in disbursements. The
Borrower managed to rectify the problems of appropriate targeting during the earlier years to
make the size and beneficiaries of the subloans fully consistent with the development objectives.
24.   The Borrower had also readily recognized the problem PBs and took appropriate actions
to remove the nonperforming PBs from the project. It also reduced or canceled allocations for
those PBs that had been inactive. However, shortages of trained staff in the branch offices of the



-7-
PBs to market and process subloans (many of the staff trained earlier under the project had
moved and/or reassigned to other jobs) and long elapsed time before the applications reach the
World Bank approval appeared to be the key constraints to faster utilization of the AFP funds.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
25.   Overall Assessment of Project Performance. Any assessment during the continuing
financial crisis must be read with caution. There is partial confirmnation of a 1997 judgement of
the World Bank's sector unit that "AFP is making an important contribution by demonstrating
the financial viability of small and medium-size loans for agricultural enterprises at market rates
of interest, and the potential for the commercial banks to play an increasing role in servicing this
emerging market." At the same time, it should be noted that the World Bank's views on the
virtues of market interest rates are not fully reflected in Indonesian policy, or the practice of
other important donors. And the present situation of very high real and nominal interest rates
does not provide a conducive climate for arguing the case that the project has demonstrated that
market rates are preferable to subsidized.
26.   Most subloans appears to have been remarkably resilient in the face of the high interest
rates engendered by the financial crisis. Subprojects with an export focus have been protected,
indeed some have clearly benefited from the massive devaluation of the rupiah. Subprojects
processing or transforming agricultural produce for the local market appear to be coping at
present, although the continuance of high interest rates may affect them. The performance of five
of the banks appears to have been satisfactory in terms of subloan quality, three banks performed
less well, while the percentage of doubtful debts and those more than ninety days overdue at four
participating banks was unacceptably high. The lending performance outcome is therefore at best
mixed.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
27.   There are not present plans for future operation of the project, in the sense of continued
lending from the PBs' own funds, or recycled repayments. While there is not an overall system
for collecting data on loan performance, the individual banks appear to have satisfactory systems
for monitoring the performance of subloans, and no additional action in this respect appears
necessary. Issues concerning BI supervision go beyond consideration of future operations arising
from AFP.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
28.   The lessons learned from this project can be grouped as those specific to the project, and
more generic lessons, some of which have already been addressed by the World Bank in recent
years. At the project specific level, matters that may need to be addressed in future similar
projects include:
* Commercial banks find it difficult to conduct economic analysis in cases where the
extent of economic distortions is difficult to establish quantitatively. A project design
relying upon case by case analyses of loans in certain subsectors or involving some
commodities should be avoided if possible.



-8-
*  The role of commercial banks in environmental screening of projects submitted to
them for financing would be better backed by a national code governing all their
lending activities, and not merely a required for subprojects receiving World Bank
assistance;
*  The degree of convergence between Government and World Bank policies, as well as
those of other donors, should not be overstated, not differences glossed over. In the
case of AFP, Government was clearly moving towards market rates, but as in many
countries, there was not a total consensus on the matter. The lesson, which may have
some relevance as Comprehensive Development Framework principles are pursued,
would be that when there is a lack of full consensus, different views should be
discussed and operational issues, if any, addressed.
* The principle of a government incurring external debt for passing on to private
interests should be specifically considered in future projects, whether in the financial
sector or otherwise, including the possibility of raising finance from other sources
avoiding the need for an effective government guarantee of private sector activities;
*  Any financial sector project should review the continuing soundness of the
institutions involved, and the performance of subloans, as critical monitoring needs to
be a centerpiece of supervision activity throughout implementation.
29.   At a more generic level, messages are:
*  For all Indonesia projects involving onlending of Bank loan funds to other agencies,
the practice has been for the Government to assume the foreign exchange risk, and
onlend in rupiah at domestic interest rates, which were assumed to cover the market
assessment of foreign exchange risk. In the light of the unforeseen massive
devaluation and its heavy cost to Government, this policy merits re-examination;
*  Project require deeper and explicit risk recognition at appraisal and continued
reassessment during implementation. (While this did not happen under AFP, Bank
practice in this regard has already changed).
*  Ratings of project progress, and likelihood of achieving development objectives, may
need to more explicitly provide for rankings against appraisal objectives. AFP
appears to have fallen into the normal trap that having recognized a major issue (in
this case the distortion of the target group), and ranking the project unsatisfactory, the
rating was too rapidly returned to satisfactory when the particular issue was resolved.
But both the volume and quality of lending compared to appraisal expectations should
have continued to be explicitly considered before assigning a satisfactory rating to the
Project, even before the crisis struck.

ICR Aide Memoire; March 12, 1999
INDONESIA: Agricultural Financing Project (Loan 3402-IND)
Implementation Completion Report Mission: March 1-12, 1999
AIDE MEMOIRE
A World Bank mission consisting of Messrs. Dennis Notley (Consultant) and Unggul Suprayitno
(RSI) undertook an implementation completion mission from March 1-12, 1999. This aide memoire was
discussed at a wrap-up meeting to chaired by Mr. Puspo Sungkowo, Deputy Director, Credit Department,
Bank Indonesia, on March 12, 1999. The mission was very gratefulfor the courtesies extended by: (a)
officials of participating banks; (b) six sub-borrowers in Lampung, Jakarta, and West Java who discussed
their experience under the Project; (c) officials of Bank Indonesia and the Ministry of Finance; and (d)
the appraisal advisor at BI who assisted the mission throughout its stay
Purpose of an Implementation Completion Report (ICR): The purpose of an ICR is to assess and
consider:
(a) the degree of achievement ofproject objectives;
(b)  prospectsfor the project's sustainability;
(c)  World Bank and borrower (GOI) performance;
(d)  the project outcome; and
(e) the plan for the project 's future operations.
This aide-memoire contains preliminary findings and judgements which are subject to refinement and
review during the course of writing the ICR, which will be submitted in due course to the Government for
comment. In addition, the Government is asked to make its own review, which will be incorporated in
full in the final ICR.
Project Objectives
1.    Policy Environment: The project objectives (para 3) were set against a backdrop of a new
environment for agriculture, entailing a changing role for the Government, geared more towards
providing support services, and intervening less in pricing, marketing, direct production and trade, while
addressing the emerging conservation needs. The agriculture sector would rely on new sources of growth
through greater diversification both horizontally (products) and vertically (services, marketing and agro-
processing). This would require unlocking the full potential of the private sector. The availability of term
credit would play an important role in tapping new sources of growth and a long-term commitment of
resources. In the financial sector major reforms in 1983 had permitted the entry of new banks,
complemented by a program to strengthen Bank Indonesia's supervisory capabilities; and further reforms
in 1990 were to markedly reduce (the appraisal report incorrectly said "eliminate") distortions created by
subsidized credit programs, and to foster further the development of the capital market. The future
agenda included strengthening the supporting infrastructure for the financial sector such as the legal
framework and prudential control and supervision. New prudential regulations including those related to
capital adequacy had been put into effect, and with the assistance of the IMF and the World Bank, efforts
were under way to strengthen BI's supervisory functions!.
2.    The World Bank objectives and strategy in the financial sector and agricultural credit included
(a) strengthening the state commercial banks (SCBs) for them to compete in the new financial
environment; and (b) promoting a sustainable flow of commercial credit to the agricultural sector to
replace the old system of subsidized directed credit. The Financial Sector Development Project (for
which Loan 3526-IND was later approved on November 12, 1992) was to reinforce GOI's efforts to



18                                   Appendix I
ICR Aide Memoire; March 12, 1999
promote an efficient, stable and sound financial sector by (a) strengthening prudential banking regulations
and BJ's bank supervision systems and staff skills; (b) further developing BI's credit information system;
and (c) strengthening the capital base of SCBs to enable them to compete in the deregulated environment.
While these measures would permit the policy environment for resource allocation to improve and the
financial system to become increasingly competitive and sophisticated, as a transitional measure the
World Bank would continue to support efficient delivery of credit to groups of borrowers whose access to
credit was constrained.
3.    Project Objectives: In support of Government's policy to eliminate subsidized credit as a means
of promoting agricultural development, the primary objectives of the proposed project were to: (a)
strengthen the capacity of participating banks (PBs) to lend on a long term basis at market rates, to private
small- and medium-scale agricultural, fishery and agribusiness enterprises; (b) improve the availability of
term credit to these enterprises during the transition period when the financial system is adjusting to the
deregulated regime; and (c) finance economic and financially viable, and environmentally sound
investments in the agriculture and agribusiness sectors.
4.    The project components were: (a) an investment credit component to finance PBs' subloans to
eligible private, small- and medium-scale investments in agriculture, livestock, fishery, forestry, and
agribusiness; and (b) a technical assistance component to provide subloan appraisal advisory and
Management Information System assistance to the PBs, staff training, and at the enterprise level,
assistance to prospective subborrowers to prepare high quality subproject proposals. During
implementation, the number of participating banks was increased, and the objectives of the technical
assistance component adjusted, as indicated in Tables I and 2.

Table 2: Technical Assistance Objectives/Components
(a) assistance to eligible prospective subborrowers to prepare proposals. This objective was dropped
after the mid-term review;
(b) assistance to participating banks: strengthening their portfolio management capabilities by BI
making available its MIS for small investment and permanent working capital credit programs, to
report daily on approvals, commitments and disbursements, and monthly on repayments and
arrears;
(c) assistance to participating banks: to train and advise on appraisal and loan administration
procedures, and to check the completeness and accuracy of subloan applications;
(d) to train participating bank staff in assessing subproject viability and risk, environmental impacts,
and requirements for mitigating possible adverse environmental effects. The cost would be borne
by the participating banks.
5.    Evaluation of Project Objectives. The project objectives were ambitious, and sustainability
dependent upon three critical factors external to the project: (a) the financial soundness of the
participating banks; (b) the related dependency upon the success of technical assistance under the
Financial Sector Development Project to strengthen BI in its role of determining and enforcing BI's
prudential banking regulations; and (c) the degree to which Government (BI/MOF) policies for the
financial sector set out above were firmly in place. The appraisal report judged that there were no major
risks, perceived at the time, that could inhibit the attainment of the project objectives. However the report
stated that uncertainties in credit demand and the participating banks' lack of familiarity with the
appraisal and administration of small agricultural subloans, might lead to slow project implementation
and loan disbursements. These risks were to be minimized by a prudent loan amount and by the selection
of participating banks with a long-term interest in developing the agricultural credit market. The benefits
of hindsight clearly bear out the error of the statement that no major risks were involved, and in fact the
external risks of bank soundness and the BI prudential regulatory function had been vigorously debated
within the World Bank during preparation. The risk paragraph should have mentioned them.
6.    The decision to proceed with the project in the face of known major risks needs to be assessed
taking into account the World Bank role to undertake innovative projects with challenging objectives.
The sequencing of AFP as a two-step onlending project, prior to successful implementation of prudential
banking regulation and enforcement by Bank Indonesia, occurred because priority was accorded to AFP
as an essential interim operation for the agricultural sector. The Agriculture Division argued strongly for
the need for AFP focussed upon agriculture and agro-industry, as it felt that banks would not readily
undertake lending for agriculture without a specialized project. The question that may now be asked is
whether this judgement to support the agriculture sector was sufficiently important to proceed in the face
of the known external risks, or whether on the information known at the time, prudence would have
dictated a delay to enable the planned objectives of the Financial Sector Development Project to bear
fruit, or an insistence on independent initial and ongoing verification of the soundness of the participating
banks.
7.    This review does not deal with how the risks grew into the financial crisis in Indonesia, which has
severely impacted upon bank viability, the exchange rate, and interest rates, but simply notes (a) the



21                                   Appendix I
ICR Aide Memoire; March 12, 1999
project did not contribute to the crisis; and (b) the ongoing high interest rates and bank weaknesses may,
particularly if they persist, cause problems for project sustainability.
Implementation Experience and Results
8.    At the time of writing this aide-memoire, the Government's decisions on capital restructuring of
banks, and the closure of some banks, was awaited. When available, the results of the decisions at they
affect the banks participating in this project will be incorporated into the ICR. At present, the situation is
that two banks were forced to withdraw from new lending under the project during implementation
(Bapindo and Pan Indonesian Bank). Bapindo and Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia are to be merged, along
with two other state banks, into Bank Mandiri. Bank Central Asia, Bank Danamon and Bank Tiara have
been taken over by the Government, and Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia has failed and been closed,
and its affairs are being handled by the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency. As a result of the
uncertain situation for the participating banks, the loan was not extended beyond its original closing date
of December 31, 1998. In total $38.8 million, or 37 percent of the original loan of $106.1 million was
cancelled.
9.    Investment Credit Component. The project was to finance about 350 enterprises having
operating assets of not more than $500,000, with a maximum subloan limit of $525,000. A major issue
arose during implementation with the World Bank considering that the granting of loans to small shrimp
farners within very large-scale integrated developments was contrary to the spirit and essence of the
project objectives for promoting small and medium enterprises. After discussion it was agreed that small
subloans associated with such very large scale projects would no longer be supported. The overall results
of investment credit component is shown in Table 3.

Note: Severe exchange rate fluctuations during 1998, mean that the extent of achievement against appraisal is understated, due to
exchange savings realized between subloan and WB loan disbursements.
10.    The two large shrimp farm schemes account for 40 percent of disbursements. They produce
export commodities and continue to be viable at present, although under strain from high interest rates.
The high cost of borrowing means that planned expansion of production to match the large investments in
factory and other infrastructure has had to be deferred. At one scheme, some rescheduling of smallholder
debt consequent to technical problems which delayed production is required and appears feasible. At the
other scheme, farmers are up to date in their loan repayments, but the situation is not yet reflected in their
accounts as the bank involved, BDNI, which has closed. The Government has agreed with the owner of
BDNI's parent company that the sub-borrower loans will be assumed by another subsidiary, PT Dipasena
which is the nucleus processing company to whom the farmers sell their produce.
11.   The performance of the other small loans, which were the intended target group, has proved more
difficult to judge in the absence of statistics from a Management Information System. However, the
maximum percentage of doubtful loans has been calculated by comparing the original amounts of the
loans in the doubtful/bad categories against the total loans granted. The resultant figure, 16 percent,
overstates the extent of bad loans as far as principal repayments are concerned. Interestingly, the problem
is particularly acute at only four of the ten banks who participated in the project. Four banks are currently
recording no doubtful debts, and two others have relatively low levels. The mission's field visits
confirmed the accuracy of reporting for the subprojects visited, but it is difficult to extrapolate from this
small sample, in view of the marked differences between the performances of different banks, and given
the continuing high interest rates. But on the figures presented, given the severity of the financial crisis,
the performance of the better banks is remarkably good.
12.    Technical Assistance Component. The first TA sub-component - assistance to prospective sub-
borrowers to prepare proposals - was dropped from the Project at the mid-term review, in the light of a
Bank Indonesia study, which concluded that entrepreneurs were willing to employ outside experts when



23                                 Appendix I
ICR Aide Memoire; March 12, 1999
needed and that studies by inexperienced young graduates under the sub-component often lacked depth.
In addition in the light of demand for credit, there was basically no need for market stimulating measures
through this sub-component.
13.   The second sub-component - the BI MIS for tern credit - was reported at the mid-term review to
have been installed, and training conducted, and BI had submitted a report to the Bank on subloan
approvals and disbursements. The appraisal objective was that the system also cover repayments and
arrears, on a monthly basis. As many if not all subloans have no grace period for interest servicing, and
some no grace period for principal repayments, the requirement for monitoring arrears began immediately
on subloan granting. The lack of payment performance statistics at mid-term was thus not satisfactory.
Subsequent supervision missions did not follow up this matter, despite queries from departmental
management, and indeed only reported some global figures on approvals and disbursements, rather than
the detailed tables which had been appended to the earlier supervision reports. The lack of data impacts
upon the quality of project supervision, and ICR preparation.
14.   The third sub-component - assistance to the participating banks on appraisal and loan
administration procedures, and vetting subloan applications - is seen by the participating banks as
successful. The banks complain however that the appraisal procedures are unduly onerous and much
more so than for other lines of credit available to them. The assistance on loan administration procedures
was not seen by the appraisal advisor as extending to assistance on monitoring repayments, an
understandable view given the lack of attention by bank missions to the MIS and its requirements for
repayment information.
15.   The training given under the fourth subcomponent - training participating bank staff in assessing
subproject viability and risk - has generally been judged by participating banks as effective and useful.
One bank branch commented to the mission that obtaining sound financial information from prospective
clients, as required by the methodology, was often difficult, but they have made a special effort to check
and assess the client by site visits and discussions with other knowledgeable parties. Interestingly, the
same bank found that the detailed appraisal methodology was useful rather than onerous.

overdues up to 6 months. As the amounts involved relate to the original loan amounts, this overstates the doubtful figure. More
accurate data is to be sought.
16.   Key factors affecting achievement of major objectives. The principal factor affecting
achievement of the project's first objective - strengthening the capacity of participating banks to lend on a
long term basis at market rates, to private small- and medium-scale agricultural, fishery and agribusiness
enterprises - has been the severe financial crisis which has been ongoing since early 1998, arising from
which the continued existence of many banks is about to be determined. The principal factor affecting the
availability of term credit to these enterprises was, in the view of most participating banks, unduly
onerous subproject appraisal and approval requirements. The ICR will comment on this. The principal
factor affecting the financing of economically and financially viable, and environmentally sound
investments has been, since the crisis commenced, the very high interest rates which have dried up
demand.

ICR Aide Memoire; March 12, 1999
17.   World Bank Performance. The project was exhaustively debated during preparation by a
department financial sector working group, and the views of specialists in the Central Operations
Department were obtained. As noted in para. 6, the issues for successful implementation were well
known, and departmental and regional management apparently judged, in view of the forthcoming
Financial Sector Development Project, that the risks associated with bank soundness and GOI regulatory
capability were acceptable. The lack of discussion of these as project risks in the appraisal report, and of
the views of other donors on the issue of subsidized interest, were omissions that should not have
occurred. Competing subsidized interest rate schemes, both donor and GOI financed, caused some, but
not major, problems during implementation. One aspect of the design which challenged supervision, was
that with the deliberate decision that BI's role was bank supervision, and not an apex institution for the
project, the project had in fact 13 project managers (12 participating banks, and the Indonesian Banking
Institute).
18.   During implementation, three major areas where the World Bank performance was important can
be identified. First, World Bank supervision did not initially raise concerns about the granting of a group
of subloans to some 540 individual shrimp farmers participating in a large development in Lampung
operating under the nucleus-smallholder model. The viability of the smallholder subloans depended upon
the viability of the overall enterprise, and the development required careful environmental assessment.
Departmental management initially focussed on whether financing small farmers under the schemes were
consistent with the project objectives, and in course, the Department satisfied itself as to the viability and
environmental issues for this and another such scheme, and agreed with Government that farmers under
further very large integrated schemes would not be considered eligible for AFP subloans.
19.   Second, warning about the emerging bank crisis were signaled by this project. A year before
board presentation, Bank Duta had experienced difficulties, and the task manager reported that the
participating banks were worried that delay in AFP could affect confidence in the financial sector. The
task manager for the Financial Sector Development Project raised concerns about the viability of
Bapindo, one of the participating banks. It was initially decided to continue to rely on the policy agreed
with Government, that BI would notify the World Bank if any bank participating in the project were no
longer judged by BI to be sound (sehat). It was agreed shortly after that Bapindo would withdraw from
new lending. Apparently not sufficiently questioned were: (a) whether the agreement to rely on an
initiative by BI to declare a bank no longer sehat, rather than insisting upon an independent judgement by
the World Bank or qualified auditors outside Government, continued to reasonable; and (b) whether the
warning signal should have led to a review by the Department of the early experience in strengthening the
BI regulatory process, upon which the decision to proceed with Agricultural Finance Project had been
based.
20.    Third, the project's MIS, including tracking of repayments, disappeared from the Bank's radar
scheme shortly after the mid-term review. A query from departmental management about repayment
performance should have triggered a new focus by the task manager on the MIS system. However, with a
change of task managers, supervision concentrated on visiting subprojects, which had earlier been
neglected, in an effort to identify any problem areas which had not been apparent in the appraisal reports
for subprojects. Both the MIS and routine project reporting were lost sight of. This was unfortunate, as
the MIS would have been a key supervisory tool for the participating banks, for BI prudential supervisors,
and for World Bank missions.
21.    GOBI/PB Performance. The Indonesian participants in general fulfilled their respective roles
under the Project, albeit with subloans not at the volume hoped for. In particular the performance of six
participating banks, as far as the project is concerned, in approving and supervising what have turned out
to be, on the whole, viable subloans, must be highlighted. However, as with the World Bank (para. 16), it
might be argued that discussion of the issues surrounding the large integrated shrimp farms, and later,



27                                   Appendix I
ICR Aide Memoire; March 12, 1999
other integrated schemes, was initially unduly influenced by a focus on whether the projects complied
with the AFP rules for individual smallholder participants, rather than looking at the substance of the
overall situation, and assessing the overall financial and environmental risks. Nevertheless, the issues
were ultimately dealt with, and additional very large integrated schemes not permitted under the Project.
The MIS, especially repayment performance tracking, was not implemented. Issues concerning the
effectiveness of Bank Indonesia prudential supervision are not dealt with in this review, although it may
be noted that one of the AFP participating banks financed not only the farmers associated with one of the
large shrimp schemes, but also the main development, which was undertaken by a company within the
same group. This at the time may have been in violation of BI rules, but in any case the BI supervisory
process was not effective in preventing violation of these rules. The bank concerned has now been closed
by the Government, with the inter-group lending restrictions being an issue in the closure.
22.    Overall Assessment of Project Performance. Any assessment during the continuing financial
crisis must be read with caution. An overall assessment will be added to the ICR once all the data
received or to be received from the participating banks has been fully analyzed. At this stage, the
evidence from reports by the participating banks, and field visits, points to partial confirmation of a 1997
judgement of the World Bank's agriculture division that "we believe that AFP is making an important
contribution by demonstrating the financial viability of small and medium-size loans for agricultural
enterprises at market rates of interest, and the potential for the commercial banks to play an increasing
role in servicing this emerging market." Most subloans appears to have been remarkably resilient in the
face of the high real and nominal interest rates engendered by the financial crisis. Subprojects with an
export focus have been protected, indeed some have clearly benefited from the massive devaluation of the
rupiah. Subprojects processing or transforming agricultural produce for the local market appear to be
coping at present, although the continuance of high interest rates may affect them. Even one innovative
subproject (in cooperation with a research institution) which unfortunately failed, nevertheless paid its
loan in full, demonstrating prudent banking collateral practice. Nonetheless, the percentage of doubtful
debts at four participating banks was, on interim figures, unacceptably high.
23.   The ICR will include a judgement as to whether the project overall was satisfactory or
unsatisfactory. The very real demonstration of how some banks unaccustomed to lending in the
agricultural and agro-industrial sectors have been able to do sound business at market interest rates, with
subprojects producing a real development impact, may be the project's most lasting impact. It provides a
practical demonstration of the arguments for resuming unsubsidized term lending, as the financial crisis
passes. A second judgement is that the project is not responsible for, nor contribute in any substantial
way to the financial crisis, nor to the difficulties of any of the participating banks. Nevertheless these
external factors may make it difficult to rank the project overall as satisfactory.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
24.   To be discussed.

Actions to be agreed in order to address issues for continued operations, and to finalize the ICR
25.   The Ministry of Finance had told the mission that some participating banks were, in the current
situation, having difficulties in meeting the required payments on the loans from MOF passing World
Bank funds to them. For example, the failed BDNI was under the control of the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency and no payments were being made. Would the World Bank find it acceptable for
the terms or interest rates on these loans to be softened? The mission indicated that the World Bank was
likely to regard such difficulties as part of the overall situation of economic, bank viability and
capitalization which was being handled on an overall, rather than a piecemeal basis. The situation could
arise also for two-step loans to bodies outside the financial sector. The mission would find it helpful to
have an indication of the amounts by which any participating bank is in arrears on payments of principle
and interest on these loans, as a factual matter to be recorded in the ICR.
26.   A related matter raised by many of the participating banks was whether the interest rate on the
loans they receive from the Ministry of Finance could be reduced (the PBs pay the Bank Indonesia
Certificate (SBI) rate, adjusted each July I and January 1). No change has yet been made as of January 1,
1999. The mission considered that the World Bank would be reluctant to consider such a matter as a
special case outside the overall approach to bank viability issues. To the extent that the concern is with
high interest rates to the end-users, the banks are able to reschedule loans as they consider appropriate
without seeking World Bank approval.

Borrower's Contribution to ICR
INDONESIA: Agricultural Financing Project (IBRD Loan No. 3402-IND)
Implementation Completion Report
The Agricultural Financing Project (AFP) implementation period covers the
period March 27, 1992 to November 25, 1998. As the financial crisis, which hit
Indonesia in August 1997, worsened during the beginning of 1998, the World Bank
decided to stop authorizing subloans submitted by the participating banks with effect from
April 1998.
This report state the opinions of Bank Indonesia based on information from the
participating banks and some of their clients, who have been granted AFP subloans.
Information given by IBI and the AFP appraisal adviser related to the technical
assistance provided by AFP to the participating banks has also been taken into
consideration. This report provides inputs to the World Bank Mission charged with the
tasks of writing the final ICR for AFP.
I. Agricultural Credit Supply
Recent agriculture development:  GOI agriculture policies during project
implementation period has been to promote modem  agribusiness enterprises  by
supporting production of agriculture and agroindustry products of high value as well as
maintaining food self sufficiency by increasing production of staple crops. The increased
agricultural production of food and agrobased rawmaterials are processed and marketed
by a wide range of modem agroindustrial firms. Marketing of processed agriculture
products is undertaken by specialized marketing agents both for the domestic and export
markets.
Agricultural firms engaged in production, processing and marketing of locally
produced rawmaterial have been able to withstand the economic crisis. Some of the
agribusiness sectors, which export part of their production, have increased their rupiah
incomes substantially due to the drastic devaluation of rupiah during 1998. The animal
husbandry sectors like poultry and cattle fattening enterprises have been hard hit by the
crisis as their import content is high.
Indonesia is in a favorable position to continue modernize its wide range of
agricultural and agroindustrial firms. The local business community are becoming
increasingly aware of the economic benefits and the vast potential for modem
agribusiness development. When the economic and political situation stabilize more
foreign investors will also be attracted to the agribusiness sectors.
Financial sector support to agribusiness: The financial sector deregulation
process which started in 1983, continued during 1988, 1990 and 1991 with a broad range
deregulatory reforms. The 1988 reform (PAKTO) made it easy for the commercial banks
to open new branch offices as well as to establish new banks and financial firms by local
investors and joint venture companies.  The 1990 regulations (PAKJAN) aimed at
reducing the supply of subsidized credit and to create conditions, which enabled the banks
finance their clients need for credit with sustainable market based interest rates.
Subsidized credit continued to support small enterprises and smallholders as well as their
primary cooperatives with limited amounts. Credit supply to medium and big enterprises
was financed with commercial banks' funds at market rates in the range of 16 to 24

percent during the period April 1992 to June 1997. Bank regulations issued by Bank
Indonesia during 1991 introduced the BIS prudent banking regulations and enhanced the
role of bank supervision in order to promote a sound and efficient banking system.
Credit supply to the agriculture and agro industry sectors: The outstanding
credit balance in the commercial banks increased with an annual average of 22 % during
the four year period April 1992 to March 1997, i.e. the period before the financial crisis.
The increase was partly financed with offshore funds, thereby increasing the nominal
value of the credit balance by 60 % during the period April 1997 to December 1998,
when some of the foreign exchange loans were converted to rupiah. At the start of the
period banks were reluctant to grant credit due to a tight monetary policy regime with
high interest rates. These policies were relaxed in 1993 with the issuing of Depository
Certificates by money market institutions and by Bank Indonesia (SBPU and SBI).
The annual outstanding agriculture credit balance in the commercial banks
increased by 13,5 % whereas credit to the agroindustries increased by 17 %, during the
period leading up to the crisis. Credit to agriculture and agroindustries amounted to 20 %
of total outstanding bank credit three months before the crisis started, and it increased to
25 % of the total outstanding credit at the end of 1998.

II. Achievement of Project Objectives
The objectives of APF were to:



31                               Appendix 2
Borrower's Contribution to ICR
I. strengthen the capacity of the participating banks to grant term credit at market rates
to private agribusiness SME,
2. improve availability of term credit to the above target enterprises during a transition
period, when the financial sector was adjusting to a deregulated policy regime,
3. finance   economically  and   financially viable and environmentally sound
investments
in the agriculture and agribusiness sectors.
Project implementation: AFP had two components, the first one was the
financial assistance provided by the World Bank to GOI through an investment loan of
$ 105 million. The second project component was provision of technical assistance to the
participating banks and their eligible clients.
To improve availability of term credit through AFP investment loan: The
project was expected to finance 350 mediumsize enterprises having operating assets of
not more than $ 500,000 with a maximum subloan limit of $ 525,000. The investment
loan was onlent by six participating banks during the period April 1992 to June 1995. As
the selected banks were slow in disbursing subloans to their clients, six more private
banks were selected early 1994. Their onlending agreements with Bank Indonesia became
effective on June 1, 1995. The World Bank approved 1,569 subloans from 191 projects
with a World Bank share of USD 82,649,142. The participating banks withdrew USD
68,294,211.33 or 65.04 % the AFP investment loan. Three of the approved projects were
for large-scale integrated agribusiness projects, i.e. two shrimp pond projects in Lampung
with 795 subloans and an oil-palm estate in South Sumatra with 600 subloans.
The AFP credit component made term credit available to targeted enterprises of
the 12 selected participating banks. Only four of the PBs were able to almost fully utilize
their allocated AFP funds. One of the PB was forced to withdraw from AFP in 1993 and
another four PBs withdrew voluntarily from AFP during 1995-1997, as they had
problems finding clients, which were eligible for AFP financing.
Bank Indonesia considered AFP to be a slow moving project without serious
participation by most the selected banks. The reasons given by some of the PBs for
withdrawing from the project were as follows;
a) agriculture and agribusiness lending is a new activity with few eligible clients,
b) the AFP loans regulations were too complicated and too detailed for the size of the
subloans,
c) the terms and conditions of the AFP were not sufficiently favorable to the banks
compared with other similar loans and offshore fund obtainable to the banks before
June 1997,
d) the banks have limited human resources, and they concentrated the use of their credit
officers to analyze projects with simpler loan regulations (ADB, JEXIM, KKPA etc.),
e) the loan processing and loan disbursement period was long, and the banks had to
finance their clients project with bridging loans for long periods.
The following extemal factors also contributed to the slow processing and
disbursement of AFP subloans;
a) the small number of PBs during April 1992 to June 1995,
b) a period without a project appraisal adviser from October 1993 to July 1994,
c) the cumbersome and long-lasting loan processing procedure during the period up to
the midterm review, when many clients had to prepare project feasibility studies in
cooperation with local consultant,                                          1



32                               Appendix 2
Borrower's Contribution to ICR
d) the general conditions in the banking system, i.e.:
- a tight monetary policy from 1992 to 1993,
- easy access to relatively inexpensive funds from 1995 to June 1997,
- the credit crunch and the negative spread, which hit the banks from the start of
1998.
To strengthen the PBs capacity by providing technical assistance had the
following components;
a)    Assistance from SMIEP TAU and BI SEPD Consultants to the PB clients was
provided during the period April 1992 to March 1994, when this type of assistance came
to an halt based upon a decision by the World Bank with Bank Indonesia support. The
SMIEP TAU and the SMIEP SEDP consultants assisted eligible AFP enterprises to have
their project proposals prepared as feasibility studies by private consultants. The WB
project officer considered this type assistance not to be efficient partly due to the fact that
it did not guarantee that the enterprises would be granted subloans based upon the
information contained in the FS.
b)    BI shall make its MIS available to the PBs in order to strengthen their portfolio
management capacity and to provide monthly up-to-date statistics on the AFP loan
portfolios in all PBs. Bank Indonesia's monthly credit reporting system (for SME credit)
was developed during 1992. The system do not provide complete and accurate
information, and it is now being replaced by a modem, complete, on-time computerized
credit reporting system, which is being installed in BI Head-office and all BI branch
offices (BISAK, Bank Indonesia Sistem Administrasi Kredit). This new system comply
with the requirements given by the World Bank for credit reporting on AFP.
BI engaged private consultants to develop a MIS for all the SME credit programs
managed by BI during 1992. This MIS has been developed, and it works in accordance
with the specifications given to the consultants, i.e. it provides information on monthly
loan approvals, outstanding loan balances, monthly repayments and various types of
arrears for each of the credit programs. However, the MIS is not on-line with BI's
monthly credit reporting system. The MIS require that all the participating banks submit
required information on a monthly basis to BI Credit Division. BI has not enforced the
banks to do so on a monthly basis, and the system has not been properly implemented.
c)    Training and assistance to PB staff on loan appraisal and administration
procedures and environmental impacts. The above assistance has been carried out
partly by SMIEP TAU, and partly by the AFP Appraisal Adviser office in cooperation
with three State Universities. IBI hosted the AFP TA units until the end of March 1996.
Since April 1996 the AFP AA has working from CPMU- PUJK, Bank Indonesia.
The AFP and SMIEP TAU arranged a three day course for 50 participants from
banks, KADIN and private consultants in Medan during 1993. The AFP AA office
arranged three similar programs for a total of 99 participants during 1994 in cooperation
with three State Universities. A final five day course for 28 PB staff undertaken by the
AFP AA in cooperation with IBI during April 1996. In addition to the 177 participants
trained during PB staff training programs many more participants have been informned
about AFP, whenever the AA and his staff have visited PB branch offices or met with
entrepreneurs applying for AFP finance. The PB staff have been trained in identifying and
appraising project proposal in line with all technical requirements relating to AFP.
Information regarding environmental impact assessment and environmental regulations
have been given by qualified staff from the State Universities. The training has not
covered loan administration procedures. However, Bl has ascertained itself that each of



33                             Appendix 2
Borrower's Contribution to ICR
the PBs have complete computerized systems for loan recording, and BI has seen that the
banks' credit files and credit records for AFP are complete. The PBs seem to be
reasonably satisfied with the TA provided under AFP.
To finance economically and financially viable and environmentally sound
mediumsize enterprises in the agricultural and agroindustry subsectors. The most recent
status of the outstanding AFP subloans balances in each of the PB covers the period up to
the end of 1998. Based on these figures it can be seen that around 90 % of the
outstanding credit are classified in category 1 "PASS" and category 2 "SPECIAL
MENTION". The remaining 10 % is largely substandard and doubtful credit with a loss
potential of less than 50 % . Bearing in mind that the financial crisis has had negative
impacts on several of the projects financed under AFP, some of the loss exposed
subloans have been granted to companies, which are marketing their products in the
domestic market. One exception are the doubtful debts reported by Bank Exim. Most of
subloans granted by Bank Exim were for mediumsize estate enterprises, mostly oil-palm
estates. Some of these companies will increase their production this year and next year,
and they will hopefully be in a position to repay their debt in accordance with new,
rescheduled loan repayment plans.
III. Comments on points raised in the AFC ICR Mission: March 1-12, 1999
DRAFT AIDE MEMOIRE
The three risk factors mentioned in the draft aide memoire, i.e. the financial
soundness of the commercial banks, the quality of bank supervision and sound financial
sector policies are relevant risk factors judged by what has happened to the banks after
the onset of the financial crisis. Although the World Bank was aware of the Indonesian
banking sector shortcomings and the need to upgrade Bank Indonesia's bank supervision
division, BI maintain that it was right to launch AFP during 1992. At that time banks
were reluctant to grant credit due to the tight monetary policy regime being implemented.
Bank supervision was also gradually being improved partly through the implementation
of new prudent banking regulations, and partly through the technical assistance provided
by the Financial Sector Development Project (IBRD Loan No. 3526-IND). The third risk
factor, GOI financial sector policies also covers the money market and financial
institutions outside the supervision of Bank Indonesia. These policies were gradually
being improved during the AFP implementation period. BI will not comment on how
each of the three risk factors contributed to the financial crisis, which is outside the scope
of this report. The general conditions in the banking sector were relatively stable during
the period 1992 to 1996, even if it was clear to BI, that some of the big commercial banks
expanded their operations partly financed with foreign exchange borrowings. The risk of
foreign exchange borrowings was thought to be reasonably covered by not allowing
foreign liabilities to exceed foreign assets by more than 15 %. Neither Bank Indonesia nor
the World Bank could foresee the panic caused by withdrawal foreign funds from
Indonesia at the start of the crisis, and the drastic devaluation of Indonesian Rupiah,
which at the bottom of the financial crisis reached Rp 15,000 to the dollar.
Implementation Experience and Results: The financial crisis has caused Bank
Indonesia to close one of the participating banks (BDNI). Four other PBs have been taken
over by the Government (BCA, Danamon, Bank Tiara and Bank Tamara). Two private
banks will be recapitalized with GOT providing 80 % of their required equity (Bank Bali
and Bank Niaga). All the three participating State Comnmercial Banks will be



34                               Appendix 2
Borrower's Contribution to ICR
recapitalized, however Bapindo and Bank Exim will be merged together with two other
state banks. Only two remaining private banks Bank Buana and Panin Bank are
categorized as A banks, meaning that their equity share exceed four percent. It is hoped
that the bank restructuring and bank recapitalization program will succeed, but this very
much hinge upon what happens to the interest rates during the coming months. AFP
subloan disbursement and loan performance have been commented upon under Part II of
this report and need no further comments.
The financial crisis has also affected Bank Indonesia. The House of
Representatives (DPR) has decided to reorganize BI's bank supervision and credit
division. Both these division will be reorganized outside Bank Indonesia, starting next
year. It is presumed that these structural changes will lead to more efficient organizations.
Bank Indonesia agrees with draft aide memoire conclusion that the AFP did not
contribute to the crisis and that high persistent interest rates may cause problems for the
project sustainability.
The three large-scale integrated projects partly financed by AFP continue to be
viable. All relevant project related assessments were made before the loans were
approved by the World Bank. With the on-going reformation process BI has become
aware of problems related to land ownership for oilpalm project on the island of Bangka.
Bank Indonesia has for a long period supported integrated projects financially by
providing subsidized term credit to finance the smallholder enterprises taking part in such
projects. With assistance of the World Bank successful integrated projects should be
analyzed and guidelines for implementing integrated projects should be developed. The
development impacts of successful integrated projects are more farreaching and
prolonged compared with other concepts for developing smallscale, traditional
enterprises.
Technical Assistance Component: Each of the sub-components have been
commented upon Part II of this report. Bank Indonesia appreciate the usefulness of the
technical assistance and the procedures for appraising AFP subloans. It can be seen that
the PBs, which have taken a serious approach towards implementing AFP have succeeded
in selecting and financing economic and financially viable, and environmentally sound
enterprises in the agriculture and agribusiness sectors.

Draft Implementation Completion Report (1CR)
in reply to your leatr dated June 8, 1999 conceniing the above nientiorted, we
herewith would like to give sonie commenis, as follows:
i. 9-asically we have -lo objection regarding the contents of the ICR, including your
conclusion in ptra I Ipage -vi- that the project oiacome rtiks as itassfacto1y.
2  Based on the Act No.23/1999 of Bank Indonesia released on the 17i' of May. the
Central Bank can no longer extend credit, including two step loans (TSL) from
internaTionsl institution soturce. In this case Beank Issdonesia has to transferred all of
its TSL sctemes to another histitUtion chosen by the Government/linistry of
Finance. Plesse note that the transfer of a TSL has to be discussed by MOF and the
Icndcr. We believe that this new regulation may inmpact the Pfogram in the future. so
please. state clearly in thle ICR.
3. Another miror inforntation. need to be corrected is Bank Indonesia-s fiscal year,
Before the niew Act, the fiscal year is 1 April - 3 I March and after the new Acr is 1
January - 31 December.
With besi regards
'Yours faithfully |
