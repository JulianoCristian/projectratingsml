INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
ELECTRICITY GENERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND WITH
THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND FOR THE
BAN CHAO NEN HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT.
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) with the
guarantee of the Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent of US$75 million
to help finance part of the first phase of the Ban Chao Nen Hydro-Electric
project. The loan would have a term of 26 years, including six years of
grace, with interest at 7 1/4% per annum. The Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund of Japan (OECF) intends to lend EGAT about Yen 11,600 million 1/ for
another part of the first phase of this project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
1.        An economic mission visited Thailand in September 1972.   Its
report, entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Thailand",
was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 9, 1973 (R73-40 and
R73-41). The report updated the basic economic report which was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on January 18, 1972 (R72-12). Another
economic mission visited Thailand in January and February 1974, and its
preliminary conclusions are incorporated below. The full report will be
distributed to the Executive Directors in May. Country Data Sheets are
attached .s Annex I.
A Time of Change
2.        The sudden relinquishment of power by Prime Minister Field
Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn and Deputy Prime Minister Field Marshal
Prapas Charusathien in the face of massive student-led demonstrations in
Bangkok in October 1973, has opened the way for important political,
social and economic change in Thailand. Some changes have already occured
and others will occur when the constitution that is now being considered
and given final shape by a National Legislative Assembly is enacted.
After more than a quarter of a century of military-dominated rule, inter-
rupted by two brief periods of limited democracy, the Thai nation is now
seeking to make a transition to a more open, participative political system.
A measure of uncertainty is inevitable in such a period, but Thailand is
favored with a homogeneous society, a well-developed national identity
and traditional social values which constitute sources of stability in times
of change.
1/   Equivalent to about $41 million in February 1974.



- 2 -
3.        The issue on which the October uprising focused was a political
one: the demand for a democratic constitution. But other pressures
were at work: discontent with immediate economic conditions (after two
decades of growth without inflation, the growth rate had dropped in
1970-72 and its recovery in 1973 was accompanied by an inflation which
was felt keenly by urban consumers); popular disenchantment with some
of the military leaders; and a growing view among the politically conscious
that the political and administrative superstructure should be changed
to reflect a changed society.
4.        The Government that took office in October 1973, led by Dr.
Sanya Dhammasakdi, a university rector and member of the King's Privy
Council, is pledged to enact a new constitution and then hold a genieral
election in the second half of 1974. Since it came to power neither
through election nor by force of arms and has no base in a political party,
the Government depends for its stability firstly on the authority conferred
upon it by the King, who selected the Prime Minister, and secondly on the
support of the public, which has welcomed the government's announced intention
to introduce a new popularly-based constitution as soon as possible. After
an initial period of turbulence in which increased activism on the part of
labor and students caused some alarmi, the basic cohesion and restraint
of Thai society are reasserting themselves and it is generally believed
that the present government will successfully hand over power to an
elected government later this year.
5.        The new political situation has already had an impact on some
major decisions concerning resource allocation. The monopoly on fertilizer
production and import which had maintained fertilizer prices at an artifi-
cially high level, has been abolishel, and some major investment proposals
of whose economic justification the public was skeptical have been dropped,
in one case largely as a result of a campaign by student groups and
newspapers.
Growth with Inflation
6.        While the country is having to contend with the unfamiliar
problem of inflation (in 1973, the GDP deflator rose by 8% and the con-
sumer price index by 12%), it is enjoying dramatic gains in the levels of
demand and prices in international markets for its commodity exports, rice,
rubber, tin, maize and sugar; this is in marked contrast to the situation
which existed in 1970 and 1971. Between the end of 1971 and the middle
of 1973, the prices of Thailand's exports rose by 61%, their volume grew b
24%, and the nation's terms of trade improved by 38%. Consequently the
value of exports of goods and services increased by 24% in 1972 and
32% in 1973. This export growth has strongly stimulated aggregate demand;
private investment grew by 11% in 1973 but is believed to have levelled
off since October because investors feel they should act cautiously in the
face of recent political and social change. The expansion of real GDP was
9% in 1973, after a drop in agricultural production due to drought had
brought it down to 3% in 1972.



7.        Domestic prices for agricultural commodities have not been pre-
vented from rising along with export prices: since the end of 1971
the average wholesale price of agricultural commodities has risen by 50%,
the wholesale prices of paddy and maize by about 100% and of rubber by 150%.
By comparison, the non-food component of the consumer price index increased
by only 16%. In the last two years, this inflation has produced real income
gains outside Bangkok of between one quarter and one half, depending on the
region. While much of the initial profit may have accrued to middle men,
farmers have been gaining substantially also. In the next few years, the
question will arise whether the gains of the less-developed regions in
general and farmers in particular can be maintained.
Monetary and Fiscal Management and Development Planning
8.        The primary response of Government to the new inflationary
situation has been to restrain the growth of its expenditure. In 1973,
total public expenditures declined in real terms by 2% and dropped as a
percentage of GNP from 21.9% to 19.8%. The FY 1974 budget is likely to
maintain téae public sector's share of GDP. Since the share of capital as
opposed to current expenditures in this amount has declined the question
arises whether the Government is providing adequately for public needs.
Tax measures taken since October coupled with a degree of inflationary
buoyancy are likely to reverse the decline in revenues as a share of GNP
but the public sector's fiscal deficit will probably remain as large as in
1973. Domestic savings have maintained their high level. Money and quasi-money
increased by 26% in 1973 as the Bank of Thailand allowed the banking
system to accommodate the price increases originating abroad with a 35%
increase in Bank credit to the private sector.
9.        Development planning suffered during the last two years
because a decline in the influence of the National Economic and Social
Development Board resulted in resource allocations being made on an
ad hoc basis. The recent appointment of a new Secretary-General of the
Board may help to reverse this decline.
10.       The two regional planning studies which have so far been issued,
for the Northeast and North, have not yet had the impact on the economy
which had been hoped for, largely because they have not been translated
into programs and projects. A third study now underway for the South looks
promising; the study team is highly competent and for the first time
steps are being taken to involve operating departments in the consideration
and preparation of specific projects.
The Outlook for the Near Term
11.       There are no supply constraints to prevent Thailand from achiev-
ing 6-8% growth in 1974 and 1975. On the demand side, export markets
should continue to be favorable and consumption demand should respond to
the recent sharp increases in income. Industrial labor is likely to con-
tinue to promote its interests more actively than was the case before 1973,



- 4 -
but no repetition is expected of the extreme activism which followed the
events of October. Cost-push inflation will be present throughout 1974,
with import prices continuing their upward trend.
12.       A question of major importance for the economy in the near term
is the character of the government which will be formed after the elections
later this year. The constitutional debate has been characterized by both
frankness and moderation. There is little to indicate that a government
formed in the near future would depart radically from the economic policies
which have been pursued in recent years, but in an elected parliament
strong expression would be given to the needs of the outlying regions and
this would to some extent counterbalance the influence of Bangkok, of whose
political weight the events of October were a dramatic reminder.
13.       The newly-demonstrated activism of the press, students and
industrial labor is probably reducing the element of paternalism which has
characterized relations between government and people, and employer and
employee.  A test of the skill of the nation's constitution makers andl
political leaders will be whether the institutions they devise and the
policies they formulate can realize the potential benefits of this
activism, e.g. a greater display of economic and social initiative on
the part of individuals and groups, more equal income distribution and
a wider sense of ownership of the economic and political process.    Providing
elections are not delayed too long, private investors are likely to regain
confidence in the course of this year.
Outlook for the Longer Term
14.       The present high population growth rate will create serious
long-term problems in Thailand. The announced goal of the Government's
population policy is to bring the growth rate down to 2.5% by 1976. Birth
control is readily accepted by the population but the Government's pro-
gram is too limited to make feasible even this modest goal. Indeed, there
is no evidence as yet that the birth rate has started to decline: the
population and the labor force continue to grow by 3% per year as they
have done throughout the last decade. In the past, agriculture has been
able to absorb most of the new entrants to the labor force, simply
through extension of the area under cultivation. However, the supply of
new land suitable for cultivation wilL probably be exhausted before the
end of the 1970s and thereafter employnment will have to be created by
increasing the intensity of land use and by transferring larger numbers
to employment in sectors other than agriculture - a much more difficult
and expensive proposition.
15.       Another task relating directly to the rural population which
awaits the Government's attention is the provision of health care in the
countryside. Efforts in this field have been very meagre so far, and
traditional healers remain virtually the only source of medical care
for most country people.



- 5 -
16.       While laissez-faire economic policies have allowed considerable
economic decentralization in Thailand, relations between central and local
government authorities have been characterized by a very high degreee of
centralization. If the regions outside Bangkok are to realize their
full economic and social potential, it will be necessary to strengthen
local administrations and give them greater opportunities to mobilize
local resources and initiative.
Balance of Payments and External Borrowing Program
17.       The recent growth of exports has resulted in a progressive
reduction of the resource gap from $320 million in 1970 (4.9% of GDP) to
$90 million in 1973 (1% of GDP). Reserves increased in 1972 and 1973
and now stand at about $1,080 million which is equivalent to seven months
of 1973 imports. Higher oil prices will increase the cost of petroleum
imports by about $356 million in 1974 (i.e., 3% of GNP), raising the total
import bill by 16%. However, expected capital inflows plus the favorable
export prices that now exist will probably allow Thailand in 1974 and 1975
to maintain a 7% real growth rate and absorb the increased cost of imports
(including petroleum) without greatly drawing down reserves. By 1976,
however, the ratio of reserves to imports is likely to have declined to a
low level and Thailand may require a greatly increased capital inflow if
it is to maintain its development efforts. Looking to the longer run,
Thailand is well endowed with potential sources of hydropower and lignite
and will be in a position to slow down the growth rate of the use of petroleum,
which accounted for 83% of energy consumption in 1972.
18.       In May 1973 the Consultative Group for Thailand met to review
the country's development prospects and requirements for external assistance
for the remainder of the Third Plan (1971-76). Because of two devaluations
of the U.S. dollar, considerable increases in the cost of Thailand's imports,
and additions to the list of projects for external financing, the Govern-
ment had revised its projected requirements of commitments of external
public capital during the Plan period from $900 to $1,200 million. This
amount appears likely to be available. In April 1972, the Government of
Japan signed a Y 64 billion credit agreement with the Government of Thailand,
and a year later announced the untying of almost the entire amount.
19.       Considerable progress has been made in project preparation since
the start pf the plan. However, external lenders to Thailand are giving
increasing emphasis to projects in agriculture, education and other social
sectors, and this may make it more difficult for the Government to achieve
its target for external borrowing which has traditionally supported
projects in the power, transportation and communications sectors.
20.       Present Government policy is to maintain the private sector's
freedom of access to private credit sources abroad; in consequence, private
capital inflows are expected to continue to finance a significant part of
equipment imports. Since reserves are high and domestic sources of finance
for private investment are not entirely adequate, this policy has been
appropriate so far.



- 6 -
21.       At the end of 1973, Thailand's total external debt stood at about
$865 million and the debt service ratio for the year was 15%. Public debt
forms a small part of total debt and the public debt service ratio was only
3% in 1973. If commodity prices remain at their recent levels in 1974 and
1975, Thailand's debt service ratio can be expected to decline somewhat this
year and next; thereafter a slowly rising trend is foreseen.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
22.       Since 1950 Thailand has received 27 Bank loans amounting to
$474.4 million, net of cancellations. Most of these have been for trans-
portation ($192 million), irrigation ($69.2 million) and power ($91 million)
with, in addition, one for a dual-purpose power and irrigation project
($65.9 million). The remaining loans have been for education ($21.4
million), industry ($1 million) and telecommunications ($37 million).
In addition, Thailand has received IDA credits of $19.5 million for
education and $5.5 million for irrigation improvement. In general Bank-
financed projects have been carried out in accordance with expectations.
Construction of the third Bangkok Port project, financed under Loan 702-TH,
began 18 months behind schedule. The delay was mainly caused by the time
taken by the Port Authority of Thailand and its consultants to pre-qualify
bidders, amend tender documents and evaluate bids which were complicated
by currency realignments. In July 1973, the Executive Directors approved
a loan of $55 million to the Metropolitan Water Works Authority (IWWA)
for a Bangkok water supply project. Signature of this loan was delayed
pending the filling of the post of General Manager of MWWA, which became
vacant in August, and the negotiation of an engineering consultancy
contract. A new General Manager has now been appointed and negotiations
for the consultancy contract satisfactorily concluded. In the meantime
however, the estimated cost of the project has risen greatly and it has
been agreed that a review of the cost and scope of the project should be
conducted before the loan is szgned.   Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans and IDA credits as of February 28, 1974, and IFC investments
as of December 31, 1973, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
23.       The Bank Group's lending program in Thailand is being diversified.
In the next few years a smaller proportion of it is expected to be devoted
to transportation and power, while projects in irrigation, rural infra-
structure, livestock, education, family planning, industry and forestry
will account for about two-thirds of the program. Both Bank and IDA
projects are increasingly selected to achieve a wider geographical spread
for development benefits and one of the main functions of the Regional
Mission in Bangkok is to assist the Government in developing projects
which will contribute to this. The Bank Group's readiness to finance
some local costs in appropriate cases will enable it to participate more
fully in projects in agriculture and the social sectors.
24.       Before the end of FY74, a loan to the industrial Finance
Corporation of Thailand should be ready for consideration. In FY75 about
three-quarters of the program (by dollar amounts) is expected to be devoted



to projects in the countryside, where incomes are lowest. It will
include a rural infrastructure project and lending for irrigation, live-
stock improvement, seed multiplication and possibly rubber replanting.
In addition outlying areas can expect to benefit from projects now under
preparation for educational radio and television and infrastructure for
four regional centers and their environs. Projects of more direct
benefit to towns are expected to include industrial estates and the
regional centers already mentioned.
25.       On December 31, 1972 Bank loans disbursed and outstanding to
Thailand amounted to $205 million, representing 24 percent of the country's
estimated total external debt and 48.4% of the public debt. The level of
Bank/IDA commitments is expected to increase substantially over the next
five years, but loans and credits disbursed and outstanding are not expected
to exceeed 30 percent of total external debt by 1978. Servicing of the
Bank debt is expected to account, in 1978, for about 55% of Thailand's public
debt service, but only 15% of its total debt service. Thailand is expected
to remairL creditworthy for substantial Bank lending.
26.       Prospects for IFC operations in Thailand are reasonably good;
IFC began appraisal of a pulp and paper project based on bamboo and bagasse
in the latter part of January 1974.
PART III - POWER IN THAILAND
Energy Requirements and Resources
27.       During the period 1956-1970, total energy consumption in Thailand
increased at an average annual rate of 13% p. a., to reach about 6.3 million
tons petroleum equivalent in 1970, and this rate will probably be sustained
in the next decade. If so, total energy consumption will amount to 27.1
million tons petroleum equivalent by 1980, with petroleum products account-
ing for about 80%.
28.       Thailand's main energy resources are hydro-power, large deposits
of oil shale, limited deposits of coal, and oil and natural gas in quantities
which are still uncertain. Its hydro potential, excluding that of two inter-
national rivers, the Mekong and the Salween, totals about 11,300 MW, of which
520 MW or 4.6% are presently exploited. The increase in operating costs of
oil-burning thermal plants, due to higher oil prices, has strengthened
official interest in nuclear power and the proposal to construct hydro-
electric facilities on the Mekong at Pa Mong near the Laotian capital
Vientiane. These facilities could have an installed capacity of up to
4,800 MW; however the technical and social difficulties inherent in the
project mean that they could not be in service before the late 1980s. Since
1972, Thailand has been importing power from the Nam Ngum facilities in Laos.
29.       Coal deposits are estimated at 150 million tons of which 65 million
tons are commercially exploitable. Proven reserves of petroleum are



- 8 -
negligible, but exploration is being carried out in the Northeast add in
the Gulf of Thailand where crude oil and natural gas have been discovered
by offshore drilling.    Oil shale deposits are estimated at 2,700 million
barrels which, if economically exploitable, could meet Thailand's domestic
requirements at the current rate of consumption for up to 50 years.
Power Production and Distribution
30.       The Power Sector is well operated, investments are adequate and
reasonable and future prospects are good. Electricity demand and generation
grew almost ten-fold from 1962 to 1972, reaching 1,117 MW and 5,990 GWh
respectively in 1972. By 1982, demand is expected to more than triple to
3,400 MW and generation to reach at least 20,000 GWh - a very large increase
in absolute terms.
31.       At present only 17% of the population has access to electricity
and most of these live in Bangkok and its environs, where the greatest
concentration of industry and commerce is located. It is forecast that
by 1982, 27% of the population will have access to electricity, and that
consumers living outside Bangkok will account for an increasing share of
this total.
32.       The development of the sector is carried out by three separate
statutory corporations, established by the state but enjoying considerable
operating autonomy: the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT),
the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electricity
Authority (PEA).
33.       EGAT, of which a fuller account is given in Part IV, is respon-
sible for generation and transmission in the public sector and accounted
for 95.3% of all electrical energy generated in Thailand in 1972, the
balance being generated by PEA in power systems isolated from the national
grid (1.8%) and by private generating plants (2.9%). EGAT sells energy
in bulk to MEA, PEA and large industrial consumers.
The Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA)
34.       MEA supplies electricity to Bangkok and its environs.    It buys
all its electricity from EGAT and accounted for 70% of EGATs sales in 1972.
MEAs investment program 1972-76 totals US$90 million equivalent, which
is adequate. Its financial situation and prospects are satisfactory, with
earnings forecast to provide a rate of return on average net fixed assets
in operation of about 11% yearly for 1972-76. In 1972, MEAs revenues
averaged 1.97 US cents per Kilosatt hour.
The Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA)
35.       PEA distributes electricity to all parts of Thailand except MEAs
service area. In 1972, PEA bought 88% of its electricity from EGAT,
accounting for 23% of EGATs sales, and generated the remainder itself. PEAs
investment program 1972-76 totals US$66 million equivalent. This is



- 9 -
reasonable given the size of the service area and the level of investment
foreseen for rural electrification. (The rural program will cover 2,500
villages at a total cost of about $22.5 million). PEAs financial position is
reasonable given the nature of its activities. Its tariffs are about
1.6 times higher than MEAs, reflecting the higher cost of its service, and
produce revenues which, in 1972, averaged 3.24 US cents per Kilowatt hour.
PART IV - THE PROJECE
36.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Ban Chao Nen Hydro-Electric
Project" (No. 291-TH dated March 19, 1974) is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. A loan and project summary is provided in
Annex III.
37.       The project is an important part of the expansion program which
EGAT has drawn up for the years 1974-82 to meet the country's rapidly
growing demand for electricity; the project would account for 13% of the
program's construction expenditure, which amounts to $1.45 billion. A dam
and power house would be constructed across the river Quae Yai, at Ban Chao
Nen, 150 km northwest of Bangkok, with an annual generating capacity of
1,230 GWh and an installed capacity of 360 MW. In addition to its power
benefits, the dam would make available a reliable supply of water sufficient
for irrigating 235,000 ha of land in the dry season, and would facilitate
the control of flooding in the wet season.
History of the Project
38.       In 1966, the Yanhee Electricity Authority, EGATs main predecessor,
requested technical assistance under the Colombo Plan for investigations of
the hydro-electric potential of the Quae Yai River Basin. Under these
auspices, the Electric Power Development Co. Ltd. (EPDC) of Japan, was
engaged in 1968 to act as engineering consultant to EGAT and prepared a
report which identified sites for several dams on the Quae Yai, of which
Ban Chao Nen was one. However, the report left some doubt as to the
physical feasibility of the project, due to difficult geological conditions.
Following pre-appraisal by the Bank in 1970, further investigations were
made with the guidance and assistance of an international consulting board.
In April 1972, the board concluded that these investigations had clearly
established that the geological conditions, although difficult, would not
be a serious problem. Meanwhile, several improvements were made in the
design of the dam and related structures.
39.       An appraisal mission visited Thailand in November/December 1972.
A follow-up appraisal was made in July 1973. The proposed loan was
negotiated in Washington, D. C. from February 19-26, 1974. The Thai delegation
was led by H. E. Anand Panyarachun, Ambassador of Thailand to the United
States, who was assisted by Khun Kasame Chatikavanij, General Manager of the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand.



- 10 -
Physical Facilities
40.       The physical facilities to be constructed under the first phase
of the project would consist of a dam, about 140 m. high and 615 m. long,
a reservoir, with an effective storage capacity of 4.4 billion m3, hy-
draulic structures, electro-mechanical equipment and transmission facilities.
In the first phase, three 120 MW units would be installed in the power house
and two 230 KV circuits, 165 km long, would connect the power house to the
national grid.  The power units are scheduled to be commissioned in late
1979 and early 1980; six years is a reasonable time for this work.    In the
second phase, in the mid-1980s, two 180 MW reversible pump turbines
would be installed, bringing the generating capacity to 720 MW.
41.       Downstream from the dam site, and below the confluence of the
Quae Yai and the Quae Noi, an area of 149,000 ha has been developed for
wet-season irrigation with Bank assistance (Loan 394-TH: Meklong Irrigation
Project). At the request of the Government an amount was included in
Credit 379-TH (Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project) to finance part
of the cost of studying the feasibility of improving this irrigation system
to enable farmers to increase their yields in the wet season on the whole
of this area, and carry out dry-season irrigated agriculture on 60% of it.
Other land in the same general area has been identified as suitable for
similar treatment, bringing to about 400,000 ha the total of land which
lies downstream from the dam site and is suitable for dry-season irriga-
tion. The Ban Chao Nen reservoir would supply sufficient water to irrigate
235,000 ha in the dry season and the reservoir release pattern required
to accomplish this has been allowed for in calculating the power benefits.
The construction and filling of the reservoir would not interfere with the
present irrigation practices of farmers downstream.
The Borrower
42.       EGAT would be responsible for construction and operation of the
facilities. Reservoir release patterns would be drawn up jointly by EGAT
and the Royal Irrigation Department, with priority being given to the
requirements of irrigation.
43.       The Bank has made six loans totalling $157 million to EGAT and
its main predecessor, the Yanhee Electricity Authority; the first was in
1957 and the most recent in 1971. The projects financed with the help of
these loans have included dam construction and equipment for hydro and
thermal generation, transmission and sub-station facilities, and have been
carried out satisfactorily.
44.       EGAT was established in 1968 by merging three public electricity
authorities, the Yanhee Electricity Authority, the Northeast Electricity
Authority and the Lignite Authority. By 1972 EGAT was generating twice the
electricity generated in 1968.



45.       From 1972-82, generation by EGAT is forecast to increase at an
average annual rate of 13%, requiring construction expenditures amounting
in the years 1974-82 to $1.45 billion, including interest during construction.
This expenditure compares with fixed assets of $500 million in 1973. During
this period EGAT will continue to rely mainly on hydro and conventional
thermal power, but a nuclear project will come into service in about 1980.
The program is based on least cost solutions and is well judged to meet
the country's needs. To ease the situation brought about by the recent
substantial increases in the price of fuel oil, ECAT proposes to convert
an existing 75 MW oil-fired unit at North Bangkok to utilize local lignite
and to advance the commissioning of the proposed new 75 MW Mae Moh lignite-
fired steam unit No. 2 by two years.
46.       EGAT possesses a well-trained and competent operational staff and
an able, well-qualified and energetic General Manager. Its work force is
7-10% higher than is necessary, due to the transfer of staff from its
predecessors, but attrition and system expansion are reducing this excess.
47.       EGATs financial situation is sound.   The rate of return for the
past three years has been about 9%, debt service coverage better than 1.6;
self-financing has been about 30% as required by existing loan agreements,
and a debt equity ratio of 58/42 maintained, indicating a satisfactory
capital structure. Moreover, tariffs have been steadily reduced. Over the
next several years, however, EGAT will face a more difficult set of
financial circumstances than in the past. Its expansion program aims at
increasing fixed assets in operation frDm $500 million in 1973 to $1.63 bil-
lion in 1982, and this will place heavy demands on its revenues; the
devaluation of the Baht in 1971 and 1973 (partially offset by a revaluation
in July 1973) has increased its recurrent and capital costs. The Guarantee
Agreement stipulates in Sections 3.03 and 2.03, respectively, that, in order
to maintain EGATs financial strength, the Guarantor (i.e., the Government)
will:
(a) not later than June 1, 1974, permit EGAT:
(i) to increase its tariffs to compensate thereafter for the
increases in its fuel costs which have occurred by that
date, and
(ii) to introduce into contracts with its customers a fuel
price adjustment clause which will enable it thereafter
automatically to pass on fuel price increases;
(b) assist EGAT in the issuance of bonds to obtain additional
funds required for construction expenditures.
48.       In addition, the Council of Ministers has passed a resolution
to the effect that the present moratorium on the payment by EGAT of remit-
tances to the Ministry of Finance (i. e. in lieu of taxes) which is due to
expire in 1976 shall be extended to 1982. The Council of Ministers has also
resolved thiat EGAT should contribute from its own resources 30% of the cost
of its investment in power facilities, and this requires a general tariff



- 12 -
increase of about 5% after taking the fuel price adjustment into account.
The Government accepts the need for this increase but judges that it would
be politically wise to defer it until consumers have adjusted to the approx-
imate one third increase in tariffs that would be needed to offset the higher
price of fuel. The proposed Loan Agreement stipulates a 30% contribution
to new investment from earnings.
49.       Assuming a general tariff increase of about 5% in 1975, EGAT
should achieve the following financial results in the years 1974-82: its
contribution from earnings to its investment program would not fall below
30% except in 1974 when it would be 28%; the rate of return on its net assets
in operation will exceed 10% in five of these nine years and will not fall
below 8% in any year; the debt/equity ratio will not exceed 60/40; the
current ratio will not drop below 1.34 and debt-service coverage will average
about 1.8 times on an annual basis.
Cost Estimates
50.       The total cost of the Project is estimated at $158.7 million,
including $4.4 millLon in taxes and duties but excluding $22.6 million in
interest during construction, and has a foreign exclhange component of
about $93.9 million. These estimates are based on extensive field investi-
gations, an advanced stage of design and prices bid for the major civil
works contract. Total contingencies amount to about 21% of basic February
1974 costs.
Financing
_1.       Co-financing with the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
(OECF) is envisaged. The Board of OECF has approved in principle a proposal
to finance on an untied basis all the foreign exchange costs and some of
the local costs of the hydraulic and electro-mechanical equipment, transmis-
sion lines, sub-stations and engineering consulting services, estimated at
11.6 billion Yen (equivalent in February 1974 to about US$41 million).
Effectiveness of the Bank loan would be dependent upon the receipt by EGAT
from OECF of a letter of intent to make firancing available to EGAT for these
items. EGAT has requested a Bank loan of US$75 million equivalent to finance
the foreign costs of civil works, and interest during construction (IDC) on
the Bank-financed portion. The Bank loan (less $18.2 million for IDC)
constitutes about 36% of total project costs (excluding taxes and duties).
lie inclusion of IDC is justified by the -ombination of financial circumstances,
described above, which the Borrower will face in the next several years.
i3ecause of the expected benefits to agriculture, the Government would con-
tribute about $30 million to the proJect. The balance of the funds would
come from the Borrower's earnings and loans to cover import duties.
Consultants
52.       The Electric Power Development Company of Japan will continue to
act as prime consultants for this project, and menbers of the international
board of consultants may also be retained on an individual basis.



- 13 -
Procurement
53.       All materials, equipment and contractors' services would be pro-
cured on the basis of international competitive bidding with the exception
of services to be supplied to EGAT by contractors to supplement EGATs force
account work on preliminary works and resettlement. Procurement of items
financed partly by the proposed Bank loan would be in accordance with the
Bankts guidelines, and eligible domestic manufacturers would be accorded
the standard margin of preference. The OECF guidelines that would be
followed in the procurement of OECF-financed items are similar to the Bank's
in all major respects. The OECF loan would be untied.
54.       Construction of the dam must go ahead quickly if the reservoir
is to start filling in the 1977 wet season; a later start to filling would
delay commissioning by a year. To avoid such a delay the contract for the
main civil works would have to be awarded during the first quarter of 1974.
The Bank, therefore, gave its approval for specifications and tender documents
to be issued in September 1973. Bids were opened on December 19 and the bid
evaluation has been reviewed and agreed by the Bank; if the proposed loan
is approved the contract will be awarded in mid-April.
Disbursement
55.       Disbursement from the proposed Bank loan would be made against
(a) the c. i. f. Bangkok price of directly imported materials and equipment;
(b) 65% of total expenditures for imported materials and equipment procured
locally; (c) 100% of total expenditures ex-factory for materials and
equipment manufactured locally; (d) 60% of total expenditures for the main
civil works contract (i. e. the estimated foreign exchange component); and
(e) interest and other loan charges during construction. A disbursement
schedule is given in Annex III.
Resettlement
56.       Eight thousand people now living in the project area would be
resettled on Crown Land. EGAT has included $6 million for this purpose in
its project estimates, of which $1.3 million would be provided by the Bank
loan to finance the purchase of materials and equipment for use in prep-
aration of the resettlement sites. At $750 per head, the allocation for
resettlement appears to be adequate. Nevertheless, the Government has
agreed to provide any funds required for resettlement in excess of this
amount. Satisfactory resettlement will require coordination of the work of
a number of different government departments. The Government has agreed
that it would establish a coordinating committee to draw up and send to
the Bank for approval by December 31, 1974, a resettlement plan which would
take into account the views of those to be resettled. The Government has
also agreed that EGAT should carry out the construction works required under
the resettlement plan, in cooperation with other responsible departments
and agencies.

Economic Evaluation
57.       The power output from the proposed project will meet only a small
part of the large increase in demand which can reasonably be expected in
the next decade (see paragraph 30 above) and which must be met if the
national ecc.nomy is to achieve a satisfactory rate of growth. The evalua-
tion confirmed that the proposed project constituted the least cost method
of meeting this part of total demand.
58.       With all costs of the proposed project allocated to power and
using July 1973 projections for fuel prices, the discount rate which
equalizes its cost stream with the cost stream of a conventional thermal
plant (the only feasible alternative, given the longer lead time required
for a nuclear plant) has a mean value of 12.9% 1/ i. e. at any discount
rate up to 12.9% the proposed facilities are preferable to a thermal
plant; with $30 million of common costs allocated to irrigation, the
equalizing discount rate has a mean value of 18.3%. If recent fuel price
changes are taken into account, the mean value of the discount rate, with
all costs allocated to power, rises to over 18%, i.e. the margin of advantage
of a hydro project over a thermal alternative is substantially increased. The
financial rate of return, at market prices and with all costs allocated to
power, is 11.2% at present tariff levels and will rise to 15.3% once the
tariff increases described in paragraphs 47 and 48 above are in effect.
These rates of return are satisfactory.
59.       It is expected that an irrigation project will be built downstream
to take advantage of the water storage and control capacity of the proposed
reservoir and of existing infrastructure. The rate of return of such a
,.Loject, based on preliminary studies, is not less than 13.5% if $30 million
of the cost of the reservoir is allocated to it, and not less than 16.4%
if none of the cost of the reservoir is allocated to it.
60.       In addition, the proposed project will provide benefits in the
form of flood control, improved communi:ations, fisheries and tourism,
which, if taken into account, would make the results of the comparison with
a thermal plant even more favorable.
Ecology
r1.       EGAT contracted with the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) to
s-tudy the likely ecological impact of the project. Its findings have been
published in two reports: "Ecological Reconnaissance", which was based
or0  a reconnaissance by a 35-member team in 1972, and "Selected Ecological
S'irvevs", which was issued in 1974 and contained further studies which had
been called for by the earlier report.  The second report concludes that
provided the further investigations which it proposes are carried out and
*crovided the recommendations made concerning project implementation are
adopced, "there is no single ecological consequence, or combination of
1/   This is the mean value of the range with 95% probability.



- 15 -
consequences, which is of sufficient importance to preclude construction
of the Project". The Loan Agreement with EGAT stipulates that all reasonable
measures would be taken to ensure that execution and operation of the
Project are carried out with due regard to ecological and environmental
factors and, in particular, the recommendations of the AIT reports.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
62.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom
of Thailand and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
63.       The special features described in paragraphs 48, 56 and 61 of this
Report are reflected in Sections 3.07 and 5.04 of the Loan Agreement and
Sections 2.03 and 3.02 of the Guarantee Agreement.
64.       The following features of these agreements are also of interest:
(a)  EC'AT would not undertake or execute any new major project
other than the Project, make any new major investment not
related to the Project, nor acquire any major asset before
having obtained the Bank's agreement to the financing plan
covering such project, investment or asset (Section 5.06 of
the Loan Agreement); and
(b) if EGAT were to prepay any part of its indebtedness under
any of the OECF Loan Agreements, it would simultaneously
prepay a proportionate amount of the Loan (Section 5.07)
of the Loan Agreement).
65.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
66.       It has not been possible in this report to take full account of
the consequetces of recent increases in petroleum prices. However, avail-
able information indicates that the proposed loan remains fully justified.
67.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.        PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Loan 514-TH, Sirikit Dam Project; US$26 Million Loan of September 19, 1967;
Closing date: original, June 30, 1973; current, June 30, 1974.
The work on the project has been practically completed. The
closure of the dam was carried out on schedule in June 1971. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$78 million, as against US$76 million
at appraisal (+2.5%). Substantial increases in the principal civil works
contract (+41%), which resulted from unforseen adverse foundation conditions,
have been largely compensated by savings on other items. The closing date
has been postponed by a year so that two claims by the contractor may be
settled by negotiation or arbitration.
Loan 626-TH, 4th Highways Project; US$23 Million Loan of June 27, 1969;
Closing date: original, December 31, 1973; current, December 31, 1974.
Construction of the project has been completed within the cost
estimates and on schedule except for the fencing of some sections of highway.
The closing date has been postponed to allow completion of the fencing. At
the request of the Government $3.0 million has been cancelled from the
unallocated category of this loan.
Loan 655-TH,_First EGAT Power Project; US$46.5 Million Loan of February 10,1970;
Closing date: July 31, 1974.
Foreign exchange expenditures are likely to exceed committed funds
by about US$3 million, due mainly to the revaluation of the Yen, and the
additional costs will be covered by the Borrower.
Loan 702-TH, Third Bangkok Port Project; US$12.5 Million Loan of August 6, 1970;
Closing date: July 31, 1974.
Construction of this project began 18 months behind schedule.
The delay was mainly caused by the time taken by the Port Authority of Thailand
(PAT) and its consultants to pre-qualify bidders, amend tender documents and
evaluate bids which were complicated by currency realignments. Subsequently,
technical problems arose and the relationship between PAT and the engineer
(NEDECO) became somewhat strained. The technical problems were solved
satisfactorily and the relationship has improved greatly.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 790-TH, South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project; US$27 Million Loan
of November 11, 1971; Closing date: November 30, 1976.
Project is on schedule.
Loan 822-TH, Second Education Project (Katsetsart University); US$15.4 Million
Loan of May 24, 1972; Closing date: June 30, 1978.
T.le preparatory stage of project implementation is about a year
behind schedule due to delay in appointing the campus planning consultants
but progress now is generally satisfactory and the master plan for the
development of the university's two campuses was presented to the University
in November 1973. Construction costs have risen much more rapidly than was
foreseen at appraisal and as a result total project costs are expected to
exceed appraisal estimates including contingencies by about $0.5 million;
this will be covered by the Government.
Loan 864-TH, Telecommuncations Project; US$37 Million Loan of December 5. 1972;
Closing date: December 31, 1977.
After initial delays due to difficulties with land acquisition,
the project is now moving forward satisfactorily with procurement action
having been taken on a number of major itens.
Loan 870-TM, Fifth Highways Project; US$28.6 Million Loan of December 26, 1972;
Closing date: December 31, 1977.
Negotiations with consultants to assist in a highway maintenance
study have been protracted, delaying its start by about one year. There
has also been about a year's delay in agreeing terms of reference for con-
sultants' services to assist the transport planning unit of the Ministry
of Communications. Construction work is proceeding without any major
problem.
Credit 369-TH, Third Education Project; US$19.5 Million Credit of April 11,1973;
Closing date: June 30, 1978.
Project implementation generally is about four months behind
schedule with the fellowship program about eight months behind, but otherwise
progress is satisfactory. Construction costs are likely to exceed appraisal
estimates (including contingencies) by $1.2 million (30%) by the time build-
ing works are contracted; this will be covered by the Government.
Credit 379-TH, Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project; US$5.5 Million
Credit of May 9, 1973; Closing date: June 30, 1978.
Project is on schedule but delay in enactment of Land Consolidation
Law may give rise to problems.
Project 898-TI, Fourth Railway Project; US$15 Million Loan of June 1, 1973;
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
Declared effective on September 28, 1973.
