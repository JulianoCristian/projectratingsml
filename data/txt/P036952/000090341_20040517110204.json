The lessons learned indicate that\n            Poverty-focused social service delivery projects should be\n            targeted to townships and villages instead of counties.\n            Especially at the village primary school level, the design,\n            financing, implementation and supervision of rural\n            poverty-focused basic education projects, is best handled by\n            designated education line ministries and their provincial\n            and county sub units. Policy changes and\n            institutionalization, such as student assistance programs,\n            may be realized when the appropriate survey work is\n            conducted first. Caution is advised when provinces and\n            counties have to repay IDA or IBRD credits or loans from\n            their education budgets. Project management training can\n            contribute to the institutionalization of a management\n            system when such training occurs throughout the life of a\n            project. Student assistance programs in rural China cannot\n            be funded solely from interest income on modest trust funds.\n            The key issue in developing education projects at the\n            provincial, county and township levels is to convince the\n            Chinese preparation teams of the importance of focusing on\n            development outcomes instead of investment inputs. Forming\n            panels of experts with a broad range of skills at the start\n            of the targeting exercise is critical to achieving a balance\n            that addresses a project's educational, financial and\n            staffing needs. Teacher and staff training could have been\n            stronger. These programs generally operate according to a\n            provincial formula which imitates the national standards."}, "docdt": "2004-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
