Operation Type        Programmatic Development Policy Operation (DPO)
Main Policy Areas     The proposed Second Development Policy Operation (DPO-2) is the
                      second in a series of three programmatic development policy operations
                      intended to support the Government of Georgia's policy reform program
                      to (i) mitigate the impact of the economic downturn in the short-term; and
                      (ii) facilitate recovery and prepare Georgia for post-crisis growth in the
                      medium-term. In addition to a satisfactory macroeconomic and fiscal
                      framework, the main policy areas supported are: (i) improving the
                      efficiency and effectiveness of public finances; (ii) improving the
                      effectiveness of the social safety net; and (iii) improving external
                      competitiveness.
Key Outcome           The macroeconomic and fiscal framework includes significant fiscal
Indicators            adjustment to safeguard sustainability as economic recovery takes hold
                      during 2010-12, following the countercyclical fiscal stimulus to mitigate
                      the downturn during 2008-2009. Improved efficiency and effectiveness
                      of public expenditures are directed at supporting economic recovery and
                      creating the conditions for growth in the medium term. Improved
                      effectiveness of the social safety net is directed at cushioning the impact
                      of the downturn and ensuring that the benefits of post-crisis growth are
                      broadly shared. Improved external competitiveness is directed at
                      ensuring that a vibrant and competitive private sector supports economic
                      recovery and serves as the engine of post-crisis growth in the medium
                      term.
Program Development   The proposed operation supports the objectives of the Government's
Objective(s) and      policy reform program, which are to mitigate the impact of the downturn
Contribution to CAS   in the short-term and facilitate recovery and prepare Georgia for post-
                      crisis growth in the medium term. These development objectives are
                      central to the 2010-2013 Country Partnership Strategy which is built upon
                      the twin pillars of meeting post-conflict vulnerability needs and
                      strengthening competitiveness for post-crisis growth.
Risks and Risk        Georgia faces a number of significant but manageable macroeconomic
Mitigation            risks and vulnerabilities. First, given the uncertain global economic
                      outlook, the external environment could suffer a renewed deterioration,
                      which would negatively impact exports, remittances, FDI, and other
                      private capital inflows. Second, renewed domestic and regional tensions
                      could have an adverse impact on investor and consumer confidence.
                      Third, domestic investor sentiment could fail to pick up, which would
                      constrain the recovery of credit to the private sector as the banking sector
                      continues to exercise caution in increasing lending. Should these
                      scenarios materialize, they would impede economic recovery from taking
                      hold. The fall out would require further external adjustment, possibly
               including further real exchange rate realignment, downscaling of planned
               public expenditures, and additional official financing, preferably on
               concessional terms to safeguard debt sustainability. Such a scenario
               would also add to the public debt burden and increase the ratio of
               nonperforming loans of the banking sector.
                  These risks are mitigated by a number of factors. First, the authorities
               have affirmed their commitment to the envisaged fiscal adjustment and
               flexible exchange rate policy, which provide key anchors for external and
               debt sustainability. In addition, the authorities are making significant
               efforts to promote Georgia's business environment to potential investors,
               in order to attract FDI and other private capital inflows. Second,
               Georgia's debt burden indicators remain within relevant prudential
               thresholds, with the authorities intending to access capital markets to
               smooth out a spike in the repayment schedule in 2013. Third, with bank
               deposits rising and the sector increasing provisioning since mid-2009,
               liquidity and capitalization indicators have improved significantly.
                  On mitigating regional tensions, mediation efforts are ongoing with
               support from the international community and bilateral partners, with all
               parties declaring the intent to resolve outstanding issues through peaceful
               means. Domestically, political conditions have improved since mid-2009
               and remain stable, with no escalation observed surrounding local and
               municipal elections at end-May 2010. The Government's efforts to
               address the needs of those affected by the economic downturn have
               helped to mitigate political tensions.

            PROPOSED SECOND DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION
                             TO GEORGIA


                                  I.      INTRODUCTION

1.      The proposed Second Development Policy Operation (DPO-2) is the second in a
series of three programmatic development policy operations for Georgia. This follows
successful completion in 2008 of the PRSO series which supported far-reaching reforms
since 2004 with impressive results. The Development Policy Operation (DPO) series is the
central component supporting structural reforms in Georgia of the Country Partnership
Strategy covering 2010-13, which is built upon the twin pillars of meeting post-conflict
vulnerability needs and strengthening competitiveness for post-crisis growth. The proposed
DPO-2, in the amount of $50 million equivalent, supports the strategic developmental
objectives of the Government's medium term reform program described in its poverty
reduction strategy document entitled "United Georgia without Poverty", supplemented by the
annual "Basic Data and Directions" document.

2.      The reforms supported by the DPO program are directed at: (i) mitigating the
impact of the economic downturn in the short-term; and (ii) facilitating recovery and
preparing Georgia for post-crisis growth in the medium-term. The double shocks to the
economy from the August 2008 conflict and the subsequent global economic crisis resulted in
a sharp downturn in economic growth to 2.3 percent in 2008 and 3.9 percent contraction in
2009, from growth in excess of 9 percent during 2004 to mid-2008. Furthermore, although
strong reforms following the Rose Revolution in 2003 led to four years of rapid economic
growth, significant challenges remained in creating the conditions to continue along a
trajectory of sustained economic growth with an effective social safety net. Georgia has,
therefore, been addressing the dual challenge of mitigating the impact of the downturn in the
short term and facilitating recovery and creating the conditions for post-crisis growth with an
effective social safety net in the medium term.

3.     The proposed DPO-2 is supporting an orderly transition in the focus of the
authorities from immediate mitigating measures toward preparing the conditions for
post-crisis growth. Toward addressing the dual challenges facing Georgia, the DPO program
supports a satisfactory macroeconomic and fiscal framework and key reforms in three policy
areas. For operational purposes, in addition to a satisfactory macro-fiscal framework, the
program is organized into three reform pillars: (i) improving the efficiency and effectiveness
of public finances; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the social safety net; and (iii) improving
external competitiveness.

4.      In order to ensure that the transition out of the immediate mitigating measures
continues to back economic recovery and address the needs of the vulnerable, the
proposed DPO-2 is supporting a number of objectives. First, under the macroeconomic
and fiscal framework, significant fiscal adjustment to safeguard sustainability as economic
recovery takes hold during 2010-12 is being implemented in a manner that protects important
social and infrastructure investments expenditures. This adjustment follows the scaling up of
public expenditures in these areas as part of the countercyclical fiscal stimulus to mitigate the
downturn during 2008-2009. Second, the higher level of the targeted social assistance (TSA)

                                                3
benefit and the expanded coverage of the targeted medical insurance program (MIP) are being
maintained and the coverage of the new publicly co-financed health insurance program is
being expanded for those not covered by MIP.

5.      In order to facilitate economic recovery and prepare Georgia for post-crisis
growth in the medium term, the proposed DPO is supporting another set of important
objectives. First, improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures are
directed at supporting economic recovery and create the conditions for growth in the medium
term. The associated adjustment should also free up resources to finance private sector
growth in an environment where foreign capital inflows are expected to remain scarce.
Second, the effectiveness of public investment is being enhanced to create the infrastructure
necessary for sustained economic growth in the medium term. Third, tax, customs, and trade-
related reforms are improving external competitiveness by further reducing the burden of tax
payment, streamlining customs procedures, and creating the pre-conditions for improved
access of Georgian products to world markets. Fourth, the effectiveness of the social safety
net is being improved to ensure that the benefits of growth in the medium term are broadly
shared.

6.      The proposed DPO is anchored in a strong Government program to respond to
the crisis in the short term and implement key structural reforms in the medium term.
In response to the double shocks of the August 2008 conflict and the subsequent global
economic crisis, the authorities adopted a number of sound measures to address the fallout
and mitigate the impact of the downturn. These include the scaling up of critical social and
infrastructure investment expenditures, providing liquidity and regulatory support to the
banking sector, and working with the international community to secure donor assistance.

7.      The Government's response to the crisis has received broad support from the
international community. In October 2008, following a "Joint Needs Assessment" (JNA)
led by the World Bank and the United Nations (with the collaboration of ADB, EC, EBRD,
EIB, and IFC) and an International Donor Conference in Brussels, Georgia received pledges
of financial support from the international community of $4.5 billion over three years,
including $850 million for the banking sector. Furthermore, the IMF Board in September
2008 approved an 18-month, $750 million Stand-By Program, which was subsequently
augmented by $400 million and extended to June 2011 at the time of the Third Review in
August 2009. The IMF program is on track: the Fifth Review was approved in March 2010,
all structural benchmarks and end-March performance criteria were met, and the Sixth
Review is scheduled to be considered by the Fund Board on July 9, 2010. Financial pledges
by the international community are on track to being delivered, with about $2.5 billion in
post-crisis support committed through March 2010, including general budget support from the
World Bank ($125 million), Asian Development Bank ($150 million), US Treasury ($250
million), and European Commission ($135 million).

8.      The Government's medium term structural reform program addresses key
development challenges (see Section IV). The areas of the Government's reform program
include: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) strengthening the social safety net
particularly expanding coverage of the extreme poor by the Targeted Social Assistance
program and expanding access to health care financing of the poor; (iii) continuing to reduce
the burden of the state on the economy and improve public service delivery; (iv) upgrading
infrastructure, transport and trade logistics services; (v) continuing to upgrade skills of the

                                              4
labor force; and (vi) upgrading institutions by implementing reforms aimed at strengthening
the rule of law, modernizing the enforcement system, and by improving mechanisms to
protect property rights. The Government's reform priorities also include measures to advance
territorial and civil reintegration, and deepening EU integration.

9.      The Government's medium-term structural reform program is being supported
by many development partners including the European Commission, USAID, the US
Treasury, ADB, the World Bank, SIDA, Japan, the Netherlands, and others. The Dutch
Government provided co-financing of Euro 2.5 million for DPO-1 and has confirmed its
intention to co-finance DPO-2 in an amount to be defined. The Asian Development Bank has
been providing policy-based budgetary support, as has the European Commission. The Bank
is focusing the DPO on areas where it has comparative advantage and by working closely
with other development partners, is leveraging resources, expertise, and technical support.
With the Government having strong ownership of the reforms supported by the DPO (which
are part of a broader Government reform program) with close collaboration of development
partners, the Government of Georgia is in the driver's seat in these reforms efforts. This
strong ownership ensures implementation and safeguards sustainability of the reforms
supported by the DPO.


                              II.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
10.    During much of the first decade of transition after the break-up of the former
Soviet Union, Georgia was one of the poorest performing economies in the Europe and
Central Asia region. In 2003, real GDP was at about 40% of its 1989 level and Georgia was
a weak state, with accumulating unpaid pensions and wages, electricity service limited to a
few hours per day and mostly to the capital city, weak public finances, and pervasive
corruption.

11.     From 2004 through mid-2008, Georgia implemented far-reaching reforms with
impressive results. Significant reforms were undertaken to strengthen public finances,
improve the business environment, upgrade infrastructure services, and improve social
services. As a result, economic growth averaged in excess of 9 percent per year during 2004
through mid-2008. A key driver of this growth was substantial inflows of foreign direct
investment (FDI), which increased from $542 million (8.5 percent of GDP) in 2005 to $1.67
billion (16.4 percent of GDP) in 2007, and continued to remain strong through mid-2008.
This was made possible by strengthening investor confidence resulting from improvements to
the business environment, with Georgia's rank among the World Bank's Doing Business
indicators improving from 112th place in 2005 to 15th place in 2008. In addition, far-reaching
trade liberalization was implemented in 2007, which made Georgia one of the most open
trading regimes in the world, with a very low average tariff and with 91 percent of product
lines subject to a zero tariff.

12.     A key pillar of growth and stability in Georgia from 2004 through mid-2008 was
its strengthening public finances. As a result of tax reform and effective anti-corruption
measures, tax revenues increased from 14.6 percent of GDP in 2003 to 25.8 percent of GDP
in 2007. This major achievement allowed the government to increase social spending by

contributed to the strong growth performance of the private sector. Budget execution and
public financial management systems improved significantly during this period, particularly
through the implementation of the Treasury Single Account. Effective public debt
management led to steady improvement in debt burden indicators, with external public debt
declining from 46 percent of GDP in 2003 to 17.5 percent of GDP in 2007.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
13.      Georgia experienced a sharp downturn in economic growth as a result of the
double shocks from the August 2008 conflict and the subsequent global economic crisis.
The double shocks led to significant deterioration in investor and consumer confidence,
contraction in foreign direct investment, exports, and remittances, a cutback in bank lending,
and stress on public finances from revenue shortfalls and increased expenditure needs. As a
result, the economy contracted by an estimated 3.9 percent in 2009 following growth of 2.3
percent in 2008, which represents a sharp slowdown from rapid growth in excess of 9 percent
during the preceding four years. FDI inflows collapsed from $1.67 billion (16.4 percent of
GDP) in 2007 to $765 million (7.1 percent of GDP) in 2009, while exports fell from 31
percent of GDP in 2007 to 29.8 percent in 2009. Inflation (end-of-period) at 3 percent for
2009 and 5.6 percent for 2008, is down significantly from 11 percent in 2007.

14.     A number of available indicators suggest that real economic activity is picking up
after bottoming out in the second half of 2009, although the recovery continues to
exhibit weakness along several dimensions. Real GDP grew by 4.5 percent in the first
quarter of 2010, after growing by 0.4 percent and contracting by only 1.2 percent in the fourth
and third quarters of 2009. This represents a pickup from sharp contraction of 5.1 percent and
10.1 percent in the first and second quarters of 2009. Exports, worker remittances, real estate
transactions, vehicle registrations, and construction permits have picked up since the second

and imports only recently showing signs of a modest pickup; furthermore, while foreign direct
investment inflows were up in the second half of 2009, they remain far below pre-crisis levels
and were down significantly to $76 million in the first quarter of 2010.

15.     The downturn in economic activity during 2008-2009 has been concentrated in
those sectors which fueled strong growth during the preceding four years.                    The
construction sector contracted by an estimated 13 percent in 2009, following contraction of 11
percent in 2008. Manufacturing contracted by 6 percent in 2009 and 2.4 percent in 2008. The
services sector (including particularly retail and wholesale trade, transport,
telecommunications, and financial intermediation), which constitutes more than 50 percent of
the economy, contracted by 2.5 percent in 2009. The collapse in FDI inflows across sectors
contributed to these contractions, with FDI falling by 65 percent in the transport, banking, and
other services sectors, and by 50 percent in construction and industry.

16.     The Georgian authorities responded swiftly to the shocks with a policy mix
directed at mitigating the economic downturn, restoring investor confidence, and
maintaining macroeconomic stability in the medium term. In particular, the authorities
implemented a countercyclical fiscal stimulus by scaling up social and infrastructure
expenditures, provided immediate liquidity and regulatory support to the banking sector, and
worked with the international community to arrange swift donor support. Public expenditures
increased from 34 percent of GDP in 2007 to 37 percent in 2008 and 38.5 percent in 2009,
while revenue collection suffered, with tax revenues falling from 25.8 percent of GDP in 2007
to 24.9 percent in 2008 and 24.5 percent in 2009. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit
widened to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2008 and an estimated 9.2 percent in 2009. The higher
fiscal deficits have been financed primarily through increased donor support. In recognition
of the government's swift and effective post-crisis response package, the international
community pledged $4.5 billion in financial support over three years, including $850 million
from the EBRD and the IFC to meet the large repayment obligations of the private banking


                                                                                                                      7
sector. These financial pledges are on track to being delivered, with about $2.5 billion
committed through March 2010.

17.     The fiscal stimulus has been associated with a marked reallocation of
expenditures, as well as a commitment to adjustment as recovery takes hold in the
medium term. Expenditures on transport infrastructure, as well as on education, health, and
social protection have been scaled up significantly, with the fiscal space for these increases
coming from a low initial level of external public debt and from a marked reduction of
defense expenditures. State budget expenditures as a share of GDP on social protection
increased from 4.6 percent in 2007 to 7 percent in 2009; on health from 1.4 percent in 2007 to
1.85 percent in 2009; on transport from 1.6 percent in 2007 to 2.8 percent in 2009. In
contrast, the defense expenditures as a share of GDP fell sharply from 8.8 percent in 2007 to
4.8 in 2009. The authorities also remain committed to a conservative fiscal stance in the
medium term, with public expenditures as a share of GDP programmed to decline as recovery
takes hold. Reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures are
also expected to help in facilitating fiscal adjustment.

18.     As private inflows have fallen, significant external adjustment has taken place
over the course of the downturn, and official transfers have increasingly financed the
current account, with an IMF Stand-By program supporting international reserves.
With FDI and other private capital inflows falling sharply since the second half of 2008, the
IMF Board in September 2008 approved a Standby Arrangement (SBA) for $750 million over
18 months to bolster investor confidence and support international reserves; this was
subsequently augmented by $400 million and extended to July 2011 as part of the Third
Review in August 2009. At the same time, significant external adjustment has taken place
over the course of the downturn, with the external current account deficit declining sharply
from 22.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to 11.9 percent in 2009, primarily due to a contraction in
imports by about 10 percent of GDP in 2009. Since the economic downturn, although the
authorities have periodically intervened to support the exchange rate in the face of foreign
exchange pressures, they have also allowed the exchange rate to adjust over time to facilitate
external adjustment. In November 2008, a 16 percent step depreciation to 1.65 Lari per dollar
was implemented and since January 2010, the currency has depreciated by about 10 percent to
1.85 Lari per dollar by June 23.

POVERTY DEVELOPMENTS

19.      Growth during 2004-07 was associated with improvements in several indicators
of well-being of the poor. Estimates based on a Living Standards Measurement Survey
(LSMS) indicate that the incidence of poverty in Georgia in 2007 was 23.6 percent, while the
incidence of extreme poverty was 9.3 percent.1 The measurement of poverty trends during
the four years of strong growth in Georgia (2004-07) is complicated by questions about the
reliability of the annual national Household Budget Surveys (HBS). Still, a look at monetary
incomes shows that the poor experienced an increase in their monetary purchasing power
during this time. Furthermore, important non-income dimensions of welfare improved for
those in the bottom 30 percent of the population, including significantly improved access to
electricity, natural gas, safe water, health, and higher education. Finally, during this period,

Georgia put in place an effective social safety net which, simulations indicate, had a very
significant impact in mitigating the incidence of poverty.

20.     Evidence on the impact of the crisis on poverty is only beginning to emerge and
points toward greater hardship resulting from higher unemployment. A Welfare
Monitoring Survey undertaken by UNICEF in May-June 2009 estimates a poverty headcount
rate of 25.7 percent (20.1 urban and 31.5 rural), and an extreme poverty rate of 9.9 percent;
however, these results are not comparable with the LSMS 2007 due to different survey
methodologies. Subjective measures of poverty, which are comparable across the two
surveys, indicate increasing hardship. In 2009, 50.9 percent of households reported that their
economic situation had worsened during the past year, while only 2.3 percent said it had
improved. Job loss was one of the most commonly cited reasons. The share of the population
reporting that unemployment was the main problem they faced rose from 37.4 percent to 42.2
percent between 2007 and 2009.

21.     Increased unemployment is one of the main transmission channels through which
the economic crisis has affected the welfare of Georgians. Unemployment is estimated to
have increased from 13.3 percent in 2007 to 16.5 percent in 2008 and further to 18.5 percent
in 2009. Data limitations pose a number challenges in estimating the welfare impact of the
unemployment shock: with the 2009 UNICEF survey having only limited information about
employment and the full year 2009 HBS not yet available, the impact of increased
unemployment is estimated using simulations based on the 2008 HBS (see table). The
estimates suggest that the welfare impact of higher unemployment is most pronounced in
Tbilisi and other urban areas. An increase in the unemployment rate by 5 percentage points is
estimated to have reduced mean consumption per capita by 3.0 percent overall, by 4.5 percent
in Tbilisi, and by 4.1 percent in other urban areas. The impact on the poverty headcount is an
increase by 1.7 percentage points overall, while the impact on the poverty gap is an increase
by 2.4 percentage points overall. Since the simulations only estimate the impact of complete
loss of employment, it is likely that the impact on consumption through reduced working
hours and substitution into lower paying jobs is even greater.

22.     Simulations drawing on macroeconomic data and the Household Budget Surveys
are currently ongoing. The HBS data for 2009, reportedly the first full year of improved
field implementation, will be available in June 2010. This should provide further information

about the impact of the economic crisis. A more in-depth effort will attempt to resolve the
challenging data comparability issues between the HBS, LSMS, and UNICEF surveys.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

23.     The economy is projected to grow by 4.5 percent in 2010, with economic recovery
expected to come from higher exports and private domestic investment, supported by a
pickup in bank lending. Growth is projected at 4 percent in 2011, increasing to 5 percent
during 2012-2013. Exports, expected to play a key role in driving economic recovery, are
projected to expand from 29.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 35.8 percent in 2010 and further to
about 39 percent during 2011-2013. Export growth is expected to come primarily from
metals and metal products, wines and other beverages, fruits and nuts, and repaired and re-
exported cars on the product side; and transport and tourism on the services side. Private
domestic investment is projected to recover from 8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 14 percent by
2013. The recovery in private investment is expected to benefit from a pickup in bank
lending in 2010 and modest improvement in FDI inflows from 2011. Private sector credit is
projected to increase by 20 percent in 2010 after being down 13.5 percent in 2009. FDI
inflows are projected to decline from 7.1 percent of GDP in 2009 to 6.5 percent in 2010
before recovering modestly to 8.2 percent in 2011 and 9 percent by 2013. The improved FDI
inflows are expected to come from existing as well as new projects, with the major destination
sectors including transport, energy, hotels, retail, and industry.

24.    Growth in the services sector is expected to be the primary driver of economic
recovery, with initially more modest pickup in construction and manufacturing. A
pickup in international trade is expected to contribute to the transport sector (particularly
given Georgia's role as a transit economy), while improvements in bank lending and overall
confidence would benefit the large but depressed wholesale and retail trade sectors.

25.      There is significant uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery. With
the medium term growth outlook built upon improved exports, bank lending, and FDI, any
deterioration in the external environment or investor confidence would result in lower growth
than currently projected. Although FDI inflows picked up in the second half of 2009
(compared to the first half), inflows during the first quarter of 2010 were down significantly
to $76 million, possibly due to seasonal factors and pre-election jitters. On the other hand,
exports have picked up strongly during the first quarter of 2010 and the economic outlook has
improved since 2009 for Georgia's major export destinations (Turkey, EU, Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Canada, and the United States), but export expansion going forward is
still subject to both uncertainty regarding the external environment as well as domestic supply
constraints.

26.    Georgia's overall macroeconomic policy framework is adequate for this
operation. The elements of this framework include: (i) a commitment to significant fiscal
adjustment during 2010-2012 to safeguard fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) maintaining a
sustainable level of external public debt; (iii) a flexible exchange rate consistent with external
sustainability; (iv) low to moderate inflation; and (v) strengthening banking sector supervision
to address vulnerabilities and support sustainable credit growth. The macroeconomic policy
framework is supported by an IMF SBA program which is on track: the Fifth Review was
approved in March 2010, all structural benchmarks and end-March performance criteria were
met, and the Sixth Review is scheduled to be considered by the IMF Board on July 9, 2010.

                                               10
27.     The authorities are committed to safeguarding fiscal and external debt
sustainability through significant fiscal adjustment during 2010-13. The fiscal adjustment
program during 2010-2011 is ambitious: the strategy is to hold the line on current
expenditures in nominal terms while accommodating a moderate increase in capital
expenditures in 2010, followed by a significant adjustment in capital expenditures in 2011.
The resumption of growth then delivers an adjustment in expenditures and the fiscal deficit as
a share of GDP. The overall fiscal deficit is projected to decline to from 9.2 percent of GDP
in 2009 to 6.3 percent in 2010, 4.8 percent in 2011, and 2.5 percent by 2013. This will require
a reduction of total expenditures from about 38.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to 36.1 percent in
2010, 33.9 percent by 2011, and 30.5 percent by 2013.2 Tax revenues are projected to rise
modestly from about 24.5 percent of GDP during 2009-2010 to about 25.6 percent during
2011-13, although a decline in nontax revenues and the winding down of crisis-related grants
means that revenues and grants will decline by more than 1 percentage point of GDP--from
29.3 percent of GDP in 2009 to 28 percent by 2012-13.

28.     The fiscal stance also includes a commitment to enhancing expenditure efficiency
by refocusing the composition of expenditures on priority areas. Specifically, the 2010
budget generally continues the changes in the composition of expenditures seen in the 2009.
Budgeted expenditures in 2010 are higher in Transport, Education, and Health, with fiscal
space for these increases coming from major cuts in defense and internal security
expenditures. Expenditures in education, health, and social protection are budgeted to rise to
33.6 percent of the budget from 32.5 percent in 2009, which itself reflects an increase from
28.7 percent in 2008. Similarly, expenditures in transport are budgeted to rise to 8.9 percent
of the overall budget in 2010 from 8 percent in 2009 and 4.2 percent in 2008. On the other
hand, expenditures on defense and internal security are budgeted to decline to 23.1 percent of
the budget in 2010 from 27.4 percent in 2009 and 39.3 percent in 2008. These shifts in the
composition of expenditures are expected to be maintained going forward. A budget
supplement for 2010 in line with these figures was submitted to Parliament on June 11, 2010.

29.    Georgia had a low level of indebtedness prior to the downturn, but external
public debt has increased during 2008-2009. As a result of strong growth and effective
debt management, Georgia had a low level of indebtedness prior to the economic downturn,
with external public debt at 17.5 percent of GDP in 2007. Private debt almost doubled in the
lead up to the downturn, but then declined as the private sector made large repayments in
2009. With the economic downturn, as Georgia has borrowed externally to finance its fiscal
stimulus, the level of public external debt has risen sharply over the last two years to 31.6
percent of GDP in 2009. A good part of the post-conflict financial assistance has been in the
form of grants and concessional loans. The ratio of public external debt is projected to
decline after peaking at about 43.2 percent of GDP in 2011. Fiscal adjustment during
2010-13 is an important component of the macroeconomic policy stance in safeguarding
Georgia's external debt sustainability.

30.     The macroeconomic policy stance also includes commitment to maintaining a
flexible exchange rate, which provides the key anchor of external sustainability in the
face of uncertain capital inflows. As the external environment improves and recovery takes
2
  Given the improved growth outlook of 4.5 percent for 2010, these projected figures on the fiscal deficit and
expenditures as a share of GDP are lower than those in the 2010 annual budget approved in December 2009,
which was based upon growth of 2.1 percent in 2010. The figures are, however, consistent with the draft budget
supplement for 2010 submitted to Parliament on June 11, 2010.

hold, imports are expected to grow, balanced roughly by a projected rise in exports. As such,
the external current account deficit is projected to widen modestly to 12.6 percent of GDP in
2010 and 13.2 percent in 2011 before declining to 11.6 percent by 2013. In 2010, external
financing of the current account is projected to come primarily from FDI, use of IMF
resources, and public sector external financing. Going forward, in 2011-2013, as IMF
repayments are due, external financing will come from FDI, other private capital inflows, and
continued public sector external borrowing. In the face of uncertain capital inflows, the
commitment to a flexible exchange rate provides the central anchor of safeguarding external
sustainability. The auction based system for the foreign exchange market, introduced by the
authorities to reinforce commitment to a flexible exchange rate policy, has become the only
mechanism of intervention by the central bank as of May 2009. In order to further reinforce
exchange rate flexibility, the authorities plan to limit intervention and the frequency of
auctions to once a week.

31.     Liquidity conditions and capitalization of the banking sector have improved
significantly since mid-2009, but NPLs remain elevated. The banking sector initially
experienced a decline in deposits by 20 percent since the end of 2008 to 2.5 billion lari in June
2009. Since then, deposits have recovered to 3.5 billion lari by March 2010. Along with the
increase in deposits, as the banking sector raised precautionary balances and increased loan
provisioning, liquidity and capitalization indicators improved significantly. The capital
adequacy ratio increased significantly during 2009 to 19.1 percent in December and remains
above prudential thresholds (18 percent in April 2010). The ratio of non-performing loans
(NPLs) has eased modestly from a peak of 18.8 percent in June 2009 to 17.3 percent in April
2010, but remains elevated compared to pre-crisis levels.3 Given that similarly high shares of
assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency (70 percent of deposits and 76
percent of loans), the direct risk to bank balance sheets from exchange rate depreciation is
limited, although the indirect risk through balance sheets of borrowers is significant. Stress
tests conducted by the NBG indicate that the depreciation in the Lari since January 2010
should put some upward pressure on NPLs going forward, although the improved
capitalization of banks should be adequate to deal with the impact.

3
 The NPL ratio quoted in the text is based on the national definition, which uses a broad classification of NPLs.
According to IMF standard classification, the NPL ratio eased from a peak of 8.3 percent in September 2009 to
6.7 percent in February 2010.

                                                              12
32.     The authorities have taken a number of steps to enhance bank supervision; with
bank lending still constrained, measures to stimulate credit growth have also come into
effect. The authorities are planning to move to risk-based supervision during 2010, with new
amendments approved in September 2009 to the law on commercial banks providing the
supervisor authority to adjust regulatory requirements based on bank-by-bank risk
assessments. Although bank lending is still constrained (credit to the private sector was down
13.5 percent y-o-y in December 2009), it increased by 3.1 percent through March 2010. A
number of measures to stimulate domestic currency lending, including improving access to
the central bank's refinancing window, have come into effect in May 2010.

33.     Georgia faces a number of significant but manageable macroeconomic risks and
vulnerabilities. First, given the uncertain global economic outlook, the external environment
could suffer a renewed deterioration, which would negatively impact exports, remittances,
FDI, and other private capital inflows. Second, renewed domestic and regional tensions could
have an adverse impact on investor and consumer confidence. Third, domestic investor
sentiment could fail to pick up, which would constrain the recovery of credit to the private
sector as the banking sector continues to exercise caution in increasing lending. Should these
scenarios materialize, they would impede economic recovery from taking hold. The fall out
would require further external adjustment, possibly including further real exchange rate
realignment, downscaling of planned public expenditures, and additional official financing,
preferably on concessional terms to safeguard debt sustainability. Such a scenario would also
add to the public debt burden and increase the ratio of nonperforming loans of the banking
sector. On the flip side, the recent initial signs of economic recovery coming from an
improved external environment could gain momentum if the global economic outlook
improves further. Given the uncertain environment, macroeconomic management will require
striking the appropriate balance between internal and external adjustment, with commitment
to the envisaged fiscal adjustment and flexible exchange rate policy providing important
anchors in safeguarding sustainability.

34.    Georgia's debt burden indicators are projected to remain well below relevant
prudential thresholds, but debt management will require smoothing out a 2013 spike in
the debt service schedule. The present value (PV) of public external debt is projected to rise
from 25.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 34.4 percent in 2011 before falling to 25.4 percent by
2019, thus remaining well under the relevant prudential threshold of 50 percent. The public
external debt service ratio is projected to remain well below the relevant prudential threshold
of 25 percent despite the spike up in 2013, which is the year when several large repayments
are bunched together. The two predominant repayments due in 2013 include the $500 million

Eurobond and the IMF SBA program. The ratio of public external debt service to exports is
expected to rise from 5.2 percent in 2009 to 7.9 percent in 2012 and then spike up to 18.8
percent in 2013, before falling back to 5.6 percent in 2014. The debt service to revenue ratio
also follows a similar pattern. Georgia will, therefore, have to evaluate its options to manage
the debt service schedule ahead of the amortization spike in 2013, with the authorities
indicating that they intend to tap the markets to refinance the Eurobond. The yield on the
Eurobond reached a low of 5.7 percent in April 2010 and has ticked up modestly in line with
those of other emerging markets; this, along with the fiscal adjustment program and the S&P
long-term sovereign rating upgrade for Georgia to B+ in April 2010, provides some indication
that Georgia has market access for this purpose.

35.      Under a number of alternative stress scenarios, debt burden indicators generally
remain below relevant prudential thresholds notwithstanding the spike in the debt
service ratio in 2013. Alternative stress scenarios explored include a lower GDP growth rate,
a higher interest rate on new public borrowing, lower export growth, a one-time depreciation,
and lower non debt-creating flows.4 For each debt burden indicator, the most extreme shock
is the stress scenario that yields the highest ratio in 2020. Under the most extreme shock of a
fall of non-debt creating flows to one standard deviation below its historical average, the PV
of public debt to GDP ratio temporarily rises to just above the prudential threshold of 50
percent for the years 2012-2014, but remains below the threshold for all other years and for all
other stress scenarios. The debt service to exports ratio also reaches its highest levels for the
shock to non-debt creating flows, but nevertheless remains well below the relevant prudential
threshold of 25 percent for all years, despite the spike to 19.5 percent in 2013.

Medium-term reform challenges for recovery and post-crisis growth

36.     As Georgia shows initial signs of recovery from the economic downturn, it faces
significant challenges in creating the conditions for post-crisis growth with an effective
social safety net. The double shocks of the August 2008 conflict and the global economic
crisis have undermined investor confidence and private capital inflows in Georgia. Beyond
the immediate mitigating measures, facilitating recovery and creating the conditions for
post-crisis growth in the medium term will require structural reforms to achieve a number of
key objectives.

37.    First, Georgia will need to improve the effectiveness with which its higher and
better allocated public expenditures are stimulating economic recovery and creating the
conditions for growth in the medium term. Given the scaling up and reallocation of public
expenditures, the priority at this point is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness with
which these inputs generate the necessary outputs to support economic recovery and to create
the conditions for growth in the medium term. Greater efficiency will also allow public
expenditures to be reduced over time and thereby free up resources for private investment to
again become the primary engine of economic growth.

38.   Second, Georgia will need to improve its external competitiveness, to facilitate
recovery and to ensure that post-crisis growth increasingly comes from the tradable

 The historical and baseline scenarios keep key exogenous variables (GDP growth, interest rate on new public
borrowing, export growth, exchange rate, and non debt-creating flows) at either their baseline projected levels or
at historical levels. The stress scenarios shock the variables by one standard deviation compared to the historical
average or, for the exchange rate shock, a one-time depreciation by 30 percent.

sectors, which is necessary for sustained growth over time. Georgia's export share of
GDP has remained relatively stable at about 31-34 percent during 2004 to mid-2008, with
growth driven primarily by non-tradables, including construction, telecommunications,
finance, and other services. While this is not uncommon in a transition economy beginning a
period of sustained economic growth, in order for growth to be sustained, Georgia needs to
further diversify economic activity into the tradable sector. This will require sufficient
exchange rate flexibility and further structural reforms to address impediments to external
competitiveness. A quick diagnosis of the business environment in Georgia indicates that two
dimensions along which Georgia lags its overall rating are the ease of paying taxes and the
costs of trading across borders.5 The DPO, therefore, supports reforms to reduce the
administrative burden of paying taxes on the private sector and to streamline customs
procedures to reduce the costs associated with importing and exporting.

39.     Third, Georgia will need to improve the effectiveness of its public investment
program aimed at developing the infrastructure necessary for sustained post-crisis
growth in the medium term. Georgia lags comparator countries in the EU-10 new member
states with regard to both the quantity and quality of infrastructure. Continuing to develop the
necessary infrastructure is also critical to improving external competitiveness. Public
investment currently plays a central role in developing infrastructure in Georgia--public
investment of 8.6 percent of GDP in 2008 exceeds that in most comparator countries and 40
percent of public investment is allocated to the new Ministry of Regional Development and
Infrastructure in the 2009 budget. The DPO, therefore, supports improvements in the
efficiency and effectiveness of the public investment program in Georgia. The objective is to
develop a multi-year public investment program which will allow Georgia to prepare,
prioritize, select, and monitor implementation of public investment projects.

40.     Finally, Georgia will need to continue improving the effectiveness of its social
safety net to protect the vulnerable and ensure that the benefits of growth in the medium
term are broadly shared. This will require both continued improvement in effectiveness of
social transfers, as well as improved access to health care through a strengthening of the
health care financing system. In the area of social transfers, the reforms support a two-
pronged strategy of continuing to improve the effectiveness of the targeted social assistance
program and to adopt a Strategy on the Social Safety Net which includes measures to
consolidate untargeted social transfers into the TSA program. In the area of health care as
well, the reforms support a two-pronged strategy to improve coverage of the medical
insurance program for the poor and the new publicly co-financed health insurance and to
strengthen public stewardship of the health insurance sector.


    III.     THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

41.     The Government's medium term reform program is described in its poverty
reduction strategy document entitled "United Georgia without Poverty", which was
approved on January 31, 2008, and thus predates the significant changes to the economic
environment following the August conflict and the global economic crisis. While this
strategy still provides the main directions of the Government's reform program, the pace and
emphasis of reforms have necessarily adjusted to reflect the impact of the double shocks to

the economy and the subsequent policy response. The main elements of the Government's
reform program are broadly supported by key political parties.

42.      The Government's response to the August conflict and the global economic crisis
has included: implementing counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary measures; safeguarding the
stability of the banking sector; addressing the needs of internally displaced people and others
affected by the conflict (including providing temporary shelter, food, medical attention, cash
support, and durable housing); swiftly repairing and rehabilitating damaged infrastructure,
and seeking and obtaining international support. In October 2008, a team led by the World
Bank and the United Nations (and including the collaboration of the ADB, EBRD, EC, EIB,
and IFC) prepared a Joint Needs Assessment (JNA), which led up to an International Donor
Conference in Brussels where Georgia received financial pledges from the international
community of $4.5 billion over three years, including $850 million for the banking sector.
These pledges have enabled Georgia to significantly scale up and reallocate public
expenditures toward addressing critical social and infrastructure investment needs.

43.    The Government prepares an annual strategy document titled Basic Data and
Directions (BDD), which outlines the medium term reform program and its objectives,
provides the medium-term macroeconomic framework, including the fiscal resource envelope
and fiscal allocations, and includes detailed descriptions of the individual sectoral strategies
for achieving these objectives. The Basic Data and Directions 2010-13 was prepared and
submitted to Parliament in May 2009 and the BDD for 2011-2014 is currently under
preparation.

44.    The overall strategic directions of the Government's economic reform program
include:

       Economic, Fiscal, and Monetary Policy: The objectives include (i) returning to a
       trajectory of sustained economic growth; (ii) maintaining macroeconomic stability
       (and safeguarding the financial sector) with low to moderate inflation over the
       medium term; (iii) continuing to reduce the burden of the state and improving public
       service delivery by reducing tax rates, reducing the share of state budgetary
       expenditure as a share of GDP, and improving the efficiency of public finances.

       Support for social needs: The objectives include strengthening the social safety net by
       expanding the coverage and improving the targeting of social assistance; expanding
       access to health care financing for the poor; improving living conditions for new and
       existing IDPs; and restructuring and rehabilitating water supply and sewage systems
       throughout the country.

       Support for critical infrastructure: The objectives include upgrading transport and
       trade logistics infrastructure (including priority for the E-W Highway and other
       segments in the South and West); and enhancing energy reliability, including
       attracting donor and private investment to support a new power transmission line and
       increased hydropower generation.

       Education: The objectives are to upgrade the skills of the labor force, including by
       bringing all public schools into line with modern standards, enhancing teacher


                                              16
       training, and strengthening the quality of universities in line with international
       standards.

       Rural productivity: The objectives are to increase productivity in agriculture through
       rehabilitating irrigation systems and assisting farmers with critical inputs; and to
       promote agribusiness and agroprocessing to help create jobs.

       Upgrading institutions: The objectives are to strengthen the rule of law, modernize the
       enforcement system, and improve mechanisms to protect property rights; and to
       enhance government effectiveness and transparency by establishing measurable
       parameters for evaluating performance, improving budgetary and treasury processes,
       and strengthening the system of asset declaration and code of ethics of public servants.

45.     The Government has recently enhanced its communication effort to explain its
policies to the public and has received support from the Bank in this regard. Better
communication of the overall reform program as well as specific policies has been identified
as an important need in Georgia. The recent communication and public outreach efforts have
responded to this need and have taken several forms. At a broad level, the President is
making biannual presentations on the state of the nation to Parliament, which includes a
question and answer session. The Government has also taken on a broad program to better
explain is services, programs, and policies to the public, through media presentations,
brochures, and other means, with the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet directly
reaching out to the public. Some of the specific public outreach efforts have been directly
supported by the DPO program. The Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs conducted
a public outreach effort to raise awareness about and explain the mechanics and benefits of
various social programs, including targeted social assistance (TSA). Similarly, in the area of
e-filing of taxes, the Revenue Service conducted an extensive public outreach effort to
encourage wider adoption of e-filing. At a broader level, the Government of Georgia has
teamed up with the World Bank and the IFC to launch a series of discussions on key policy
issues with a broad spectrum of stakeholders.


           IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINK TO CPS AND OTHER BANK TASKS
46.      Link to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The proposed DPO series is a
central component of the Country Partnership Strategy for Georgia covering 2010-2013. The
CPS is built upon a two-pillar approach to the Bank's engagement with Georgia, including (i)
meeting post-conflict and vulnerability needs; and (ii) strengthening competitiveness for post-
crisis recovery and growth. These overarching objectives in the CPS reflect the objectives of
the Government's reform program under the current economic environment. The DPO covers
the core sectors targeted for Bank Group support, and the reforms supported by the DPO
program are complemented by technical assistance and investments in essential infrastructure
and service delivery, public sector financial management, health, and energy.

47.    Link to AAA. The reforms supported by the DPO program have built upon a
foundation of extensive Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) by the Bank, including the
Public Expenditure Review (PER) in 2003; the Integrated Trade Development Study (2003);
Pension and Social Assistance Note (2005), various Doing Business Reports, the Financial

                                              17
Sector Assessment Program Update (2006), the draft Country Procurement Assessment
(2007), and the Programmatic Poverty Assessment (2008), and the Bank-EC Joint PEFA
(2008).     Earlier Programmatic Poverty Assessment activities (FY05, 06, 07) have
concentrated on building capacity to track poverty and Programmatic Public Finance
activities (FY05, 06, 07) have covered recent developments and issues in public finance and
challenges in intergovernmental finances. Ongoing work on the Programmatic Public
Expenditure Review (PPER) is directed at identifying policy options to implement fiscal
adjustment, while improving the efficiency with which public expenditures deliver quality
public services, provide an effective social safety net, and meet significant infrastructure
development needs. The analysis of the PPER will complement the dialogue of the DPO
program, particularly on the macro-fiscal framework as well as budgetary reforms to improve
the efficiency of public expenditures. Similarly, the ongoing work under the programmatic
poverty assessment is complementing the dialogue on the reforms to the social safety net.

48.      Link to Other Bank Operations. The Public Sector Financial Management Reform
Support Project which is directed at assisting the Government in addressing the capacity
constraints of key public sector agencies will also support implementation of DPO reforms.
In the context of streamlining the tax payment system, the Tax Modernization Project
currently under preparation will support implementation of different components of the
DPO-3 reforms. The reforms to the statistics system are being supported by a trust fund on
statistical capacity building, which is helping the newly independent statistical office conduct
a needs assessment and develop a statistical master plan. Similarly, the health sector reforms
supported in the DPO program have a direct link with the ongoing Primary Health Care
Development Project.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
49.     The Government has maintained satisfactory macroeconomic performance in
line with the IMF Standby Arrangement (SBA) and the DPO program. In the aftermath
of the August 2008 conflict, an IMF mission prepared a Standby Arrangement (SBA) for
$750 million over 18 months to bolster investor confidence and support international reserves,
which was approved by the IMF Board in September 2008. The SBA program was
subsequently augmented by $400 million and extended to July 2011 as part of the Third
Review in August 2009. The Fifth Review of the SBA was completed on March 19, 2010 and
indicated that signs of economic recovery were becoming more evident, sustained by an
improved external environment and supportive macroeconomic policies. The Sixth Review
of the SBA is scheduled for July 9, 2010. The Bank and the Fund teams are closely
coordinating their monitoring of macroeconomic developments, technical assistance, and
assessment of the macroeconomic framework.

50.    The DPO program has been designed in close coordination with other donors and
with the private sector and NGOs in Georgia. In designing and monitoring implementation
of the DPO program, the Bank has coordinated with the Netherlands Embassy (which is co-
financing the operation), the Macro-Financial Assistance and sectoral budget support
programs of the European Commission, and the budgetary support programs of the Asian
Development Bank. These donors are supporting the Georgia in a number of complementary
areas. The Netherlands Government supports Georgia in the areas of governance and
oversight institutions. The program of the EC, in addition to macro-financial assistance,
includes support in public financial management, intergovernmental fiscal relations, auditing,
and administrative reform. The ADB provided budgetary support in the aftermath of the
                                              18
crisis in 2008 and 2009 and is expected to provide further budgetary support in 2010. The
ADB has also been supporting the banking sector and infrastructure projects. The Bank also
consults with the private sector and civil society groups in Georgia and these consultations
have influenced design and preparation of the DPO program.

51.     The Government's program is supported by other development partners in the
following areas. The program of USAID includes support in the areas of budgeting,
Treasury management, governance, anti-corruption, private sector development, agriculture,
sanitary/food safety, energy, and education. The program of SIDA includes support in public
sector, governance reform, agriculture, natural resources, the environment, health, and
education. The program of the UNDP includes support in the areas of administrative/civil
service reform, customs reform, and poverty monitoring. The program of DFID included
support in MTEF and health sector budget management but has been phased out since
February 2009. The EBRD focuses on investment promotion, municipal development and
energy. GTZ support is in the areas of legal and judiciary system, performance audit capacity
building at the CCG, land management, and private sector development, while the KfW
focuses on energy. The MCC program includes rehabilitation of key regional infrastructure,
delivery of regional and municipal services, tourism and agribusiness.

LESSONS LEARNED
52.     The formulation of the DPO program draws on the lessons learned from
successful implementation of the PRSO program, previous development policy operations,
as well as overall IDA support to the reform process in Georgia. The policy dialogue between
IDA and the Government of Georgia has had a strong focus on public sector reform, anti-
corruption and governance issues.

53.     Specifically, design and preparation of the DPO program has taken on board the
following factors which underpinned the success of the PRSO program. First, the
Government had strong ownership of the reform program and led the reforms, with IDA
playing a catalytic and supportive role (see Box 1). Second, the operation was well defined
and focused on priority issues where the medium-term strategy is well understood and
accepted by the Government. Third, any reform program was grounded in a realistic
assessment of the Government's implementation capacity. Careful balancing of these three
factors resulted in a well-focused and sequenced program, supported by well-coordinated
donor technical assistance. Increasing the Government's implementation capacity and
leveraging World Bank Group resources through other donors are critical elements in the
design of IDA's assistance program in Georgia.

                               Box 1. Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
  Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
  The Government has strong ownership of the proposed DPO, which supports several dimensions of the
  Government's reform agenda where the Bank has comparative advantage and complements the work being
  supported by other development partners. Furthermore, the proposed operation is in line with Georgia's medium
  term structural reform program. The proposed DPO follows successful in implementation of the PRSO program,
  which demonstrates Georgia's track record of significant Government ownership and strong commitment to the
  reform process. The Bank's analytic work has contributed to the formulation and implementation of selected
  aspects of the Government's reform program.
  Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
  framework
  At the core of the accountability framework is the operations policy matrix outlining actions over the medium-
  term with clear and monitorable outcome indicators developed jointly with the Georgian government during
  preparation of the DPO program. Lessons from the PRSO program show that the policy matrix may evolve over
  time to reflect that reforms exceed program expectations so that the program is able to adjust to the emerging
  reform priorities. The reform program benefits from close coordination and consultations with other
  development partners including the IMF, the Netherlands Government, US Treasury, the European Commission,
  the ADB, USAID, SIDA, KfW, GTZ, and EBRD (see Section IV). The program supports important features of
  Georgia's Action Plan under the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP). The EC plans to provide financing
  under its Macroeconomic Financial Agreement. The ADB is expected to provide budgetary support.
  Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
  circumstances
  The DPO team works closely with Government counterparts from various ministries in designing and monitoring
  reform implementation. The agreed accountability framework is fully consistent with the Government's
  expressed policy intentions and internal accountability mechanisms. Further, the program focuses on outcome-
  oriented actions, since that is the best way to calibrate the series of reforms that are necessary to achieve program
  objectives.
  Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
  The DPO program focuses on actions that are critical for the success of the reform which it supports. All triggers
  take the form of prior actions agreed upon with full participation of the Government and reflect the reform
  priorities of the Georgian Government which are supported by the Bank in the CPS.
  Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
  support
  Progress made with the implementation of reforms and achievement of outcome goals is monitored on a regular
  basis: a progress matrix, which outlines the status of reforms and outcome indicators, is updated and reviewed
  periodically. The DPO program's financial support is expected to provide predictable budget support to the
  Government on a timely basis which is allowing its inclusion in the annual budget. As such, the proposed DPO
  support is fully consistent with the Government's macroeconomic framework and the 2010 budget.




V.       THE PROPOSED SECOND DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION (DPO-2)

54.    The proposed DPO-2 is directed at supporting an orderly transition in the focus
of the reforms from immediate measures to mitigate the impact of the economic
downturn toward facilitating recovery and preparing the conditions for post-crisis
growth. Toward addressing these dual challenges facing Georgia, the proposed DPO-2
program supports a satisfactory macroeconomic and fiscal framework and key reforms in
three policy areas: (i) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public finances; (ii)
improving the effectiveness of the social safety net; and (iii) improving external
competitiveness.

55.     The reforms supported by the proposed DPO-2 contribute to ensuring that the
transition out of the immediate mitigating measures continues to back economic

                                                          20
recovery and address the needs of the vulnerable in a number of ways. First, under the
macroeconomic and fiscal framework, significant fiscal adjustment to safeguard sustainability
as economic recovery takes hold during 2010-12 is being implemented in a manner that
protects important social and infrastructure investments expenditures. This adjustment
follows the scaling up of public expenditures in these areas as part of the countercyclical
fiscal stimulus to mitigate the downturn during 2008-2009. Second, the higher level of the
targeted social assistance (TSA) benefit and the expanded coverage of the targeted medical
insurance program (MIP) are being maintained and the coverage of the new publicly
co-financed health insurance program is being expanded for those not covered by MIP.

56.     The reforms supported by the proposed DPO-2 facilitate recovery and prepare
Georgia for post-crisis growth in the medium term through a number of additional
channels. First, improvements in the efficiency of public expenditures are directed at
ensuring that public expenditures continue to effectively support economic recovery and
create the conditions for growth in the medium term. This will also free up resources to
finance private sector growth in an environment where foreign capital inflows are expected to
remain scarce. Second, the effectiveness of public investment is being enhanced to create the
infrastructure necessary for sustained economic growth in the medium term. Third, the
effectiveness of the social safety net is being improved to ensure that the benefits of growth in
the medium term are broadly shared. Fourth, tax, customs, and trade-related reforms are
improving external competitiveness by further reducing the burden of tax payment,
streamlining customs procedures, and creating the pre-conditions for improved access of
Georgian products to world markets.

PILLAR 1: IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PUBLIC
FINANCES

57.     Public expenditures and revenues increased substantially in Georgia in the four
years leading up to the August 2008 crisis. The level of expenditures increased by almost
five times between 2003 and 2007, rising from 17.5 percent of GDP ($700 million) in 2003 to
34 percent of GDP ($3.46 billion) in 2007. Furthermore, expenditures on health, education,
and social protection increased from 4 percent of GDP in 2003 to 8.2 percent in 2007, while
capital expenditures increased from 2.8 percent of GDP ($110 million) in 2003 to 9.0 percent
($900 million) in 2007.6 These increases were, however, outpaced by increases in
expenditures on general public services and defense during 2003-07. The increase in
expenditures was supported by an increase in tax revenues from 14.6 percent of GDP in 2003
to 25.8 percent of GDP in 2007. Although the overall fiscal deficit widened from 1.8 percent
of GDP in 2003 to 4.8 percent in 2007, this was more than fully financed by increases in
privatization proceeds from 0.4 percent of GDP in 2003 to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2007. Thus,
the fiscal deficit was financed in a non-inflationary manner and without crowding out private
investment.

58.    In order to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn, public expenditures in
the social sectors and infrastructure were scaled up in 2008-09 to implement a
countercyclical fiscal stimulus. Public expenditures increased from 34 percent of GDP in
2007 to 37 percent in 2008 and 38.6 percent in 2009. Health, education, and social protection

6
  The figures for social expenditures are from the state budget only, whereas the figures for capital expenditures
are from the consolidated budget.

                                                       21
expenditures increased from 8.2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 11.4 percent in 2009. Over the
same period, defense expenditures declined sharply from 8.8 percent of GDP in 2007 to 4.8
percent in 2009. Thus, there has been a marked shift in the composition of spending from
defense outlays toward social expenditures (including addressing the needs of internally
displaced people), and infrastructure investments. Revenue collection suffered from the
economic downturn, with tax revenues falling from 25.8 percent of GDP in 2007 to 24.5
percent in 2009. As a result, increased expenditures in 2008-09 were financed by higher
grants and other budgetary support, as the overall fiscal deficit increased to 9.2 percent of
GDP in 2009 and privatization proceeds fell to 2.3 percent of GDP.

59.     In order to support economic recovery and create the conditions for post-crisis
growth in the medium term, improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of public
finances are a critical priority for Georgia. Given the substantial scaling up of public
expenditures in recent years and the important shifts in composition of spending that have
taken place, a critical priority for Georgia is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
public finances. This will contribute to a number of objectives. First, it will ensure that the
higher expenditures are contributing effectively to Georgia's growth and poverty reduction
priorities. Second, with the authorities committed to significant fiscal adjustment during
2010-13, efficiency improvements will ensure that adjustment takes place in a manner that
protects important social and infrastructure expenditures and continues to support economic
recovery and post-crisis growth. Third, greater efficiency will facilitate adjustment in the
level of public expenditures over time and thereby expedite the process of re-establishing
private investment as the engine for accelerating economic growth in the medium term.

60.    In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public finances, the DPO
proposes to support reforms in the areas of (i) improving the efficiency and effectiveness
of public expenditures; and (ii) increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the public
investment program.

Improve efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures

Public Financial Management Framework
61.     Improving the efficiency of public finances in Georgia requires coordinated
progress along a number of different areas of public financial management. Under the
support of DPO-1, the Georgian authorities developed a strategy on public finances (known as
the Public Financial Management Reform Policy Vision 2009-2013) to provide a framework
for the coordination of reforms and an integrated approach to strengthening the public finance
system. The PFM Reform Vision was developed as a follow up to the findings and
recommendations of the PEFA (2008).7 The Strategy coordinates reforms in the following
areas: strategic budgeting, budget preparation and approval, resource management, internal
control, and accounting and reporting. The reform agenda in these areas requires technical
assistance and capacity building that are being supported by the Public Sector Financial
Management Reform Support Project. The DPO focuses on supporting priority policy
reforms in the areas of results-oriented budgeting, the public investment program, and tax and
customs. Beyond the specific policy reforms in these areas, it is important for Georgia to
have a framework for coordinating the substantial agenda for reforms in the PFM area.

7
 The findings of the PEFA report and the overall state of the PFM environment are discussed in further detail in
section VI.

                                                      22
62.      The proposed DPO-2 supports the following policy action in this area:
         Enacted a Budget Code to unify the legal framework for budgeting at all levels, as part
         of implementation of the Public Finance Management Reform Strategy.

63.    A priority reform implemented under the PFM Reform Strategy is development
of a new Budget Code, approved by Parliament on December 1, 2009. The new Budget
Code unifies the existing legal framework for budgeting at all levels; and better integrates the
BDD, results-oriented budgets, and the public investment program into the annual budget
cycle, making each of these a legal requirement for all spending units by 2012. The Budget
Code is expected to provide an impetus to the results-oriented and public investment
budgeting reforms being supported by the DPO.

64.    The Ministry of Finance has strong ownership of the PFM Reform Strategy and
has adopted it as an operational document. The strategy contains an associated Reform
Action Plan, which lists specific reform activities along with the timeline for completion and
the responsible implementing department. The Minister of Finance presented the Progress
Report on the Action Plan for 2009 in October, which indicated sound progress in
implementation in several areas--a range of key reforms were completed or are underway in
the areas of budgeting, resource management, accounting and reporting, internal audit, and
external audit. The Action Plan for 2010 was presented on April 1, 2010 at the first meeting
of the PFM Reform Implementation Coordination Council established as per the Ministerial
Decree of 03/30/2010. The authorities intend to annually update the PFM Reform Strategy to
incorporate lessons learned on the coordination of reforms and also report on implementation
of the updated action plan. The updates to the strategy and action plan would include any
necessary rebalancing in the prioritization and coordination of public finance reforms.

65.     Under the support of DPO-3, the authorities would approve a new methodology for
program budgeting, including guidelines for capital budgeting, as part of implementation of
the Budget Code. This new methodology would enable full integration of program and
capital budgeting into the Annual Budget Law starting from the 2012 budget cycle.

Improved results-orientation of the budget
66.     Georgia has made significant progress since 2004 in aligning public expenditures
with national development priorities, although there is room for improvement in better
formulating sector strategies and monitoring progress. Prior to the public finance policy
reforms initiated in 2004, Georgia had neither a systematic approach to budget planning nor a
statement of national objectives, with the result that there were no links between budgetary
allocations and development priorities. Significant progress has been made since then in this
area. Budget planning is now done on a four year cycle through a Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF). The starting point is the Basic Data and Directions (BDD) document
which outlines national development objectives and shows the links to the budget. The
MTEF has included all spending units since 2006, although the quality of sectoral strategies
and links to budgetary allocations varies across spending units.

67.     Budget preparation in Georgia still focuses heavily on inputs allocated and
greater attention is needed in better connecting allocations to measurable development
results in order to further improve the effectiveness of public expenditures. Introduction
of the MTEF has improved the strategic planning process, with spending units laying out their

                                               23
strategic goals and objectives in the BDD document. However, the strategic objectives are
often stated in broad terms and are not easily measurable. To address this problem and to
increase the accountability for results, there is a need to now focus on developing improved
measurable indicators of program performance as part of the budget submission, as well as to
monitor progress by later reporting on actual performance against the indicators.

68.     An enhanced results-orientation of the budget would increase the focus on
outputs generated beyond a mere focus on inputs or resources allocated. This would
create pressures within the budgetary process to reallocate resources both intersectorally
across ministries and intrasectorally within ministries. Thus, a results-oriented budget would
create the embedded incentives to improve efficiency in the use of resources and delivery of
public services.

69.     The DPO supports development of results-oriented budgeting in Georgia through
a multi-year, stepwise process. Although the generation of meaningful performance
indicators and their effective use in the budget process will take time, the DPO sets in motion
a process by which spending units identify measurable results and then report on them in a
structured manner. Capacity in most line ministries is weak, but the MoF is providing
guidance on a methodology and initially insisted on indicators for only one program for one
year. By starting with only a few first-level spending units, the MoF is calibrating
implementation of results-oriented budgeting with its capacity to provide guidance. A few of
the first-level spending units have also benefited from EU-sponsored technical assistance on
multi-year planning and budgeting. The goal is to build capacity and ownership over time,
and to create incentives for ministries to identify poorly performing programs and to take
appropriate actions.

70.     The first step (DPO-1) involved piloting results-oriented budgets for at least one
program in three first-level spending units. The budgets outlined strategic priorities,
costing of priorities, and performance indicators for the various activities supported by the
program. In fact, five pilot first-level spending units (Ministries of Agriculture, Justice,
Health, Education, and Culture) were asked to submit results-oriented budgets for the 2009
budget cycle. Although the pilot submissions were of varying quality and were not
incorporated into the actual budget document, they provided a structure for budget planners
and policymakers within the ministries involved to connect budgetary allocations to more
precisely formulated outputs.

71.      The proposed DPO-2 supports the following policy action in this area:
         Submitted to Parliament an Information Annex to the Annual Budget Law of 2010
         containing results-oriented budgets for three government first-level spending units and
         expanded their coverage across government programs.

72.     In the second step (DPO-2), the objective is to incorporate results-oriented
budgets of improved quality and coverage for three first-level spending units as an
information annex to the Annual Budget Law. An inter-agency Working Group, led by the
Head of the Budget Department and including representatives from six line ministries
(Justice, Health, Education, Finance, Probation, and Agriculture), was formed by Ministerial
Decree in March 2009 to work on preparing improved results-oriented budgets for 2010. The
budget circular for the 2010 budget preparation was updated to include three new forms
dedicated to results and performance indicators.

                                               24
73.      The Annual Budget Law for 2010 included an Information Annex incorporating
results-oriented budgets for three ministries (Justice, Education, and Health). For each
spending unit, the information annex presents: (i) a list of strategic priorities; (ii) for each
strategic priority, a brief description of the state of affairs and a list of programs; (iii) for each
program, budget allocations for 2010-2013, a brief description of purpose, a list of expected
results, and a list of performance indicators. Compared to the results-oriented budgets piloted
as part of the 2009 budget preparation process, the presentation in the Information Annex
submitted for 2010 is more systematic and coverage has expanded across programs. At the
same time, there is much room for further improving quality, including through developing
better measurable indicators of program performance. The Ministry of Finance has prepared
a document (for approval by cabinet) with a timeline to establish results-oriented budgets for
all spending units by 2012, as required by the new budget code. An IMF mission provided
technical assistance on next steps in program budgeting in April 2010 and the authorities have
also requested support on program budgeting through the Bank's public sector project.

74.     In the third step (DPO-3), the focus would be on strengthening the quality of the
performance indicators by building on an assessment of actual versus planned
performance of the prior year, as well as extending coverage to five spending units. The
reporting process would include an explanation of factors that contributed to any major
differences in actual versus planned performance along with appropriate mitigating actions for
the future. The MoF would continue to play a critical supporting role by providing feedback
to the ministries on the content and completeness of their performance reports.

75.     As a result of the reforms supported in this area, the medium-term outcomes
expected include: (i) increase in the share of the budget and number of first-level spending
units covered by results-oriented budgeting, and in the number of spending units that report
on performance. Over time, this is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
public expenditures in Georgia.

Increase efficiency and effectiveness of public investment program

76.     Public investment has increased significantly in Georgia since 2004; with the
sharp decline in private investment since mid-2008, the role of public investment in
infrastructure development and creating the conditions for post-crisis growth has risen
markedly. Public investment has increased significantly in recent years, rising from 2.8
percent of GDP in 2003 to 9 percent in 2007. However, the share of public investment
allocated to defense and internal affairs increased significantly in the pre-crisis period, from
26 percent in 2006 to 39 percent in 2007 and 55 percent in 2008. Following the August 2008
conflict, public investment was reallocated toward basic infrastructure development, with the
share going to defense and internal affairs falling markedly to 29 percent in 2009. Since
private investment had begun to play an increasingly important role in infrastructure
development in Georgia in the pre-crisis period, the collapse of private investment and FDI
since August 2008 has resulted in a marked rise in the role of public investment in
infrastructure development and creating the conditions for post-crisis growth. The overall
level of public investment has remained high at 8.4 percent of GDP in 2009 to balance the fall
in private investment, mitigate the economic downturn, facilitate recovery, and sustain
infrastructure development.



                                                 25
77.     Georgia faces substantial infrastructure development needs for sustained growth
in the medium term and public investment now plays a central role in developing this
necessary infrastructure. In order to generate sustained growth in the post-crisis period,
Georgia faces very substantial infrastructure development needs. As discussed in the DPO-1
program document, Georgia lags comparator countries in the ECA region with regard to the
quantity of available infrastructure (based on an index of transport, energy, and
telecommunications infrastructure). A similar lag is found in looking at the index of
infrastructure quality. Public investment plays a central role in developing this infrastructure.
According to the 2009 state budget, 37 percent of public investment was undertaken by the
Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure.

78.     Given the scaling up of public investment in recent years and its allocation to
areas broadly supportive of growth, the priority at this point is to improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of the public investment. Public investment in Georgia (at 8.4 percent of
GDP in 2009) exceeds that in most other comparator countries: 5.8 percent in Ireland, 3.5
percent in Romania, and 3.4 percent in Armenia. Furthermore, as discussed above, public
investment has been allocated to areas that are broadly supportive of economic growth. The
priority at this point, therefore, is for Georgia to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
its public investment so that the investments undertaken are most effective in creating the
conditions for sustained growth in the post-crisis period.

79.     The DPO proposes to support improvement in public investment efficiency
through development of a multi-year public investment program in which project
priorities and multi-year funding requirements are elaborated in a single document.8 At
present, Georgia does not possess such an integrated and systematic multi-year public
investment program which could be used as a decision-making tool by policymakers both
within and across sectors in selecting investment projects. Such a tool would also allow
decision makers to identify peaks and troughs in future investment plans and provide an early
warning system about potentially unaffordable ambitions in future years. The program would
also show foreign investors and the development community that Georgia uses a systematic
approach to direct its public investment toward projects that are supportive of growth and
poverty reduction.

80.     Developing the public investment program is expected to progressively
strengthen the system of preparing, selecting, and monitoring public investment
projects. It aims to do this by improving the guidance on project preparation issued by the
MoF to the major spending units and by enhancing the transparency and accountability for
project implementation. The DPO builds upon other budget planning reforms underway in
Georgia (such as the MTEF) and integrates where possible the public investment program
within this framework. Although individual investment decisions are often decentralized to
line ministries, the DPO encourages the MoF to set standards and guidelines for project
analysis and reporting that will create incentives for a more efficient and effective
management of public investment resources.

81.   Although Georgia has not yet developed methodical capital budgeting systems, it
nevertheless performs better than is commonly understood in managing its public

8
  The multi-year public investment program would include past and future expenditure for planned and ongoing
investment projects and a summary of investment expenditure by category for each spending unit covered.

                                                    26
investments. For example, the Municipal Development Fund (MDF), with well developed
systems of preparing, selecting, and implementing projects, handles a significant share of
public investment in Georgia. The Roads Department of the new Ministry of Regional
Development and Infrastructure makes use of the HDM4 software which enables it to conduct
economic analyses of proposed road projects. Still, there exists much room for further
improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of public investment in Georgia.

82.     The reform supported by DPO-1 in this area set in motion a process by which
Georgia prepared to develop a multi-year public investment program along three
parallel dimensions. First, as part of the 2009 budget preparation cycle, the budget circular
was revised to include proposals on non-financial assets. This was part of the effort to ensure
that information on public investment projects is collected in an effective and systematic
manner. Second, the MoF introduced a training program in capital budgeting principles in
budget departments to prepare, assess, and manage investment projects. Third, in April/May
2009, five first-level spending units (Roads Department, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of
Probation, Municipal Development Fund, and City of Tbilisi) piloted preparation of public
investment program summaries based on the already-approved 2009 budget, thus exceeding
the original target of pilots in two first-level spending units. An inter-agency Working Group,
led by the Head of the Budget Department and including representatives from select line
ministries, was formed by Ministerial Decree in March 2009 to work on developing the public
investment program.

83.      The proposed DPO-2 supports the following policy action in this area:
         Developed a multi-year public investment program by: (a) revising budget circular to
         include public investment proposals; (b) developing guidelines for preparing,
         submitting, and selecting public investment proposals above defined thresholds; and
         (c) preparing a public investment program information summary, as an Annex to
         Annual Budget Law for 2010.

84.     The proposed DPO-2 supports the development of the multi-year public
investment program along a number of dimensions. The budget circular for the 2010
Annual Budget preparation was revised to include new forms dedicated to preparing public
investment budgets and included guidelines for preparing, submitting, and selecting project
proposals above a defined threshold. The Annual Budget Law for 2010 includes an
Information Annex on the public investment program for two spending units (Roads
Department and Ministry of Finance). For each spending unit, the information annex
presents: (i) a list of projects with past and planned expenditures; and (ii) for each project, a
brief description of purpose and a table of sources of financing and some rudimentary
categorization of expenditures. The MoF is currently developing a work plan directed at
improving the quality of the public investment budgets and has review examples of
international best practice with a view to extracting lessons relevant for Georgia.

85.     Under the support of the third DPO, the multi-year public investment program
would be strengthened by extending coverage to a majority of public investment and by
reporting on actual versus planned project implementation. At this stage, the public
investment program summary would also be incorporated as an Annex to the BDD document
as well as the Annual Budget Law. As a result, decision makers will be able to see the types
of public investment projects that are planned by each first-level spending unit, the past
spending on the project (for ongoing projects), and the annual spending projection for each of
                                               27
the years covered by the MTEF. Moreover, opportunities to understand factors that affect the
quality of project execution would increase as some spending units begin reporting on actual
versus planned implementation of projects for 2010. This reporting mechanism would
increase accountability for project implementation and strengthen the incentives for ministries
to improve efficiency and effectiveness of their public investment programs.

86.    As a result of the reforms supported under this pillar, the medium-term
outcomes expected include: (i) improved programming of public investment over a medium
term horizon; (ii) improvement in the system of preparing, prioritizing, selecting, and
monitoring implementation of public investment projects; and (iii) gradual increase in the
share of public investment projects subject to economic and technical analysis.


PILLAR 2: IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET

87.     The overall objective of reforms under this pillar is to continue to improve the
effectiveness of the social safety net to both mitigate the impact of the economic
downturn and to ensure that the benefits of growth going forward are broadly shared.
Georgia has taken important steps toward developing a social safety net by putting in place a
social assistance program targeted to the extreme poor and a medical assistance program
targeted to the poor. Georgia also has significant other social transfers, including pensions
and assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs), which together with targeted social
assistance (TSA), accounted for 4.6 percent of GDP in 2007. In order to mitigate the impact
of the economic downturn, higher fiscal outlays have increased coverage and benefit amounts
of the social safety net in the short term, with public expenditures in social protection rising to
7 percent of GDP in the 2009. In the medium term, improved access of the poor to the social
safety net is expected to come from improved targeting and coverage.

88.     In the area of health care, the challenge for Georgia is to identify fiscally
sustainable measures to improve access to health care and protection against health care
costs exceeding some threshold share of household consumption. Coverage of the
Medical Insurance Program (MIP) targeted to the poor has been scaled up and a new publicly
co-financed program has been introduced to expand coverage of health insurance in the
medium term. The MIP has improved access to health care for those covered, although a
significant share of the poor are not covered and thus lack access to health care services and
protection against health care costs exceeding some threshold share of household
consumption. Coverage of the new co-financed insurance program is progressively being
expanded. Public health expenditures accounted for 1.85 percent of GDP in 2009.

89.     In order to address the challenges outlined above under this pillar, the DPO
proposes to support reforms in the areas of: (i) continuing to improve effectiveness of
social transfers, including the targeted social assistance program; and (ii) improving access to
health care through fiscally sustainable strengthening of the health care financing system.

Continue to improve effectiveness of social transfers, including the targeted social
assistance program

90.   Georgia's system of social transfers reaches about two-thirds of the population
and includes pensions, assistance to IDPs, targeted social assistance, and a number of

                                                28
smaller cash transfer programs. Pensions are by far the largest (almost 75 percent) of
social transfers, followed by targeted social assistance (14 percent) and assistance to IDPs.
Fiscal outlays for social transfers have increased in the aftermath of the economic downturn,
rising from 4.6 percent of GDP in 2007 to 6 percent in 2008 and an estimated 7 percent in
2009. Social protection spending is projected to be flat in 2010 as the economic environment
begins to improve.

91.     Social transfers are important for poverty reduction: simulations indicate that
poverty would be much higher without the transfers. According to the findings of the
Poverty Assessment, without social transfers, poverty in 2007 would have been 35 percent
instead of 23.7 percent (higher by 50 percent), while extreme poverty would have been 20.3
percent instead of 9.3 percent (higher by more than 100 percent). Pensions, given their large
size, deliver most of the poverty reduction impact of social transfers. Targeted social
assistance (TSA) contributes to poverty reduction as well, but because of the relatively small
size of the program, the impact is smaller. Without TSA, the overall and extreme poverty
rates would have been higher by 6 and 17 percent, respectively. Estimates based on a more
recent UNICEF survey indicate that in 2009, poverty would have been 7 percent higher (27.5
percent vs. 25.7 percent) without TSA and 52 percent higher (39.1 percent vs. 25.7 percent)
without pensions.

92.     While the TSA program is well targeted, its coverage is limited but increasing. In
2007, 65% of TSA beneficiary households were in the (pre-transfer) bottom quintile,
indicating a well targeted program. Yet, TSA only covered about 22% of households in the
bottom quintile. The TSA budget has increased since then, with implications for both
indicators. A UNICEF Welfare Monitoring Survey conducted in 2009 indicates that 62% of
beneficiary households were in the bottom quintile, while coverage had risen to 27%.
International experience with similar programs suggests that this pattern is common: as
programs expand to improve coverage, there will be some deterioration in targeting.

93.     In the medium term, improving the targeting and effectiveness of social transfers
will increase access for the poor and in particular, the extreme poor. This can be
achieved through two means. The first is to further improve effectiveness of the part of social
transfers that is already targeted (i.e. TSA), by implementing various measures (such as the
DPO-2 supported reform actions described below) to focus the program more on the extreme
poor and ensure that the increased budgetary allocation reaches the target population
effectively. The second is to begin targeting of those social transfer programs that are still
untargeted. One such large program is a monthly payment to about 220,000 IDPs. While
overall consensus to widen targeting of social transfers is still being developed, some progress
is being made in this direction by transferring administration of the IDP allowance and other
cash transfers to the Social Services Agency and integrating their budgets into the MoLHSA.
Eventually, the key challenge regarding the range of untargeted social transfers, including
IDP allowance, is to move from categorical eligibility of the various covered groups toward
needs-based targeting.

94.    In order to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn, DPO-1 supported an
increase in both the coverage of the TSA program and the amount of the TSA benefit.
Coverage of the TSA program increased from 131,182 families in December 2008 to 155,497
families in April 2009. In addition, the Government increased the amount of the TSA benefit:
the base benefit has remained at GEL 30 per month but the top-up per family member was

                                              29
doubled from GEL 12 to GEL 24 per month as of January 1, 2009. Adequate funding was
secured for the increased coverage and benefit amount. The budget allocation for the TSA
was increased from GEL 126 mln in 2008 to GEL 160 mln in 2009, and will be maintained at
that level in 2010. These changes have been an important component of the government's
response to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn.

95.     In addition, DPO-1 supported a number of measures to improve the effectiveness
of social transfers. These included transferring administration of IDP benefits and child
welfare allowances to the Social Services Agency and integrating their budgets into the
MoLHSA. Consolidated administration of social transfers was intended to enable better
cross-checks and verification of information needed to award cash benefits, thus resulting in
efficiency gains through reduced leakage of resources. Consolidation of program budgets into
the MoLHSA allowed for better planning and management of resources allocated to social
transfers. The MoLHSA has also prepared a report on the performance of the TSA program
to inform TSA improvements.

96.      The proposed DPO-2 supports the following policy actions in this area:
         Improved the effectiveness of targeted social assistance (TSA) by: (a) adjusting the
         proxy-means testing formula; (b) improving business processes related to TSA
         administration; (c) implementing a public information campaign; and (d) restarting
         recertification of TSA beneficiaries.

97.     Good progress has been made in implementing the different measures to improve
the effectiveness of the targeted social assistance program. First, the monitoring survey
was completed in October and discussed by various stakeholders (including Parliament) in
November-December. Based on the report, SSA compiled a list of recommendations which
have been approved by Cabinet, with implementation beginning June 1. Measures include a
greater role for communities in reviewing eligibility, and the exclusion of certain assets from
the proxy-means testing formula. Second, SSA continues to improve its business processes
on several fronts, including network, software, and hardware development, rehabilitating local
offices, and simplifying procedures for social worker evaluation of applicant households, with
the result that waiting times between application and receipt of benefits are being cut in half,
from six to three months. Third, SSA has conducted numerous ongoing outreach activities,
including developing TV and radio programs to inform the public and events in rayons to
explain programs to the public, with an emphasis on transparency of the database and
application procedures. These will continue in 2010. Fourth, ongoing re-certification of
beneficiaries started in August on a rolling basis and is being undertaken on a wave-by-wave
and region-by-region basis, with SSA now re-certifying beneficiaries after four years. More
frequent re-certification has been deemed to be too burdensome on administrative resources at
the current juncture.

98.     Under the support of DPO-3, the authorities would implement an integrated and
fiscally sustainable strategy for health and social programs with an emphasis on protecting the
poor. The strategy on the social safety net is expected to establish an integrated vision for the
medium term of how the social safety net system will evolve, including laying out key
challenges and the reform agenda. A draft health strategy, including budget estimates, has
been completed and is under discussion, and an elaboration on the social transfers is also
expected. Several ideas are being discussed by the government and some consensus is

                                               30
emerging on the way forward. Key priorities include reducing poverty and protecting the
poor and vulnerable, while simultaneously ensuring fiscal sustainability and avoiding the
pitfalls associated with large entitlement programs that some of the other countries in the
region have encountered, particularly in the context of the economic downturn. A key
component of the strategy is expected to keep the share of the population covered by the
targeted social assistance program at least at the level of extreme poverty rate and to allocate
sufficient resources to fund the program.

99.    Also under DPO-3, the effectiveness of the TSA program would be further improved
through the deployment of an integrated management information system for the Social
Services Agency and through continued recertification of TSA beneficiaries.

100. As a result of the reforms supported under this pillar, the medium-term
outcomes expected include: (i) increase in percent of poor and in particular, extreme poor
population receiving targeted social assistance (increased coverage); and (ii) no significant
increase in percent of non-poor population among targeted social assistance recipients. TSA
features an inclusion error of 30 percent, which is reasonable by international standards. The
objective of the program along this dimension is to keep the inclusion error at least at the
same level in the medium term.

Improving access to health care through fiscally sustainable strengthening of health care
financing system

101. Improving access to health care and reducing the impoverishing impact of out-of-
pocket health spending are important priorities for improving Georgia's overall social
safety net. With a low level of public expenditure on health, Georgia had the highest share of
total health expenditure funded through out-of-pocket payments in the ECA region in 2006,
the highest out of 53 European countries, and nearly twice as high as the average among even
its CIS comparators (see table 2).9 Household survey data reveal that both the incidence of
catastrophic health expenditure and the impoverishing impact of out-of-pocket health
spending in Georgia are at levels that are among the highest in the world.10 According to the
Life in Transition Survey (2006), Georgian households, including poor households, identify
the health sector among the top priorities for government investment.

102. The Medical Insurance Program (MIP), introduced in June 2006, is targeted to
the poor and offers a free, extensive benefit package financed through general tax
revenues. The target group is identified by the same proxy means test carried out by the
Social Services Agency (SSA) for the Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) program. The

eligibility score threshold for MIP is 70,000, higher than for the TSA. In 2008, about 750,000
individuals were eligible to receive program benefits, with a total budget of GEL 80 million.
The MIP budget rose to about GEL 127 million in 2009 and GEL 159 million in 2010.
Eligibility expanded to about 900,000 individuals during 2009 and is being maintained at that
level during 2010. Administration of the program has recently been transferred to SSA,
which issues vouchers to the eligible population, who in turn select an insurance company to
purchase the government-defined benefit package on their behalf.

103. The introduction of MIP represents a significant improvement in access to and
affordability of health care by the poorest households. Evidence from an impact
evaluation supported by the World Bank suggests that while utilization has not yet risen, the
program has led to a 50 percent decrease in out-of-pocket payments for medical care among
beneficiaries. In 2009, the program accounted for nearly half the total health budget. By
channeling limited public funding for health to the poor through an objective means test, the
benefit incidence of health spending should improve markedly. Along with the TSA, this
program represents better targeted spending than the majority of the large MoLHSA budget.

104. A major challenge facing Georgia's health sector remains to expand access to
health care services and to reduce impoverishing OOP in a fiscally sustainable way. The
recent expansion in coverage of MIP has made some progress toward addressing this
challenge, and the new addition of an out-patient drug benefit is also a significant step.
Furthermore, the new publicly co-financed voluntary health insurance scheme introduced in
2009 is another policy reform aimed at addressing this issue. At present there is little
evidence on its performance, and its budget of GEL 5.8 million is small.

105. Georgia also faces significant challenges in terms of fulfilling its public
stewardship role with respect to the growing private health insurance industry. The MIP
entails a transfer of GEL 160m (in 2010) from the public budget to private insurers in
exchange for their services as purchasers of health care for the poor. This comes with certain
stipulations, such as the prohibition of risk selection (no eligible applicant can be turned
away) and a pledge to reimburse care covered by the government-defined benefit package.
However, there has not been a formalized mechanism for monitoring fulfillment of these
obligations. In addition, other coordination functions could usefully be undertaken by the
government in order to, for example, promote the application of common information systems
that would help avoid the pitfall of high administrative costs that frequently arise in a system
with multiple private insurers (e.g., US, Chile).

106. In order to help confront these challenges, DPO-1 supported a two-pronged
approach comprised of expanding coverage and strengthening public stewardship. First,
coverage of MIP was increased from 750,000 to 900,000 beneficiaries, primary care was
added to the package (previously it was covered by UBP), and the average monthly premium
increased from GEL 11 to 15 in 2009 (potentially enhancing access to care for the insured).
These changes were paid for by a 50 percent increase in the MIP budget to GEL 130m in
2009. Second, the government introduced a publicly co-financed health insurance for the
population not covered by MIP. This program offers a subsidized minimum benefit package
covering primary care and urgent hospital care. Third, the government strengthened its public
stewardship role vis-à-vis the growing private insurance sector by establishing a stakeholder
forum to oversee implementation of state-funded programs by health insurance companies
and developing a draft standardized classification system for reporting to help ease the major

                                              32
source of disputes between insurers and providers and reduce the associated administrative
burden.

107.   The proposed DPO-2 supports the following policy actions in this area:
       Expanded coverage of publicly co financed health insurance to approximately 125,000
       beneficiaries through an open enrollment period for population not covered by the
       medical insurance program (MIP) and maintained coverage of MIP targeted to the
       poor at about 900,000 beneficiaries, while including an outpatient drug benefit in the
       MIP package.
       Strengthened public stewardship of health sector by initiating public support for the
       health insurance mediation service to enhance patient rights and introducing an
       electronic system for beneficiary identification.

108. The insurance coverage targets are on track to being met. Coverage of the
publicly co-financed insurance package is currently 122,000 individuals (who signed up
during the enrollment period ending July 2009) and the 2010 budget includes funding for a
renewal of their plans through open enrollment beginning in mid-2010. While there is no
budget allocation to undertake a new enrollment period to sign up additional beneficiaries
during 2010, it is expected that the necessary resources will be secured (possibly through
reserve funds) for new enrollments in mid-2010. Once this is rolled out, MoLHSA estimates
that the number of beneficiaries would rise at about 250,000 by mid-2011. With regard to the
MIP targets, the 2010 budget contains adequate funding to maintain coverage of the MIP at
about 950,000 to 1 million beneficiaries. The average benefit level (premium) per beneficiary
remains unchanged in 2010, but the MIP budget is up by 25 percent in 2010 to cover those
who joined the program part way through 2009 but will be covered for the full 12 months of
2010 (with additional budgetary implications of reducing the waiting time for processing).

109. The initiation of public support for HIMS was secured in March 2010. The
government decreed that a portion (3 tetri per beneficiary per month) of the insurance
premium would be provided to support the Health Insurance Mediation Service (HIMS)
created in 2008 with USAID funding. Operating costs of the HIMS are small--
approximately $200,000 per year. The government is committed to ensuring its continued
operation. Although still in its infancy, this dispute resolution center has been widely
applauded for enabling the insured population to obtain information and recourse in the event
of disagreement with insurance companies. It thus promotes accountability in the use of
public funds, enhances patient rights, and enhances the effectiveness of the social safety net
embodied by MIP.

110. The introduction of an electronic system for beneficiary identification is well
under way. SSA has completed a pilot electronic system whereby providers can send a text
message to confirm beneficiary status of a prospective patient. This innovation simplifies
administration and helps combat potential fraud. The introduction of an electronic system for
medical claims has proceeded more slowly than originally anticipated, but it is still expected
that by 2011, a common IT platform will be developed to unify the government's various
beneficiary databases with the medical claims process. This will generate significant savings
for all stakeholders including government, providers, and insurers. This would enhance the
efficiency of government spending on health benefits by reducing administrative overheads
throughout the system, cut back on fraudulent claims, and generate a valuable stream of data

                                             33
that could be used to make evidence-based decisions on key issues such as premium
adjustment.11

111. As a result of the reforms supported under this pillar, the medium-term
outcomes expected include: (i) increase in share of bottom two quintiles of population with
access to publicly subsidized health insurance; (ii) increase in share of population with access
to health insurance; and (iii) increase accountability and efficiency of the institutional
framework for state-funded health programs.

PILLAR 3: IMPROVING EXTERNAL COMPETITIVENESS

112. Improving external competitiveness of the private sector is a key priority for
Georgia going forward. The objective is to ensure that a vibrant and competitive private
sector facilitates economic recovery and serves as the engine of post-crisis growth in the
medium term. Rapid economic growth during 2004 through mid-2008 was not associated
with rapid growth of exports, with the export share of GDP remaining relatively stable at
about 31-34 percent and GDP growth driven primarily by nontradables.12 Unlike several East
Asian economies, Georgia and other transition economies have been slow in developing
export capacity (exceptions include the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia), and strong
inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have not been associated with an expansion of
export capacity. While this is not uncommon in a transition economy beginning a period of
sustained economic growth, in order for growth to be sustained over the medium to long run,
Georgia needs to improve its external competitiveness, diversify economic activity in the
tradable sector, and expand its export capacity. Improving external competitiveness requires
addressing a number of relevant policy constraints.

113. First, trade and exchange rate policy which do not impart any anti-export or
anti-tradable bias are important for ensuring external competitiveness. Georgia has
made remarkable progress in liberalizing its trade regime over the last few years, so that the
import regime is one of the most liberal in the world, with a very low average tariff and with
91 percent of HS 6-digit product lines facing a zero tariff. At the same time, the real
exchange rate appreciated since 2004, which underscores the importance of exchange rate
flexibility under the current economic environment to minimize bias against tradables. Under
current conditions, exchange rate policy needs to carefully balance between the risks to
external sustainability, the risks to banking sector portfolios, and the impact on growth and its
sustainability. The recent adoption by the NBG of a foreign exchange auction mechanism is a
welcome step in this direction.

114. Second, improved external competitiveness requires improved access to
transport, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure. Georgia faces substantial
infrastructure development needs given that it lags comparator countries in the ECA region
with regard to the quantity and quality of available infrastructure. Public investment currently
plays a central role in developing infrastructure in Georgia (see discussion on Pillar 1).
Infrastructure development efforts are being supported by the EBRD, the World Bank, the
EC, ADB, and many bilateral development partners including the US, Japan, and Sweden.

11
   Several IT-related activities in the policy matrix will also be supported by the World Bank's Health Sector
Development Project (formerly Primary Health Care Development project).
12
   At the same time, the growth of exports of goods and services during this period, despite trade restrictions on
exports to Russia, is notable.

                                                       34
Over the next three years, international financial support to address basic infrastructure needs
may be close to $1.7 billion dollars. The reforms proposed under Pillar 1 complements these
efforts by supporting development and adoption of best international practice on public
investment programming (capital budgeting) covering another $1 to $1.3 billion of investment
projects financed from the central budget.

115. Third, upgrading skills of the labor force to compete effectively in world markets
is important to support development of tradable sectors and export capacity in
particular. Upgrading skills is being addressed by the ongoing education reform. Reforms
include measures aimed at reducing the gap between skills of the labor force and the skills
needed by a new globally integrated emerging economy: 38 percent of firms surveyed in
BEEPS 2008 report that the skills gap is a constraint to operating a business in Georgia. To
this end, reforms include modernizing curricula, monitoring and reporting of academic
attainment, and establishing vocational training. These efforts are being supported by several
development partners including USAID, the EC, SIDA, the Dutch Government, and others.

116. Fourth, strengthening property rights and adopting international standards can
play an important role in supporting development of tradable sectors and export
capacity in particular. To a large extent, Georgia remains a cash-driven economy which
limits business opportunities, with only a few large firms developing capacity to export while
most others in the tradable sectors service a limited domestic market. Further strengthening
the rule of law including protection of property rights, increasing reliance on contracts,
improving dispute resolution mechanisms, and further progress in adopting international
technical standards can play an important role in expanding business opportunities in the
tradable sectors and enhancing market access for Georgian products in world markets.
Notably, a Government Task Force is now involved in developing a program for Georgia to
adopt international and EU standards and technical regulations to create the pre-conditions for
improved access of Georgian products to European and international markets. This effort has
been undertaken in preparation for negotiations between the EU and Georgia on a Deep and
Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA).

117. Fifth, a key lever of improving external competitiveness is further improvement
of the business environment, which remains among the top priorities for the Georgian
authorities. Foreign direct investment and other private capital inflows as well as official
inflows will have to continue to play an important role in financing Georgia's investment
needs. Without substantial natural resources, a large market, or a location contiguous with a
large external market, further improvements to the business environment are critical for
Georgia to compete for limited foreign direct investment and other private capital flows.
Improving the business environment is therefore an important area of reform to diversify
economic activity and develop the tradable sector and export capacity in particular.

118. In this broad reform agenda, the Georgian authorities have requested the
support of the proposed DPO program in the areas of: (i) reducing the burden of tax
payment and tax compliance on the private sector; (ii) improving customs administration
infrastructure and further streamlining customs procedures to enhance integration with world
markets; (iii) enhancing the export enabling environment by improving access of Georgian
products to European and international markets; (iv) reform of the statistics system to provide
reliable and timely information to investors and policy makers.

119. While the business environment in Georgia improved impressively in the four
years leading up to the August 2008 conflict, the costs of tax compliance and the costs of
transactions across borders remained impediments to business activity. At the outset of
the DPO program, the dimensions of the business environment where relative weakness was
found for Georgia, according to the Doing Business 2009 report, were "Paying Taxes" and
"Trading across Borders". Along these two dimensions, Georgia significantly lagged its
overall high ranking of 15, with the "Paying Taxes" rank at 110 and the "Trading across
Borders" rank at 81.13 Georgian companies spent too much time paying taxes and the cost of
exporting and importing remained high. At the same time, BEEPS 2008 reported that one in
every four firms finds tax compliance a real constraint to operating a business and one in
every five firms finds customs administration time another area where improvement is
needed. Thus, reducing the costs associated with paying taxes and importing and exporting
are key levers in improving external competitiveness in Georgia. The capacity building needs
in these areas are being supported by the EC programs, USAID, SIDA and other development
partners.

120. The Doing Business 2010 report indicates that progress has been made along
both the "Paying Taxes" and "Trading Across Borders" dimensions in 2009. Along the
taxes dimension, Georgia's ranking improved from 110th place to 64th place, indicating that
further progress remains. Along the trade dimension, although, Georgia's ranking improved
from 81st place to 30th place, the costs of exporting and importing remain high. With Georgia
not geographically contiguous with a large external market and given the importance of
developing export capacity for sustained growth going forward, the authorities consider
further reductions in the costs of trading across borders a key priority.

Reduce the tax burden on the private sector

121. In order to minimize the costs associated with tax compliance for the private
sector, DPO-1 supported the introduction of the e-filing system covering all taxes and

13
   While Georgia also significantly lags its overall ranking along the "Closing a Business" dimension, it has
recently adopted a new insolvency law that shortens timelines for reorganization of a distressed company or
disposition of a debtor's assets, which is expected to result in improvement along this dimension going forward.
In addition, the authorities have recently introduced a range of measures directed at simplifying liquidation
procedures, which are expected to significantly reduce the time required to close a business.

                                                      36
available to all taxpayers in February 2009. Although a decree was issued in August 2007
to introduce e-filing, the facility was initially piloted for large VAT taxpayers and
progressively rolled out to other taxpayers and categories of taxes. The e-filing web-page
with detailed guidelines and instructions has been designed to serve taxpayers and can be
reached by all interested parties. As of March 2009, there were approximately 780 e-filers;
and although work was underway to further streamline the system by removing possible
access and utilization bottlenecks, expanding the number of e-filers proved challenging.

122. Another reform supported by DPO-1 to minimize the costs of tax compliance was
development of selection criteria and testing of software for a risk-based tax audit
system. In order to streamline tax audit procedures, the Government defined selection criteria
and tested the software for a risk-based tax audit system. A set of 13 criteria for risk-based
audit were developed using a point-based system. The objective of the system is to select for
audit those taxpayers that are associated with a greater risk of noncompliance. Under the
system, selection will not be subjective and will instead be based on a combination of defined
objective criteria. This will ultimately spare taxpayers with a good record of compliance from
the burden associated with an audit and thereby improve the overall fairness and efficiency of
the tax audit system.

123.   The proposed DPO-2 supports the following policy actions in this area:
       Improved the information technology (IT) platform and conducted a public
       information campaign to induce wider adoption of the e filing system, as part of a
       program to streamline the tax payment system.
       Introduced a risk-based tax audit system so that at least half of the planned number of
       on-site tax audits is selected by the system.

124. Intensive work by the authorities on a number of measures to induce wider
adoption of the e-filing system, including improvements to the IT platform and extensive
public outreach, have resulted in a sharp increase in the number of e-filers. At present,
more than 70 percent of tax declarations are filed electronically. The number of e-filing
declarations increased from 1,478 in August 2009 to 4,435 in October 2009 (including 1,884
electronic VAT filings and 2,318 electronic PIT filings), and then jumped sharply to 232,185
in February 2010. This has far exceeded the modest targets set at the outset of the program of
2000 e-filers (including large firms, small and medium firms, and individuals) by the end of
2009 and 5000 e-filers by the end of 2010. All tax inspectorates were required to organize
open door sessions on e-filing, at which the e-filing systems were explained to taxpayers and
technical difficulties in the system were identified and corrected. Furthermore, a 3-day
seminar on e-filing was organized in collaboration with AmCham for large and medium
businesses. A total of 150 different businesses attended the seminar, where the e-filing
system was explained through meetings with accountants and other technical persons
involved in the filing process. Furthermore, the IT system has been improved along several
dimensions, including enhancing its capacity to handle a large numbers of e-filings and to
simplify the procedures for registration by e-filers.

125. The risk based audit system is now being used to make actual selections of
planned on site tax audits rather than simply to make pilot selections for the purposes of
fine tuning the system. Earlier, in October 2009, the audit department completed and
submitted a report based on the audits of 24 firms selected by the system on a pilot basis. The

                                              37
report was used to further fine-tune and reweight the criteria. Following that exercise, the
risk-based audit system was put in place to make actual rather than simply pilot selections.
Recent information from the Revenue Service indicates that all planned on-site tax audits
between January and April 2010 were selected by the risk-based system. Going forward, the
authorities will have to focus their attention on ensuring that all planned on-site tax audits
continue to be selected by the risk-based system, increasing the number of planned on-site tax
audits, and reducing the share of control checks.

126. Under the support of DPO-3, the tax payment system would be streamlined further
by issuing comprehensive procedural guidelines for use by tax officers in providing the entire
menu of necessary services to taxpayers. The objective would be to further improve
interaction between taxpayers and tax authorities, so that a uniform set of guidelines are in
place for all cases. Furthermore, the risk-based tax audit system would be enhanced, with the
objective of selecting all planned on-site tax audits by the system, increasing the number of
planned on-site audits by at least 50 percent, and reducing the share of control checks to less
than 40 percent of total (planned on-site audits plus control checks).

127. In addition to the planned reforms to reduce the burden of tax compliance, a
number of tax reforms during 2004-08 have resulted in improved revenue collection and
reduced tax burden. A new tax code was enacted in 2005 and the authorities have been
improving the tax regime in terms of tax policy and administration. The tax burden has been
substantially reduced on firms and individuals through a reduced number of taxes, lower and
flat tax rates, and a broader tax base. Restructuring of the tax and customs institutional
framework and measures to eliminate widespread corruption in those systems led to
substantial improvements in tax administration and increased tax collection from 14.6 percent
of GDP in 2003 to 25.8 percent in 2007. The Revenue Service established under the Ministry
of Finance has made voluntary compliance the cornerstone of its modernization strategy.
Taxpayer service centers have been designed and established to make interaction with
taxpayers more efficient and professional and to provide taxpayers with instructions and
guidance.

128. A comprehensive tax amendment was approved in December 2008 (and became
effective as of January 1, 2009) to reduce the tax burden and streamline tax
administration procedures. The specific measures envisaged over the next four years by the
amendment include, inter alia: (i) reduction of the personal income tax rate from 25% to 20%
in 2009 and further reduction to 18% in 2011 and to 15% in 2012; (ii) reduction of the tax rate
on dividends to 5% in 2009, and further to 3% in 2011 and to 0% in 2012; (iii) granting
enterprises the right to submit invoice for VAT refund within 90 days instead of 45 days after
transaction; and (iv) payment of VAT refund within 3 months instead of 6 months.

129. As a result of the reforms supported in this area, the medium term outcomes
expected include: (i) reduced tax burden; (ii) reduced time required for tax compliance; and
(iii) stable budget revenue performance.

Improve customs management infrastructure and further streamline customs
procedures to enhance integration with world markets

130. While Georgia has substantially liberalized its trade regime, progress remains
ahead in the trade facilitation area to streamline customs procedures. Over last few

                                              38
years, Georgia has been actively implementing trade reforms, including liberalizing trade
restrictions and reforming custom services. These efforts materialized in a new customs code
consistent with international standards adopted in mid-2006. Under this code, Georgia
implemented a major trade liberalization reform, with the number of import tariff rates
reduced from sixteen to three: 0, 5, and 12 percent. Under an amendment to the tax code
adopted by Parliament in December 18, 2009, the number of tariffs was further reduced to
two: 0 and 12 percent. While this could in principle have further liberalized the trade regime,
it resulted in a number of new commodities being subjected to the 12 percent tariff. A new
amendment approved by Parliament in March brought back down to 0 percent the tariff for 50
percent of the commodities previously raised to 12 percent and to 5 percent for another 20
percent of those commodities. In parallel, customs administrative arrangements were
reformed and changes in management and staffing were implemented to eradicate corruption,
eliminate overlapping functions, and streamline procedures. However, progress remains
ahead in further streamlining customs procedures.

131. In order to streamline customs procedures, DPO-1 supported introduction of the
Risk Management System at customs, including yellow and red corridors for all
declarations and green and blue corridors for firms on the Gold List.14 The overall
objective of the newly introduced system is to provide different degrees of customs
inspections for those with different records of compliance. Declaring entities are subject to
the risk-based examination through the red and yellow corridors, while two additional blue
and green corridors are available for entities with status of Gold List. The new procedures are
compliant with WTO requirements and were written in a user-friendly manner with much
explanation and illustrative examples. The red corridor requires documentation and physical
examination, the yellow corridor requires documentation only, and the blue corridor provides
for advanced declarations to conduct examination of documents after customs clearance
procedures. Furthermore, relations between importers and customs brokers have been
streamlined through the requirement for brokers to present bank guarantees. The red corridor
represents the most elaborate inspection requirements and ultimately, the system is expected
to reduce the number of shipments through the red corridor and ensure that only strong
violators are subject to the red corridor requirements.

132. Benefits were expanded and eligibility criteria relaxed for the Gold List program,
which offers streamlined customs clearance procedures to low-risk, high-volume/high-
value traders. Simplified procedures introduced included post payment (up to 30 days) of
customs duties and other taxes previously due at the border, immediate release of goods to
circumvent formalities at inland clearance terminals, and electronic submission of customs
declarations. The new regulation also eliminated the requirement that members have no prior
customs violations, which was almost impossible under the poor customs administration that
prevailed in the recent past.

133.    The proposed DPO-2 supports the following policy actions in this area:
        Improved the risk management system at customs by allowing access to all corridors
        for all customs declarations and reducing the number of declarations passing through


14
  Green, blue, yellow, and red corridors provide different degrees of streamlined customs procedures for
importing entities. The Gold List includes importing entities with a sound established track record of customs
compliance.

                                                     39
       the red corridor, which requires documentation and physical examination prior to the
       release of goods.

134. The risk management system is progressively being improved. The risk
management system is progressively being improved. As a result, the share of total
declarations assigned to the red corridor has been reduced to 9 percent by February/March
2010 compared to 12-15 percent in June 2009. The share of red corridor declarations was at
7-8 percent in November 2009, with about 8 percent for imports and 6 percent for exports.
Information from the Revenue Service indicates that in April 2010, the share passing through
the red corridor was 8 percent for imports and 1.7 percent for exports. All declarations now
potentially have access to green, yellow, and red corridors, and a Revenue Service decision in
April will provide access to the blue corridor for all declarations by mid-May. Going
forward, as part of DPO-3, the authorities will focus on increasing the share of declarations
through the blue corridor and reducing the share through the yellow corridor. The risk
management system software embeds criteria for assigning declarations in an automated
manner, with random checks done in only 1-2 percent of declarations. Currently, there are 5
importers on the Gold List, which had assigned about 100 declarations through September
2009.

135. DPO-3 will support measures to further improve the risk management system at
customs by increasing the share of declarations passing through the blue corridor and
reducing the share passing through the yellow corridor.

136. As a result of the reforms supported in this area, the medium term outcomes
expected include a reduction in time and cost required to import and export. In 2008, the
times required to export and import were 12 days and 14 days. These costs are expected to
decline by about 10 percent per year as a result of the reforms supported by the DPO.

Enhance export enabling environment by improving access to European and
international markets

137. Access of Georgian products and services to European and international markets
depends on an array of factors. These include tariffs, quantitative restrictions, and other
non-tariff barriers in destination markets. As a result of Georgia's free trade areas with
several countries and GSP status in several markets, tariffs and quantitative restrictions do not
significantly limit access of Georgian products to those markets. Georgia has free trade
agreements with the CIS countries and has recently signed an FTA with Turkey. Georgian
products benefit from GSP status in the markets of the EU, the USA, Canada, Switzerland,
Japan, and Turkey. Under the EU's GSP, Georgia has qualified for the special arrangement
for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) which offers it enhanced access to
the EU market. At the same time, access of Georgian products to European and international
markets can be impeded by a range of non-tariff barriers including quality and regulatory
requirements in destination markets. Reforms in trade-related areas in Georgia can play an
important role in overcoming non-tariff barriers in destination markets and thereby improving
access of Georgian products to those markets.

138.   The proposed DPO-2 supports the following policy actions in this area:
       Identified and started to implement reforms in trade related areas by submitting draft
       strategies to the European Commission on food safety, technical barriers to trade, and

                                               40
       competition policy to facilitate access for Georgian products to European and
       international markets.

139. The process of identifying trade-related reforms to facilitate access has proceeded
at a brisk pace. Following an EU Deep and Comprehensive FTA (DCFTA) feasibility study
in summer 2008, a Central Task Force on DCFTA Preparation (led by the Advisor to the
Prime Minister and with representation from all relevant agencies of government) was set up
by government decree in February 2009. Detailed specific recommendations from the EC
were received in April 2009 and Working Groups on key thematic areas were set up in the
same month. The Working Groups prepared draft strategies (including operational programs
and timetables) for three priority thematic areas: technical barriers to trade, food safety, and
competition. The draft strategies were submitted to the EC in September 2009. In May 2010,
the EC obtained a mandate from member states to initiate negotiations at an appropriate date.

140. The strategies in the three thematic areas have been revised several times and are
expected to be finalized following ongoing technical discussions with the EC and specific
implementation steps are underway. Following submission of the strategies to the
European Commission (DG Trade) in September 2009, technical discussions on the strategies
were held between the Georgian authorities and the EC in November 2009 and the strategies
have been revised several times in light of the discussions. The authorities have shared the
substance of the draft strategies and the specific implementation steps with the DPO team.
Technical assistance from the EC is being used by the authorities and the Bank is also
providing technical assistance to build capacity.

141. Under the support of DPO-3, Georgia is expected to continue reforms in trade-
related areas, including food safety, technical barriers to trade, competition policy, and
intellectual property rights to facilitate access to European and international markets..

Reform of the Statistics System

142. Reliable and timely statistics on economic and social conditions are important for
investors and for policy makers. Foreign investors depend on statistics on trade,
investment, and economic conditions to track opportunity and make investment decisions. As
such, the availability of timely and reliable statistics serves to reduce uncertainty and bolster
investor confidence. Not only should statistical indicators be of good quality, but the public
and investors must also have confidence in the integrity and accuracy of the statistics. The
task of producing credible statistics should rest with a public institution that is professionally
and technically competent, free of political influence, and responsive to public needs.
Fulfilling these requirements is the objective of reforms of Georgia's statistics system.

143. The previous Department of Statistics of Georgia faced significant challenges,
including the need to improve technical capacity and structural efficiency, ensure that official
statistics are of high quality, and enhance public confidence in the integrity of statistics. In
order to meet these challenges, a Commission was appointed by the Prime Minister in
December 2008 to recommend measures for the reform of the statistics system of Georgia.
The objective of the reforms is to ensure that the new statistical system will produce credible,
high-quality, and reliable statistics that are prepared in a manner consistent with international
best practices.


                                               41
144. In order to address the challenges, DPO-1 supported adoption of a concept of
reform of the statistics system and submission to Parliament of the new law on state
statistics. The Concept on Reform of the Statistics System was prepared by the Commission
and adopted by Cabinet. The Concept recommended reforms in a number of areas, including:
measures to strengthen the independence of the agency including from political influence;
measures to ensure that the methodologies used in the preparation of official statistics are
consistent with accepted international standards; and measures for institutional development,
including human resources, infrastructure, and international cooperation. Subsequently, the
Law of Georgia on State Statistics was submitted to Parliament on in March 2009. This Law
included provisions for an independent statistics office governed by a supervisory board, the
adoption of internationally recognized statistical methods, and improved skills of staff.

145.   The proposed DPO-2 supports the following policy actions in this area:
       Reformed the statistics system by: (a) adopting the law on official statistics; (b)
       establishing the supervisory board envisaged by the law; and (c) establishing the
       statistics office as an independent entity.

146. Following adoption of the Law of Georgia on Official Statistics in December
2009, the new statistics agency, GeoStat, was established as an independent entity on
February 1, 2010. The new independent statistics agency, GeoStat, is governed by a
supervisory board consisting of eight members, including the Executive Director, Vice
President of NBG, Deputy Ministers of Finance and Economic Development, and four others.
A key priority for the new statistical agency is the implementation of international best-
practice methods in collecting and compiling statistics. Following a request from GeoStat, the
Bank is currently processing a trust fund grant to assist in designing the national strategy for
statistical development as well as a master plan to operationalize this strategy. The agency is
also in the process of discussing technical assistance from the EU to advance this priority.
The agency is also expected to initiate training to improve the technical capacity of staff.

147. Steps expected to be supported by DPO-3 include improved implementation of
internationally recognized statistical methods, further fine-tuning of institutional structures,
and continued improvement of technical capacity of staff.

148. As a result of reforms supported in this area, the medium-term outcomes
expected include: (i) increased reliability and independence of statistics; (ii) streamlined
institutional structures; and (iii) improved human capacity and public outreach.


                        VI.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
149. The Ministry of Finance will act as the main coordinator for managing the
overall implementation of the DPO program. The Ministry also actively participates in
implementing the overall strategic goals of the Government's "United Georgia without
Poverty" reform program. The primary implementing line agencies for the DPO program are:
the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Development, and the Ministry of Labor,
Health, and Social Affairs.



                                              42
150. The monitoring of the reform program will be carried out through regular
reviews and in the context of the supervision of this operation. Progress in the
implementation of policy measures will be further monitored through other Bank financed
projects, including those that complement actions supported under the DPO program. The
monitoring of public sector reforms as well as public expenditures in social sectors is of
particular importance to the Government.

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
151. The DPO program is designed to mitigate the impact of the current economic
downturn on the poor and to improve living standards in Georgia over the medium
term. First, the overall macroeconomic and fiscal framework includes significant reallocation
of expenditures, which is creating fiscal space for increased social protection and health
expenditures. Second, reforms to scale up the social safety net while maintaining targeting
efficiency are expected to have the greatest immediate effect in supporting incomes of the
poor during the economic downturn. Third, in the medium term, reforms to facilitate
economic recovery and post-crisis growth are expected to be the driving force behind
improved living standards. Finally, it should be noted that the prior actions supported under
the public finance and external competitiveness pillars are expected to be neutral with regard
to the impact on income distribution.

152. Fiscal reallocation is creating space for increased expenditures on health and
social protection, which are in turn mitigating poverty. As a result of significant fiscal
reallocation, public expenditures on health and social protection in the State Budget increased
from 6.0 percent of GDP in 2007 to 7.5 percent in 2008 and 8.8 percent in 2009, and they are
projected to remain at that same level according to the 2010 state budget. With regard to
specific programs, the 2010 budget projects a 3.8 percent increase in the state pension budget,
a 1.1 percent increase in the TSA budget, and a 25.4 percent rise in the medical insurance
program for the poor budget. Given the evidence (presented below) on their poverty impact,
these increased social expenditures are helping to significantly mitigate the impact of the
economic downturn on the poor. As the authorities implement fiscal adjustment going
forward, the impact on the social sectors and poverty developments will need continued
monitoring, including through the public expenditure review exercise.

153. Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) and pensions both contribute significantly to
reducing poverty in Georgia. TSA is targeted to the very poor households in Georgia using
a proxy means test. According to the most recent household survey data available--collected
by UNICEF in June-July 2009--8.1% of the population lived in households that receive TSA.
This is a slight increase over the 6.7% in 2007 that was reported in the Bank's most recent
poverty assessment. The UNICEF survey shows that among households that receive TSA, the
average amount received per household was GEL 78 per month in 2009. Furthermore,
pensions are received by more than one-half of the households in Georgia: the UNICEF
survey reports that 52% of the population lived in households that receive pension income in
2009, which is comparable to the 53% reported for 2007 in the latest poverty assessment.
Among those that received pensions, the average amount received per household was GEL
114 per month in 2009.

154. With TSA targeting the poorest households, it is able to achieve a significant
reduction in poverty incidence as well as the poverty gap. Based on the Georgia national
poverty line of 89.7 GEL per adult equivalent per month, the poverty headcount in 2009

                                              43
without TSA would have been almost two percentage points higher than the headcount with
TSA (27.5% versus 25.7%), while the poverty gap would have been more than two
percentage points higher (9.6 versus 7.5). As pensions are larger in value and reach a much
wider population, poverty levels would have been much higher without pensions, with the
headcount and gap reaching 39.1 and 18.6, respectively. In addition, both TSA and pensions
reach a proportionally larger share of the rural than urban population, and thus have a
relatively greater poverty impact in rural areas (thereby also reducing spatial inequality).
These estimates of poverty impact depend, of course, on the poverty line that is chosen. A
figure showing the cumulative distribution of consumption, or poverty incidence curve, for
Georgia in 2009 shows that the impact of TSA is well targeted to the poorest households,
while the impact of pensions is felt across the spectrum.

              Cumulative distribution of consumption with and without pensions and TSA 




155. Reforms in the area of the social safety net are scaling up benefits and coverage
of the targeted social assistance program and the medical insurance program targeted to
the poor. The amount of the TSA benefit and budgetary funding for the TSA program are
being increased and coverage under the Medical Insurance Program (MIP) for the poor is
being expanded under reforms supported by the DPO. These reforms are expected to have a
significant impact in mitigating the impact of the economic downturn on the poor.
Furthermore, reforms to improve the effectiveness of social transfers and to strengthen the
health care financing system are expected to ensure that the benefits of recovery and growth
in the medium term are broadly shared.

156. In addition to larger budgets, several DPO-2 prior actions are also expected to
strengthen the safety net. These include revisions to the TSA and MIP proxy means test to
improve targeting and reduce fraud, cutting in half the waiting time between application for
and receipt of benefits for these programs, and greater accountability for their implementation
through community involvement in means-testing as well as funding for the health insurance
mediation service to provide recourse for the poor in the event of a dispute with their insurer.
The addition of out-patient drugs to the MIP benefit package ­ previously a major source of
out-of-pocket spending on health by the poor ­ is also a significant step.

157. Reforms to facilitate economic recovery and post-crisis growth are expected to be
the driving force behind improved living standards in the medium term. Strong growth

                                                44
during 2004-07 was associated with significant improvements in non-income dimensions of
well-being for the bottom 30 percent of the population, including significantly improved
access to electricity, natural gas, safe water, health, and higher education. At the same time,
the productivity-enhancing restructuring process accompanying growth during 2004-07 was
associated with labor shedding, which affected employment and prevented overall poverty
from responding immediately to the acceleration of growth. As recovery and post-crisis
growth take hold in the restructured Georgian economy in the medium term, employment and
labor productivity are expected to expand and poverty is expected to decline over time.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
158. The policy actions supported by this DPO series are not likely to cause significant
effects on the environment, forests, and other natural resources of Georgia. The one
policy area that required careful screening was business environment reforms. The reforms to
the business environment supported by the DPO program focus on further streamlining tax
administration to reduce the burden on the economy and improving customs administration
infrastructure and hence do not weaken the institutions and regulations with respect to
environmental protection. In general, experts observe that while the regulatory framework on
the environment in Georgia is broadly aligned with international standards for the level of
economic development of Georgia, the implementation of this framework can be
strengthened. Strategic priorities in environmental protection for a three year period are
explicitly stated in the Basic Data and Directions (BDD) document of the Government of
Georgia comprising strategic objectives and budgeted activities for all sectors.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
159. Public financial management system. The findings and conclusions of various
assessments of the Georgian public financial management system have been incorporated
within and indeed are integral to the design of the DPO. These assessments include: the
World Bank's 2007 Draft Country Procurement Assessment (CPA)15; the 2003 Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)16; the IMF's 2003 Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes - Fiscal Transparency Module17; the World Bank's 2002 Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)18; the World Bank's 2003 Public Expenditure
Review (PER)19, and the 2008 Joint World Bank-European Commission PEFA20. The salient
public financial management issues of these assessments, as well as issues arising since the
publication of these assessments, have been summarized, and progress has been discussed and
addressed as appropriate elsewhere in this Program Document.

160. As discussed in the PEFA report, significant progress has been made in
reforming the PFM system since the Rose revolution and a number of areas have been
identified as priorities for further reform. The Budget System Law approved in January
2004 set in place principles of comprehensiveness, transparency and accountability for the

budget system, and rules and procedures for preparation, approval, execution, reporting, and
audit of the budget. The new Budget Code approved in December 2009 further improves the
legal framework in these areas. All extra-budgetary funds were closed and all State financial
transactions were unified within a Treasury Single Account. Legislation defines the division
of power between the Government, external control, and Parliament. The public sector
accounting reform strategy, as well as the financial and performance requirements for Legal
Entities of Public Law (LEPLs) have strengthened the Treasury system and its financial
accounting and reporting framework. The law on local self government finances has defined
the budget and financial control procedures for local self governments and established rules
for formulation, control, audit, evaluation and execution of local government budgets. The
State Procurement Agency has developed regulations for efficient procurement procedures
and continues to improve transparency in public procurement processes by adopting
international standards. The Law on State Procurement was enacted in 2009 that provides a
solid legal framework for second generation reforms, including introduction of the e-
procurement system. A number of areas, including strategic budgeting, budget preparation
and approval, the internal and external control system, resource management, procurement,
and accounting and reporting have been identified as priorities for continued reform to further
enhance the effectiveness of the public finance management system.

161. Review of foreign exchange environment. The IMF conducted the latest safeguards
assessment of the NBG in November 2008. According to the latest report (December 10,
2008), the status of earlier safeguards recommendations are the following: three of the
previous recommendations were fully implemented, and one recommendation was superseded
by three new recommendations. Particularly, it was recommended that the composition of the
Audit Committee be modified to include only non-executive members, supported, as needed,
by an expert advisor. In addition, the committee should provide oversight of NBG's auditing
and financial reporting mechanisms. It was also recommended that the NBG Council adopt
an action plan for strengthening its vault operations, including through addressing external
audit findings, improving access controls, and automating vault records. The third
recommendation was on coordination of the monitoring and mitigation of existing and
emerging risks, possibly via a new committee.

162. The NBG received an unqualified audit opinions on its latest published financial
statements from its auditors, Deloitte & Touche, in respect of the year ended December 31,
2006, from KPMG for the year ended December 31, 2007, and from Ernst & Young for the
year ended December 31, 2008. Overall fiduciary risks are judged to be moderate, taking into
account the arrangements in place.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
163. The proposed Operation is an IDA Credit of SDR 26.5 million (US$40 million
equivalent) and an IBRD Loan of US$10 million. The proceeds of the IDA Credit and
IBRD Loan will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness. The Operation will be
subject to ratification by Parliament before it becomes effective. The expected closing date of
the proposed second DPO is March 31, 2011.

164. The proposed second DPO will be disbursed in US dollars into the Ministry of
Finance Treasury's Foreign Currency Account maintained at the National Bank of
Georgia (NBG) that forms part of the budget management system. The Recipient shall
ensure that upon deposit of the Credit and Loan proceeds into the said account, an equivalent

                                              46
amount in GEL at the official exchange rate will be deposited within 30 days of disbursement
in the Treasury Single Account in the NBG and accounted for in the Recipient's budget
management system. The proceeds of the Credit/Loan deposited at the Treasury Single
Account with NBG will be available to finance budget expenditures. The foreign exchange
proceeds of the proposed second DPO will be sold by the NBG or held in reserves, in
accordance with the objectives of monetary policy.

165. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the Operation's administration,
for preparing the withdrawal application, and for maintaining the Treasury Foreign
Currency Account at the NBG. The Ministry, with the assistance of the NBG, will maintain
records of all transactions under the Operation in accordance with sound accounting practices.
The MoF will provide to IDA/IBRD a confirmation that the amount of the Operation has been
credited to an account acceptable to the Association (the format of the confirmation letter
should be acceptable to IDA/IBRD). This confirmation letter is required within 30 days of
receipt of the amount.

166. Auditing. Audits of the First and Second Poverty Reduction Support Operation
(PRSO) were unqualified and revealed no issues of concern. Given the progress in fiduciary
reforms, the improvements recorded in the IMF safeguard assessments, the unqualified audit
opinions provided in the NBG's recent audited financial statements (FY 2006, FY 2007, and
FY 2008) and on PRSO I and II, and no audit requirement under PRSO III and IV, and
DPO-1, no additional fiduciary arrangements including audit are required for the
second DPO.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
167. This operation faces several macroeconomic risks which could affect reform
implementation and outcomes. In the area of macroeconomic risks, first, there are global
risks related to the recovery of global investor sentiment and growth: these could result in a
renewed deterioration in the external environment for Georgia, which would negatively
impact exports, remittances, FDI, and other private capital inflows. Second, there are risks
related to renewed domestic and regional tensions, which could have a further adverse impact
on investor and consumer confidence. Third, there are risks related to the recovery of
domestic investor sentiment, which could constrain the recovery of credit to the private sector
as banks continue to exercise caution in increasing lending. Should any of these risks
materialize, they would affect the outlook for growth in Georgia and affect operation
outcomes even if the reform program is implemented as planned. The fall out would require
further external adjustment, possibly including further realignment of the real exchange rate,
downscaling of planned public expenditures, and additional official financing, preferably on
concessional terms to safeguard debt sustainability. Such a scenario would also add to the
public debt burden and increase the ratio of nonperforming loans of the banking sector.

168. The macroeconomic risks are mitigated to some extent by a number of factors.
First, the authorities' macroeconomic framework is supported by an IMF SBA program,
which provides strong backing for the country's reserve position (presently, the SBA provides
exceptional financing at 500 percent of quota). The Bank and the IMF have intensified their
macroeconomic monitoring and are holding a continuous policy dialogue with the authorities
on macroeconomic developments and policy responses. Second, the authorities have affirmed
their commitment to the envisaged fiscal adjustment and flexible exchange rate policy, which
provide key anchors for external and debt sustainability. In addition, the authorities are

                                              47
making significant efforts to promote Georgia's business environment to potential investors,
in order to attract FDI and other private capital inflows. Third, Georgia's debt burden
indicators remain within relevant prudential thresholds, with the authorities intending to
access capital markets to smooth out a spike in the repayment schedule in 2013. Fourth, with
bank deposits rising and the sector increasing provisioning since mid-2009, liquidity and
capitalization indicators have improved significantly..

169. Domestic and regional tensions are also subject to a number of mitigating factors.
On regional tensions, mediation efforts are ongoing with support from the international
community and bilateral partners, with all parties declaring the intent to resolve outstanding
issues through peaceful means. Domestically, political conditions have improved since mid-
2009 and remain stable, with no escalation observed surrounding local and municipal
elections at end-May 2010. The Government's efforts to address the needs of those affected
by the economic downturn have helped to mitigate political tensions.

170. The operation also faces program-specific risks, including the risk of reform
implementation. The reform program supported by the DPO is ambitious and includes an
array of reforms considered important for meeting the Government's development objectives.
Progress in implementation of the reform program is dependent upon effort and capacity of
the authorities, as well as support from relevant stakeholders. For example, the reforms in the
areas of program budgeting and capital budgeting involve coordination among different line
ministries, as well as parallel capacity building. The reforms to the social safety net have
important implications for the distribution of income and therefore require support from key
stakeholders. Finally, the success in the trade-related reforms to enhance access for Georgian
products in European and international markets depend not only on policy progress on the
Georgian side, but are also affected by decisions taken by trading partners. These risks are
mitigated to some extent by strong Government ownership of the reform program and broad-
based donor support on capacity building and technical assistance for different components of
the reform program.

                          ANNEX 4: FUND RELATIONS NOTE

The Letter of Assessment dated June 18, 2010 provided by the IMF is appended below. The
Sixth Review of the IMF's SBA is scheduled to be considered by the IMF Board on July 9,
2010, following which a PIN on the Sixth Review would be available.


                     GeorgiaAssessment Letter to the World Bank
                                  June 18, 2010

This note provides the IMF staff's assessment of Georgia's macroeconomic developments and
prospects, for the purposes of the Second Development Policy Operation Program (DPO-2,
US$50 million equivalent to be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness) being
considered by the Executive Board of the World Bank on July 29, 2010. The assessment is
based on the last IMF Executive Board Review of the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) of
March 19, 2010, (Georgia Country Report No. 10/83) updated with information gathered by
an IMF mission that visited Tbilisi in April-May 2010 and follow up discussions.

Economic activity is rebounding faster than earlier anticipated, but private capital
inflows in 2010 have been revised down, reflecting subdued FDI in the first quarter of
the year.

       Real GDP growth for 2010 has been revised up from 2 to 4½ percent, based on two
       consecutive quarters of economic expansion evidenced mainly by the VAT turnover.

       Inflation stood at 4 percent in May, and is expected to stabilize at around 5 percent for
       the year.

       Despite the acceleration of economic activity, the current account deficit in the first
       quarter was lower than expected due to improved terms of trade. The 2010 current
       account deficit is projected at 12½ percent of GDP. FDI inflows are projected to be
       somewhat lower than in 2009.

       Credit growth has resumed, supported by a gradual lowering of interest rates. The
       growth in lending is entirely due to growth in local currency loans. The banks' balance
       sheets are cushioned by ample levels of capital and provisioning, but the high level of
       NPLs and currency-induced credit risk are risk factors.

Program objectives under the SBA remain those of:

       Setting fiscal policy on a path of steady adjustment to preserve debt sustainability and
       macroeconomic stability.

       Facilitating external adjustment by allowing the exchange rate to respond flexibly to
       sustained balance of payments pressures.


                                               61
       Monitoring closely banking sector risks and enhancing the efficiency of supervision.

End-March quantitative performance criteria under the SBA (net international
Reserves (NIR), net domestic assets (NDA), and the fiscal deficit) were met with ample
margins. The end-June performance criteria are projected to be met, except for the floor
on NIR which is expected to be missed.

       Due to the cyclical rebound, the 2010 fiscal deficit is expected to be lower (in terms of
       GDP) than initially targeted under the program.

       The exchange rate has depreciated by 11.5 percent relative to the U.S. dollar since the
       beginning of the year, but intervention also increased above program levels in April-
       May in the face of persistent pressures. As a result, the end-June NIR target is unlikely
       to be observed.

       Measures taken to improve access to the central bank's refinancing window have
       contributed to the easing of credit conditions. The monetary policy stance is being
       tightened in response to recent exchange rate pressures.

       Recent global financial market turbulence has increased external risks.

       In light of pressures on the foreign exchange market in April-May, the authorities took
       welcome corrective fiscal and monetary policy measures and market conditions are
       stabilizing.

Relations with the Fund

An 18-month US$750 million Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was approved by the IMF's
Executive Board on September 15, 2008. On August 6, 2009, credit available under the SBA
was increased by about US$420 million, and the SBA was extended to June 14, 2011.
Cumulatively, the access to IMF credit made available to Georgia under the SBA comes to
497 percent of quota. The fifth review of the program was completed on March 19, 2010.
