The Health\n            Development Project extended technical and financial\n            assistance to the health sector of rural areas. The priority\n            was given to strengthen the primary health care system,\n            particularly in rural areas. Medical Insurance Program had\n            to be improved to ensure the poorest Georgians to have\n            access to health care services. Georgia implemented\n            far-reaching policy and institutional reforms to expand\n            health insurance coverage to more than 1 million.
