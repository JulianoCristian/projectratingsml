2. The project is on-track to achieve its development objectives, as reported in the
   Implementation Status and Results report. To-date seven on the eleven output indicators have
   already been met. The Project has also been providing assistance with implementation of the
   Value Added Tax, which became operational on January 1, 2010. The outcome indicator
   which has lagged most relates to implementation of budget norms for health and education
   sector. This is due to the revenue shortfalls experienced by the government on account of the
   global economic crisis. There is now renewed impetus by the Ministry of Finance to make
   progress on this issue and the team will continue to work with counterparts in this regard.

3. The proposed reallocation is necessary to mainly support the increasing requirements for
   budget training and procurement of consultants to carry out fiscal and budget works, and the
   purchase of IT equipment for GFIS under the Public Finance Management Reform
   component. The reallocations will come from unallocated funds and the civil works
   category. This is a second level restructuring as per the new restructuring framework. The
   requested reallocation will not affect the project design, implementation arrangements, and
   scope neither does the reallocation require a modification of the project description in the
   Financing Agreement. The Task Team had a discussion with the PIU and was informed that
   the reallocation plan will serve the project until the closing date in April 2011.
