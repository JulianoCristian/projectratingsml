Some lessons learned included:\n            the FMCBP highlights the experience from initially seeking a\n            strong project implementation  unit (PIU) organization\n            structure to compensate for low national capacity to deliver\n            timely outputs to relying on existing capacity for project\n            implementation, perhaps at the expense of expediency. While\n            a strong PIU could deliver some outputs on time, more often\n            than not its staff had to work within the existing low-level\n            capacity environment. This critical factor affected the\n            project implementation across the board. The FMCBP shows\n            that a strong PIU could be effectively used to focus on\n            certain critical areas where strong capacity is needed to\n            bring about timely results. But for a capacity building\n            project in general, it is beneficial to take into account\n            and to work with the country's existing capacity and\n            given environment to best support the capacity building\n            agenda. Due to the need for intensive supervision, a\n            technical assistance project would require adequate funding\n            and staffing to be able to address and manage challenges at\n            the implementation stage, some of which were unexpected and\n            unanticipated. The need for intensive supervision will\n            clearly benefit from the continuing and close presence of\n            the task manager (TM) and the core project team. The TM, in\n            close cooperation with other team members in the field and\n            at headquarters, maintained the implementation momentum for\n            the project through actively coordinating the\n            trouble-shooting activities among Bank staff and government\n            officials for all the challenges and bottlenecks facing the project."}, "docdt": "2011-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
