    Better Institutional Capacity Is Key to Structural Reforms in Lao PDR


Overview
This initiative supported the Government’s efforts to enhance its institutional capacity in guiding
the implementation of its structural reform program in selected sectors such as banking and
finance, public financial management, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). International
Development Association (IDA) financing and Bank expertise have supported Lao reform
efforts to enhance fiscal transparency by supporting publishing of audit reports and budget
reports, eliminate arrears on salaries by installing an electronic salary payment system,
improve management of SOEs by designing restructuring plans and conducting financial audits,
and improve fiduciary controls by supporting establishment of the centralized National Treasury.


Challenge
Based on lessons learned from experience with previous
                                                                     More Results

institutional capacity was one of the difficulties the

The Financial Management Capacity Building Project                    Country Website
(FMCBP), as an intervention instrument, would provide the             Country Overview
means for the Government to strengthen its institutional
                                                                      Country Assistance Strategy
capacity for implementing its reforms. In some cases, it
addressed inadequate staffing in many ministries and                  Data and Statistics
agencies concerned, led by the Ministry of Finance and the
Bank of Lao PDR. As the project progressed, it was
instrumental in assisting the Government in improving public
finance management (PFM), given the coming on-stream of
its hydroelectric power revenues and the required
management of these earnings. With the Government’s adoption of the Public Finance
Management Strengthening Program (PFMSP) to improve policy consistency, efficiency,
transparency and accountability in public finance management, the FMCBP assisted in
strengthening institutional systems and capacity with the aim of moving towards appropriate
international finance management standards. Among other interventions, the project addressed
the absence of a functional classification of the budget, the lack of an effective budget
monitoring and execution system, and the inadequate audit capacity of the State Audit
Organization, the weak monitoring of external debts, and the preparation of an SOE strategy
and action plan.

Results

      The FMCBP contributed to laying the groundwork for strengthening the institutional
      capacity of the government to manage the country’s Public Financial Management
      Strengthening Program at the Ministry of Finance (2005-2011);

      The Government Financial Information System was rolled out to all provinces with better
      connectivity quality, stability, and on-line availability (2010);

      Timely budget execution reports (2009 – 2011);

      The State Audit Organization was strengthened and its institutional capacity enhanced
      with better and more timely reporting to the National Assembly (2008-2011);

      Summaries of audit reports on the budget were made public (2010);

      A Procurement Monitoring Office was established (2007);

      Better and comprehensive curriculum for training officials at the Ministry of Finance was
      developed (2008);

      Approximately 93,000 women received subsidies for prenatal care and hospital delivery
      and 536,000 women received free or subsidized health exams between 1997 and 2006;

      The value-added tax was established and implemented successfully (2010).


Beneficiaries
FMCBP beneficiaries are various the Government ministries and agencies: Ministry of Finance
and its selected departments, Bank of Lao PDR, Ministry of Planning and Investment, various
state-owned enterprises, and Ministry of Public Works and Transport, Ministry of Justice,
Committee for Business Development, three state-owned commercial banks, the National
Assembly, and State Audit Organization. Building a stronger capacity for these institutions for
policy formulation, implementation and oversight has contributed to better reform program
management  and a better outcome in poverty reduction by ensuring sustained long-term
growth.

Bank Contribution
An IDA credit of US$8.5 million equivalent was provided and later augmented with a grant of
US$3 million for project restructuring.

Partners
Other partners that contributed to implementation and results were:

      The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID);

      The European Union (EU);

      Japan;
      The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); and

      The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.


Toward the Future
In order to continue supporting the Government of Lao PDR in implementation of the Public
Finance Management Strengthening Program and supporting institutions for external
accountability, the Bank is preparing a follow-up public finance management project, building
on the lessons learned from the FMCBP. In the meantime, interventions are continuing through
the multi-donor trust fund for the Public Finance Management Strengthening Program.
