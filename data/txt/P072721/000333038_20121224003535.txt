     CHINA: HEAT REFORM AND BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT
                              P072721
             GEF TRUST FUND GRANT, NUMBER TF054687-CHA

                                  Restructuring Paper


1.      The closing date for the China, Heat Reform and Building Energy Efficiency
Project, GEF Trust Fund Grant, Number TF054687-CHA, P072721 will be extended
from December 31, 2012 until October 31, 2013.

2.      During the first extension period (calendar year 2012), the project has met goals
set for restructuring in terms of new subprojects approved: from an agreed minimum of
three, the project has initiated seven subprojects. All subprojects have received Bank
NOL and have initiated procurement. The GEO and IP ratings of the last ISR are
satisfactory. The project objectives continue to be achievable.

3.      The auditor's opinion on the latest project audit report (for the year ending on
December 31, 2011) was unqualified (clean). The Bank reviewed the audit report and
found it acceptable.

4.      Disbursements to date (as of December 12, 2012) are 55% but MOHURD is
currently submitting disbursement requests to the Bank through MOF for 7% of the Grant
amount. Therefore, disbursement is estimated to be at 62% by the end of December 2012
(depending on MOF’s turnaround time for processing ongoing MOHURD’s
disbursement requests).

5.      The proposed extension is necessary to procure and execute at least 28% of the
Grant amount during the next 10 months. Payments for the ongoing subprojects will be
made in three tranches: 20% when the goods are delivered, 60% when the goods are
installed, 20% after an M&E summary report is produced. Goods that are being procured
now cannot be installed during the current heating season (November 2012 to April
2013) as this would require shutting down heating systems. They will be installed,
starting in April 2013. The total commitments for subprojects and technical assistance
under the project represent 90.4% of the total GEF grant.

6.     This will be the second extension of the project.
