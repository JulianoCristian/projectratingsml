The closing date for the\n            project will be extended from December 31, 2012 until\n            October 31, 2013. The extension is necessary to procure and\n            execute at least 28 percent of the Grant amount during the\n            next 10 months. Payments for the ongoing subprojects will be\n            made in three tranches: 20 percent when the goods are\n            delivered, 60 percent when the goods are installed, 20\n            percent after a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) summary\n            report is produced. Goods that are being procured now cannot\n            be installed during the current heating season (November\n            2012 to April 2013) as this will require shutting down\n            heating systems. They will be installed, starting in April\n            2013. The total commitments for subprojects and technical\n            assistance under the project represent 90.4 percent of the\n            total Global Environmental Facility (GEF) grant. This will\n            be the second extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
