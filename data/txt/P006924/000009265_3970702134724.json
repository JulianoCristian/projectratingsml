objective of the proposed\n            project is to expand the production of agricultural exports\n            in support of the Government's economic recovery and\n            structural adjustment program. In order to achieve its\n            principal objective, the proposed project would: (a) provide\n            agricultural credit for financing the development of\n            selected export crops, including rehabilitation or\n            replanting of about 4,500 ha and new planting about 2,500 ha\n            of cocoa. It would, furthermore, (b) improve about 104 km of\n            rural roads; (c) issue about 1,500 land titles; (d) provide\n            technical assistance to farmers; and (e) strengthen project\n            administration. Under the overall coordination of the\n            Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy (MIDEPLAN), the\n            project would be implemented by the following agencies: the\n            Banco Nacional de Costa Rica, or BNCR (credit); the Ministry\n            of Public Works and Transportation (roads); and the Agrarian\n            Development Institute (titling)."}, "docdt": "1986-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
