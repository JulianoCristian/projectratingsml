On the positive\n            side, the development objective of increasing export crops\n            in the Atlantic region was achieved, and the land titling\n            and rural roads programs provided considerable benefits to\n            the farmers and others in the project area. However,\n            excessive delays in project implementation occurred. The\n            following lessons were learned: a) The design of\n            agricultural development projects to support significant\n            technology change must include clear methodological\n            indicators and a work program for technology extension,\n            together with the budgeting of the resources required. B) In\n            projects where credit is a fundamental development\n            instrument, it is important to fully involve the\n            participating bank in the process of project preparation, in\n            order to develop ownership and discover and address possible\n            implementation problems. C) The institutional implementation\n            capacity of all involved entities should be carefully\n            evaluated, especially for rural roads components. D) The\n            execution of activities with active community participation\n            can result in considerable efficiencies and cost savings."}, "docdt": "1999-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
