IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
NEPAL
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 1515-NEP)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report for the Third Highway Project in
Nepal, for which Credit 1515-NEP in the amount of SDR 44.7 million ($ 47.5 million
equivalent) was approved on August 28, 1984, made effective on January 31, 1986, and
amended on May 6, 1986.
The Credit was closed on June 30, 1995, compared with the original closing date of
June 30, 1990. Final disbursement took place on November 22, 1995, at which time a
balance of SDR 3,462,584.69 was canceled. Co-financing for the project was provided by
the Government of India with a grant of IR 500,000,000 and the United Kingdom, through
its Overseas Development Administration (ODA), with a grant of UKP 7,702,000.
This Report was prepared by Brendan Kennedy, Consultant and Chris Hoban, Task
Manager, SA2EI of the South Asia Region, and reviewed by Jean-Fran,ois Bauer, Chief,
SA2EI and Kazuko Uchimura, Project Adviser, SA2DR. The Borrower prepared a separate
Implementation Completion Report which is on the project file, and a Completion Report
Summary and Plan of Operation which are attached as Appendixes B and C.
This Implementation Completion Report is based on IDA's final supervision
mission of May 1995, a follow-up mission in February 1996 and on the records maintained
in the project files. The Borrower contributed extensively and positively to the preparation
of the ICR through views reflected in the mission's aide-memoire, preparing its own
evaluation, and providing comments on the draft ICR.

THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 1515-NEP)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Nepal had a very limited road network up to the early 1970s, and its construction
and maintenance have been difficult because of unstable mountain terrain and high rainfall.
IDA has supported this sector with three previous projects. Credit 223-NEP ($2.5 million),
satisfactorily completed in June 1977 after some delays, dealt the replacement of
substandard bridges, construction of suspension bridges for porter traffic, preparation of a
road maintenance program and technical assistance. Credit 730-NEP ($17.0 million)
provided for the upgrading of about 18 km of the main road link from Kathmandu to India,
equipment for feeder road construction, feasibility studies on potential future road
investments and a training program for mechanics. A Road Flood Rehabilitation Project,
Credit 1922-NEP (SDR 11.2 million), completed in June 1995, assisted in the repair of the
damage to roads and bridges by the severe monsoon floods of 1987. The ongoing Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project, Credit 2578-NEP (SDR 36.6 million), which
became effective in September 1994, is dealing with the maintenance and rehabilitation of
important road links and substantial institutional strengthening.
Prject Objctives
2.    The objectives of the project were to: (a) integrate the Far Western Region of the
country into the national economy by completing an all-weather East-West Highway; (b)
improve traffic conditions between Kathmandu and the Indian border at Birganj; and (c)
improve the Department of Roads' (DOR) capacity to implement and monitor road
maintenance and the project components. The objectives were clear, realistic and
achievable. However the components included to strengthen DOR capacity were not
particularly demanding with regard to institutional reform and strengthening.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    The physical objectives were almost entirely met after some delays. The Far
Western Region has been connected to the national road network and largely integrated into
the national economy. The quality and reliability of the road connection between



ii
Kathmandu and Birganj has been substantially improved. Project savings were used to
finance emergency repairs following severe flood damage on this road towards the end of
the project. The notable exception is that the full benefits of the East-West Highway can
not be realized until the remaining 18 bridges are completed under separate bilateral
financing. These are due to commence in 1996 and be completed in 1998.
4.    The institutional components were implemented successfully as intended, including
a large training program, support for private sector development and the purchase of road
maintenance equipment. These have strengthened the skills and capacity of both the public
and private sector, but much remains to be done.
5.    At the end of the project, maintenance outputs of the DOR were still far short of
desirable, resulting in declining condition of the road network not currently under
rehabilitation, and accelerated deterioration of existing assets. These issues are being
addressed by an ambitious program of technical assistance and reforms under the ongoing
Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project, which is beginning to show some promising
results. Long-term improvement of maintenance delivery will require sustained
implementation of these programs, with high-level commitment to a major shift towards
results-oriented maintenance management. It is likely to require continued support for
institutional strengthening over 5-10 years. In the meantime, sustainability of project
investments is rated as uncertain.
6.    Credit effectiveness was delayed by one year, and implementation took 9 years
instead of the expected 5. The Credit closed with all major items completed and SDR 3.5
million undisbursed, reflecting savings in project costs, appreciation of the SDR and some
reallocation of works to GOI financing. The main IDA-financed components had actual
ERRs of 27%, 29% and 16%, compared with appraisal estimates of 18%, 21-23% and 14-
16% respectively. In each case, increased benefits arose from higher-than-expected traffic
growth. No re-assessment was possible for the East-West Highway and Kamali Bridge, but
the works were cost-effective.
7.    Some of the causes of delay were not fully within the control of the Borrower,
implementing agency or IDA: bilateral negotiations on aid restructuring, major flood
damage, and a Trade and Transit dispute with India. Other aspects of delay reflected lack of
implementation capacity and experience on the part of both the Borrower and the private
sector. These have improved under the project but further reforms are needed to ensure
timely completion of road projects.
8.    The overall project outcome is rated as satisfactory, and the performance of IDA
and the Borrower are also rated satisfactory. Future projects should be integrated with
ongoing projects, to give momentum to institutional development and physical
development, and continuity in the macro objectives of sustainability of road assets and
reduced transport costs.

Findings and Key Lessons Learned
9.    The project met its immediate objectives, and made some progress towards
strengthening the institutional capacity of the Borrower and the private sector. Full
realization of the benefits of the East-West Highway investment will depend on completion
of the missing bridges and approach roads, and would be substantially enhanced by
completion of a new road link to India via the Tanakpur Barrage on the Mahakali River,
some 12 km north of the current highway terminal. The government in its comments on
this report indicated that this could be the subject of future bilateral discussion
10.   The key lessons learned from the project are:
(a)   Maintenance effectiveness needs to be dramatically improved to ensure
sustainability of road improvements. While there may be a need to increase
maintenance budgets, the most critical immediate challenge is to ensure that
available maintenance resources are effectively and systematically used for
highest-priority needs. This requires strong government commitment to
improved maintenance management and results-orientated maintenance
spending.
(b)   Particular attention to drain clearing, river training works and road repairs
before and during the monsoon season could reduce the susceptibility to
flood damage. This can be addressed through improved maintenance
management.
(c)   There is a need to improve procurement processing, customs clearance and
inter-ministerial coordination in DOR and HMGN, to permit timely and
effective response to road improvement needs and reduce the costs of works
implementation
(d)   The successful involvement of DOR staff in implementation was a particular
highlight of the project. This involvement of DOR staff in project
preparation could be expanded and should be encouraged in future for
effective implementation.
11.   The Borrower's Plan of Operation for the Project is included in Appendix C.
Particular attention will be needed for routine and periodic maintenance, flood protection
measures, environmental management and systematic maintenance of the Kamali Bridge.

THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 1515-NEP)
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT AND EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
Objectives
The objectives of the project were to:
(a)   provide a dependable means of integrating the Far West of the country into
the national economy by completing an all-weather East-West Highway;
b)    improve traffic conditions between Kathmandu and the Indian border at
Birganj by selective rehabilitation of bridges and road pavements; and
(c)   strengthen the operation and administration of the Department of Roads
(DOR), in particular to improve their capability to implement and monitor
both road maintenance and project components by providing technical
assistance, equipment and training.
2.    To achieve these objectives the project comprised:
(a)   the completion of the East-West Highway by constructing to all-weather
standards about 204 km of the last section remaining between Kohalpur and
the Indian border, including the construction of a major bridge over the
Karnali River;
(b)   construction of about 60 km of feeder roads linking main areas of
agricultural production south of the project road;
(c)   rehabilitation and maintenance of about 82 kmn of the Kathmandu-Birganj
Road, including selected bridges;
(d)   equipment for road maintenance, materials testing and site inspection; and
(e)   technical assistance and training.



2
3.    These components were significantly modified in the project amendment of May 6,
1986, shortly after Credit effectiveness. The East-West Highway and feeder road
construction were taken over by Indian co-financing under the project, with supervision and
Karnali Bridge construction financed by IDA, and the deletion of Saudi Fund co-financing
(para 10). During implementation, the scope of the project was further modified, and the
closing date further extended, to utilize project savings for flood damage rehabilitation
works on project roads. The project did not include any environmental objectives, but
included a legal covenant and training activities to mitigate possible impacts of a 15 km
road section passing through Royal Bardia National Park.
Evaluation of Objectives
4.    The project reflects high priority given in Nepal's Sixth Plan (1980/81-1984/85) for
the development of agriculture, national integration, optimizing the use of existing
infrastructure and the development of human resources. The objectives were clear, realistic
and achievable. The physical components included in the project were appropriate means
of achieving the objectives. The project appraisal recognized the inadequacy of past
maintenance and the need for improvements, but perhaps did not fully address this need in
the design of institutional strengthening components, which were not particularly
demanding with regard to maintenance reform. The approach taken was typical of similar
Bank projects at the time.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
5.    The physical objectives of the project were almost entirely met after some delays.
The 204 km Kohalpur-Mahakali section of the East-West Highway was substantially
completed, including the Kamali River bridge and 52 km of gravel-surfaced feeder roads.
As a result, the Far Western Region has been linked to the national road network and
largely integrated into the national economy, and nearby agricultural areas have been better
linked to the new highway. The quality and reliability of the main road connection between
Kathmandu and Birganj has been substantially improved. In addition, major flood damage
repairs were undertaken on the Naubise-Mugling section of the Prithvi Highway following
severe floods in 1993.
6.    However the full benefits of the East-West Highway improvement are constrained
by the remaining need for construction of 18 bridges and associated approach roads. These
missing sections arose from the inadequacy of floodways originally included in the project,
and delays in negotiating bilateral assistance for replacement bridges. Until they are
completed (under Indian assistance commencing in 1996), traffic is using temporary detours
and river crossings which are not always passable in the rainy season.
7.    The institutional components were implemented successfully as intended. The
project included substantial local and overseas training and on-the-job secondments for
DOR engineers. Small contracts were let and assistance was provided to local contractors
and consultants to strengthen their capacity in the road sector. Road maintenance
equipment with a total value of $4.6 million was purchased under the project and located at
divisional and regional offices throughout Nepal. The benefits of this training are still



3
obvious within the Department and the private sector, and the equipment has been valuable
for use in emergency maintenance and flood damage repairs. There was clearly an
improvement in the capability of DOR to implement and monitor road maintenance and
project components, as specified in the project objectives. However this improvement was
limited. At the end of the project, road maintenance remained inadequate and maintenance
equipment was not utilized to its full potential.
8.    The main constraint on maintenance effectiveness appears to be a lack of systematic
management of resources (equipment, staff and budgets) and outputs. While there may be a
need to increase maintenance budgets, the most critical immediate challenge is to ensure
that available resources are effectively used for highest-priority maintenance needs, and not
diverted to lower-priority tasks.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
9.    The main factors affecting project completion were (a) significant delays to the start,
(b) slow contract implementation and, (c) when the project was substantially completed in
mid-1993, the repair of damages caused by the devastating floods of that year. The start of
the project was stalled by delays in Credit Effectiveness. The Credit was expected to be
effective in March 1985, but eventually became effective in January 1986 after three
extensions. Effectiveness was initially delayed by conditions of effectiveness (Project
Implementation Unit, environmental training and regulations). Major delays then arose
over restructuring of the project to include GOI financing.
10.   Procurement for the Kohalpur-Mahakali road contracts had been completed with a
HMGN Letter of Intent to award the contracts to the lowest evaluated bidder, China Road &
Bridge Construction Co. However, in July 1985, before the contracts were signed, GOI
offered a grant of IR 500 million ($40 million equivalent) to finance this road and
associated feeder roads using Indian and Nepali contractors. HMGN indicated to IDA its
intention to accept the GOI grant. IDA initially considered that such an arrangement would
constitute misprocurement, but later concluded that there were special extenuating
circumstances. In September 1985, HMGN signed an agreement with the GOI accepting
the grant and requested the Saudi Fund to cancel their financing. In May 1986, IDA issued
a Letter of Amendment to Credit 151 5-NEP revising the financing plan.
11.   Project implementation was seriously delayed by the expiry of the Trade and Transit
Treaty between Nepal and India in March 1989. All the civil works components suffered
severe shortages of fuel and other material which lasted until the treaty came back into
operation in July 1990. Progress during this period was limited.
12.   There was also slow progress because of contractual and technical difficulties. The
lack of experience of the contractors in executing large road contracts to international
standards was apparent on the Kohalpur-Mahakali and Naubise-Malekhu contracts. Typical
problems included a lack of serviceable plant and equipment and experienced site staff and
a lack of on-site management for some contracts. On the Kamali bridge contract there were
various technical problems related to foundation concrete cracks, high stresses in the truss
and cable vibrations, which led to implementation delays and substantial increases in



4
supervision cost. The logistics problems on large contracts in the remote Far Western
Region without proper all-weather access also contributed to the contract delays.
13.   The original design for the Kohalpur-Mahakali road called for 14 floodways.
However flooding in 1991 extensively damaged five of the six floodways already built, and
DOR proposed replacement of all floodways with bridges. IDA financed the feasibility
study and bridge design. The available GOI funds would not cover the cost of bridge
construction, but the possibility of further GOI grant assistance for this purpose was
discussed over several years. HMGN and GOI concluded an agreement in January 1996
under which the GOI will finance the construction of the missing bridges and approach
roads.
14.   The project was substantially completed by mid 1993. Credit Closing was then
delayed by severe monsoon floods of July and August of 1993 which carried away three
bridges, built earlier with Chinese aid, and damaged the road works on the Naubise-
Mugling road. Additional repair works were substantially completed at the new Credit
Closing on June 30, 1995 but financing of the remaining bridge works and some minor road
works have been carried forward to Credit 2578.
Implementation Record and Economic Re-Analysis
15.   Construction periods for four GOI-financed contracts for the East-West Highway
between Kohalpur and Mahakali (including 52 km of feeder roads) ranged from 64 to 86
months, compared with a contract period of 48 months, and substantial completion was
achieved by April 1993. Construction cost was NR 1,015 million, compared with the
appraisal cost estimate of NR 1,039 million. IDA financed a major bridge over the Karnali
River. The 42 month contract period was twice extended by a total of 31 months to June
1993. Final costs were NR 360 million compared with the bid price of NR 255 million and
the appraisal estimate of NR 237 million.
16.   At appraisal the economic analysis feasibility of this road investment included the
costs and benefits of planned irrigation, agriculture and other development projects in the
influence area of the road, and benefits from tourism and cost savings in avoiding airlifting
food and fuel. The ERR on the entire package of investments was estimated at 14%. It has
not been possible to recalculate the ERR for the road investment since the data on the
benefits from the major irrigation, agriculture and other investments are not available.
Furthermore, the full impact of the road has not yet been realized due to the missing
bridges. Nevertheless there are clear signs of new economic activity along the route, and
the 1995 average daily traffic of 200 veh/day is well above that on the pre-existing track.
The per-kilometer cost of NR 5.0 million or about $100,000/kn is cost-effective for new
construction of a two-lane road on embankment in this region.
17.   The 44 km Naubise-Malekhu road upgrading financed by IDA started in December
1987 and was scheduled for completion in 24 months. The works were substantially
completed in December 1992 following contract extensions mainly related to supply
difficulties resulting from the expiry of the Trade and Transit Treaty. The cost to this point
was NR 213 million, and about 80% over the appraisal cost estimate of NR 170 million.



5
The cost per kilometer was cost effective at NR 7.0 million or about $142,000 equivalent,
for road widening to two lanes and rehabilitation in mountainous terrain. Table 9a shows a
revised ERR of 30% compared with the appraisal estimate of 18%. This is primarily due to
the high annual traffic growth of 13.2% to 1995, leading to more than double the traffic
expected under the predicted 6.5% growth rate. The contract was subsequently extended to
include flood repair works in the amount of NRs  110 million. A separate contract paid NR
50.00 million towards the replacement of the three bridges. It was not possible to calculate
a rate of return which incorporated the additional costs and benefits of these works.
18.   The 38 km Malekhu-Mugling road section, financed by ODA, was built under a
contract management arrangement under which all the resources of plant, equipment,
materials and skilled manpower for the construction and management were provided. The
final cost including flood damage repairs is estimated at about $24.0 million, more than
163% over the appraisal estimate of $9.12 million. The cost per kilometer is approximately
180% higher than for the adjacent section financed by IDA. However, this cost includes
substantial technical assistance on project management and slope stability, and plant,
equipment, transport and housing handed over to HMGN after the completion of the
roadworks.
19.   The seven new bridges constructed on the Tribhuvan Rajpath were substantially
completed in April 1989, six months beyond the original 24 month contract period. The
final cost was NR 54.2 million, the same as the bid amount. This represents NR 35.7
million in 1983/84 prices, compared with the appraisal estimate of NR 58.5 million. For
the two bridges between Thankot and Naubise, Table 9b shows a revised ERR of 47%
compared with appraisal estimates of 23% and 21 %. This is primarily due to lower real
costs and an annual traffic growth of 12.5% to 1995, compared with the appraisal estimate
of 6.5%. Similarly, for the five bridges between Hetauda and Birganj, Table 9c shows a
revised ERR of 29%, compared with appraisal estimates of 14-16%. Actual traffic growth
in this case was 8.3% to 1995, compared with the original 6.5% estimated.
20.  In the final year, project savings financed completion of unfinished rehabilitation
works on the Mugling-Marsyangdi section of the Prithvi Highway, which was previously
financed under Credit 1478-NEP.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
21.   Sustainability of the project is rated as uncertain. Sustainability of physical works
depends primarily on the probability of timely and effective maintenance to preserve the
value of road assets. At the closing date of the project, there is considerable evidence that
such maintenance is not being systematically provided. Recent data on road network
condition show a considerable proportion of the road system in poor condition, and when
sections currently under rehabilitation are excluded, it appears that overall condition of the
remaining highway network is deteriorating. On those sections programmed for
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance, procurement delays and lack of preventative
maintenance have frequently resulted in accelerated deterioration prior to works
commencement, typically leading to more expensive emergency maintenance and/or
additional works costs. While routine maintenance budgets have been increasing, the



6
achievement of effective maintenance has been limited by a lack of systematic management
of work programming and results. The need for institutional strengthening in this area, to
preserve road assets and make best use of maintenance resources, was not fully foreseen in
project preparation.
22.   These issues were identified in the preparation of the ongoing Road Maintenance
and Rehabilitation Project (Credit 2578-NEP), and an ambitious program of institutional
strengthening was developed with support of ODA, SDC and UNDP. This includes a
assistance for a Maintenance and Rehabilitation Coordination Unit, Strengthened
Maintenance Divisions, Field Implementation Advisers, Plant Management, Bridge
Management, Road Safety, Bio-engineering, a Priority Investment Plan and a Pilot District
Labor-Based Rehabilitation and Maintenance component. The ongoing project also
focused on increased budget allocations for maintenance and the establishment of a Road
Maintenance Fund. Many of these initiatives are beginning to show very positive results in
improved road maintenance planning, management and execution. In particular, DOR is
beginning to identify changes in management practices which place more emphasis on
setting and achieving maintenance targets. Continued pursuit of these programs over five to
ten years is likely to lead to sustainable road maintenance for the strategic network and
increasingly efficient management of traffic flow, but this will require considerable focus
and commitment on the part of HMGN. In the meantime, sustainability of physical works
under the project must be rated as uncertain.
23.   Because of its unique characteristics and remote location the maintenance of the
Kamali Bridge requires special attention. Apart from an inspection in 1994 and current
provisions for security and minor maintenance, the recommended inspection and
maintenance program has not been implemented since bridge completion. This is now
receiving further attention from HMGN, and further IDA assistance is provided for under
the ongoing Credit 2578.
24.   Training provided under the project provided substantial ongoing benefits in skill
development in DOR. However the DOR Training Center has not yet demonstrated
sustainable success of its continuing programs, and is receiving further assistance under
Credit 2578. Equipment provided under the project is still being utilized by DOR, and was
very effectively employed in the massive and well organized emergency repairs to maintain
road access to Kathmandu after the 1993 floods. However utilization rates and equipment
maintenance are well below the standards which would be expected of an efficient private
sector equipment operator. Assistance provided by ODA under the Road Maintenance and
Rehabilitation Project is working towards a more commercial approach to equipment
management.
25.   Site visits indicate that the measures taken under the project to minimize the
environmental effects of the road passing through the Royal Bardia National Park are
continuing and are effective.

E. BANK PERFORMANCE
Identification/Preparation
26.   Preparation of the project was supported by feasibility studies and design done
under the Second Highway Project (Credit 730-NEP). Feasibility and design for the
Kohalpur-Mahakali road was jointly financed by IDA and UNDP. In planning for this road,
IDA emphasized the need for appropriate regulations to protect the Royal Bardia National
Park. This eventually led to conservation regulations being adopted nationally and in a
proposal to increase the size of the park by including a buffer zone. IDA worked closely
with DOR in reviewing and monitoring the studies' findings and designs, and in mobilizing
cofinancing through ODA and the Saudi Fund.
Appraisal
27.   The main issues at appraisal in January/February 1983 concerned a financing gap of
about $ 30.0 million, whether the Kohalpur-Mahakali road should be bid as part of the
Babai Irrigation Project, and early prequalification of contractors. It was decided that
additional financing be sought, the road project be bid separately if the irrigation project
was delayed (which it was), and that the prequalification be a condition of negotiations.
The Decision Memo of April 1983 also emphasized that road network maintenance was the
major sector policy matter.
Sunervision
28.  IDA's progress reporting was adequate and the performance ratings were
appropriate. While advice was provided on implementation problems experienced on the
GOI-financed Kohalpur-Mahakali road contracts, these were largely outside the control of
IDA and DOR. The prompt and flexible responses to the many unforeseen circumstances
which arose were a commendable feature of IDA's supervision performance. Following the
1993 flood which isolated Kathmandu by cutting the vital road link to India, an IDA Flood
Emergency Mission mobilized quickly in Nepal to advise HMGN on dealing with the
widespread infrastructure damage. IDA agreed to have all the repair works financed from
savings under the Credit, and worked quickly to process the procurement arrangements.
Similar support was provided by ODA for the Malekhu-Mugling road section, and for the
deployment of three temporary Bailey bridges to re-open road access.
F. BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
Project Preparation
29.   The borrower's performance in project preparation was satisfactory. Even with its
resource constraints, DOR's role in monitoring the preparatory studies, contract
documentation and procurement with IDA and other donors was significant. However there



8
was evidence of a lack of coordination with other government agencies particularly in
regard to the environmental issues in the Royal Bardia National Park.
Project Implementation
30.   The start of the project was delayed by the borrower's slow compliance with the
conditions of effectiveness. Several IDA post-appraisal missions were needed to expedite
these matters and enable the credit to be declared effective. At DOR's request, it was agreed
early in the project that DOR staff would be actively involved in implementing the project.
DOR engineers were also seconded to work on the sites with the technical assistance
consultants responsible for design and supervision of construction. This on-the-job training
has been effective in enabling DOR staff to acquire new project management skills and to
improve their ability to supervise projects and to implement quality control procedures.
DOR also appointed senior engineers as Project Managers for each works component.
31.   The borrower complied fully with IDA guidelines on procurement and generally
complied with the Credit covenants although there were some long delay in submitting
audit reports.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
32.   The overall project outcome is rated as satisfactory. The physical objectives were
almost entirely met, after substantial delays, many of which were beyond the control of the
implementing agency, HMGN or IDA. Additional flood damage repairs were financed
from project savings. Economic benefits of the works on the Prithvi Highway and
Tribhuvan RajPath are substantially higher than expected, largely due to sustained high
traffic growth over the project period. The East-West Highway between Kohalpur and
Mahakali, including the large Kamali Bridge, provides a greatly improved link between the
far Western Region and the rest of Nepal, which has resulted in increased economic activity
in the region. However the full benefits of this link have not yet been realized due to the
absence of a number of bridges and approach roads.
33.   A number of implementation problems arose from institutional weaknesses within
DOR, the contracting and consulting industry, and HMGN procedures, such as customs.
Both public and private sector capacity were substantially improved under the project.
Nevertheless implementation problems need to be further reduced in more recent contracts
under the ongoing Credit 2578.
34.   The project training component strengthened DOR and HMGN staff skills and
capabilities, but did not substantially address institutional arrangements and practices which
limit the ability to manage contracts and implement effective maintenance. These are
important to DOR's macro objective of reducing transport costs by developing sustainable
maintenance management.

H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
35.   The Borrower's Plan of Operations for future management of project roads is
included in Appendix C. Routine and periodic maintenance of the road network is of the
highest priority in Nepal and vital to maintaining road assets. Particular attention is needed
for timely maintenance of roadside drainage. The ongoing Credit 2578 is helping DOR
reorganize and fund road maintenance on a more efficient and cost effective basis.
36.   Construction of the missing bridges on the Kohalpur-Mahakali section of the East-
West Highway is expected to commence in 1996 under bilateral GOI financing. The
impact of this road could also be greatly enhanced by the completion of a road link to India
at the western border on the Mahakali River. This will require coordination with GOI on
the opening of the Tanakpur Barrage to road traffic, and the construction of an approach
road on Indian territory. A feasibility study is required to define a 12 km link road from the
East-West Highway to Brahmadev on the Nepal side.
37.   Environmental protection will remain an important issue for future road
construction, maintenance and operation. Drainage, slope stability, roadside planting and
river protection works are important features of responsible environmental management,
requiring close planning and control of construction and maintenance operations. Measures
should be incorporated in road planning and management to mitigate social impacts and to
protect wildlife, sensitive natural environments and cultural heritage. The low survival rate
of the trees planted along some project roads highlights the need for a robust approach to
this important environmental action. Arrangements for selection, planting and care of
roadside planting should involve expert advice and may utilize maintenance lengthmen and
local villagers. Planting and plant maintenance by contractors should be carefully specified
and monitored, with appropriate penalty clauses.
1. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
38.   Maintenance management needs to be strengthened to ensure sustainability of road
improvements. This requires substantial changes in procedures for planning and executing
maintenance works, and for monitoring and reporting results achieved. While there may be
a need to increase maintenance budgets, the most critical immediate challenge is to ensure
that available resources (equipment, staff and budgets) are effectively and systematically
used for highest-priority maintenance needs. New procedures and capabilities are being
developed under the ongoing Credit, but their success will depend on strong leadership and
commitment from senior officials to improved management and results orientation for
maintenance spending. This can be assisted by strong donor support.
39.   Particular attention to drain clearing, river training works and road repairs before
and during the monsoon season could reduce the susceptibility to flood damage.
40.   While a number of project delays were outside the full control of either HMGN or
IDA (e.g. bilateral grant negotiations, the Trade and Transit dispute, extreme floods), others



l0
could have been avoided, through high-level inter-ministerial coordination and decisive
actions to meet the conditions of credit effectiveness and expedite project execution. While
implementation procedures have improved, substantial and costly delays remain and need
further reform. There is a need to improve procurement processing, customs clearance and
contract management in DOR and HMGN, to permit timely and effective response to road
improvement needs and reduce the costs of works implementation. Time consuming and
lengthy procedures need to be simplified by HMGN, and concurrence from IDA should be
expedited where possible.
41.   The successful involvement of DOR staff in implementation was a particular
highlight of the project. This involvement of DOR engineers should be continued in future
operations and expanded in the project preparation process. DOR capacity to supervise and
review consultant feasibility and design work also requires strengthening.
42.   There is some debate in the engineering profession as to whether floodways were
appropriate for the river crossings on the Kohalpur-Mahakali Road. However it seems
likely that their viability could have been substantially improved by better design and
implementation. Following the failure of some floodways and the subsequent long delays
in provision of replacement bridges, more speedy actions could have been taken to provide
temporary crossings in order to more fully utilize benefits of the completed road
construction works.
43.   The technically complex design of the Karnali Bridge may not have been
appropriate for construction in a remote area of Western Nepal, given the limited capacity
of the DOR to oversee its construction, retain skilled personnel and ensure effective
maintenance over the life of the bridge.

APPENDIX A
Extract from Mission's Aide-Memoire, April 2 - 19,1995
1.    The mission had detailed discussions with the Deputy Director General, the Project
Manager for the Road Flood Rehabilitation Project and the two Project Managers for the
Third Highway Project (one for the Kohalpur-Mahakali Road and Karnali Bridge
components and one for the Naubise-Malekhu Road component) on the guidelines for the
Borrower's Project Evaluation Reports/Summary. Copies of the guidelines for the
preparation of the report were given to the Deputy Director General and to the Project
Managers.
2.    There was considerable discussion on the details to be included in the
Report/Summary on the plan for the operational phase of the project. The mission pointed
out that objective of such operational plan was to sustain the flow of economic benefits
accruing from the investments made under the projects. Accordingly, for completed road
projects the operational plan would include details of the preparation, funding and
implementation of a routine and periodic maintenance program.
3.    The particular problems concerning the operational plan for the Government of
India (GOI) funded Kohalpur-Mahakali Road was discussed. The 18 bridges and approach
roads, west of Kamali Bridge, which were deleted from the project and the lack of a
connection to the new barrage at the Indian border have resulted in the traffic flow along the
Kohalpur-Mahakali road and on the Kamali bridge being much less than anticipated. As a
consequence, the expected benefits from the road investment have not yet been fully
realized. The mission was informed that discussions were progressing with the
Government of India (GOI) regarding the financing of the 18 bridges and remaining works.
Therefore, it was agreed that, in addition to the road and bridge inspection and maintenance
plan, the operational plan for the Kohalpur-Mahakali Road would include a detailed
schedule for the completion of the remaining road and bridge works so that the benefits
from the investments on the road and bridge can be fully realized.
4.    The Deputy Director General queried whether an economic reevaluation of the road
investment at this time would be meaningful. He also told the mission that DOR did not
have the expertise in agronomics to replicate the type of economic analysis done in the SAR
for this road and asked for IDA's assistance.
5.    Following a request from the Borrower in a letter dated January 3, 1995, IDA has
approved an amendment to Credit 151 5-NEP to include i) the rehabilitation of the Mugling-
Marsyangdi Road and ii) technical assistance for the supervision of the rehabilitation works.
The Amendment Letter dated March 21, 1995, and signed and returned to IDA by the
Borrower on April 16, 1995, covered the inclusion of this work in Credit 151 5-NEP and
gave allocation amounts in SDR based on the request for $ 700,000. The mission was told
that the amount required for this work has now increased from $700,000 to $ 900,000 and



24
informed DOR that the additional funds needed could be provided by reallocating the
amounts between the categories of Credit 1515-NEP.
Naubise - Malekhu Road Component
6.    The final cost including the cost of flood repair and the three new bridges is
estimated as:
Naubise-Malekhu Road Contracts             -      NRs. 312.86 m.
Repair of Flood Damages (V.O.s 22 & 23)    -     NRs. 126.16 m.
Reconstruction of Three bridges            -     NRs. 155.63 m.
7.    The bridge contract will not be completed before June 30, 1995, the Closing Date
for Credit 1515-NEP, and the total value of the work remaining to be completed is
estimated at NRs. 92.43 million. Therefore, with IDA's financing of 77% of civil works, an
estimated amount of $ 1.45 million for civil works plus an additional amount of about $
234,000 for consultant services on supervision, amounting to a total of $ 1.68 million will
need to be financed from the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project, Credit 2578-
NEP. The mission and DOR agreed that the Borrower would promptly ask IDA to issue a
Letter of Amendment to Credit 2578-NEP to include the remaining bridge construction and
supervision and their financing in the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project. The
Borrower would also send to IDA an Implementation Schedule with costs for the bridge
works.
Kohalpur-Mahakali Road Component.
8.    All four road contracts have been completed. The original contracts periods were
48 months, from March 1, 1986 to February 28, 1990. Time extensions were granted to all
contracts on February 26, 1991: an additional 36 months for Contract No.1, 38 months for
Contract no. 2, 24 months for Contract No. 3 and 15.5 months for Contract no. 4. All the
contracts have now been completed with the last maintenance Certificate issued for
Contract No 1. on May 31, 1994. The four contracts have completed 153.5 km out of the
total project length of 204 km. The 18 bridges and their approaches with a combined length
of about 8 km are yet to be built but the mission was told that HMG has reached an
understanding with GOI who would provide a grant for their construction. About 43 km of
the most westerly section was built some 15 years ago by DOR. Of this length, 12 km
needing complete rehabilitation and 31 km needing maintenance are included in the Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project. The mission strongly recommends that a link road
to the new Tanakpur barrage be built to connect the highway to the Indian road network

9.    The original and current estimated costs of the Kohalpur-Mahakali Road contracts
are:
Corrected Contract Amount   Final Contract Amount
(NRs.m.)                  (NRs.m.)
Contract No. 1                       148.49                    149.92
Contract No. 2                      214.12                     188.31
Contract No. 3                      218.10                     224.59
Contract No. 4                      248.46                     231.25
829.17                    794.07
10.   Total costs are estimated at NRs. 794.07 million plus claims estimated at NRs.
192.65, giving a total of 986.72 million, about 29% above the original contract amount.
The claims submitted by the four contractors are mostly related to the expiration of the
Trade and Transit Treaty between Nepal and India and the mission was informed that the
claims have been negotiated between HMG's Negotiating Committee and the contractors.
Karnali Bridge Component
11.   The total cost of the contract is NRs. 353.068 million an increase of about 23% over
the original contract amount of NRs. 287.800 million. The last outstanding Claims Nos. 18
and 30 have been reviewed by the Claims Committee who recommended payment of NRs.
7.16 million and IDA has given its no objection to the payment of these claims.
Summary of Agreements and Understandings Reached.
1.    DOR agreed to send to IDA by September 30, 1995, the Borrower's Report on the
Third Highway Project (Credit 1515-NEP)
2.    The mission and DOR agreed that the Borrower would promptly ask IDA to issue a
Letter of Amendment to Credit 2578-NEP to include the construction and
supervision of the remaining bridge civil works on the Mahadevbesi, Belkhu and
Malekhu bridges on the Naubise-Malekhu Road to done after June 30, 1995, and
their financing in the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation project. The Borrower
would also send to IDA an Implementation Schedule with costs for the completion
of the bridge works.

Extract from Mission's Aide-Memoire, October 31-Nov 8, 1995
Third Highway Project and Road Flood Rehabilitation Project:
Preparation of Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs)
1.    The remaining tasks for the preparation of these ICRs were discussed. For the Road
Flood Rehabilitation Project, DOR provided detailed comments on IDA's draft completion
report, and agreed to prepare a summary of not more than three pages from its borrower's
completion report, for inclusion in the final ICR. DOR also agreed to prepare an action
plan for the operational phase of the project.
2.    For the Third Highway Project, preparation of the government's report was delayed
because of uncertainties about a possible further extension of the project, which did not
eventuate. DOR agreed to finalize this report by the end of December 1995, including
project performance indicators, indicators for the operational phase of the project, and
details of current traffic flows and expected traffic growth on each of the project roads.
3.    The mission discussed the sustainability of road works undertaken in the course of
these two projects. It is clear from a number of indicators that HMGN budgeting,
programming and implementation of routine and periodic maintenance works are not
currently adequate to preserve existing road assets, so that substantial premature
deterioration is taking place on many sections even while other sections are being
improved. This was evident at a number of sites observed in the field, and is reflected in the
road condition data collected by MRCU. On the other hand, the Department of Roads has
embarked on an ambitious program of reform of road maintenance planning, management
and execution, which is showing excellent results in a number of areas such as the SMDs.
It was agreed that the continued pursuit of these programs over five to ten years will lead to
sustainable road maintenance for the strategic network, but that this will require
considerable focus and commitment on the part of HMGN.
4.    Following previous correspondence on this matter, the mission informed DOR and
MOF that it was not possible for IDA to extend the disbursement period for the Third
Highway Project (Cr. 1515) beyond the October 31 deadline. HMGN endeavored to
finalize a large proportion of the outstanding claims and forward these to IDA before the
deadline. DOR informed the mission that there remained some outstanding claims related
to the Mugling-Marsyangdi road section which could not be finalized within this period.
5.    IDA expressed concern about the lack of routine maintenance on the Mugling-
Marsyandgi section of the Prithvi Highway, which was completed in March, 1995. Further
information was also requested on the current arrangements and future plans for
maintenance of the Kamali Bridge.

DEPARTMENT OF ROADS
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT - CREDIT 1515-NEP
BORROWER'S COMPLETION REPORT - SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Due to the young geological age of Nepal's Himalayas Mountains and Terai with
numerous rivers cris-crossing the country, its terrain has always been fragile and
ecologically sensitive, the construction of highway proved to be most challenging, difficult
and costly from the technical and environmental point of view.
2.    Nepal is building roads in order to integrate the country physically and
economically. Nepal had accorded highest priority in transport sector. Still some 20
district headquarters out of 75 are still to be provided with road transport facilities. IDA has
assisted Nepal with two previous transport projects since two and half decades.
3.    The Third Highway Project is the subject of this report and is described below. The
fourth credit Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation project (RMRP), IDA's Cr. 2578-NEP
amounting 50 million US $ (SDR 36.6 million) is currently running with a view to maintain
and rehabilitate some of the important road links of the country.
4.    The IDA has also approved to finance the outstanding works of three major bridges
and some of Road repair works of Prithvi Highway (PHW) from RMRP IDA's Cr. No.
2578-NEP after the expiry of the loan period of Third Highway Project IDA's Cr. No.
1515-NEP on 30 June 1995. The IDA's Cr. No. 1515 NEP also partially financed the
remaining works of Mugling - Marsyangdi Road Rehabilitation Project leading to the
scenic tourist spot of Pokhara Valley after the expiry of the loan period of the Marsyangdi
Hydroelectric Power Project IDA's Cr. No. 1478-NEP on 31st December 1994.
5.    The assistance from IDA in carrying out the transport Projects have been
commendable and instrumental in the development of this vital transport infrastructural
facilities which prove to be catalytic agents for other sectors of development. Furthermore
the decision of the World Bank to finance some of the projects such as the Replacement of
Flood Damaged Bridges and Road Repairs Works on Naubise-Malekhu section of PHW
and the remaining works of Mugling-Marsyangdi section which are not conceived in the
original DCA of IDA's Cr. No. 1515-NEP has helped in restoring the severed link to the
capital with the rest of the country.

Objectives
6.    The main objectives of the Third Highway Project were:
(a)   To integrate the far western region of the country physically and
economically by completing the construction of East-West Highway from
Kohalpur to Mahakali in western Indian border.
(b)   To improve the Traffic conditions between Kathmandu and Indian border at
Raxaul by the selective rehabilitation of bridges and Road pavements and
(c)   To strengthen the operations and administration of the Departments of
Roads (DOR) in particular to improve their capability to implement and
monitor both Road Maintenance and the Project components by providing
them with technical assistance, equipment and training.
7.    These objectives mentioned above were achieved to a great extent. These objectives
as well as the means of achieving them under the project are described in detail below.
A.   STATEMENT AND EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
8.   In order to achieve the above mentioned objectives, the Third highway Project
comprised the following components:
(a)   Construction of 204 km of East-West Highway including a major bridge
over Kamali River at Chisapani.
(b)   Construction of about 60 km of feeder roads linking main areas of
agricultural production in the influence areas of the Karnali River
northwards to the Project Road.
(c)   The rehabilitation/maintenance of about 82 km of the Road of Naubise-
Mugling Section of Prithvi Highway between Kathmandu and Birgunj
including the selective bridges.
(d)   The procurement of equipment for Road Maintenance and materials
laboratory, office equipment and inspection vehicles.
(e)   Technical assistance and training.
Objectives
9..   East-West Highway Construction (approx. 204 km Kohalpur - Mahakali.
This last section of East-West Highway, when completed, will integrate the whole
country economically and physically. Thus early completion is considered a basic need of
the country and HMG/N has accorded it top priority. Road traverses about 16 km of the



29
Bardiya wild life National Park (Kamali Wild Life Reserve), an area of about 90,000 Ha.
Environmental action plan to conserve and protect the wild life in this area had been agreed
between DOR and National Park and Wild Life conservation office during and after
construction of the Road.
10.   The construction of this highway section had been co-financed by Government of
India with a grant assistance of IRs 500,000.000 (Indian Rupees five hundred million). The
construction of two sections was awarded to two Indian contractors viz. UPSBC & NBCC
and two packages were awarded to NCCN with KONECO as sub-contractor. The
construction supervision had been carried out by a Canadian Consulting firm, N. D. Lea &
Associates. NCCN has been provided technical assistance to reinforce their management
capability in their construction works by Crown Agent's Construction Management Group.
11.   The construction of the bridge over Karnali River was awarded to a Japanese
construction firm Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. The design and construction
supervision of the bridge was carried by an American Consulting firm named Steinman,
Boyton Gronquist & Birdsall Inc., New York.
Feeder Road Construction
12.   From the West of the Karnali River, the Road travels through the foot of Churiya
Hills North of fertile Terai of Tikapur. In order to provide road access to this fertile fan of
the Karnali Delta approx. 60 km. of feeder roads with gravel wearing course has been
envisaged to be constructed at relatively low cost.
13.   Rehabilitation/Improvement of the Kathmandu Birgunj Road and Bridges
14.   The worst part of the road between Kathmandu and Birgunj is the Naubise Mugling
Section (about 82 km of Prithvi Highway) which is only and most important link to
Kathmandu with the rest of the country.
15.   The bridge between Hetauda and Birgunj and two bridges between Thankot and
Naubise was awarded to the IRCON and the design and supervision was carried by N. D.
Lea International.
16.   The contract to Rehabilitation Naubise - Malekhu Section was awarded to CCECC
and supervised by Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick (SWK) UK.
17.   The section of the road from Malekhu to Mugling was rehabilitated with the grant
assistance of Sterling Pds. 16.00 Mil. from ODA UK and the contract was managed by
Crown Agents/Kier JV and supervised by the SWK.
18.   Procurement of Equipment, Material Laboratory, Office Equipment and Inspection
Vehicles
(a)   6 Nos. wheel dozer, 3 Nos. Motor graders & 4 No. Mobile cranes other plant
& tools had been procured to strengthen the maintenance capacity of DoR.



30
(b)   Central laboratory had been established at Lalitpur and material testing are
being conducted satisfactorily.
All section of DoR had been supplied with computers & photocopy machine
and other office equipment.
19..  Training
Training had been provided in the following various fields:
(a)   Highway Project Management
(b)   Quality Control Techniques
(c)   Bridge & foundation design
(d)   Traffic Engineering
(e)   Transport Planning
(f)    Workshop Management
(g)   Remote Sensing
Evaluation of Objectives
20.   Nepal's Seventh Plan (1985/86-1990/91) had accorded highest priority to complete
the remaining far western part of Mahendra Highway - the main trunk road running from
East to West throughout the country. Also the seventh plan envisaged that the existing
manpower would be made skillful and efficient to carry out their job and various types of
training programmes would be given to promote manpower productivity and expertise.
B.   ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
21.   The objectives of the Third Highway Project have been fulfilled to the greatest
possible extent. The Far Western and Mid Western region of the country have been brought
together into the National Economy by completing the construction of Kohalpur-Mahakali
Road and the bridge across the Karnali River. 18 Causeways have yet to be replaced by
permanent river bridges. These are promised to be constructed with the grant assistance
from GOI.
22.   Traffic conditions between Naubise & Mugling have greatly improved with the
construction of five new bridges on Hetauda - Raxaul. Also the construction of two more
double lane bridges between Thankot to Naubise at Khatri Pauwa and Naubise greatly
improved the traffic bottleneck at these locations. The previous bridges build in mid-fifties
by GOI were of one lane width. Also the procurement of the heavy machines greatly
enhanced the maintenance capability of DOR and the opening the traffic throughout year by
deploying them in regions susceptible to landslides. In-house technical enhancement has
been greatly fulfilled in Roads sector as most of the engineers and technicians had been
seconded to SWK to man various key jobs in technical field in respective project
components. Also the training and further specialized studies in Highway related
disciplines greatly improved the technical capability of the DOR and offered the knowledge



31
in emerging trend in technology in the Highway sector. As expected the completion of the
East-West Highway and the construction of about 52 km of feeder road links from the
Highway to the major agricultural production areas of the Karnali delta region has greatly
increased the agricultural productivity with the ease of providing inputs like improved
seeds, fertilizer, agricultural plants and tools and trade activities.
23.   The involvement of DOR technical staff as project managers for each project
components and the secondment to consulting Engineers for survey, design, material
testing, quality control has not only reduced the need of expatriate staff but also helped on
the job training and transfer of technology with such acquired knowledge now the DOR can
carry out the implementation of major Civil Works.
C.    MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
24.   The following are the main factors delaying the Project implementation and the
completion.
(a)   Delay in Credit effectiveness caused delays in the procurement of consulting
services.
(b)   The award of the contract to a Chinese Construction Company for the
Construction of the Kohalpur-Mahakali Highway (KMHP) had to be
withdrawn following the acceptance by HMGN of a grant assistance from
the GOI thereby necessitating an amendment to the DCA of IDA's Credit
No. 1515 -NEP to reflect the co-financing arrangement and replacing the
loan assistance from SFD.
(c)   Trade and Transit impasse between Nepal and India in March 1989.
(d)   Political changes in March 1990.
(e)   Shortage of fuel due to Gulf War in August - December 1990.
(f)   Floods in July 1993.
(g)   Delay in acquisition of land, removal of trees, delay in customs clearances
delay in procurement of explosives, occasional labor disputes, procurement
of natural construction materials such as sands, boulders and aggregates
freely.
(h)   The contractor's own inability to organize and manage the project efficiently
in Naubise - Malekhu Projects.
(i)   The contractor's inability to deploy enough plant and equipment in KMHP.
(j)   The lack of participation for DOR's seconded staff in the decision making
process in the ODA (UK) financed project of Malekhu - Mugling did not



32
materialize the much needed establishment of PHU as envisaged in the
objectives of the Malekhu - Mugling Project. Furthermore, dependence on
too many expatriate staff and lesser number of seconded staff inflated the
project costs on the ODA (UK) financed Malekhu -Mugling Road Project.
D.   PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
25.   Plan of operation is attached which gives details for maintaining the assets provided
under the Project and thereby ensuring the sustainability of the project.
E.    BANK'S PERFORMANCE
(a)   The Bank's performances in identifying the projects, studies of the projects
taking into account the economic rate of return have been excellent.
(b)   The Bank's policy in further investing in flood damaged bridges and road
repair works and the remaining works of the Mugling - Marsyangdi section
of PHW is praiseworthy and testifies to its continued effort in the
development of Nepal.
(c)   The Bank's performances in coordinating the various donor agencies have
been quite good.
(d)   The resident office based in Kathmandu through its consultants and other
officials has been providing cooperation, assistance and necessary
information from time to time for the successful completion of the projects.
(e)   The resident office based in Kathmandu is quite prompt in processing
withdrawal application for early payment.
(f)   The Bank's mission visit for monitoring the project has been quite good in
providing suggestion and advice for the successful completion of the
projects.
F.    BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
(a)   Coordination and accountability should be improved in order to avoid the
delay among the various offices of the Ministries of HMGN and in order to
avoid the delay in the submission of Audit Reports.
(b)   The IDA's guidelines on the procurement of civil works, goods and
consulting services have been fully followed by the borrower.
(c)   DOR's posting of project managers in each project component helped to
expedite the decision making process in vital matters.



33
(d)   Disparity of salary in DOR Projects office staff and seconded staff to the
consulting engineers created friction and division.
(e)   The Project managers from each of the component always provided latest
status of the project pertaining to its physical and financial progress.
G.   ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
(a)   Despite the delays and constraints as mentioned above, the Third Highway
Project was successful in achieving its goals. The objectives set by the
Project were realistic, achievable and reflected the national needs of the
country as envisaged in the development plans of the country.
(b)   The unforeseen situations evolved during project execution was handled
effectively both by IDA and Borrower and the Consultants. The IDA during
their visiting missions to Nepal with their blend of experiences displayed
enthusiasm, flexibility and sympathy towards the needs and aspirations of a
developing country.
H.   KEY LESSONS LEARNED
(a)   Coordination among different offices should be improved
(b)   Decentralized system of procurement of explosives in all regions should
start in order to minimize the delay.
(c)   Start the construction work only after the acquisition of lands
(d)   Maximize number of DOR staff's participation to man the project.
(e)   Pay difference to be narrowed between HMG/N Projects office and
seconded staff.
(f)   Labor liaison office to be established to minimize the labor disputes.
(g)   Ways and means of quick customs clearances should be explored.
(h)   Price adjustment should be submitted by the Engineer in every applicable
interim statement in order to minimize the financial burden at the end of the
project necessitating the need for decision from higher authorities.
(i)   The Engineer and the contractor are required to submit the lists of the
construction materials and equipment required for the project well before the
start of the project so that approval for the custom clearances could be
obtained in time.



34
(I)   The Engineer should submit the detail property acquisition and removal of
forest cover during and after survey and process for the acquisition should
start before the start of the project.
(k)   Specifications of the works should be suited to the local conditions.
(1)    Central Unit and existing maintenance divisions should protect the right of
way of the highways and prevent encroachments.
(in)   Measures should be taken to minimize the accidents in highways.
(n)   Community participation should be encouraged in greening the areas
adjacent the highways.
(o)   Local contractors can perform fairly good at low cost as seen in the case of
ODA financed Malekhu - Mugling Section. Therefore LCB should be
encouraged.
(p)   The duties and responsibilities of Management Contractor could be
entrusted to the consulting engineers with greater participation from DOR's
seconded staff, thereby reducing the cost of management and supervision
considerably and duplication work on supervision and control on works
could be avoided.
(q)   Capacity of HMG/N to expend the credit should be increased so that
allocated credit is fully and effectively used.

APPENDIX C
DEPARTMENT OF ROADS
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PLAN OF OPERATION
BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.    Nepal has a total road network of around 10,000 krm of roads. It comprises 2734 km
of National Highways, 1520 Km of Feeder Roads, 3941 km District Roads and 1339 km
Urban Roads. Operation and maintenance of National Highways and Feeder roads, and
some important district and urban roads is carried out by the Department of Roads under the
Ministry of Works & Transport
Organization
2..   The Department of Roads (DOR) is headed by Director General, who is assisted by
five Deputy Director Generals looking after Planning, Design, Maintenance, Mechanical
and Foreign Cooperation Branches at the Kathmandu Head Office. Besides these, there are
several other units involved in specific fields, i.e., Bridge Unit, Geo-environmental Unit,
Traffic Engineering & Safety Unit, Maintenance & Rehabilitation Coordination Unit, etc.
Regional Offices and Divisions
3..    Apart from the head office in Kathmandu, DOR has six regional offices, one each in
Eastern, Western, Mid-western and Far-Western regions and two in the central region.
Under these regional offices there are 25 Divisional Units, which are directly involved in
the operation and maintenance of roads. Each Divisional Unit is headed by a Division
Chief, who is a senior engineer. In general, the unit includes three assistant engineers and
nine technicians along with account and administrative personnel. For the operation and
maintenance of Road Maintenance equipment, six Heavy Equipment Divisions have been
established, one for each regional office.
Budgeting
4..   The works performed by DOR is financed by HMG and bilateral as well as
multilateral donor and loan agencies. The budget allocated for Fiscal Year 1995/96 is as
follows in NRs. Xl06):_
General Administration            120
Routine Maintenance                39
Periodic Maintenance              602



36
Rehabilitation & Improvement     1584
New Construction                 1556
Studies & Design                  144
Total                         4045
5.    It represents about 10% of annual national budget for 1995/96. The contribution of
HMG/N amounts to NR 1725 million or 43% of the total annual budget.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
Description of Works
6.    The following works have been completed under the Third Highway Project IDA
Credit 1515-NEP:
(a)   Construction of 204 km Kohalpur - Mahakali Highway except remaining 22
bridges and its approaches totaling approximately 8 km. in length.
(b)   Construction of 500 m long Karnali Bridge
(c)    Rehabilitation of 82 km Naubise - Mugling Highway
(d)   Reconstruction of 7 Bridges on the Tribhuvan Highway
PLAN OF OPERATION
Kohalpur - Mahakali Highway
7.    This has been divided into two sections: Kohalpur - Karnali 77 km and Karnali -
Mahakali: 127 km. The first section lies in the mid-western region and is operated and
maintained by the maintenance division in Nepalganj. One assistant Engineer and two
technicians have been assigned to this road. Two stretches with total 16 km road is located
inside the Royal Bardiya National Park, which is wild life reserve area. Maintenance on
these stretches is done with close coordination with the park authorities. The second section
is located in the far western region and is operated and maintained by the maintenance
division in Mahendranagar. On this section 22 bridges and their approaches remain to be
constructed, and at present traffic is being operated trough diversions. These are disrupted
during rainy season for hours and sometimes for days. Gabion mattresses are being laid o
these diversions to minimize the delay. An agreement between HMG and GOI has recently
been concluded for the construction of the bridges and approaches. The westerly 43 km
stretch on this section was constructed with HMG resources about 15 years before and now
is included in the road rehabilitation programme under IDA's Credit 2578-NEP. Traffic on
this road is nominal at present with ADT of 140 and it is expected to increase after the
construction of these remaining bridges.



37
Karnali Bridge
8.    At present this Karnali Bridge is being looked after by the Division in Nepalganj.
This is a 500 m long single tower cable - stayed bridge with an asymmetric span
arrangement of 325 m main span and 175 m side span. the bridge was designed and
supervised by an America Consultancy firm Steinman, New York and constructed by a
Japanese Construction Company Kawasaki Heavy Industries. This, being a very
sophisticated engineering structure, needs special consideration for its operation and
maintenance. The manual for inspection and maintenance prepared by the Consultant states
general inspection of the Bridge on annual basis and in-depth inspection every five years.
Accordingly, general inspection has been carried out in November, 1994. No defect was
observed in any part of the structure. Need for security of the Bridge has been felt and
necessary arrangement for it is being worked out in DOR. A building has been planned for
construction near the Bridge site and 24 - hour watchmen/guards will be stationed at the
Bridge. The bridge, being only recently completed, does not require any significant
maintenance except clearing of the deck surface and removing dust and stone particles from
the expansion joints. However, more rigorous inspection and maintenance will have to be
carried out in the future. For this, necessary expertise has yet to be developed in DOR and
overseas as well as in-house training programmes are being planned, and IDA's or other
international assistance will be sought for this. In spite of this, for such a technically
sophisticated Bridge, the local technical manpower alone may not be able to handle the in-
depth inspection and maintenance of vital components like cables. Truss, bearings, etc.
Hence, DOR will have to employ from time to time expatriate consultants as well as
maintenance crew. The ongoing IDA's Credit 2578-NEP includes a component for
specialist assistance in maintenance of Karnali Bridge and this is expected to be
implemented.
Naubise - Mugling Highway
9     This road lies in the central region and is operated and maintained by DOR
Maintenance Division located in Bharatpur.
Traffic
10.   AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic) survey carried out in 1983 showed 435
vehicles, 80% being heavy vehicles. After the completion of the rehabilitation of Naubise -
Mugling, the traffic has increased to 1935 in 1995, 83% being heavy vehicles, consisting of
Buses and Trucks even surpassing our traffic prediction of 1738 vehicles. Using a 1986
baseline AADT value of 1000 vehicles and average annual compound growth rates of:
6.5% p.a.          -            1986 - 1994
5.5% p.a.          -            1996 - 2010
11.   ADT forecast for 1995 was 1738 vehicles as against actual count of 1935 showing
an increase of 25%. Based on the traffic forecast the design period of 10 years and 15 years



38
have been evaluated beginning from 1990, assuming that 50% of road surfacing works
would be complete. These evaluations give growth factor of:
10 years    -      Growth Factor:-     1.648
15 years           Growth Factor:-     1.936
12.   The different loading cases have been considered assuming that these will occur on
Naubise - Mugling Section of the Prithvi Highway during alternative pavement design
period of 10 and 15 years.
13.   The first case assumed that the current prevailing traffic will continue. The second
case considered the effects that the opening of new road link between Sindhuli and
Kathmandu in mid 1995 would have effects on the traffic loading on this Naubise -
Mugling Section.
14.   The third case examined the consequential effects of containerization of goods
imported to Nepal. In each case examined the Cumulative Equivalent Standard Axle
(CESA) loading for both 10 and 15 year design period were evaluated. The CESA is the
cumulative number of 8200 kg Standard Axle Loads which it is estimated will be carried by
the pavement of the mot heavily trafficked road land during its design life. The traffic
loadings on Naubise - Mugling Section of the Prithvi Highway for the normal pattern of
traffic for the design period of 10 years and 15 years are estimated to be 9.5 million and
16.7 million respectively. As the pavement is designed for 10 million Standard Equivalent
Axle Loading, which is expected to be reached after 10 years overlaying of pavement will
be necessary after that period.
Road Safety
15.   After the completion of the Naubise - Mugling Rehabilitation Work traffic accidents
are on the increase. DOR is taking necessary safety measures to minimize traffic accidents.
A Traffic Engineering & Safety Unit (TESU) has been established in DOR with the
assistance of ODA (UK). TESU has prepared accidents documentation formats. Safety
Audit of Naubise - Mugling is being conducted by this unit and at present 20 chevron traffic
signs are planned to be installed at hazardous bends. These and other safety measures will
be continued in the future. Moreover TESU holds regular seminars with participation from
engineers from divisional offices and the traffic police.
7 Bridges on the Tribhuvan Highway
16.   The name and location of the bridges is as follows:-
(a)    Khatripauwa on Thankot - Nabise road
(b)   Naubise on Thankot - Naubise road
(c)    Karra on Hetauda - Birgunj road
(d)   Chure on Hetauda - Birgunj road



39
(e)   Amlekhganj No. 3 on Hetauda - Birgunj road
(f)   Amlekhganj No. 4 on Hetauda - Birgunj road
(g)   Jitpur on Hetauda - Birgunj road
17.   The first two bridges Khatripauwa and Naubise on Thankot - Naubise road is being
looked after by the Division in Bharatpurand the other five bridges on Hetauda - Birgunj
road by the Division in Pathlaiya.
18.   With the assistance of ODA (UK) a Bridge Unit has been established in DOR. The
unit has prepared bridge inventory for the whole road network and is conducting bridge
condition survey. All bridges are being numbered in accordance with a national system.
Maintenance of regular nature is done by the divisions and maintenance requiring special
technical skills, i.e., replacing bearings and expansion joints, repair of vital components like
truss members, cables/suspenders, etc. will be conducted with close coordination with the
bridge unit. Inspection forms have been prepared and are now in use.
Mainteanc
19.   Two types of maintenance works are carried out on a regular basis, i.e. Routine
Maintenance and Periodic Maintenance.
Routine Maintenance
20.   Routine maintenance is carried out throughout the year on a force account basis by
employing a gang of 10 - 12 labor and a supervisor for about 25 - 30 km of road. The
works under routine maintenance include clearing the road surface by hand brooms,
clearance of side drains and culvert openings of soil and debris, removal of grass
encroaching on the shoulders, repair of denuded shoulders and embankments, patch repairs
of isolated pot holes on the pavement, etc. Besides the mentioned works of regular nature,
emergency works are also carried out under routine maintenance. The type of works
depend upon the nature of emergency and hence, is difficult to specify. However, some of
them include: removal of damaged vehicles from the road and clear it for traffic especially
following an accident, clearance of slides, removal of felled trees after severe storrn,
protection of endangered embankment slopes by placing gabions and filling with boulders,
construction of temporary diversions, etc. For such emergency works necessary labor is
engaged temporarily and also available equipment like cranes, loaders, trucks, etc. are used.
Strengthened Maintenance Divisions (SMD)
21.   In order to improve Maintenance and Rehabilitation Programme of DOR and
agreement between HMG/N and SDC had been signed on 3rd December 1993. SMD
concept has been adopted first in two Division offices namely Chitwan and Lalitpur
Division. During in initial phases and later on extended to six divisions till 1995. DOR has
plan to extend to all 25 divisions. The aim of the SMD concept is to improve the



40
routine/recurrent, periodic and emergency maintenance works, its management, planning,
monitoring and budgeting. The SMD concept has the following objectives:-
(a)   Decentralize the administration of the network.
(b)   Establish a network planning capability in DOR.
(c)   Establish a self-sustaining fund for Road Maintenance covering Routine,
Periodic and Emergency activities.
(d)   Improve Routine Maintenance Operations in the Districts.
(e)   Improve Periodic Maintenance of Strategic Network.
(f)   Improve Budget Maintenance on the Strategic Network.
(g)   Improve Road side Support Maintenance.
(h)   Establish the concept of National Standards.
(i)   Improve DOR Plant Management and Utilization in the Medium Term.
Periodic Maintenance
22.   Periodic maintenance, in general is carried out on a contract basis. The contracts are
relatively small amounting from NRs. 0.2 million to NRs. 2 million with contract periods
ranging from 3 months to 6 months. The contract works are supervised by the existing
organization of the Division. Periodic maintenance include works, which are beyond the
scope of routine maintenance, such as, stretches of damaged road pavement and shoulders,
rehabilitation of culverts and construction of additional culverts, if required, construction of
additional retaining structures, river training works, etc.
Inspection
23.   Inspection of the road and ongoing maintenance works is done as follows:-
(a)   Technician is at the work site daily except during no work days.
(b)   Assistant Engineer inspects the road and the works twice a week and more,
if necessary.
(c)   Division chief inspects the road and the road works on a fortnightly basis or
more, if required.
(d)   Regional Director inspects the road and the works at least once a month.
(e)   Deputy Director General inspects the road generally every quarter and the
