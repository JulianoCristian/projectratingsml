The project met its immediate\n            objectives. It has begun to strengthen the institutional\n            capacity of the Borrower and private sector. Sustainability\n            is uncertain at this time. Both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, maintenance effectiveness needs to\n            be dramatically improved to ensure sustainability of road\n            improvements. The most critical immediate challenge is to\n            ensure that available maintenance resources are effectively\n            and systematically used for highest-priority needs. Second,\n            particular attention to drain clearing, river training\n            works, and road repairs before and during the monsoon season\n            can reduce the susceptibility to flood damage. Third, there\n            is a need to improve procurement processing, customs\n            clearance, and inter-ministerial coordination in DOR and\n            HMGN to permit timely and effective response to road\n            improvement needs and reduce the costs of works\n            implementation. Lastly, the involvement of the DOR staff in\n            project preparation should be expanded and encourage in the\n            future for effective implementation."}, "docdt": "1996-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
