The project will improve\n            traffic conditions between Kathmandu and Birganj at the\n            Indian border through selective rehabilitation of bridges\n            and road pavements, and strengthen the construction and\n            maintenance capability of the Borrower. It will construct\n            about 204 km of the East-West Highway including a bridge\n            over Karnali (Chisapani) River and feeder roads,\n            rehabilitate about 82 km of the Mugling-Naubise road,\n            provide maintenance equipment, technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1984-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
