Forestry Project will be to expand and adequately maintain\n            forest areas and thereby to increase the supply of fuelwood\n            for domestic consumption; provide protection against\n            cyclones, tidal bores, and soil erosion; and increase the\n            supply of wood products for industrial and commercial uses.\n            The project will continue the program of afforestation of\n            newly accreted land begun under the Mangrove Afforestation\n            Project (Credit 1042-BD) and will support improved\n            utilization and management of indigenous forests. Specific\n            project components will include: (a) establishment of about\n            100,000 acres of mangrove plantations, and maintenance of\n            about 200,000 acres of existing plantations; (b)\n            establishment of about 58,000 acres of industrial\n            plantations, and maintenance of about 70,000 acres of\n            existing plantations; (c) establishment of Resource\n            Management Systems for mangrove plantations and other forest\n            resources; (d) support of mangrove afforestation research;\n            and (e) training of forestry personnel and improvement and\n            expansion of forestry education and training facilities."}, "docdt": "1985-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
