OLKARIA GEOTHERMAL ENGINEERING PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:               The Kenya Power Company Limited (KPC)
Guarantor:              Republic of Kenya
Amount:                 US$9.0 million equivalent
Terms:                  Repayable in 10 years, including 3 years of grace,
with interest at 7.35% per annum. The loan would
be refinanced under any later loan the Bank might
make to implement the proposed geothermal power
project at Olkaria - the Power III Project.
Project Description:    The engineering loan would finance:
(i)   drilling equipment and supplies to drill
production wells for the recovery of steam at
Olkaria sufficient to power an electric generator
with the capacity of 15 MW, to be followed by
further drilling for a second unit of 15 MW;
(ii) the cost of consultants for the preparation of
specifications for the drilling equipment and for
the supervision of the drilling program;
(iii) the cost of expatriate drill operators; and
(iv) the training of local personnel.
The purpose of the drilling would be to provide adequate quantities of steam
at appropriate temperatures and pressures for the Power III Project. The
training element would help KPC develop indigenous geothermal drilling
experience so that they may be capable of executing a continuous drilling
program. The risks appear to be normal for such underground work, since five
of the seven wells already drilled have been producing steam.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KENYA POWER COMPANY LIMITED WITH THE GUARANTEE
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA FOR THE OLKARIA GEOTHERMAL
ENGINEERING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to The Kenya Power Company Limited (KPC) with the guarantee of the
Republic of Kenya for the equivalent of US$9.0 million to help finance
geothermal drilling at Olkaria. The loan would have a term of 10 years,
including three years of grace, with interest at 7.35 % per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Memorandum on Kenya" (Report No.
1783a-KE, dated December 28, 1977) has been distributed to the Executive
Directors. A summary of social and economic data is in Annex I. The prepa-
rations for a Basic Economic Report on Kenya are now well advanced--the
mission to complete the report is expected to arrive in Kenya in late October.
Economic Structure and Trends
3.        During the first fifteen years of independence Kenya has had conti-
nuity in leadership and development strategy. That strategy has been to
promote rapid economic growth by means of public investment, encouragement of
both smallholder and large-scale farming, and the promotion of accelerated
industrialization through incentives for private (including foreign) invest-
ment in modern industry. More recently, policy statements have suggested an
increasing emphasis on poverty alleviation measures even at the cost of a
slight reduction in the rate of economic growth. With the death of President
Kenyatta there is inevitably some uncertainty about the future but present
indications are that the main outline of Kenyan development strategy will
remain the same.
4.        Kenya is a poor country with an economy still largely dependent
on agriculture. Average per capita income in 1977 was US$270 and agriculture
accounted for 34% of GDP on average during the period 1975-77. Agriculture
also normally provides about 70% of export earnings and remains the major
source of livelihood for the 90% of the population which lives in rural
areas.
5.        Growth of the economy since independence has been impressive.   From
1964-73 total GDP grew at an annual average rate of 6.6%. Manufacturing was
the most rapidly growing of the major sectors during the period; value added
in manufacturing increased by 8.4% per annum and the share of the manufactur-
ing sector rose from 10.4% of GDP in 1964 to 13.6% in 1973. Agricultural



-2-
growth contributed to the strong overall performance as well. Agricultural
output increased by over 50% from 1964-73, or at an average annual rate of
4.7%. Marketed production in agriculture grew especially fast (6.0% per
annum) but subsistence production also grew faster than population during the
period.
6.        Growth was temporarily stalled in 1974 and 1975 due to the com-
bined effect of drought and a sharp worsening of the international terms
of trade; real GDP grew at an annual rate of only 1.6% during these two years.
However, favorable weather and a temporary reversal of the terms of trade
stimulated another period of rapid growth in 1976 and 1977. Total GDP grew by
6.1% in 1976 and by 7.3% in 1977.
7.        Despite Kenya's impressive post-independence growth record, a
number of problems have emerged which will make it difficult to sustain
growth and to reduce poverty.
8.        The most fundamental problem is the rapid growth of population in
the face of limited arable land. Although Kenya has some excellent agricul-
tural land with reliable rainfall, good soil and favorable slopes, this
comprises only about 7% of the total land area. The soils of a further 4 1/2%
are suited for crop production but unreliable rainfall causes occasional crop
failures. Some 60% of the total land area is classified as semi-desert. Most
of the high-potential land is densely settled. Pressure on the land was
alleviated during the years following independence by the opening up of a
large part of the land previously owned by Europeans to settlement by Kenyan
smallholders. However, with population growing at 3.5% per annum pressure is
mounting. This has resulted in increasing subdivision and landlessness in
high-potential areas and in settlement in semi-arid areas ill-suited to
farming. These problems help to account for the slackening in recent years of
the previously high agricultural growth rate, which fell from 4.7% per annum
from 1964-73 to 2.3% per annum from 1973-77.
9.        Rapid population growth is felt most seriously through the increas-
ing pressure on available agricultural land, but it creates other problems as
well. The non-agricultural formal wage sector (which employs less than 15% of
the total labor force) is unable to absorb all the new labor force entrants
because of its small base. Considerable budgetary pressure has also been
created because of the growing demand for social services. Finally, efforts
to improve the distribution of income are impeded because of the relative lack
of access to land and education for the children of the poorest sections of
the population.
10.       The manufacturing sector has reached a critical juncture.    The rapid
growth of industry in the past has been largely based upon investments in
simple import-substitution industries by multinational companies. To a lesser
extent manufacturing production has also catered to the export market in neigh-
boring countries, particularly in the protected East African Community (EAC)
market. The scope for further industrialization along these lines is limited.
Most of the easy import-substitution possibilities have been exhausted and in



many industries there is excess capacity. The EAC preference for Kenyan goods
has been abolished and access to both the Zambian and Tanzanian markets is
presently restricted by the closure of the Tanzanian border. The past pattern
of industrialization has left the industrial sector increasingly dependent on
imported raw materials, components and spare parts and therefore vulnerable
in case of a shortage of foreign exchange. To maintain growth it will be
necessary to reorient industry toward increased use of domestic inputs and
increased production for export. This will be difficult, however, because
existing industry has grown up under high protection and is relatively uncom-
petitive in world markets.
11.       An additional problem is the stagnation of export volume in-recent
years. From 1964-72 the volume of exports expanded at an average annual rate
of 4.6%. Between 1972 and 1974 export volume increased by an additional 11%
but has not risen above the 1974 level. To some extent this is a reflection
of production problems in agriculture and industry, but it is also an indica-
tor of the need to direct more resources into foreign exchange earning activi-
ties. A combination of slow export growth and continued high import dependence
would leave the Kenyan economy very vulnerable to fluctuations in the terms of
trade.
Developments since the 1974-75 Crisis
12.       The Kenyan economy was disrupted by import price increases and by
drought in 1974-75. Marketed agricultural production did not grow at all in
1974 and 1975 while total GDP grew at only 1.6% per annum. The value of
imports increased by more than 50% over the 1973 level and the balance of
payments position deteriorated. The crisis highlighted the extent to which
Kenya, with its import-intensive manufacturing and limited domestic energy
resources, had become dependent on imports.
13.       The Government made several policy changes to deal with the
crisis. First, it introduced measures to minimize the loss of foreign ex-
change reserves and control domestic demand. These included an increase in
sales taxes, credit restrictions, passing on the increases in oil prices to
users, and a freeze on Government recruitment. Second, since its Development
Plan had been overtaken by events, it formulated a medium-term Restructuring
Program with more modest growth and equity targets. Achieving those targets
required restraining consumption in favor of investment, lowering Kenya's high
import dependence and making the economy more export-oriented.
14.       There was a marked improvement in the economy in 1976 and 1977,
though this was largely due to external circumstances rather than to the
effects of the Restructuring Program, most of whose effects are longer-range.
Favorable weather conditions helped agricultural output to grow by nearly 8%
during the two years and high coffee and tea prices transformed the balance of
payments position. The volume of coffee exports increased by nearly 40%
between 1975 and 1977 while the average price received more than quadrupled.
The balance of payments moved into surplus in 1976 and in 1977 there was a
surplus on current account, the first in thirteen years.



- 4 -
15.       The coffee boom also had numerous secondary repercussions.   High
coffee incomes stimulated activity in manufacturing and other sectors, and
also helped directly and indirectly to finance an investment boom; gross fixed
capital formation rose by 22,6% in real terms between 1975 and 1977. The
effect on domestic savings was even more dramatic; the ratio of domestic
savings to GNP rose from 12.5% in 1975 to 18.7% in 1976 to 22.7% in 1977.
Finally, current revenue of the Government increased by about 50% during the
budget year 1977/78. This was matched, however, by an increase in recurrent
expenditure, while development expenditure increased by at least 40% according
to preliminary estimates. In real terms total Government expenditure increased
by more than 20%. This increase was greater than anticipated because of
unexpected large increases in defense expenditure and because of heavy invest-
ment in transportation equipment occasioned by the break-up of the East
African Community.
16.       As a result of these generally expansionary conditions a short-term
macro-management problem has emerged. The total supply of money and quasi-
money expanded by 46.8% during 1977. Consumer price increases accelerated,
with price increases in 1977 ranging from 13.5% for the Nairobi Middle Income
Index to 21.0% for the Nairobi Lower Income Index. Imports also grew rapidly
during the first few months of 1978 at the same time as coffee prices declined
well below the level of early 1977.   The full effect of past monetary expan-
sion has probably not yet been realized and continued pressure on domestic
prices and import demand can be expected. In order to restore domestic and
external stability, it may be necessary to pursue more restrictive monetary
and budgetary policies during the next several months.
17.       Of more long-term significance is implementation of the Restructur-
ing Program. The Government has made good progress but there are some areas
in which further action is needed. In the fiscal field, it has introduced
procedures to ensure better control of expenditure and increased expenditure
in directly productive activities. However, as noted above, unanticipated
expenditures have temporarily put renewed pressure on the budget. The Govern-
ment has also emphasized agricultural sector development and taken a variety
of measures to improve performance in this sector. Periodic producer price
increases and a strong wages policy have helped to shift the terms of trade
between agriculture and manufacturing in favor of agriculture by over 100%
during the past three years after a long period during which they had moved in
favor of manufacturing; even if coffee is excluded the improvement was close
to 50%. However, the Government has been slow to formulate and implement
badly needed new policies in the industrial field. While it introduced duties
on hitherto duty-free imports of intermediate and capital goods as steps
towards a more rational protection system, increased the sales tax on luxury
goods, introduced an export subsidy of 10% to stimulate the export of manufac-
tured goods and certain commodities, and devalued the shilling in October 1975
to make manufactured exports more competitive, a comprehensive policy package
to eliminate the disadvantages under which export-oriented industries operate
remains to be formulated.



-5-
Development Plan FY79-83
18.       Background studies are now under way to analyze major economic and
social issues in preparation for the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan. The
major objective for the next Plan period will be alleviation of poverty
through the creation of income earning possibilities and by providing for
basic needs in nutrition, health, education, housing and other social services.
Thus, while the Plan would provide for a large degree of continuity in Kenya's
development strategy, there would be greater attention paid to social
objectives as compared with the ongoing Restructuring Program and the Third
Plan. At the Government's request, the Bank is providing assistance in
developing strategies in urban development and resource mobilization.
External Debt
19.       The current low overall debt service ratio of about 5% (including a
notional 50% share of the debt of the East African Community Corporations) is
expected to rise to about 11.5% by 1985. Including this share of EAC debt,
the IBRD is presently holding 29% of Kenya's outstanding external debt and IDA
11%; the IBRD share is expected to rise to 33% and the IDA share to 12% by
1985. Debt service payments to the Bank are about 30% of total debt service
payments; IDA share is about 1%. These two figures are projected to be about
the same by 1985. Kenya has seen a gradual switch by other donors from loans
to straight grants or to loans on very concessional terms and the Government
has pursued a rather conservative commercial borrowing policy in recent years.
Despite the recovery of Kenya's overall savings performance to a notable 18%
of Gross Domestic Income, Kenya's sound development program will require sub-
stantial finance in excess of public savings and available external capital.
We therefore expect to continue our practice of financing a substantial
proportion of total project costs, including some local costs when necessary.
Impact of the De Facto Dissolution of the East African Community (EAC)
20.       Recent developments of the East African Community were outlined in
a report to the Executive Directors dated December 29, 1977 (R 77-312). The
de facto breakup of the EAC is expected to have some impact on Kenya's budget
initially. The establishment of national corporations to replace the former
East African Community Corporations will require investment outlays as well as
operating subsidies from the Government, but the burden on the Government
budget will hopefully be temporary, as the Corporations are expected to become
self-financing. The closure of the border with Tanzania will have some effect
on trade -- Tanzania was a large customer for Kenyan manufactured goods and
new markets will have to be developed. As Tanzanian exports to Kenya were
small replacing these should not be a major issue except in specific commodi-
ties (i.e. tobacco and cotton). The border closure has also a slightly
negative impact on tourism, although Kenya is expected to overcome this by
developing beach resorts and game parks within Kenya.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN KENYA
21.       Hitherto, Kenya has received 28 Bank loans, including three on
Third Window terms, and 25 IDA credits amounting to US$746.6 million, support-
ing 45 operations. In addition, Kenya has been one of the beneficiaries of
10 loans totalling US$244.8 million which have been extended for the develop-
ment of common services (railways, ports, telecommunications and finance for
industry), operated regionally for the three Partner States of the East
African Community. Annex II contains summary statements of Bank loans and
IDA credits to Kenya and to the East African Community Corporations, and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects as of August 31, 1978.
22.       The Bank has assisted the Government in its efforts to restructure
the economy. In addition to increasing lending in directly productive sectors
(particularly agriculture), a US$30 million program loan was approved in 1975 to
provide direct assistance to the Government for implementing its Restructuring
Program (para. 13 and 17). While recent sector and economic work has also
focused on the adjustments which Kenya must make to deal with the changed
international economy, the upcoming Basic Economic Report is expected to
comprehensively address the issues of income distribution, population growth,
and long-term agricultural and industrial policy.
23.       Significant progress has been made in giving the Bank's lending
program a rural focus, and in concentrating on employment and income distri-
bution objectives. Projects approved since July 1977 include the first
Integrated Agricultural Development Project aimed directly at small subsistence
farmers; the Rural Access Roads Project supporting labor-intensive infrastruc-
tural developments; and an Irrigation Project which will open up significant
new areas for settlement. The Bank also supported the tourism sector in Kenya
for the first time -- an effort intended to help Kenya conserve its wildlife
and exploit its foreign exchange earning potential. The industrial lending
program included a third loan to the Industrial Development Bank and a Small
Scale Industry Project. Recently a Fourth Education Project, a Water Supply
Project for Nairobi and a Second Urban Project have been approved. An agri-
cultural development project for Narok district, a rural water supply project
and a sugar rehabilitation project have been appraised and are expected to be
presented to the Executive Directors before the end of 1978. In the near
future, further support to the agriculture sector is expected to include a
coffee rehabilitation project, a second integrated agricultural development
project and a pilot scheme for development of arid and semi-arid areas. In
addition, a telecommunications project and further assistance to the transport
and power sectors are contemplated.
24.       Overall, project implementation performance is satisfactory.
One major exception was the Second Livestock Development Project which was
suffering from inadequate beef prices as well as organizational difficulties
reflecting in part the complexity of the project. The Government has recently
increased beef prices substantially and prospects for utilizing the credit
have now improved. Progress on the Group Farm Rehabilitation Project has also
been slow due to administrative difficulties and reluctance of group owners to



-7-
participate. Finally, Kenya has experienced serious cost overruns, most
notably on the Nairobi Airport Project and road construction projects. The
Government of Kenya has made funds available to complete these projects.
International Finance Corporation (IFC)
25.       IFC has committed a total of US$36.8 million for four companies in
Kenya: Pan African Paper Mills, Ltd.; Kenya Hotel Properties, Ltd.; Tourism
Promotion Services (Kenya) Ltd.; and Rift Valley Textiles (Ltd.). A credit
line for medium- and small-scale enterprises was extended to the Commercial
Bank of Kenya. As of August 31, 1978, IFC held for its own accotnt US$28.4
million comprising US$20.4 million of loans and US$8.0 million of equity. A
summary of IFC investments in Kenya as of August 31, 1978 is included in
Annex II.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources and Future Development
26.       The major known indigenous energy resource is hydroelectric power.
Most of the hydro sites are in the Tana River Basin with a realizable energy
potential of about 4,000 to 5,000 GWh/year and power capacity estimated
at 800 MW. Other locations for future hydroelectric generation are located
on the Turkwell and Athi Rivers but these require higher development expendi-
tures. The Government's strategy in the past has been to harness the hydro-
electric resources of the Tana River, as far as it was economically comparable
to imported fuel-based thermal plants. As a result of this policy, developed
hydroelectric capacity in the Tana River Basin amounts to about 300 MW in-
cluding the installations at Kindaruma (44 MW), Kamburu (90 MW), Gitaru (134
MW), Tana (15.2 MW ), Wainjii (7.4 MW) and several other small hydroelectric
plants.
27.       Kenya has also taken advantage of phased power developments in
the neighboring countries by the use of high voltage interconnecting lines
for exchanges of power. Thus, Kenya imports 262 GWh/year of electric energy
(30 MW at 100% load factor) from the Uganda Electricity Board, obtained
under a long-term agreement extending to year 2005. Kenya also depends
heavily on oil for its energy supply. Most oil requirements are imported
as crude and processed in a refinery in Mombasa. During the period 1974-76,
the value of net imports of crude oil and petroleum products averaged about
11% of the value of Kenya's total imports.
28.       Kenya's economically exploitable hydroelectric potential however
is limited and investigations have been mounted to locate viable alternatives
for power generation. Surveys have shown no significant coal deposits in Kenya
and the geological structure of most of Kenya seems to preclude finding oil
except, perhaps, in a strip bordering Somalia in the northeast. Further, the
present political climate in East Africa inhibits full utilization of possi-
bilities offered by the interconnection of the national electric grids of
Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya.



-8-
29.       The most attractive alternative at the moment appears to be geo-
thermal potential at Olkaria, in the Rift Valley near Lake Naivasha. The site
has been systematically investigated and explored and, according to estimates,
should be capable of supporting power generation of 100 MW and possibly as
much as 200 MW. Two other potential sites, at Lake Hannington and Eburu, have
not been explored but it is expected that, with further drilling, geothermal
power could make a significant contribution to meeting Kenya's power needs.
In the long-term, improved relations with neighboring countries may lead to the
development of power resources on a regional basis, whereby the abundant
low-cost hydroelectric resources of Tanzania and Uganda would be connected
with the Kenya transmission system.
Organization and Management of the Power Industry
30.       The power industry in Kenya consists of three companies:    the
East African Power and Lighting Company, Ltd. (EAP&L), the Kenyan Power Com-
pany Ltd. (KPC) and the Tana River Development Company, Ltd. (TRDC). EAP&L
was founded in 1922 by the amalgamation of two private companies then in
existence. It is responsible for planning and coordinating all power devel-
opment and is the sole distributor of electricity in Kenya. The Government
owns 60% of the equity of EAP&L, while the balance is privately owned. KPC
and TRDC were established to allow full government ownership of particular
power investments; but their staffing and management is fully integrated
into EAP&L. KPC was set up in 1955, primarily to finance the interconnection
with Uganda and to sell the imported power to EAP&L. It has now been selected
to implement the proposed geothermal power project (see para. 41). TRDC was
instituted in 1964 to develop the potential of the Upper Tana River.
31.       EAP&L is well-managed on sound commercial principles.    The company
employs 65 expatriates in technical and middle management positions although
department heads are now virtually all Kenyan nationals. EAP&L has a policy
to progressively replace all expatriate staff with qualified Kenyans. The
number of expatriate professional staff has fallen from 189 in 1970 and
120 in 1974 to 65 in 1977 in compliance with the Government's Kenyanization
policy.
32.       The power industry in Kenya has generally demonstrated a sound
technical and managerial approach to project preparation and implementa-
tion. The record of EAP&L and its associated companies, for timely and
effective action in meeting the requirements of legal covenants and obliga-
tions under previous Bank loans (see para. 34) is excellent.
Electricity Consumption
33.       Energy requirements in Kenya are expected to increase from 1,188
GWh in 1977 to 1,559 GWh in 1980 and 2,219 GWh in 1985, which is an increase
of 8.5% per annum. Power demand is expected to increase from 223 MW in 1977
to 296 MW in 1980 and 424 MW in 1985. Although detailed sectoral projections
are not available, the consumption of electricity by the industrial and com-
mercial sectors grew from 534 GWh in 1972 to 772 GWh in 1976 or about 9.6% per



annum. Since these two sectors are the largest consumers of electricity in
Kenya, it is their accelerated future demand that would contribute most to the
overall expansion of demand. The Government's policy is to supply, as far as
possible, all increasing needs through the development of domestic generating
capacity. Hence the priority accorded to projects such as the proposed geo-
thermal development. The Government has also maintained a policy of extending
the supply of electricity to rural areas, through a number of rural electrifi-
cation projects.
Previous Bank Lending in the Sector
34.       The proposed loan would be the third Bank lending operation for power
in Kenya. Both previous loans - US$23 million for the Kamburu Hydroelectric
Project (Loan 745-KE of 1971) and US$63 million for the Gitaru Hydroelectric
Project (Loan 1147-KE of 1975), were made to the Tana River Development
Company (TRDC).
35.       The Kamburu Project was the second phase of the Seven Forks hydro-
electric development on the Tana River (the first was a hydroelectric power
station at Kindaruma). The project was designed to meet the demand for power
in Nairobi and the coastal areas round Mombasa, where most of the industrial
and commercial activities of Kenya are concentrated. The project consisted
of a rock fill dam on the Tana river, an underground power station containing
three 30 MW units, and the associated transmission line facilities connecting
the power station with Nairobi and the Kindaruma hydroelectric power station
further downstream. The project was completed in 1974 about five months
behind schedule with a cost overrun of about 7%. The delays were those
normally experienced in a construction program of this nature, and the cost
overrun was unavoidable as it was largely due to currency fluctuations.
36.       The Gitaru Project is the last phase of the Seven Forks Scheme
completing the development of the hydro potential of the Upper Tana River.
It is situated between the existing Kamburu and Kindaruma power stations,
and the three stations operate in cascade. The project was completed on
schedule in June 1978, with cost savings o1f about US$5.0 million under the
Bank loan. The cost savings are almost entirely attributable to unutilized
physical contingencies, a reflection of the good preparation and implementa-
tion that went into this project.
Bank Strategy in the Power Sector
37.       The Bank's continued lending in this sector would assist in meet-
ing Kenya's needs for technical assistance, institutional development and
the development of competent Kenyan personnel t'o fill middle and senior
management positions and other skilled and technical jobs now held by ex-
patriate staff; it would also permit continuing dialogue on tariff policies.
38.       EAP&L had proposed to implement in late 1977 a new tariff struc-
ture to meet its revenue requirements and to provide adequate finance for its



- 10 -
development needs. The proposal would have resulted in a 17% increase in
the average tariff level. But the rapid increase in the demand for power
consequent to accelerated economic growth in Kenya in 1976 and 1977, together
with the savings obtained through the reduction in the use of fuel oil because
of the abundance of hydro-generated power, enabled EAP&L to build up its cash
reserves to such an extent that a tariff increase of 6% would have been
adequate to meet its needs. However, in order to make allowance for years
with low rainfalls, the EAP&L management, in agreement with the Bank, proposes
increasing tariffs by an average of 7.5% and is now proceeding to implement
the new tariff structure.
39.       Loan 1147-KE included financing for foreign currency costs of pre-
paring a National Power Development Plan for Kenya. The plan has been re-
ceived by the Bank and is currently under review.
PART IV - THE ENGINEERING PROJECT
Introduction
40.       The development of the geothermal potential at Olkaria appears to
be the most economically attractive investment for the next stage of power
development. Studies (see para. 41), have shown that it is cheaper than con-
ventional oil-fired steam power generation and, unlike hydro facilities,
it is independent of seasonal variations in river flow. The development of
Kenya's geothermal potential would thus complement the existing hydro facil-
ities in providing a firm power supply base. Furthermore, the relatively
small incremental size of geothermal investments will enable Kenya to tailor
increases in power supply more effectively to growth in demand, thus avoiding
the diseconomies typically associated with the lumpiness of hydro projects.
Given the overall resource constraint facing Kenya, the latter advantage is
particularly attractive.
Description
41.       In 1970 extensive surface investigations and geological, chemical
and geophysical surveys were initiated with UNDP assistance, and a deep well
drilling program at Olkaria, again assisted by UNDP, was initiated in 1973
until UNDP funds were exhausted in 1976. In addition, using part of the
proceeds from Loan No. 1147-KE, the Bank financed feasibility studies for a
proposed geothermal power project, including the installation of two 15 MW
generating units and related facilities at Olkaria. The studies have now
been completed and indicate that the proposed geothermal project is feasible.
As a result of the studies KPC, utilizing its own funds, reactivated the
drilling operations in March 1978 and has sought Bank assistance for the
power project.
42.       The Bank is considering providing funds for the proposed project
in two phases. Initially, the Bank would provide an engineering loan for the



- 11 -
drilling of steam production wells. Depending on the results of this drilling
program, the Bank would then consider financing other components, including
generators and transmission facilities, of the proposed geothermal development
(hereafter referred to as Power III).   The Bank engineering loan would be re-
financed under any later loan that the Bank might make to implement Power III.
43.       The need for the engineering loan arises because of the element
of unpredictability associated with the development of geothermal resources.
These include the risks relating to volume of steam output, temperature
and pressure variations and the success rate in the drilling of production
wells. Thus, before the Bank can proceed with Power III, wells capable of
producing the steam required for the proposed generating capacity should be
drilled; the engineering loan would be utilized for this purpose and is
a preliminary though essential phase of Power III.
Components and Implementation
44.       The engineering loan would be used to finance the purchase of an
additional drill rig and related accessories, and ancillary equipment and
supplies necessary to drill production wells for the recovery of steam at
Olkaria. Initial drilling will aim at providing steam capable of generating
15 MW of electric power and will be followed by further drilling for the
steam supply for a second unit of 15 MW. Drilling is already in progress and
although the results of the drilling program cannot be predicted with any
certainty due to the nature of geothermal drilling, it is expected that
sufficient steam for the first 15 MW will be available by early 1979 and for
the second 15 MW by late 1980. An appraisal mission for Power III would be
sent to the field when sufficient steam for the first unit is available.
45.       The foreign exchange costs of the drill operators and the con-
sultants (about 200 man-months), would also be met out of the proceeds of the
loan. KPC plans to develop indigenous geothermal drilling experience so as to
be capable of executing a continuous drilling program designed to increase its
geothermal resources. Thus, the present drilling program is being done by
KPC's own staff with the supervisory assistance of experienced drilling
consultants from Geothermal Energy of New Zealand (GENZL). The consultants
are satisfactory to the Bank. GENZL provides specialized technical assistance
for the present drilling and trains KPC staff for future drilling. KPC will
retain a qualified consultant acceptable to the Bank, to prepare the specifi-
cations for the second drilling rig, its accessories and other equipment and
supplies necessary to continue the drilling program (Section 3.02 of the draft
Loan Agreement).
46.       KPC will present to the Bank a detailed drilling program and pro-
posed method of operation for the work. The drilling program will be re-
viewed periodically by the Bank's staff. To facilitate this procedure, KPC
will submit monthly reports indicating detailed technical progress and
expenditures incurred during the period covered, and explain any deviation
from estimates.



- 12 -
47.       Since the viability of Power III is dependent on the production
capability of the field, KPC will produce, on the completion of each well,
a complete test report indicating volume, temperature, pressure and chemical
characteristics of steam during flow and recovery test periods (Section
3.04(a) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Cost and Financing
48.       The total cost of the drilling program until December 31, 1980, is
estimated at US$15.5 million; net costs excluding taxes and duties are
approximately US$14.2 million. The foreign exchange costs to be financed by
the proposed loan, amount to US$9.0 million; 63% of the estimated net costs.
49.        The local costs of US$6.5 million will be financed by KPC.    It will
utilize funds made available to it by EAP&L through the development surcharge
included in the price of electricity purchased by EAP&L from the bulk supply
companies. EAP&L has been paying the surcharge to TRDC, but since the Gitaru
Hydroelectric Project is now complete, TRDC no longer needs the funds for that
project. Thus, EAP&L will amend the present arrangement so that the develop-
ment surcharge will in future be payable to KPC. Additionally, the Government
has subscribed Kh 3.0 million towards the equity capital of KPC and, if
required, a part of these funds will also be utilized to help finance the
local costs of the engineering project.
50.        US$2.0 million of retroactive financing is recommended to cover the
estimated foreign exchange expended by KPC after March 1, 1978, when KPC
reactivated its drilling program.
Procurement and Disbursements
51.       All contracts for the supply of equipment and materials estimated
to cost US$100,000 or more would be awarded on the basis of international cor-
petitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts of less than
US$100,000 (expected to total about US$1.0 million) would be let on the basis
of international shopping (Schedule 4, Part B of the draft Loan Agreement).
In bid comparison of equipment procured through international competitive
bidding, domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15%
or the existing customs duty, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of
competing imports.
52.       The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period of two years
against the following costs: (1) 100% of the foreign expenditures for the
drilling rig, well casings and other drilling equipment and materials; 100% of
ex-factory cost of items when procured from local manufacturers or 65% of the
local cost when purchased locally and (ii) 100% of the foreign expenditures
for the drilling experts, other technical assistance and training.

Justification and Risks
53.       As a result of the recent acceleration in economic growth in Kenya,
the demand for power has increased so rapidly that the need for the construc-
tion of additional generating capacity has become very urgent. It is thus
necessary to implement Power III as soon as possible. At the same time, it
is important,to be certain that adequate quantities of steam at appropriate
temperatures'and pressures will be available for the project; this can only
be ascertained through the drilling of additional production wells. UNDP
financed the/earlier investigations but additional UNDP funds are no longer
available. KPC has reactivated the drilling program with its own funds but
these are limited and the existing drilling facilities are old. The engi-
neering loan will ensure the continuity of the drilling operations and in-
crease the speed of development. The training component financed by the loan
will also help KPC establish a drilling capability sufficient to satisfy its
future incremental power demands.
54.       Measures taken to minimize the risks in this project include the
preparation of feasibility studies and the employment of consultants with
extensive experience in geothermal work. However, the risks appear to be
normal for such underground work since the wells already drilled have been
producing steam over extended periods of time. Out of the seven wells that
have been bored, only two were abandoned, and currently the remaining five are
estimated to be producing about 70% of the steam required for the first 15 MW
unit. It is anticipated that with another two wells the steam necessary to
commission the first generating plant will be proven. In addition, as each
well is drilled, the experience gained increases and the potential for failure
in the boring of the next production well decreases.
Power III
55.       KPC intends to request Bank approval of advance contracting for the
first contracts for Power III, which are estimated to total US$13.5 million
out of the total estimated project cost of US$55 million. During negotiations
for the engineering loan, assurances were obtained from KPC that, prior to the
awarding of these contracts, it will provide the Bank with sufficient evidence
to establish that the design specifications in the tender documents are
reasonable in so far as the pressure and characteristics of geothermal steam
are concerned and, that KPC would adhere to the Bank's procurement guidelines
for all project items that may be financed by the Bank.
56.        KPC considers advance contracting justified in view of the pos-
sibility of costly power supply shortfalls in 1981 and the risk that the momen-
tum of the geothermal development program could be lost. During appraisal of
the proposed geothermal project, the Bank will review the justification of
this request. If it is found to be justified and the proposed geothermal
project is found to merit Bank support, the next power project proposal may
include retroactive financing of the initial costs of these contracts.
However, KPC has been informed that any commitments entered into in advance
of approval by the Executive Directors are entirely at their own risk.

ANNEX II
C. Projects in Execution 1/
(As of August 31, 1978)
There are currently 26 projects under execution in Kenya.
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Loan No. 993-KE - Tea Factories: $10.4 million Loan of June 5, 1974;
Effective Date: September 23, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
A combined Bank/CDC (the cofinancing partner) mission carried out an
in-depth supervision in October 1977 and a combined report was issued in April
1978. Due to better international tea prices resulting in high payments
the growers have shown increased interest in tea as a cash crop which, coupled
with the fertilizer credit scheme, financed by CDC, will result in improved
yields. The project factory building program is behind schedule and due to
cost escalations funds will only enable 12 factories to be built instead of
17 if the originally agreed disbursement percentages are adhered to. A
revised financing plan for the balance of five factories included under the
project is being determined, and other external sources of funds to finance
construction of these factories are being explored. The standard of KTDA's
management and organization is high although certain departments work under
strain due to the recent rapid development. The Marketing Department problems
are now being resolved. Disbursements are behind schedule.
Credit No. 477-KE - Livestock: $21.5 million Credit of June 5, 1974;
Effective Date: December 2, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Project implementation has been slow and there have been substantive
problems in organization, cost overruns and pricing. An in-depth review
of the project was undertaken in March 1976; the mission's report was presented
to the Government in September 1976 and a series of discussions have been
held since that date. The project was adversely affected by the Government's
failure to raise certain cattle and beef prices to adequate incentive levels,
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress on projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

but a new and satisfactory livestock price structure was adopted in early
1978, removing the most serious constraint to ranch development and viability.
Some progress has been made in organization of the pastoralists in the range
development components, and Government services in ranch water development
planning and in the company ranch sector have been improved. However, problems
continue in that (a) the poor financial situation of many Phase I and Phase II
company ranches continues (although currently under review and replanning);
(b) an effective extension service in the Masai group ranch areas, which is
essential if the project's objectives are to be achieved, is still not adequ-
ate; (c) currently high prices have to be paid for immature steers (which are
necessary to enable generation of cash flow) due to a temporary situation of
high demand coupled with an unwillingness by pastoralists to sell due to good
pasture conditions. The project will continue to be kept under close review.
Credit No. 537-KE/Loan No. 1093-KE - Group Farm Rehabilitation Project:
$7.5 million Credit and $7.5 million Loan of March 26, 1975;
Effective Date: September 30, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Cooperation between the various Government ministries and agencies
concerned with the project has improved. However, farm recruitment overall
continues to lag because of legal and social problems; only 16 mixed farms
and 9 coffee farms have been recruited so far compared with appraisal targets
for the third year of implementation of 65 mixed farms and 18 coffee farms.
Costs of rehabilitating coffee farms have increased substantially. A study
prepared by consultants on the large farm sector is presently being reviewed
by the Government and may lead to policy changes which would necessitate a
complete review of the objectives of the project.
Loan No. 1132-KE/Credit No. 565-KE - Second Forestry Plantation
Project: $10.0 million Credit and $10.0 million Loan of June 27,
1975; Effective Date: September 25, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The planting program is progressing fairly satisfactorily, but
the cumulative total to date is 18 percent below target, due to unfavorable
weather conditions in 1975 and 1976, shortage of equipment and, in some cases,
of labor (both now remedied). The building and road construction programs
are both considerably behind schedule. However, all the backlogs should be
made good during the last 3 years of the project. Progress has been slow
in implementing most of the covenants of the Credit Agreement, particularly
regarding the sawmilling sector, the national land use study, the gazetting
of nature reserves and new forest reserves, and the study of stumpage rates
for sawlogs. Government is now providing very substantial budgetary alloca-
tions to make up for past cuts. Procurement is, proceeding normally. Dis-
bursements and total project expenditure are both slightly behind schedule,
but they should soon catch up with estimates. The general situation of
this project is improving, slowly but steadily.

ANNEX II
Loan No. 1303T-KE/Credit No. 650-KE - Integrated Agricultural
Development Project: $10.0 million Loan and $10.0 million
Credit of July 9, 1976; Effective Date: March 15, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
During the first year of implementation, the focus of the project
changed towards assisting large numbers of subsistence farmers rather than
progressive smallholder farmers. This change has led to a number of diffi-
culties, but the project objective of improving the productivity and incomes
of smallholder farmers continues to be met. The rates of credit recovery and
loanee reparticipation thus far have been disappointing. Active efforts are
now being made to expand and implement the infrastructure components, in-
cluding improvement of input supplies and marketing systems. Some adjustment
to the administrative framework is required, and discussions on this subject
are ongoing. The Annual Work Plan for FY79 is now under review.
Loan No. 1389-KE - South Nyanza Sugar Project: $25.0 million
Loan of April 15, 1977; Effective Date: November 3, 1977;
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
Agricultural implementation proceeds satisfactorily with only minor
problems. Cane yields are higher than anticipated, probably because of excel-
lent and well-distributed rainfall during 1977 and the first half of 1978.
Building works were delayed due to shortage of cement, but the position
has improved and the factory should be completed on schedule in October 1979.
Recruitment of staff is underway, and training and research programs are under
preparation. A recent Government decision not to increase sugar prices in
1978 was reviewed with the Bank, and agreement was reached that the current
price levels were adequate to provide the necessary incentives to growers.
Credit No. 692-KE/Loan No. 1390T-KE - Third Agricultural Credit
Project: $20.0 million Credit and $5.0 million Loan of April 15,
1977; Effective Date: September 14, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The progress of the Agricultural Finance Corporation's (AFC) lending
program has accelerated, and both the small scale and medium scale lending
lines are expected to catch up with appraisal forecasts. IDA disbursements
for medium scale loans have now started since AFC has recruited a Credit Spe-
cialist, a precondition for commencement of disbursements under this project
component. Loan recovery from Phase I and II projects is satisfactory and
steps are being taken to improve control of utilization of disbursed loans.
The impact of AFC's loans is seen in the diversification of progressive farms
into dairy, pigs, sugar and other new and expanding enterprises.
Loan No. 1449-KE/Credit No. 722-XE - Bura Irrigation Settlement
Project: $34.0 million Loan and $6.0 million Credit of June 22,
1977; Effective Date: June 27, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
This loan and this credit became effective on June 27, 1978.
The delay in effectiveness did not affect project implementation which is
proceeding satisfactorily.

ANNEX II
EDUCATION SECTOR
Loan No. 1184-KE - Third Education Project: $10.0 million Loan
of December 31, 1975; Effective Date: March 17, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Physical implementation is about two years behind the appraisal
schedule, basically due to delays by the various Committees in approving
sketch designs for the 17 primary teacher colleges. The Government's
reluctance to finance technical assistance specialists from the loan
proceeds may further delay project implementation. The sessional paper
on the report of the National Committee on Educational Objectives and
Priorities which was tabled in Parliament in May 1978 is expected to
be discussed in a full Cabinet meeting in the near future. No major changes
in the document are expected. The delays in approving sketch designs are
expected to be overcome and the dialogue with the Government regarding the
hiring of required specialists is continuing.
Credit No. 797-KE - Fourth Education: $23.0 million Credit of June 7,
1978; Effective Date: August 25, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
This Credit became effective on August 25, 1978. The Project Unit
Staff are benefitting from experience gained in implementing the Third Educa-
tion Project. Consultant architects have been appointed for the Faculty of
Agriculture and the thirteen Nomadic Primary Schools. Implementation of tech-
nical assistance for the Faculty of Agriculture and the Kenya Institute of
Administration has started.
WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
Loan No. 1167-KE - Mombasa and Coastal Water Supply; $35.0 million
Loan of October 15, 1975; Effective Date: January 13, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Physical execution of the major parts of the project is about nine
months behind schedule, while completion of some of the smaller components
may be as much as 15 months late. Delays were due mainly to weak project
administration by the Ministry of Water Development, particularly in the
early stages. Progress has now improved to an acceptable pace although lost
time is unlikely to be recovered. Disbursements have recently improved to
about 80% of the appraisal forecasts. There is an estimated cost overrun
of about 10% (expressed in US dollars) to be covered from Government re-
sources. Institution building is proceeding slowly due to difficulties in
recruiting staff. Steps are underway to audit the accounts of the Coast
Province Water Branch for the first time. Tariff measures taken by the
Government have been satisfactory.
Loan No. 1520-KE - Second Nairobi Water Supply; $30.0 million
Loan of March 27, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
This loan is not yet effective. Good progress is being made on
detailed design and the preparation of tender documents. Tender invita-
tions for the first contracts to be financed from the loan are scheduled
for September 1978.



- 26 -
ANNEX II
TRANSPORT SECTOR
Loan No. 224-KE - Road Maintenance: $12.6 million Credit of
December 28, 1970; Effective Date: March 18, 1971; Closing
Date: December 30, 1978
The project, about a year and a half behind schedule, is now sub-
stantially completed, with final completion expected by December 1978. The
delay was primarily caused by a slow start in construction of the regional
workshops and camps due to unforeseen difficulties in the acquisition of
sites and procurement of steel. The revised cost estimate of US$16.0 million
is about US$2.1 million below the appraisal estimate because of savings on
staffing costs and equipment and spare parts. There will be a US$1.8 million
savings from the credit funds. This remaining balance will be used for
purchase of additional workshop equipment and tools in order to achieve the
project's objectives. The Closing Date has been postponed to December 30,
1978 to allow additional time for completion of procurement.
Loan No. 826-KE - Nairobi Airport: $29.0 million Loan of June 2, 1972;
Effective Date: July 7, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Construction of the new Nairobi Airport was essentially completed
in December 1977, and it has been open to traffic since March 14, 1978. The
loan is almost 98% disbursed. The airport is performing up to expectations.
The remaining principal problem areas are in hiring and training sufficient
staff for operation and maintenance, both of which are constrained by non-
competitive salary scales and a Kenya-wide shortage of skilled personnel.
The project completion report is under preparation.
Loan No. 932-KE - Highways: $29.0 million loan of September 6, 1973;
Effective Date: November 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Implementation started two years behind schedule due to changes in
design standards by the Ministry of Works and financial constraints . In view
of heavy cost overruns, tenders for the construction of two roads were delayed.
Agreement has now been reached to delete the Thuchi-Nbuku (51 km) road from
the project. The Closing Date, which was postponed from December 31, 1977 to
December 31, 1979, is likely to be postponed further to allow time for comple-
tion of project works. All work is now in progress except for construction of
the Kisii-Mogonga road.
Loan No. 1133-KE - Mombasa-Nairobi Oil Product Pipeline Project:
$20.0 million Loan of June 27, 1975; Effective Date: December 31,
1975; Closing Date: February 1, 1979
Construction was completed in October 1977 and commercial operations
commenced in January 1978 as originally planned. The oil industry, the
Railways and the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) have agreed to install central
railroad loading facilities at KPC's Nairobi terminal. Financing of the



- 27 -
ANNEX II
US$1.54 million cost is being arranged. KPC has updated the project cost and
financial forecast. The final project cost overrun is only US$9.5 million or
11%. The increase is primarily due to escalation in construction costs.
KPC's long-term financial prospects are quite satisfactory although there
could be cash flow problems in the initial few years of operation because of
the preponderance of short and medium-term loans in the financing package.
Loan No. 1305-KE/Credit No. 651-KE - Rural Access Roads Project:
$4.0 million Loan and $4.0 million Credit of July 9, 1976; Effective
Date: October 7, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Although the Loan/Credit became effective in October 1976, no funds
have yet been disbursed. The project is slightly more than a year behind
schedule, though costs are not expected to increase. Economic evaluations
for the eight districts in which Bank-financed units would be set up have
been reviewed and approved by the Bank; five construction units are now
operating, and start up of the remaining three units is expected during
the next six months. So far, 140 km of access roads have been constructed
within appraisal estimates; commitments through December 31, 1977 are estimated
at US$1.1 million.
POPULATION SECTOR
Credit No. 468-KE - Population: $12.0 million Credit of April 1,
1974; Effective Date: July 31, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The four-year population project forms an integral part of Kenya's
Five-Year MCH/FP program, FY1975-79. All of the IDA-financed components
of the project are proceeding satisfactorily. All construction work has
been contracted and 95 percent of the facilities completed. Supply of
vehicles and furniture and equipment has been contracted and delivery has
commenced. The Nursing Activities study has been completed and the Study
of Fertility Determinants is underway. The program components financed
by other donors and the GOK are also moving ahead and are expected to be
completed on schedule, although program management needs to be strengthened
and the quality of services improved. Postponement of the Closing Date to
June 30, 1979 has been approved to permit completion of construction and
procurement.
POWER SECTOR
Loan No. 1147-KE - Gitaru Hydroelectric Project: $63.0 million Loan
of July 25, 1975; Effective Date: January 29, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979
Construction of the project was completed satisfactorily in June
1978 on schedule and within estimated cost. On the basis of contracts
awarded for civil works and electrical and mechanical equipment, present
estimates show that the project cost in Kenya shillings is likely to be about

ANNEX II
1% lower than the appraisal estimate. Due to the devaluation of Kenyan
currency in October 1975, however, the project cost saving expressed in US
dollar equivalent will be about 15% of the appraisal estimate. This will
result in a saving in the Bank loan of about US$5.0 million, in spite of the
increase made on June 15, 1977 in the percentage of civil works expenditures
to be financed under the Bank loan from 60% to 80%. Consultants' studies on
possible alternatives for future development and a long-term power development
plan are being reviewed by the Government and the Bank.
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Loan No. 946-KE - Industrial Develonment Bank Project: $5.0 million
Loan of November 29, 1973; Effective Date: March 26, 1974; Closing
Date: March 31, 1979
The first Bank loan of US$5.0 million to IDB, which became effective
on March 26, 1974 was 88% committed as of December 31, 1977 and was
fully committed in March 1978, two years behind schedule. This delay is
due to the cancellation prior to disbursement of a number of projects pre-
viously approved. As at August 31, 1978, US$4.4 million of this loan had
been disbursed. The Closing Date has been postponed by one year to March 31,
1979.
Loan No. 1148-KE - Second Industrial Development Bank Project:
$10.0 million Loan of July 25, 1975; Effective Date: October 9,
1975; Closing Date: July 1, 1979
The second Bank loan of US$10.0 million became effective on October 9,
1975. The loan was fully committed in August 1978 and US$7.0 million had been
disbursed as at August 31, 1978.
Loan No. 1438-KE - Third Industrial Development Bank Project: $20.0
million Loan of June 22, 1977; Effective Date: November 10, 1977;
Closing Date: July 1, 1982
This loan was declared effective on November 19, 1977. Two sub-projects
have been approved. As at August 31, 1978, US$2.1 million had been committed.
Credit No. 750-KE - Small Scale Industry Project: $10.0 million
Credit of November 28, 1977; Effective Date: June 26, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
This loan was declared effective on June 26, 1978. Measures to
increase Kenya Industrial Estates' (KIE) capital have been finalized. Several
key project staff have been recruited, and efforts are underway to fill the
remaining positions. KIE's guidelines for appraisal of sub-projects are now
being reviewed.

URBAN SECTOR
Credit No. 543-KE/Loan No. 1105-KE - Sites and Services Project:
$8.0 million Credit and $8.0 million Loan of May 6, 1975; Effective
Date: September 25, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Infrastructure has been completed for the first 1,000 plots and most
beneficiaries have constructed satisfactory houses. Infrastructure for an
additional 2,700 plots is under construction with tendering underway for
construction of infrastructure for the remaining 2,300 plots. Off-site
infrastructure is nearly completed. Community facilities provision is behind
schedule. One primary school is nearing completion. The remaining five
schools are to be tendered within the next six months. One health center is
under construction, however, the Bank does not plan to disburse against its
costs as its design was too expnsive and did not meet Bank approval. The
design of the other health center should be submitted for approval soon.
Technical assistance components are completed or scheduled for completion in
conjunction with the project. Project costs remain close to appraisal esti-
mates although minor cost overruns are foreseen for the remaining components
of the project.
Credit No. 791-KE/Loan No. 1550-KE - Second Urban Project: $25.0
million Credit and $25.0 million Loan of May 5, 1978; Closing
Date: December 31, 1983
This Credit and this Loan are not yet effective. Nairobi's Housing
Development Department is organized and staffed; Mombasa and Kisumu are
recruiting staff for their Housing Development Departments. At least one site
in each municipality has been acquired, and work can begin immediately. No
major land acquisition problems are foreseen for any of the other sites
although minor problems exist in acquiring one site in Mombasa. Consultants
for detailed design and engineering for some of the sites have been appointed,
with the appointment of others in process. Substantial progress has been made
on all 13 technical assistance components of the project.
WILDLIFE AND TOURISM SECTOR
Loan No. 1304-XE - Wildlife and Tourism Project: $17.0 million Loan
of July 9, 1976; Effective Date: November 10, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982
Preparation for project implementation has been considerably slower
than expected, due largely to delays in recruitment of personnel for the Proj-
ect Management Unit (PMU) and the Wildlife Planning Unit (WPU). Project imple-
mentation should now accelerate as officers have recently been appointed for
the PMU. CIDA has expressed an interest in funding WPU posts, and seconded
the acting head of the unit for about six months. Preparations for the
Tourism Pricing Study and the Very Large Herbivores Study are proceeding
satisfactorily. A supplementary letter strengthening the Government's proposal
for anti-poaching operations to be financed by the Loan has been negotiated
and signed, and disbursements on this component can now begin. The Government

has largely complied with the terms of the supplementary letter but some de-
tails remain to be finalized.
East African Community
There are currently 5 projects in execution in the East African
Community. 1/
Loan No. 638-EA - Second Harbours Project: $35.0 million Loan
of August 25, 1969; Date of Effectiveness; December 15, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Loan No. 865-EA - Third Harbours Project: $26.5 million Loan of
December 18, 1972; Date of Effectiveness: April 16, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Second Harbours project included financing for five general
cargo berths and a single bay tanker terminal for the Port of Dar es Salaam;
two general cargo berths and a bulk cement wharf for Mombasa; tugs, lighters,
cargo handling equipment, offices, housing and general improvements for both
ports. The Third Harbours project included three new deep water berths,
modernization of two berths and a lighterage quay, a training school building
and central repair area for Dar es Salaam; modernization of several berths and
a ligherage quay, construction of a tug berth, cold storage facilities and a
training building in Mombasa and improvement of a lighterage quay in Tanga.
Construction of all major project elements has been completed. Of the
minor project elements, only two are still under construction, namely the
improvement of lighterage facilities in Tanga and reconstruction of sheds
im Mombasa. Both are expected to be completed before mid-1978. Because of
shortage of funds under both loans, the following minor project elements
have not been submitted for Bank financing: the second phase of modernization
of the lighterage quay and a training school for Dar es Salaam; and moderniza-
tion of the lighterage quay and a training school for Mombasa. Locally
financed contracts have been awarded for these project elements with the
exception of the modernization of the lighterage quay in Mombasa. General
cargo throughput has increased above appraisal forecasts for Dar es Salaam,
and cargo handling productivity has improved with increasing throughput;
however, port labor productivity has stagnated in Mombasa where general
1/   Since October 1, 1977,the East African Community loans (excluding the
East African Development Bank) have been disbursed on the basis of
separate national guarantees. The agreed allocation of undisbursed
balances for each loan, as proposed in a report to the Executive
Directors dated December 29, 1977 (R77-312) and approved on January 12,
1978, is given in this annex. The Closing Dates for Loans 638-EA,
674-EA and 865-EA have passed. However, since the amount allocated
to and guaranteed by each Partner State is clearly identified under
the terms of the agreement signed on January 25, 1978, as proposed
in the above report (R77-312), we are continuing disbursements.

cargo throughput has declined considerably. The ports of Kenya and Tanzania
are now functioning completely independently of each other. Legislation to
establish a Tanzania Harbours Authority has been enacted, and a Kenya Port
Authority is expected to be established soon. Management of ports in both
countries is competent. Some $33.8 million of Loan 638-EA and $25.4 million
of Loan 865-EA has already been disbursed. The agreed allocation of undis-
bursed funds at October 1, 1977 between the countries concerned is given below:
For Loan No. 638-EA             (US$ million)
Kenya                           0.7
Tanzania                        0.6

of May 25, 1970; Date of Effectiveness - October 30, 1970;
Closing Date - June 30, 1978
The original purpose of the project was to complete the Railways'
1969-1972 Development Program, including track improvement, procurement of
rolling stock and other equipment, and to finance studies of the economic
feasibility of certain railway lines and services. The physical execution of
the original project has been seriously delayed due to administrative and
political problems within the Community. In November 1974, the Executive
Directors approved a reallocation of the uncommitted balance of the Loan to be
used for consultant services and emergency investments in track material. All
three countries have now enacted legislation to establish their own Railways
Corporations. The agreed allocation of undisbursed funds at October 1, 1977
among the various countries concerned is given below:

Loan of June 22, 1973; Date of Effectiveness - September 19, 1973;
Closing Date - December 31, 1979
The project included provision for procurement of local telephone
exchange equipment, cables and subscriber apparatus, microwave and UHF/VHF
systems and multiplex equipment, interurban cables and wires, automatic
switching and signalling equipment, telegraph, telex and data equipment,
and training. All major works other than microwave system construction have
now been completed, despite initial delays caused by staffing and other
problems associated with the reallocation of the headquarters. Funds dis-
bursed to date total $26.9 million and the balance has been committed for
cables and subscriber apparatus, microwave and multiplex telex and tele-
graph equipment. Because of the long lead time required for the microwave
equipment, the project is expected to be fully completed by mid-1979. The
agreed allocation of undisbursed funds at October 1977 among the countries
concerned is given below:
$ Million
Kenya                2.4

of March 1, 1976; Date of Effectiveness - June 7, 1976; Closing
Date - March 31, 1979
Over the last year, the environment within the Community has had a
negative impact on EADB operations. Level of operations both for appraisal
and supervision has been depressed, and there has been some deterioration in
the state of the portfolio with the arrears affected portfolio rising to 50%
as of June 30, 1977. However, EADB has been able to retain nearly all its
staff who are both adequate in number and technically competent to continue
the operation of the institution and effect some recovery in the portfolio.
Some $6.7 million has been disbursed to date, and the uncommitted balance
amounts to $3.3 million.
