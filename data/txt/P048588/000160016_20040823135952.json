This report\n            anticipates likely negative environmental impacts connected\n            to the development of integrated waste management\n            facilities, and proposes measures to mitigate them. They\n            include the following: To offset negative visual effects\n            from the change in landscape character, provide vegetative\n            cover on closed portions of the landfill and convert land to\n            area to be used for recreation or low intensity agriculture,\n            service roads, ditches, ponds, and wetland areas. Use solid\n            perimeter fencing around the construction site, storm water\n            management, including surface water drainage control and\n            treatment system to reduce leachate generation and flooding,\n            and cover slopes with vegetation. To manage impacts\n            affecting air quality including odor control, provide daily\n            cover, minimize presence of exposed waste material, provide\n            fencing, and keep excavated areas wet. Install noise fencing\n            at sensitive sites, use machinery that suppresses noise,\n            avoid nighttime work, and use mobile noise barriers. To\n            relieve traffic congestion, direct traffic during heavy\n            periods. Protect large trees, transplant smaller trees, and\n            provide indigenous vegetation."}, "docdt": "1999-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
