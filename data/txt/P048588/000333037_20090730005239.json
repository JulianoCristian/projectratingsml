the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the reforms and institution building envisaged under\n            LOGOFIND required time and sustained dialogue within\n            government. Government of the Philippines (GOP) and the Bank\n            will have benefited from phased program, with a series of\n            loans funding activities but approved sequentially as\n            progress of implementation of reforms are made. Through\n            Adaptable Program Loan (APL), adjustments can be made as the\n            reforms are carried out, unlike with the regular investment\n            lending. In the case of LOGOFIND, the attempt was to\n            complete a rather package of reforms that proved to be\n            unrealistic given the institutional, economic, and political\n            circumstance and the short timeframe for implementation. If\n            it were pursued through an APL, the first phase could have\n            addressed the institutional and capacity requirements of the\n            Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) as the implementing\n            agency. The succeeding loans could have then covered the\n            next phases of MDFO reorganization and transformation into a\n            separate entity. In this way, the institutions and agencies\n            that are assigned the responsibility for overseeing the\n            reform process could also be assisted and strengthened while\n            allowing them to implement the reform agenda and they will\n            be more prepared to deal with more complex institutional\n            reforms requiring actions like creation of municipal\n            financial entities."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
