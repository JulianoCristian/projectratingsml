Lessons learned from the\n            project: Natural Resource Management (NRM) interventions\n            planned and implemented through local communities benefit\n            from local knowledge, better integration of conservation\n            goals with local livelihood concerns. Since many\n            conservation measures typically benefit land-holders,\n            pro-poor interventions in watershed projects are helpful in\n            creating a stake in the project for the weaker and marginal\n            segments of the community as well. Facilitation (helping\n            with the strengthening of relevant local institutions,\n            processes and capacities) is at least as critical an input\n            as external finance in helping communities address their\n            conservation and development concerns. Project experience\n            shows that social mobilization and community capacity\n            building take time to start up but work powerfully when\n            matured. Complexity in implementation of multi-state\n            projects can be reduced significantly by a system of joint\n            supervisions and a shared learning platform. A significant\n            output of this project is the up-grading of\n            skills/capacities of project staff. In a multi-state\n            project, greater uniformity in recording and reporting\n            systems is needed to facilitate comparisons as well as\n            project self-appraisal."}, "docdt": "2005-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
