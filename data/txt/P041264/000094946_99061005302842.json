The\n            project contributes significantly to decreasing soil\n            erosion, increasing water availability, and alleviating\n            poverty in the contiguous areas of the Shivalik hills in the\n            five project states. The project has two main components: 1)\n            Watershed protection and development; and 2) Institutional\n            strengthening. The first component includes watershed\n            treatments, fodder and livestock development, and rural\n            infrastructure development. The second component includes\n            policy reforms, studies, and human resource development;\n            beneficiary capacity building; income generating activities\n            for women; information management and monitoring and\n            evaluation; and support to project coordination."}, "docdt": "1999-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
