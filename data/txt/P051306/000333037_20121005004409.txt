SUMMARY

The objective of the Project is to enhance the access of young men and women, between the ages of
14 to 26 years old, to opportunities for education, work and political participation in Colombia. The
Project consists of the following parts: Part A. Financial and Technical Support for Project
Initiatives of Young; Part B. Financial and Technical Support to Local Governments and
Agencies Specialized on Youth; Part C. Monitoring, Evaluation and Training, and Part D. Bank
Incremental Costs, Supervision and Operational Costs.

The Grant Recipient, Fundacion Restrepo Barco, requested the Bank on August 8, 2012 a
reallocation of grant proceeds to reflect the current status of the Project and the needs of the
Project to comply with its development objective.

The proposed changes intend to transfer resources from category (5) Subgrants for Subprojects to
categories (1) Consultants’ Services, (2) Training/workshops and (4) Operating costs. It is important
to mention that the proposed changes would not alter the objective, components, activities, or
deliverables of the Project, neither would they imply a change to the Project’s safeguards.

PROJECT STATUS

The Project was declared effective on September 20, 2010. It is being executed with diligence
and commitment by the Grant Recipient, Fundacion Restrepo Barco, and has put in place an
interesting decentralized intervention model to work in six Departments of Colombia and 12
municipalities to enhance the access of young men and women to opportunities for education,
work and political participation.

Currently, 60% of the Grant has been committed and 19 subprojects (of USD$40.000 each), are
under implementation and scheduled to close by March 2013, while the Project’s closing date is
July 28, 2014. Local authorities are explicitly supporting the Project development objective and
some have included youth policies and programs within their local development plans.

The Grant Recipient is organizing a national workshop to be held by the end of the year, in order
to disseminate preliminary Project lessons and share subprojects outcomes and results, and
continue strengthening partnerships among public and private organizations at the national,
regional and local level.



                                                 5
The first external audit has been completed with unqualified results, demonstrating that all
agreed procedures and guidelines have been complied with.

PROPOSED CHANGES

As requested by the Recipient, the proposed reallocation is necessary to cover additional costs
under categories (1), (2) and (4), using unused resources from category (5). Particularly, the
proposed reallocation provides for:

   (i)       The reallocation of USD$98,938 from Category (5) to Category (1) to maintain the
             national team and the regional coordinators until the end of the subprojects
             implementation period;
   (ii)      The reallocation of USD$136,583 from Category (5) to Category (2) to ensure the
             proper technical assistance to subprojects under Component A.2., and organization
             and development of local and national workshops with broad participation of Project
             stakeholders;
   (iii)     The reallocation of USD4,479 from Category (5) to Category (4) taking into account
             the needs of the Project teams at the national and regional level to cover operating
             costs associated to the supervision and monitoring of subprojects until the end of its
             implementation period; the publication of the Project’s best practices, and
             dissemination events.
   (iv)      The reduction of USD240,000 from Category (5) considering that it was not possible
             to finance more subprojects due to: (i) the transition period between municipal
             authorities that impeded new majors to identify and properly prepare subproject
             proposals at the time of the call for proposals, and (ii) the difficulty to find youth
             organizations with the legal requirements and experience needed to implement
             subprojects.

This is the second restructuring of this grant, the first being to improve the financial and
administrative arrangements necessary to carry out the Project, it was agreed to amend the Grant
Agreement to, inter alia: (i) clarify that the activities related to Part B.2 of the Project will be
performed through Subgrants; (ii) specify the funds allocated to said Subgrants; (iii) specify the
number of events that will be carried out under Part B.1 of the Project; (vi) remove Part D of the
Grant Agreement, and (v) introduce other formal changes such as updating of the Anti-Corruption
Guidelines.



                                                 6
The original version of the Grant Agreement omitted the reference to the execution of activities
under Part B.2 of the Project through Subgrants, similarly as how Part A.1 of the Project will be
implemented. Using this opportunity, the Bank proposed in addition to: (i) review some
definitions in the Annex of the Grant Agreement; (ii) clarify the scope of activities under Part
B.1 of the Project; (iii) remove Part D of the Grant Agreement considering that this Part is not
Recipient executed, and (iv) incorporate the updated version of the Anticorruption Guidelines of
January, 2011, and correct a few typos and missing words in the description of activities. First
amendment is dated May 10, 2011.
