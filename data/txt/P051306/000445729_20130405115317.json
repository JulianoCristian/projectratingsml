were\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; bank\n            performance was satisfactory; borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. There are some of the key lessons learned from\n            this project: (i) the Peace and Development Program (PDP)\n            methodology is useful for generating development processes\n            that are conducive to peace;(ii) interventions in areas of\n            conflict, supported by alliances among the Government of\n            Colombia (GOC), international community and civil society,\n            generate greater legitimacy from the outset; (iii)\n            consensus-building based on trust in the midst of contexts\n            marked by violence and polarization, has the potential to\n            influence local development processes;(iv) the Partner\n            Organization (PO) profound knowledge of the territories,\n            their knowledge of the socioeconomic and political dynamics,\n            imprinted realism to the PDP interventions;(v) building on\n            lessons from Learning and Innovation Loans (LIL) to scale up\n            the program using an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) was\n            particularly useful in supporting a long term peace and\n            development agenda.
