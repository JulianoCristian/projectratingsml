                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective of Phase I is to assist vulnerable, low income and displaced populations in rural and urban communities in the conflict-
                         affected regions in order to reduce the risk of their exposure to conflict and mitigate the negative impact of possible derived effects. The project assumes that
                         building assets is a measure that contributes to mitigate the risk of displacement, and that restoring a basic safety net to displaced families is a vital first step in
                         their social and economic stabilization. The Project will not finance activities related to the armed conflict or conflict related violence, however it provides the
                         support necessary for people to reduce and mitigate the risk of conflict and violence.

                         Project's implementation schedule vis-a-vis the original program for 2010, in the current calendar year the Project, again, is being affected by important delays mainly due to: (i) lack
                         of leadership in Accion Social in regards with this operation during the transition period; (ii) several changes in the Project Coordination Team and the reduction of personnel in
                         charged of the Project in Accion Social; and (iii) weak administrative performance to guarantee on time flow of funds from the national level to the territories. In addition, Accion
                         Social has not taken alternative measures to implement the Project in the Macizo Colombiano/Alto Patia region, therefore the Project has not started activities in this area.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank is closely accompanying the implementation of the Project since December 2010 when the last supervision mission took place, through carrying out bimonthly supervision
                         meetings with Accion Social and keeping close communication with the Partner Organizations. The Bank has also strengthened communication with the National Planning
                         Department in order to share concerns about the administrative constraints that affect the implementation pace of the Project. The Bank has also contributed to facilitate the dialog
                         and the transition between Project Coordinators in Accion Social. Currently, Accion Social is awaiting final authorization of future budget allocations (2012) that will allow the
                         subscription of the Subsidiary Agreements with Partner Organizations for the period 2011-2012 with positive impacts for the flow of funds from the national to the territorial level.
                         Finally, the Bank is following closely the recently approved Victims Law which incorporates an institutional reform affecting Accion Social, in order to assess the potential impact of
                         this reform in the implementation of the Project.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
