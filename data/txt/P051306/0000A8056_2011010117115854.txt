                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective of Phase I is to assist vulnerable, low income and displaced populations in rural and urban communities in the conflict-
                         affected regions in order to reduce the risk of their exposure to conflict and mitigate the negative impact of possible derived effects. The project assumes that
                         building assets is a measure that contributes to mitigate the risk of displacement, and that restoring a basic safety net to displaced families is a vital first step in
                         their social and economic stabilization. The Project will not finance activities related to the armed conflict or conflict related violence, however it provides the
                         support necessary for people to reduce and mitigate the risk of conflict and violence.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation

                         to expedite Project's implementation during the first year of the Project. The Partner Organizations are working satisfactorily, except for the Partner Organization operating in the
                         Macizo-Alto Patía Region, Asopatía, which is going through an institutional and financial adjustment. As a result, the Project has not yet started implementation in this Region and the
                         2010 Subsidiary Agreement with Asopatia will be terminated. For 2011, the Government and the Bank are assessing this Partner Organization's institutional situation prior entering
                         into a new subsidiary agreement, and if necessary will select a new Partner Organization for the implementation of the Project in the Alto Patía-Macizo Colombiano Region.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
