                         This additional financing remains with the same objectives as the original project: to assist vulnerable, low-income and displaced populations in rural and urban
                         communities in the conflict affected region in order to reduce the risk of their exposure to conflict and mitigate the negative impact of possible derived effects.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Additional Financing Project (AF) had a slow start in 2010 during the transition period from one administration to the new one, and implementation constraints from the national
                         level have continued during the execution of the Project, mainly associated to the institutional reform that created the Administrative Department for Social Prosperity (DPS), replacing
                         the former Accion Social (Project's executing agency). However, counterpart teams at the territorial level lead by Partner Organizations, have done their best efforts to overcome the
                         institutional constraints and to catch up with the delays in Project implementation. The main difficulties that the Project has encountered during its implementation are: (i) the more

                         complex than expected transition from Accion Social to the DPS; (ii) several changes and staff rotation in the Project Coordination Team in DPS; (iii) weak supervision and
                         administrative performance in DPS to guarantee on time flow of funds from the national level to the territories. Despite this, the Bank is confident on the Project's capacity to achieve
                         its PDO and expected outcomes/results by its closing date on September 15, 2012.

                         After the Mid Term Review Mission (August 2011), future budget allocations (including 2012) permitted the signing of Subsidiary Agreements with the Partner Organizations for the
                         remaining of the Project's implementation period; the Project Coordination Team was strengthened, and activities in the Macizo-Colombiano-Alto Patia Region (with the use of
                         alternative institutional arrangements) finally started and are under implementation. Currently, 32 territorial strategic processes (PETs) are under implementation. In January 2012 the
                         Bank approved a Project's restructuring to reallocate proceeds of the Loan among categories. During the period March-April, the Bank undertook a Project's regular supervision
                         mission and assessed Project's progress, and at the same time, evidenced the challenges that the Project has in its final stage of implementation.

                         The Bank has started with enough anticipation the planning activities to prepare the Project's Implementation Completion Report (ICR) that will be prepared with an intensive learning
                         approach, not only because of the relevance that Colombia has given to the peace and development intervention model in conflict-affected regions targeted to assist poor, vulnerable
                         and displaced populations, the experience and institutional capacities built at the territorial level where the Project operates, but because this ICR will comprise the overall operation
                         initiated in 2004 with the original (parent) Project and represents with its closure, fourteen years of Bank's involvement in the peace-building and consolidation process in Colombia. It
                         is time to assess the overall experience, collect learnings and results, and disseminate them in the Country (for their use in the design and implementation of related flag programs,
                         such as the victims reparation and land restitution program) and in the Bank (for reference to the Bank's work on fragile and conflict-affected States).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank is closely accompanying the implementation of the Project in its final stage of implementation and it is having close communication with the Project's Coordination Unit in
                         DPS (former Accion Social) to ensure that they are providing continuing support to Partner Organizations (Peace and Development Regional Programs, PDRP) at the territorial level.
                         The complex institutional reform that created the new Administrative Department for Social Prosperity (replacing Accion Social) has resulted in administrative constraints, interrupted
                         flow of funds, staff rotations, loss of Project' s history, etc. affecting Project's implementation pace. Therefore, the upcoming closure of the Project has important challenges to

                         overcome in order to guarantee a proper completion of Project activities and closure, complying with all the expected outcomes and results, and facilitating time and spaces for
                         retrospective analysis and dissemination. However, due to the Project's Coordination Team and the Partner Organizations' commitment, the Bank is confident on the Project's
                         capacity to achieve its PDO and expected outcomes/results by its closing date on September 15, 2012.

                         Key issues and actions identified and agreed upon during the last supervision mission (April, 2012) are: (i) DPS to guarantee an interrupted flow of funds to the Partner Organizations;
                         (ii) punctual legalization of funds by Partner Organizations before DPS; (iii) speed up Project activities related to the organizational strengthening strategy led by DNP (Component B);
                         (iv) systematization of Project's emblematic study cases; (v) review and possible extension of Subsidiary Agreements entered between DPS and Partner Organizations to allow a
                         proper finalization of activities at the territorial level, and (vi) preparation of Project's Implementation Completion Report (ICR).
