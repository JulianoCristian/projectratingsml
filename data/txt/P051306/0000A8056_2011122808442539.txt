                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective of Phase I is to assist vulnerable, low income and displaced populations in rural and urban communities in the conflict-
                         affected regions in order to reduce the risk of their exposure to conflict and mitigate the negative impact of possible derived effects. The project assumes that
                         building assets is a measure that contributes to mitigate the risk of displacement, and that restoring a basic safety net to displaced families is a vital first step in
                         their social and economic stabilization. The Project will not finance activities related to the armed conflict or conflict related violence, however it provides the
                         support necessary for people to reduce and mitigate the risk of conflict and violence.

                         decision to annualize the budget and Project activities which demanded internal Bank consultations and the adjustment of the Global Operational Plan, originally designed as a three
                         year Plan, in order to convert it into annual plans. Although the Project's counterpart teams at the national and territorial levels did an important effort to catch up with the six month
                         delay in Project's implementation schedule vis-a-vis the original program for 2010, until the first semester of the current calendar year the Project continued to be affected by
                         implementation delays. These delays were explained by: (i) lack of leadership in Accion Social in regards with this operation during the transition period; (ii) several changes in the

                         Project Coordination Team and the reduction of personnel in charged of the Project in Accion Social; and (iii) weak administrative performance to guarantee on time flow of funds
                         from the national level to the territories. On the other hand, Accion Social did not take on time alternative measures to implement the Project in the Macizo Colombiano-Alto Patia
                         Region. Therefore the Project only started activities in this Region in July 2011.

                         Fortunately, after the Mid Term Review Mission, some positive expectations about the future implementation of the Project have materialized:(i) the approval of future budget
                         allocations (2012), and therefore the signing of the Subsidiary Agreements with the Partner Organizations for the remaining of the Project's implementation period. This will facilitate a
                         continued flow of funds from the national level to the territories until the end of the Project; (ii) the appointment of a new Project Coordinator and strengthening of the Project
                         Coordination Team in Accion Social; (iii) the demonstrated capacity of the Partner Organizations to overcome these difficulties encountered at the national level; and (iv) the initiation
                         of activities in the Macizo-Colombiano-Alto Patia Region with the use of alternative institutional arrangements (direct contract between Accion Social and beneficiary organizations to
                         implement their own subprojects). Currently, the Bank's Project Team is confident on the Project's capacity to achieve the expected outcomes and results by its closing date on
                         September, 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank is closely accompanying the implementation of the Project since the Project's Mid Term Review Mission held from August 22 to September 2, 2011. Project implementation
                         pace continue to require more agility. Accion Social received authorization for the useof future budget allocations (2012). This allowed the subscription of Subsidiary Agreements with
                         Partner Organizations for the period 2011-2012. This has important positive impacts for the flow of funds from the national to the territorial level. Currently, the Bank is : (i) following
                         closely the recently approved institutional reform that transforms Accion Social into the new Administrative Department for Social Prosperity, in order to assess the potential impact of
                         this reform in the implementation of the Project; (ii) preparing a Project restructuring paper for the reallocation of proceeds of the Loan among categories; and (iii) accompanying the
                         implementation of the Project in order to ensure that the Project Coordination Team is providing continuing support to the Partner Organizations (Peace and Development Regional
                         Programs, PDRP) at the territorial level.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
