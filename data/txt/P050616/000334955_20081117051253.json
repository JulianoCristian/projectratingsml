focus on\n            development effectiveness and adequacy of supervision inputs\n            and processes - also rated highly satisfactory. The project\n            became effective on 7/19/2000, almost eleven month after\n            Board presentation. This was the major initial problem. The\n            two effectiveness conditions, which took a long time to be\n            resolved, were: (i) the nomination of the Central Water\n            Sanitation Agency (CWSA) Board, and (ii) Parliamentary\n            approval of the subsidiary grant agreement between the\n            Government and CWSA. There was a close follow up of the\n            effectiveness issue by the Bank through the resident mission\n            and the 2000 CPPR was instrumental in raising to the\n            attention of Government of Ghana (GOG) senior managers the\n            urgency of obtaining Parliamentary approval for all pending\n            subsidiary grants agreement under Bank credits. With regard\n            to the issue of harmonization of the water supply/sanitation\n            policies, the Bank team has been very proactive in reaching\n            out to other donors with a view to convince them to adopt a\n            common sector wide approach, and progress is being made.\n            Conditions for effectiveness have to be strictly minimized\n            and reduced to the legal opinion and the signing of\n            subsidiary agreements, if and when applicable. In this case,\n            delay could have been reduced if the nomination of the Board\n            could have been made a condition of Board presentation."}, "docdt": "2002-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
