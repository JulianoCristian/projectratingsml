The Bank's and\n            Borrower's performances were satisfactory for all three\n            projects. Three lessons were cited: 1) Decentralization\n            requires an enabling institutional environment including: a\n            long term commitment, a demand-driven approach including\n            beneficiary contributions, clear institutional roles and\n            guidance for all stakeholders, and a common implementation\n            modality for all actors. 2) A major drive to build\n            implementation capacity is essential including: major\n            training for local governments, communities and private\n            sector support services, emphasis on up-front capacity\n            building before investment in infrastructure, strong central\n            coordination including monitoring and evaluation, and\n            integration of hygiene education alongside the investment\n            program; and 3)  Sustainability needs to be a central focus\n            including: priority on raising revenues for operations and\n            maintenance, institutional adjustments to improve revenue\n            collection, self-sustaining support services from the\n            private sector, and follow-on training for the local\n            governments and community organizations."}, "docdt": "2006-07-07T00:00:00Z"}
