Lessons learned: The\n            project's ability to exceed the access target in the\n            Development Objective by an additional 40 percent coupled\n            with the strengthening of local institutions and systems to\n            ensure sustained delivery capacity demonstrates the\n            potential of decentralized water and sanitation services.\n            Strong district ownership and leadership is key. Funds flow\n            from center to local level should be efficient. Capacity\n            building strengthens implementation and operation and\n            maintenance. District planning underpins strategic\n            decision-making. Private sector capacity to respond to\n            demand is crucial. Adequate supply chains promote efficient\n            and sustainable delivery. Significant benefits could only be\n            derived if at least half of community members owned latrines\n            and made this an access criteria for subsidies. Ghana\n            ownership was consistent at all levels, most notably the\n            Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Local Government. Over\n            2,000 communities assisted by the project are adequately\n            using and maintaining their water facilities."}, "docdt": "2005-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
