The Second Community Water and\n            Sanitation Project (CWSP2) will be implemented in three\n            3-year phases. The first phase for CWSP2 aims to increase\n            service coverage, and achieve effective and sustained use of\n            improved community water and sanitation in villages and\n            small towns in four regions. There are two main project\n            components. The Community Subprojects component provides\n            grants to communities and schools through their district\n            assemblies for construction of water and sanitation\n            facilities and finances technical assistance and community\n            development activities to strengthen community capacity to\n            plan, implement, operate, and maintain water and sanitation\n            facilities in an effective and sustainable manner. Community\n            subprojects include protected communal hand-dug wells,\n            communal boreholes equipped with handpumps, a mechanized\n            boreholes, a surface water supply system, a protected spring\n            source, rainwater catchment, and household and school\n            latrines. The second component strengthens stakeholder\n            capacity by supporting the private sector and\n            nongovernmental organizations as providers of hardware and\n            software services, and provides national program development."}, "docdt": "1999-08-05T00:00:00Z"}
