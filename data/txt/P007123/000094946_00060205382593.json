Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are adjudged satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include the following: To the degree lenders\n            do not identify all affected groups and work with them to\n            see the \"win-win\" aspects of such projects as this\n            one, success may be limited. In the early phase of this\n            project, there were several instances of both central-local\n            and intra-local conflicts related to this problem. It should\n            be made clear that revenue-sharing practices is not a goal\n            in decentralization and municipal development projects; few\n            sub-national entities can totally survive on their own\n            resources. National contracting issues had to be addressed\n            at the project level which lowered considerably the\n            probability of success. Use of revenue-sharing funds as\n            sub-loan guarantees is a good device for first-generation\n            municipal lending operations; however, sub-national\n            borrowers and lenders need to quickly move to instruments\n            which more closely link investments with their associated\n            costs, benefits, and risks."}, "docdt": "2000-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
