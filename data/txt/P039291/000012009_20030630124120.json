satisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank, and Borrower. Lessons drawn\n            from the project convey primarily that: financial\n            sustainability should be a key element in institutional\n            strengthening programs; technical assistance (TA) projects\n            are more effective if they include an investment component\n            in the project's later years; result, and impact\n            indicators are important for both project follow-up and\n            ex-post evaluation, as well as for managerial\n            decision-making; providing upfront procurement, and\n            financial management assistance are important partners to\n            technical capacity building for sustainability. Furthermore,\n            projects should build-in a mechanism for regular\n            inter-institutional coordination, and a periodic\n            redefinition of roles, and competencies of environmental\n            agencies, i.e., for increased effectiveness, and efficiency\n            of environmental management, within a particular\n            geographical area, there should be only one responsible\n            environmental management agency. However, prior evaluation\n            of the potential risk of different interpretations of the\n            legal framework is fundamental for the design, and execution\n            of a project of this nature, in particular if the legal\n            framework is relatively recent. In addition, an adequate\n            documentation center within institutions, and a related\n            dissemination plan are important to create an institutional\n            memory, but also to make full use of outputs generated."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
