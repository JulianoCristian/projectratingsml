Among the\n            lessons cited were these: 1) A Competitive Grants system is\n            feasible even within a small scientific community such as\n            the agricultural research community in Ecuador, if adequate\n            resources are dedicated to project preparation and\n            monitoring of activities. This requires a much greater\n            amount of resources than conventional supply driven research\n            projects. 2) A Competitive Grants system can make a\n            significant contribution to strengthening the national\n            capacity to do agricultural research by drawing out latent\n            capacity external to the national agricultural research\n            system as well as leveraging resources which might otherwise\n            not be used for agricultural research. Because most\n            counterpart resources are available in kind (personnel,\n            facilities etc.) the external financial contribution is\n            essential as leverage to initiate the process. 3) A\n            Competitive Grants system is an important tool to help\n            researchers and institutions to prepare high quality\n            proposals and install good financial and reporting systems.\n            Traditional national research authorities derive\n            considerable benefit from the experience of participating in\n            competitive grant schemes. 4) A Competitive Grants system is\n            flexible enough to allow funding of research in all aspects\n            of the production chain if needed. In this project the\n            following areas were covered; natural resource management,\n            production, agro-industry, marketing and occupational health\n            of field workers. 5) As a Competitive Grants system per se\n            is not self-sustaining, means for establishing a\n            competitive, demand driven system beyond the project phase\n            need to be developed as an integral part of the project\n            itself. While a Competitive Grants system is very effective\n            for the many reasons listed above, they are not sustainable\n            unless there is full government support for a larger\n            agricultural innovation system. Competitive Grants should be\n            seen as one mechanism to promote innovation within a broader\n            scheme of financing. 6) Serious reform of an established\n            national research establishment requires a combination of\n            political will and staff support."}, "docdt": "2005-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
