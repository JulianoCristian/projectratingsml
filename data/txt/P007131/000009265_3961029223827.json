introducing a competitive research grant program; (ii)\n            developing research and education exchange partnerships with\n            international science institutions; and (iii) strengthening\n            the national agricultural research institute, INIAP. The\n            project components include: (i) competitive grants which\n            include research grants, research and educational exchange\n            partnerships with international institutions; (ii)\n            strengthening INIAP; and (iii) project implementation."}, "docdt": "1996-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
