proposed project would improve\n            incomes and living standards of farmers in the Communal\n            Areas and the former African Purchase Areas by intensifying\n            agricultural production through financing farm inputs and\n            investments. It would provide seasonal credit for seed,\n            fertilizer and chemicals and medium-term credit for farm\n            improvement and equipment; and facilities and technical\n            assistance to the Agricultural Finance Cooperation (AFC) to\n            support its expansion of small-farm credit. The project\n            would directly benefit about 27,000 families in the Communal\n            Areas with average holdings of 2 or 3 ha, besides 4,000\n            families in the Purchase Areas."}, "docdt": "1982-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
