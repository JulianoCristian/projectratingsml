CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower            :         Republic of Zimbabwe.
Beneficiary                   Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC)
Amount                        SDR 27.9-million (US$30.4 million equivalent).
Terms               :         Standard.
Relending                     Passed on as fixed capital to AFC, in form of
irredeemable loan, at the rate of interest
normally charged to statutory bodies (current-
ly 9.5 percent).
Project                       The proposed project would improve incomes and
Description                   living standards of farmers in the Communal
Areas (formerly Tribal Trust Lands) and the
former African Purchase Areas by intensifying
agricultural production through financing farm
inputs and investments. It would provide,
through AFC, seasonal credit for seed, fertil-
izer and chemicals and medium-term credit for
farm improvement and equipment; and facilities
and technical assistance to AFC to support its
expansion of small-farm credit.
The project would directly benefit about
27,000 families in the Communal Areas with
average holdings of 2 or 3 ha, besides 4,000
families in the Purchase Areas. The risks
include a loss of senior AFC staff because of
emigration or attraction to the better-paid
private sector, and a weakening of AFC's
performance and repayment record during the
rapid expansion of smallholder lending.
However, the project would finance
replacements for any departing staff, while
AFC has coped well with the credit expansion
of the past three years, the repayment record
remaining sound. The risks also include
delays in marketing and input supply caused by
any worsening of transportation; but the
Goverrment is urgently addressing the
transport problem, assisted by the Bank.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EKECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE
FOR A SMALL FARM CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
t            credit of SDR 27.9 million (US$30.4 million equivalent) to the Republic of
Zimbabwe to help finance a Small Farm Credit Project. The credit would be
on standard IDA terms. Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) is expected to
provide a loan of US$4.0 million for 30 years, including a 10-year grace
period, at an interest rate of 2 percent. The IDA credit and KfW loan
would be passed on by the Government to the Agricultural Finance Corpora-
tion (AFC) as fixed capital in the form of irredeemable loans.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A first Bank economic mission to independent Zimbabwe visited the
country in September 1980. A Country Economic Memorandum (Report Number
3234-ZIM) was distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1981. This
description is based on that memorandum and on information obtained on sub-
sequent missions.
3.        Zimbabwe is a landlocked country of about 390,000 sq ki, bordered
by Mozambique on the east, Botswana on the southwest and Zambia on the
northwest. The population as of December 1981, was estimated to be
7.7 million, 97 percent of whom were Africans. 1 The remainder consisted
of about 170,000 Europeans, 10,000 Asians and 23,000 people of mixed
origin. The growth rate of the African population is estimated to be about
3.5 percent per year. The number of Europeans has been declining due to
emigration, which has recently been occurring at an average rate of about
1,700 persons per month. According to estimates based on pre-war data,
20 percent of the population is urban; but this is almost certain to under-
state the present extent of urbanization.
*           4.         In 1980, per capita income was Z$470 (US$630, using the World
Bank Atlas methodology). Estimates for 1981 suggest that real per capita
income grew at about 4.6 percent, giving a 1981 figure of slightly under
Z$500 per person.  In spite of this good growth performance, distribution
of income and assets between Africans and non-Africans remains highly
I The Government of Zimbabwe's nomenclature for population divisions is
used throughout.  The first census since 1969 is scheduled for late 1982.



--.2-
si_wea             f .     icunre Act of I 969 updated legislation of the 1930s and
corfirmed          of tohe cou ntry's total land area into roughly two equal
parts for European and African settlement, the Europeans possessing most of
the best land.  Given the difference between the size of the two groups,
the division resulted in an allocation at independence of approximately
2.5 ha per African and 6'5.2 ha per non-African.  The degree of disparity
will begin to change now that majority rule has been achieved, but similar
disparities exlst in the distribution of other productive assets and in-
come. Rough estimates made in l979 of the differences in per capita income
suggest that the average per capita income for Africans was about Z$110
(US$175}, compared with roughly Z$5,500 (US$9,000) for non-Africans.
5.        It was to protect the Europeans' privileged position that
Rhodesia made its illegal Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in
1965 which was foilowed by economic sanctions and, beginning in 1973, a
costly -war. The sanctions were only partly effective. Between 1965, when
they began, and 1974, reat GDP grew at about 7 percent per year and per
capita income at about 3.5 percent.  Exports expanded, enhancing the coun-
try's ability to import. Notably, the sanctions stimulated development of
local import substitution capacity, so that by 1979 consumer goods were
only about 10 percent of total imports, compared with 22 percent in 1964.
Sanctions also encouraged the diversification of commercial agriculture and
the rapid growth of investment in and exports from the mining sector.
6.        However, the economic situatiorn changed for the worse between
1975 and 1979. The effect of the war on top of increases in oil prices and
two droughts caused economic activity to decline, so that per capita income
in real terms fell by 35 percent to its 1965 level. While the value of ex-
ports rose slightly even during this period, the dramatic increase in the
cost o' imports, in particular oil, caused the volume of imports to fall
precipitously. Real investment and formal employment also declined signi-
ficantly.
7.        Despite these setbacks, the new Government inherited a well-
diversified economy with good potential for growth. Agriculture, manufact-
uring and mining are all important, contributing 14 percent, 8 percent, and
24 percent, respectively, of GDP in 1980. Together these sectors provide
52 percent of total formal employment. Agriculture accounts for about
300,000 jobs, or 35 percent of the total; manufacturing for 167,000 jobs
and mining for 70,000. Most of the remaining formal employment is provided
by service sectors such as public administration, education and, in parti-
cular, domestic service.  Mining and agriculture earn significant amounts
of foreign exchange and supply most inputs for manufacturing, which in turn
accounts for slightly over 30 percent of Zimbabwe's merchandise exports,
mainly processed agricultural and mineral items.
8.        Since independence, the economy has rebounded strongly.  Resump-
tion of normal economic activity has been accompanied by an improvement in
the terms of trade and expansion of external borrowing. Imports increased



by 40 percent in 1980 and by 23 percent in 1981, facilitating increases in
capacity utilization. Growth was extremely strong in agriculture, which
benefitted from good weather. Consequently, overall real growth of the
economy was about 8 to 10 percent in 1980. Early estimates suggest a rate
of seven to nine percent for 1981.
9.        Some short- and long-run problems must be addressed if the coun-
try is to achieve more equitably distributed growth. The major short-run
problem is controlling domestic demand so as to reduce inflation (currently
about 15 percent per year). Some needed policies are already being imple-
mented. Sales and import taxes and interest rates have all been raised.
The rate of expansion of the money supply was reduced from 22 percent in
1980 to 15 percent in 1981. The overall budget deficit as a percent of GDP
has declined from its high of 14 percent in 1979/80. However, further re-
ductions must be accomplished during the current (1982/83) budgetary exer-
cise if stabilization efforts are to fully succeed. Significant longer-
term problems concern the need to increase the level and quality of invest-
ment, to expand domestic savings, and to adopt a wage policy consistent
with the need to increase employment. Although these issues are inter-
related, the Government recognizes that increasing employment and labor
productivity are key to achieving its aim of growth with equity. Unfortun-
ately, the recent increase in wage minima, the third such increase since
independence, and the announcement that further revisions are likely, is
inconsistent with the employment goal. Should further wage increments be
decreed before an appropriate lapse of time, it is clear that upward ad-
justments in prices and devaluation of the exchange rate will be needed.
10.       Should Government effectively deal with the abovementioned prob-
lems, prospects for respectable growth and more equitable distribution of
Income are quite good. Real increments in GDP could well average 5.5 per-
cent per year in 1980-85. Thereafter, growth could slow, perhaps, to an
average of four percent per year, as investments are made in longer-
gestating projects which more evenly distribute assets. Much of the burden
of achieving these growth and equity goals must fall on the agricultural
sector.  In the past, the commercial farms accounted for most agricultural
production. However, the development of smallholder agriculture now has
been assigned the highest priority.
11.       Zimbabwe emerged from 15 years of sanctions and the war with
relatively low external indebtedness. In September 1981, foreign debt
totalled Z$493 million (US$715 million equivalent) and the country-s gross
international reserves equalled about Z$150 million, or an estimated two
months of imports. The external debt figure was equivalent to US$90 per
capita or about 15 percent of estimated GDP. The debt service ratio, which
was about four percent in 1980, is projected to rise to 7 and 15 percent in
1981 and 1982, respectively. This rapid rise reflects the fact that nearly
all Zimbabwe's present debt must be repaid in the next six years. However,
so long as the country avoids recourse to large amounts of short-term com-
mercial borrowing, the debt service ratios should begin to decline after
1984, even with large amounts of additional external borrowing. In light



- 4 -
of this and the country's potential for growth and expansion, Zimbabwe is
clearly creditworthy for Bank lending. However, given the country s mas-
sive external resource requirements for the next few years and the expected
high level of international interest rates and relatively hard repayment
terms of non-concessionary borrowing, it is clear that Zimbabwe needs to
receive part of its external assistance on concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       Before 1965, the Bank made five loans totalling US$140.3 million                1'
benefitting Rhodesia -- two directly to the Government for agriculture
(US$5.6 million) and power (US$28.0 million), two loans totalling
US$87.7 million to the Central African Power Corporation (CAPCO), and a
US$19.0 million loan to the Rhodesia Railways. As a guarantor of each of
the loans, the United Kingdom serviced them after 1964. The loans for
agriculture and railways have been repaid, and CAPCO resumed servicing its
two loans after the lifting of sanctions on December 21, 1979. During
FY81, the Bank and the Association approved a loan of US$50 million and a
credit of US$15 million to Zimbabwe for the Manufacturing Rehabilitation
Imports Program. The loan (1959-ZIM) and the credit (1120-ZIM) financed
priority import requirements of raw materials, spare parts, and components
and balancing equipment needed to utilize idle capacity in the manufactur-
ing sector. The Bank also approved a loan (1944-ZIM) of US$42 million to
finance import requirements of spare parts, track maintenance equipment and
toels for the rail way;, equipment for the Central Mechanical Equipment
Department and technical assistance.
13.       IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, approved by its Board in
March 1981, was in the Wankie Colliery Company Limited, to help finance a
project for producing coal for a thermal power station, now being construc-
ted, and for other uses. The investment was in the form of a US$38 million
loan (552-ZIM), of which US$20 million was for IFC's own account and
US$18 million comprised commercial bank participation in the loan. IFC was
also responsible for arranging a further US$10.3 million of commercial bank
financing related to a proposed loan by the Export-Import Bank of the
United States (Eximbank). Annex II contains a stummary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of June 30, 1982, and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects.
14.       The Bank is helping identify and prepare projects in power, rail-
ways development, manpower development and training, agriculture, forestry,
rural development, industrial intermediation and technical assistance in
petroleum supply. A power project, appraised November 1981, would enhance
power generating capacity through a Phase II extension of Wankie Thermal
Power Station. A project to support rural afforestation was appraised in
May 1982. A proposed Highway project, which was appraised in February
1982, includes constructing 600 km of rural roads in the Communal Areas,
plus a pilot feeder-road program. The Bank also has reviewed the energy,



urban, education and manpower and telecommunications sectors, and sector
memoranda are under preparation. Recent Bank missions have reviewed the
agriculture and population, health and nutrition sectors and identified
possible Bank assistance for agricultural planning. Disbursements in
Zimbabwe have kept to schedule.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Introduction
15.       Zimbabwe has a land area of about 39 million ha.  The main topo-
graphic areas are: (i) the highveld, a plateau at about 1,300 m running
through the center of the country from southwest to northeast; (ii) the
middleveld, at about 900 m, on either side of the highveld; (iii) the low-
veld, at about 500 m, in the southeast and northwest corners of the coun-
try; and (iv) a high altitude ridge along the eastern border with
Mozambique. Summers are warm and wet, and winters cold and dry. Annual
rainfall is between 300 mm and 1,000 mm. Barely one-third of the country
is suitable for rainfed crops, the drier areas being suited only to ranch-
ing.
16.       Engaged in agriculture are:
(a) 5,800 commercial farmers on 15 million ha
under freehold title, including a small number
of large irrigated estates;
(b) 8,500 farmers on 1.5 million ha in the African
Purchase Areas under tenancy or freehold
titles; and
(c) 660,000 farm families on 16 million ha in the
Communal Areas, with traditional land tenure
rights allocated under the hereditary chiefs.
Performance
17.       Agriculture contributed an estimated 18 percent of GDP in 1981,
with production valued at US$1,070 million (Z$738 million) and exports at
US$605 million (Z$420 million), consituting 47 percent of total exports.
Agriculture, therefore, is of major importance as a source of foreign ex-
change. Most production comes from the commercial farms. The Communal
Areas are responsible for only about 20 percent of total production, little
of which finds its way into official markets and exports. In recent years
most Communal Areas have not even been self-sufficient in food. About
75 percent of the population are dependent for their income on agriculture,
which provides about a third of all formal employment opportunities.



-6-
Communal Areas
18.       The Communal Areas are the main target of the Small Farm Credit
Scheme (SFCS) organized by the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC).
About 57 percent of the total population derive their livelihood from these
areas, most of which have limited agricultural potential. Women are re-
sponsible for 70 percent of farm work, and, in effect, are often heads of
households, as many of the men live and work in urban areas. Including the
men's remittances, average per capita income in the Communal Areas is about
US$68. Infrastructure and services, such as input delivery systems, stor-
age and marketing facilities, and roads and rail transport, which have been
designed primarily for the large commercial farmer, are now being extended                V
to the Communal Areas. Intensified agriculture is possible in those Com-
munal Areas with better rainfall, and will be supported by credit. There
is a need for strong adaptive research, especially in the drier areas, and
improved marketing services and transport.
African Purchase Areas
19.       Special areas to be set aside for purchase by African farmers
were introduced in 1931. There are now about 8,500 farms in the African
Purchase Areas (APAs) -- which are in the process of being renamed -- with
an average size of 120 ha. They have not so far achieved the high levels
of productivity and employment of the commercial sector, but are a source
of indigenous expertise in commercial farming, which the Government intends
to foster alongside the proposed settlement programs.
Settlement
20.       Zimbabwe is one of the few countries in Eastern Africa that con-
sistently produces a food surplus. Agricultural productivity is achieved
mostly by the commercial farms, especially a small productive core consist-
ing of irrigated estates and the more efficient maize and tobacco farms.
Outside this core, a substantial area of underutilized and abandoned land
exists in the commercial sector. This is being absorbed by a new settle-
ment program which is providing plots, capable of supporting an annual in-
come of about US$725, to the landless and those with insufficient land in
the Communal Areas. Farm sizes will range from 25-200 ha. Communal culti-
vation will be encouraged, but will not be compulsory.  However, the rate
of settlement, even on a massive scale, would barely keep up with popula-
tion growth, and must be combined with other measures to alleviate the
problem of low incomes and over-cultivation in the Communal Areas.
Government Strategy
21.       The Government's strategy in agriculture aims at growth with
equity, and includes a wide range of objectives, perhaps not all mutually
consistent: fair distribution of land ownership, reduced poverty in rural
areas, increased productivity and employment, maintenance of national food
self-sufficiency, increased exports, land conservation, regional balance in



- 7 -
development, and the development of human resources. The Government ex-
pects to define its priorities and formulate a corresponding program as a
result of ongoing work, including the Provisional Three-Year Development
Plan (1982-85) and a special agricultural commission. Provision of credit
is given high priority for increasing small farmer productivity.
Agricultural Services and Support
22.       Research.  Excellent research has been carried out for commercial
farming, but has been limited in the Communal Areas. In the higher rain-
fall zones of the Communal Areas, where much of the project lending would
take place, the bias is less serious because the results of commercial farm
research can be adapted. In drier areas, lack of appropriate research is
more serious, and a number of donors are now interested in providing fin-
ance for this.
23.       Extension.  Extension services -- especially for the poorer
farmers -- are expected to improve gradually under a program to be funded
by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). As the pro-
posed Small Farm Credit Project is for creditworthy farmers, extension is
unlikely to be a major constraint. While the ratio of extension staff to
farmers averages about 1:800 nationally, in the better farming areas it is
below 1:400. Extension staff are generally well trained and respected by
farmers.
24.       Institutions.  Agriculture is served by a number of efficient
marketing boards. Their services have in the past been biased towards the
commercial sector. These are now being reoriented towards the small farmer
and farmer cooperatives, and marketing constraints are likely to diminish.
25.       The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the Ministry of Lands, Re-
settlement and Rural Development (MLRRD) are responsible for agricultural
development. Until recently, MOA mainly served the commercial farms and
had little responsibility for the Communal Areas, but the recent transfer
of extension services for these areas to it from MLRRD is expected to be
consolidated during the proposed project. The Ministry of Agriculture is
also responsible for the the Agricultural Finance Corporation. The Minis-
try of Agriculture is very competent technically, but its planning capabil-
ity needs strengthening.  The Bank has identified a technical assistance
project which would improve agricultural planning and address MOA's man-
power constraints.
26.       Agricultural Credit.  Agricultural credit in Zimbabwe has been
channelled through a variety of institutions. Seasonal loans, hire-
purchase and lease-hire facilities are extended to farmers by the commer-
cial banks and other financial institutions. Until recently, however,
these facilities have been virtually confined to the large-scale commercial
producers. Provision of finance for the small farmer is now being under-
taken by the Agricultural Finance Corporation. Mission organizations, sup-
pliers of inputs and manufacturers also have extended credit to small-scale
farmers. Among the private and religious organizations which have promoted
loan and development schemes, the most noteworthy is Silveira House, a



-  -
Catholic mission organization, wlich achieved repayment levels close to
100 percent except during the worst period of the war. For more than 15
years, savings clubs have been prominent among smallholders, and, since the
end of the war, the number of clubs has increased sharply. The clubs are
informal and voluntary with membership ranging from about 10 to 40 persons,
including many women. They rarely advance credit, so the provision of of-
ficial credit through AFC is unlikely to compete with them.
The Agricultural Finance Corporation
27.       The expansion of agricultural credit is being pursued through the
Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC), which makes credit available to in-
dividuals, groups, cooperatives and socleties for agricultural inputs.
Most of AFC's lending in the past was to large-scale commercial farmers,
but it is now playing an increasing role in official small-farm lending,
which began in 1978 when the Small Farm Credit Scheme (SFCS) was introduced
by AFC initially to serve the African Purchase Areas (APAs). In 1979, the
Government agreed that AFC should assist farmers in the Communal Areas and
finance a limited number of pilot schemes. The program has made rapid pro-
gress, and for 1981/82 an estimated US$16 million (Z$11 million) was lent
to about 30,000 Communal Area farmers, while 3,930 loans were made for the
same year to farmers in the Purchase Areas. AFC encourages small farmers
seeking seasonal loans to form groups of between 20 and 30, each electing
an executive committee. The result has been cost savings, better admin-
istration of loans and communication between lender and borrower, and en-
hanced communal spirit, control and discipline. To define its goals as it
expands into new forms of lending, AFC has prepared its first policy state-
ment, which was adopted by AFC-s Board in October 1981. The statement pro-
vides a good basis for AFC's future development, reflecting sound financial
policies and a balanced approach to small-farm lending. Therefore, assur-
ances have been obtained from AFC that the policy would not be changed
without agreement of the Association (draft Project Agreement, Section
2.11).
28.       Staffing.  AFC has a staff of more than 530, about half of whom
are employed by the Small Farm Credit Scheme (SFCS). Staff has doubled
since 1979, mainly to serve the SFCS. While AFC has coped well with the
rapid growth of small-farm lending, a substantial training program is need-
ed to help maintain standards. The Overseas Development Administration of
the United Kingdom has agreed to provide a senior training officer to AFC
to begin a training program for credit assistants, extension officers and
farmers, particularly group leaders.  There is also concern about a grad-
ually increasing loss of key AFC staff through emigration and attraction to
the better-paid private sector. This problem would be addressed by the
proposed project.
29.       AFC's Loan Repayment Record.  Despite farmers' difficulties with
marketing, the repayment rate for SFCS for the 1980/81 season had reached
70 percent by November 1981, with the prospect of further improvement dur-
ing subsequent months (repayment up to two years is allowed for seasonal
credit), but because of very dry weather during the 1981/82 season, a less



-9-
favorable repayment rate is expected. However, Zimbabwe's various farmer
credit schemes have generally had an outstanding repayment record. Some of
the staff of the SFCS have come from the African Loan and Development
Trust, which provided credit to Purchase Area farmers with a recovery rate
of more than 90 percent; and AFC is taking over former clients of Silveira
House (para. 26), which recovered virtually all its small farm loans
between 1971 and the intensification of the war in 1976.
er        30.       AFC's Financial Position.  AFC has a satisfactory capital struc-
ture, and its operations have been moderately profitable. At the end of
FY82, AFC's assets amounted to US$230 million equivalent, most of it fin-
anced by relatively low-interest loans from the Government and commercial
bank loans. In line with the method of capitalization for statutory bodies
in Zimbabwe, AFC does not have any share capital as such. The Government's
long-term funding has taken the form of irredeemable ("fixed capital")
loans with interest at rates fixed for such bodies. Thus AFC's capital
base consists of its general reserves and fixed capital loans, which to-
gether accounted for 54 percent of total resources at the end of FY82.
31.       Under its controlling legislation, AFC is expected to operate
without loss. It therefore charges interest to commercial farmers equal or
close to the prevailing commercial rate, while the administrative cost of
handling large loans and the risks of lending to financially-sound commer-
cial farmers are low. In contrast, small loans under the SFCS are costlier
to administer, and repayment prospects cannot be predicted with any cer-
tainty. However, the Government has undertaken, through legislation, to
compensate AFC for the total actual loss incurred annually on any scheme,
such as the SFCS, carried out at the Government-s behest.
Bank Strategy in the Sector
32.       The proposed project would be the Bank Group-s first in agricul-
ture in Zimbabwe. An outline of the sector's main issues is contained in
the Country Economic Memorandum. Bank support for transport, provided un-
der the US$42 million Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan of June
22, 1981 (Ln.1994-ZIM), will indirectly relieve the transport constraints
in the rural areas, and the proposed highway project (para. 14) would be
important in the medium term by constructing 600 km of state roads in the
Communal Areas.  The Bank-s agricultural strategy in Zimbabwe is taking
shape gradually. To pursue the Government's goal of growth with equity, a
major effort is being made in the Communal Areas, where most rural people
_W        live. Agricultural settlement on a substantial scale is necessary, but will
not be sufficient, to relieve population pressure. The Bank has therefore
been working with the Government to develop the present Small Farm Credit
Scheme for the more creditworthy farmers in the Communal Areas; a pilot
rural afforestation project, appraised in May, to reduce degradation and
provide fuelwood; and a technical assistance project to assist agricultural
planning. The Government has asked the Bank also to consider funding major
irrigation works. More recently, the Bank conducted an agricultural sector
study, the findings of which should be available soon.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
33.       The proposed project would be the Bank Group's first agricultural
operation in Zimbabwe. It was identified in late 1980 and early 1981 dur-
ing missions to prepare the Country Economic Memorandum. The project was
appraised in September 1981.  Negotiations took place in Washington, D.C.,
between July 26 and August 2, 1982. The Zimbabwean delegation was led by
Mr. Austin T. Copeland, Treasury Under Secretary. Annex III contains sup-
plementary project data.
Project Objective
34.       The project would improve the living standards and incomes of
farmers in Communal and Purchase Areas by financing farm inputs and im-
provements to intensify agricultural production. It would provide credit
mainly to farmers of above-average competence, and enable AFC to expand its
smallholder credit operations in 54 Communal Areas, which for many years
were generally starved of credit. AFC would be strengthened through provi-
sion of physical facilities and technical assistance. The project would
strengthen AFC's capacity at a crucial stage in AFC's expansion of small-
farm lending.
Project Description
35.       The project would, over three years, finance:
(i) seasonal credit for seed, fertilizer and chem-
icals;
(ii) medium-term credit for farm improvements,
equipment and other capital;
(iii) facilities for AFC, including additional of-
fice space, housing, vehicles and computer
equipment;
(iv) staff training and technical assistance; and
(v) monitoring and evaluation.
Detailed Features
36.       Seasonal Credit.  Seasonal credit would be provided to credit-
worthy farmers mainly for fertilizer and pesticides for cotton and maize.
It is estimated that such loans in the Communal Areas would increase from
33,000 in 1981/82 to about 60,000 in 1984/85 (the project's final year),
while the average size of loans would rise from US$483 to US$687. Total
value of loans to new Communal Area borrowers and financing of the



- 11 -
incremental requirements of AFC's present customers is estimated to be
US$24.8 million. The number of APA borrowers is expected to increase from
3,930 to 5,300, and the cost of meeting Purchase Area farmers- new and in-
cremental needs is estimated at US$7.3 million.
37.       Medium-term Credit.  Medium-term credit for up to five years
would be provided to farmers in Communal Areas and Purchase Areas for pur-
chasing fencing, farm implements, ox carts (and, in special cases, draught
oxen) and trailers, and for drilling boreholes and wells. APA farmers
would also be allowed credit for tractors. Communal Area farmers borrowing
for the first time would be made loans to the value of the items but,
thereafter, would have to make a substantial contribution from their own
resources. Purchase Area farmers would contribute an estimated 25 percent
of the required investment. Medium-term loans totalling about US$3.8 mil-
lion would be made to some 12,200 Communal Area farmers, and similar loans
totalling about US$5.3 million (or US$7.1 million including the farmers'
contribution) would be made to some 1,350 Purchase Area farmers, KfW help-
ing to finance the latter.
38.       Services.  To support AFC's decentralization to deal with its ex-
panded small farm credit operations, the project would provide for nine
district offices and ten houses costing US$438,000, besides office furni-
ture and equipment costing US$280,000 and 52 vehicles, motorcycles and bi-
cycles, costing US$432,000.
39.       Computer Consultants and Equipment.  AFC's lease of the computer
on which it keeps its accounts will expire in 1984. As the use of existing
facilities is expected to be fully extended by 1982/83, the project would
provide AFC with upgraded computer facilities, expected to cost US$580,000,
and technical assistance and consultancies, at a cost of US$435,000, to en-
sure efficient utilization of equipment.
40.       Technical Assistance and Training.  To ensure adequate staffing
for AFC, US$580,000 would be provided in the project to finance, if neces-
sary, internationally-recruited appointments to key positions, including
those of General Manager, Deputy General Manager and Assistant General Man-
ager for SFCS. The Government and AFC would consult with IDA on new ap-
pointments to key positions (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section
3.05(a) and draft Project Agreement, Section 2.05); and AFC would review
its staff compensation annually to ensure its competitiveness (draft Proj-
ect Agreement, Section 3.03). To support training, which would be planned
and initiated by the ODA specialist (para. 28), the project would provide
US$435,000.
Project Costs and Financing
41.       Total project costs, including contingencies, are estimated to be
US$47.3 million, of which US$26.2 million represents foreign exchange
costs. Besides the IDA credit of US$30.4 million, Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW) would make a loan of US$4.0 million equivalent for 30



- 12 -
years, including 10 years' grace, at an interest rate of 2 percent. The
IDA credit and KfW loan would finance 73 percent of total project costs,
including all the foreign exchange costs and US$8.2 million equivalent of
local costs. The Government (US$11.1 million equivalent net of taxes and
duties) and farmers contributions (US$1.8 million equivalent) would pro-
vide the remainder of the local costs. Project costs have been estimated
on the basis of April 1982 prices. Physical contingencies of 10 percent
have been included in all costs except agricultural credit, computer con-
sultants and expatriate staff.  Price contingencies on buildings allow for
a 40 percent increase in 1982-83 and 30 percent in each of the next two
years, reflecting high building costs in the current boom. On all other
items, except agricultural credit, price contingencies allow for increases
of 15 percent in 1982/83, 12 percent in 1983/84 and 9 percent in 1984/85
for local costs, and 8 percent in 1982/83 and 1983/84 and 7.5 percent
thereafter for foreign exchange costs. The Government would make timely
allocation of foreign exchange to support the demand for seasonal inputs
(draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.03). Project costs are sum-
marized in the Credit and Project Summary.
Project Implementation
42.       The project would be implemented by the Agricultural Finance Cor-
poration whose policies and operations are described in paras. 27 to 31.
Interest Rates
43.       AFC would charge its borrowers interest at or above the prime
commercial lending rate (at present 13 percent, compared with the current
inflation rate of about 15 percent) for all medium-term lending and for
seasonal lending in the Purchase Areas. Communal Area farmers receiving
seasonal loans would be charged interest at four and two percentage points
below the prime rate in the first and second project years, respectively,
and at not less than the prime rate afterwards (draft Project Agreement,
Schedule 2(A), and draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.02(a)). A
condition of effectiveness is the prior announcement by the Government of
the interest rates to apply in the first year of the project and of the
intended increase in the subsequent years (draft Development Credit Agree-
ment, Section 5.01(b)). The interest rates would be reviewed annually by
the Government and IDA (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section
3.02(b)).
Credit Proceeds
44.       To strengthen AFC's capital base, the IDA credit, the KfW loan
and the Government's contribution would be onlent to AFC as irredeemable,
fixed capital loans, which would be consistent with the Government-s method
of capitalizing statutory bodies (para. 30). The interest rate would be
that prevailing for such loans, currently 9.5 percent. Agreement between
the Government and AFC on on-lending arrangements satisfactory to IDA is a
condition of effectiveness (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section



-13 -
5.01(a)). AFC would establish a revolving fund with the project funds to
finance provision of credit in the Communal and Purchase Areas. To assist
planning and control of SFCS operations, AFC would prepare each year
advance estimates of revenues and expenses (including reasonable estimates
of administrative expenses and provision for bad debts) to forecast the
annual susbidy. The Government and the Association would review the
reasons for any subsidy payable in excess of the forecast (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.01(c)).
Project Staffing
r         45.       The project would provide for 60 man-months of internationally-
recruited staff time if AFC were to lose key management staff. The average
cost of US$9,670 per man-month, including salary, benefits and internation-
al travel, is three or four times the cost of staff recruited locally,
hence the need for AFC to do all it can to retain staff. For the efficient
operation of AFC-s expanded computer capacity (para. 39), the project would
provide for 43 man-months of consulting services at an average cost of
US$10,000 per man-month, excluding travel and subsistence. Appointment of
consultants would be according to Bank guidelines.
Monitoring and Evaluation.
46.       Monitoring and evaluation would be carried out by AFC with the
assistance of another organization, probably the Ministry of Agriculture or
the University of Zimbabwe. The latter is already conducting farm surveys
in two project areas, including some evaluation of credit impact. Cost of
this component is estimated at US$178,000. AFC would prepare a Project
Completion Report.
Procurement
47.       The relatively small and varied items to be financed by loans to
farmers (totalling about US$43.0 million) would not warrant international
competitive bidding. Farmers would place group orders for seasonal inputs
on a local competitive basis from preferred local and locally-based foreign
suppliers, AFC helping with the documentation. Offices and houses
(US$700,000) and furniture and office equipment (US$420,000) would be pro-
cured through local competitive bidding.  Orders for AFC vehicles would be
bulked as far as practicable and orders of US$100,000 and above procured
through international competitive bidding. Procurement procedures for
computer equipment (about US$690,000) would be agreed with the Association
after it has reviewed the recommendations of consultants recently recruited
by AFC to advise on computer upgrading and procurement (draft Project
Agreement, Schedule 1, C5). Contracts for works and goods of US$50,000 and
above would be awarded after the Association-s review of procurement docu-
mentation. Consultants would be employed in accordance with Bank guide-
lines. The Association would review procurement procedures which AFC is
preparing for its operations in general. Their completion to the satisfac-
tion of the Association would be a condition of disbursement against



- 14 -
procurement of buildings, vehicles, office equipment and furniture (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Schedule 1, para. 4(b)).
Disbursement
48.       Disbursements would be on the basis of:
(a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for tech-
nical assistance (consultants and expatriate
staff);
(b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures or 75 per-                             V
cent of local expenditure for vehicles and
computer equipment;
(c) 75 percent of incremental disbursement of
seasonal loans;
(d) 75 percent of local expenditures for build-
ings, office equipment, training and monitor-
ing and evaluation; and
(e) 85 percent of medium-term loans to Communal
Area farmers.
Disbursements for seasonal and medium-term loans would be against state-
ments of expenditure certified by the general manager of AFC. Disburse-
ments for buildings, vehicles, office and computer equipment, training,
monitoring and evaluation and technical assistance would be fully docu-
mented. Retroactive financing may be provided, as from April 1, 1982, for
seasonal credit, to a maximum of US$3.0 million. This is proposed because
farmers' purchase of seasonal inputs mostly takes place from about April
through September for the start of the planting in October, while AFC does
not at present have uncommitted funds to expand its small farm credit.
Without retroactive financing, seasonal lending for 1982/83 is likely to be
restricted to 70 percent of the planned level, which could deny credit to
some 4,000 farmers in the Communal Areas.
Audit and Accounts
49.       AFC's accounts are at present audited by the Harare office of
Deloitte, Haskins and Sells, who are satisfactory to IDA. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that AFC continue to appoint independent auditors
acceptable to the Association and that the audited accounts and auditor's
report be submitted to the Association within six months of the end of
AFC's fiscal year. The auditors would be requested to make specific
reference in their report to the reviews of documents supporting the state-
ments of expenditures for farmers' loans, training and monitoring and eval-
uation, and certify that the documents are in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the credit.



- 15 -
Environmental Impact
50.       Land degradation from overgrazing and deforestation is unlikely
to be made worse by the project, as the land affected in the Communal Areas
is being used mainly for cropping. However, erosion and indiscriminate use
of pesticides are potential problems, and measures to deal with them may be
supported by an extension project being prepared by IFAD, and by the Bank's
recently appraised Rural Afforestation Program.
Justification and Beneficiaries
51.       The project would provide financial and technical assistance to
AFC during a crucial phase in the expansion of its credit activity among
small farmers. As a result, the proportion of Communal Area farmers parti-
cipating in AFC's credit schemes would increase from 5 to 10 percent. The
project would directly benefit about 27,000 families in the Communal Areas
who cultivate an average 2 or 3 ha, and 4,000 families (including labor) in
the Purchase Areas on farms of between 20 and 800 ha. Although the project
does not focus on the poorest, who would be best helped through intensive
rural development programs, the net farm income of prospective borrowers in
the Communal Areas is expected to be in the range of US$200 to US$280 equi-
valent per family before credit, which is close to subsistence level. The
loans to farmers are expected to increase production and incomes, although
the project's success depends essentially on the ability of AFC to make
sound lending decisions. AFC has proved its competence, and would continue
to monitor, on a financial and economic basis, selected lending models to
help ensure sound lending policies.
Risks
52.       A major project risk is a worsening of transportation required
for marketing and input supply. There was a widespread failure to collect
crops until late in the season during the bumper harvest of 1980/81 because
of poor roads, limited marketing facilities and road transport and problems
experienced by the railways (partly the result of withdrawal of locomotives
by South Africa, which are now in commission again). The Government is
giving urgent attention to the transportation problem, and the Bank is con-
sidering extending the assistance it has already provided for the rail-
C         ways.  It is also considering a highway project which would build 600 km of
roads in the Communal Areas. To provide direct, immediate assistance to
the Communal Areas, the Government, with USAID assistance, is helping
farmers' cooperatives increase the number of distribution points.  Other
risks would include a loss of senior AFC staff and a weakening of AFC's
performance and credit repayment record caused by the rapid expansion of
smallholder lending. However, AFC has coped well with the expansion of
credit over the past three years, the repayment record has remained sound,
and the project would finance replacements for key departing staff.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Zimbabwe and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Asso-
ciation and the Agricultural Finance Corporation, and the recommendation of
the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Association are being distributed to the Executive Direc-
tors separately.                                                                           *
54.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.  Special conditions of effectiveness are execution of a
satisfactory subsidiary agreement between Government and AFC; and
announcement by Government of interest rates to be charged to farmers.
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. STATUS OF BANK AND IDA PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
as of July 31, 1982
Loan No. 1959-ZIM    Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$50
Credit No. 1120-ZIM million and US$15 million, respectively, of April 9,
1981; Effectiveness Date: April 9, 1981; Closing
Date: March 31, 1982
The loan and credit have financed priority import requirements of
raw materials, spare parts, components and balancing equipment needed to
utilize idle capacity in the manufacturing sector. The program is being
implemented by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The loan and credit are
already fully disbursed. It is too early to assess the full impact of the
loan and credit, nevertheless, during the loan and credit period,
manufactured output increased by almost 10 percent. However, because of a
shortfall in the availability of foreign exchange, full reconstruction of
the sector is unlikely to be achieved. Therefore, a second program-type
lending operation aimed at export promotion is under preparation.
Loan No. 1994-ZIM    Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$42 mil-
lion, of June 22, 1981; Effectiveness Date: June 26,
1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan is providing
for locomotive and wagon spare parts, electrical spare parts, general spare
parts, machines and tools, signalling equipment, service vehicles, track
tools and equipment, and technical assistance for the National Railways of
Zimbabwe and the Central Mechanical Equipment Department. The departure
rate of skilled staff has increased far beyond the level expected at loan
appraisal, resulting in additional need for technical assistance. Conse-
quently, in addition to the US$6.8 million for technical assistance estim-
ated at loan appraisal, another US$7.1 million has been reallocated to that
category. Since NRZ anticipates a considerable long-term technical assist-
ance requirement from 1984 onward, a special railway technical assistance
and training project, for which Bank assistance has been requested, is
under preparation.

(As of June 30, 1982)
r             Wankie Colliery Company, Limited (WCCL)            552-ZIM
IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, a loan of US$38 million
(gross) together with US$10 million arranged by IFC to cover the medium-
term maturities on an EximBank package, helped finance a US$191 million ex-
pansion of WCCL's coal mining operations, principally to supply a thermal
power plant. The financial plan included US$51 million of cash generation
and US$14 million to be raised by a rights offering. In the renegotiation
of the Coal Pricing Agreement, Government reconfirmed its commitment to the
Wankie project and its support for the company-s financial commitments un-
der the IFC Investment Agreement. Specifically, as Wankie may not be able
to have a successful rights offering in the current stock market environ-
ment, Government is now negotiating with the company the terms of an equity
investment to replace the rights issue.
The Company requested a second disbursement which was made on
March 10, 1982. As a result, the company has now drawn US$8.0 million of
the US$20.0 million "A' loan from IFC and US$7.2 million of the US$18 mil-
lion "B" loan from participants.
