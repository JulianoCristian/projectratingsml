improvement in the supply and\n            distribution of electricity and petroleum products in the\n            main urban areas as well as to support economic recovery\n            beyond the short term.  To that end, the project consists of\n            rehabilitation of the Electricity Company of\n            Mozambique's (EDM) and National Petroleum Supply\n            Company's (PETROMOC) facilities to meet current demands\n            reliably; (ii) provision of operational support for three\n            years and (iii) technical assistance to EMDM, PETROMOC, the\n            Ministry of Industry and Energy (MIE) and the National\n            Hydrocarbons Company (ENH).  The economic benefits from the\n            project would be increased agroindustrial and industrial\n            production through quick-acting relief on constraints on\n            improving the reiliability of electricity and petroleum\n            product supply to processing and manufacturing plants."}, "docdt": "1987-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
