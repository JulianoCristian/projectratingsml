PROJECT FOCUS, DESIGN AND RATIONALE
The Bank has played a catalytic role in the establishment and
growth of the Development Bank of Western Samoa (DBWS) by providing four
advisory and operational technical. assistance grants and as many loans.
DBWS has evolved into a significant national institution since its
establishment in October 1974 and has played a key role in financing
development activities in Western Samoa.
DBWS accounted for 18 per cent of the outstanding loans of all
financial institutions in Western Samoa as of 30 September 1983. DBWS
has provided 80 per cent of the total loans extended to the agricultural
sector by all financial institutions in Western Samoa during 1974-1983.
DBWS's operations in the agricultural sector have helped increase food
production and reduced the import of some food items such as fish and
seat. In addition, DBWS has played an active role in promoting
industrial projects. Being the only DFI in the country, DBWS is
expected to continue to play an essential role in economic development.
It will help in the implementation of the Fifth Five-Year Development
lamn (1985-1989), now being formulated. Fixed capital outlays for the
agricultural and industrial sectors are expected to be between WS$40
million and WSS50 million per annum during 1985-1987.
To date, the Bank has provided four loans totalling US$12
million for utilization by DEWS. The economic development of Western
Samoa will be further supported by the proposed fifth Bank loan of US$4
million to DBWS for sublending to economically and financially viable
projects in line with Government policy. The augmentation of DBWS's
foreign currency resources will enable it to meet the foreign exchange
requirements of investment projects during 1985-1987.
The Bank's previous loans were given to DBWS as general credit
lines and have been satisfactorily utilized. The proposed fifth Bank
loan is also designed as a general credit line which is considered
appropriate in the context of the Western Samoan economy. DBWS remains
a suitable vehicle for financing development projects in Western Samoa
and is capable of channelling the Bank's funds to prospective
sub-borrowers efficiently.
Further technical assistance for DBWS is also proposed with a
view to upgrading it institutionally in specific areas. UNDP has agreed
to provide US$50,000 towards the cost of the proposed technical
assistance for which a Bank grant of US$300,000 is proposed.
The beneficiaries of the proposed loan are expected to be
about 1,000 small subprojects. Considering the Government's priority to
increasing agricultural production for export and future prospects of
DBWS lending, 80 per cent of the proposed loan is likely to be utilized
by the industrial and agricultural sectors (40 per cent each), while 10
per cent each could be allocated to the group/village and service
settors. The total investment cost of the projects to be assisted by



the proposed Bank loan is estimated at US$7.5 million. In view of the
large number of small loans, it is difficult to quantify the exact
socio-economic benefits under the proposed loan; however, based on the
experience under previous Bank loans, projects under the proposed loan
are expected to create about 1,000 job opportunities and to earn or save
foreign exchange of about US$2.5 million per annum.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Bank has played an important role in the establishment and
subsequent growth of the Development Bank ?f Western Samoa (DBWS) by
providing four tech}cal assistance grants- totalling US$447,000 and four
Special Funds loans- totalling US$12.0 million. The technical assistance
projects have been successfully completed. The fourth technical assistance
grant fiuanced a study of DBWS's role and functions. The findings of this
study are reflected in this report. AlI four loans "ve been fully comuitted
and the first three loans have been fully disbursed.-  Of the fourth loan
of US$4.0 million, which became effective in May 1982, US$3.04 million was
disbursed as of 30 June 1984.
2.        In response to the request of the Government of Western Samoa for a
fifth loan of US$4.0 million for DBWS, an Appraisal Mission visited Western
Samoa from 23 July to 10 August 1984. It was composed of T. Mitchell,
(Financial Analyst) Mission Chief, 0. R. I. Bako (Senior Country Officer),
J. Boyd (Senior Counsel) and T. F. Choong (I*izancial Analyst). This Report
is based on the findings of th,e Mission.
1/   TA No. 80 for US$217,000 approved in January 1973;
TA No. 137 for US$90.000 approved in March 1975;
TA No. 185 for US$40,000 approved in December 1976; and
TA No. 590 for US$100,000 approved in March 1984.
2/   Loan No. 218 for US$1.0 million approved in March 1975;
Loan No. 287 for US$3.0 million approved In December 1976;
Loan No. 366 for US$4.0 million approved In November 1978; and
Loan No. 527 for US$4.0 million approved in September 1981.
3/   The Project Completion Reports on the first and second Bank loans
to DBWS were circulated to the Board in September 1980 (Doc. No.
148-80) and June 1984 (Doc. IN. 103-84) respectively.

II. BACKGROUND
A. The Economic Setting
3.        The economy of Western Samoa continues to have a dualistic
character with a large traditional agricultural subsistence sector
co-existing with a small but growing monetized one. With limited
natural resources. the country's development activities depend heavily
on imported goods and expertise. Its remoteness from major commercial
and industrial centers results in high costs of transportation for its
exports and imports. Despite these inherent weaknesses, the economy
made steady progress during the 1970s in various fields such as
infrastructure, manufacturing, energy, communications, rural development
and social services.
4.        However, the country's economic performance during 1980-1982
was discouraging. Its GDP declined bylan average of 5 per cent in real
terms during each of those three years- . Develqpments on the
external front have underscored the critical weakness in the balance of
payments. Imports, although declining, were allowed to exceed the
country's capacity to earn foreign exchange. Th' current account
deficit, excluding official transfers, amounted to about US$75 million
during 1980-1982, equivalent to 26 per cent of GDP. International
reserves became almost exhausted and external debt rose rapidly. The
country has substantial arrears of external payments. Domestically,
Western Samoa has had high rates of inflation. As a result, the
purchasing power of consumers has diminished and efforts to increase
exports have become more difficult.
5.        This deterioration in the economic situation stemmed from a
combination of factors including: (i) a decline in agricultural
productivity and sluggish growth of agricultural exports; (ii) a serious
worsening of the terms of trade, following a sharp fall in export
commodity prices of copra and cacao while import prices rose;
(iii) high levels of development expenditure and inadequate control and
monitoring of public expenditure, resulting in deficits in the
government's budget, compounded by growing deficits incurred by public
corporations; and (iv) excessive public sector borrowing from the
banking system, resulting in high growth in domestic credit and money
supply.
6.        In order to reverse these trends, the Government adopted a
stabilization program in February 1983 supported by a o B year standby
arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).-  The
1/  GDP, expressed in constant 1980 producer prices, was estimated at
WS$85.4 million in 1983. Of this amount, agriculture (including
forestry and fisheries) accounted for 49 per cent, industry
(manufacturing, construction, commerce and electricity) 21 per cent
and services (including public administration) 30 per cent.
2/   On 27 June 1983, IMF approved a one-year standby arrangement for
Western Samoa in the amount of SDR 3.375 million, and a purchase
equivalent of SDR 1.15 million under the compensatory financing
facility.



3
Government put through new revenue measures, curtailed government
expenditure, improved the financial performance of public enterprises,
raised interest rates (see para 13) and tightened credit policies. The
Western Samoan tala was depreciated in stages and stood as of 31 July
1984 at WS$2.10 to one US dollar compared with WS$1.24 tala in 1982 and
WS$0.91 in 1979. The policy changes, coupled with better export prices
in 1983, have resulted in an upturn in economic trends and the goals set
under the stabilization program were largely met. 1983 is expected to
register a growth in GDP of about 1 per cent. The Government budget
deficit (excluding foreign grants) was reduced from 23.2 per cent in
1982 to about 15.5 per cent of GDP in 1983, against the target of 14.7
per cent. Excluding official transfers, the current account deficit in
1983 was about US$12.4 million (13 per cent of GDP) against a target of
US$13 million and US$18 million in 1982. The overall balance of
payments showed a surplus of US$7.8 million in 1983, while the target
was to show a modest surplus. Inflation declined to an estimated 16.5
per cent in 1983 compared with 18.4 per cent in 1982 and 20.5 per cent
in 1981. External payments arrears were reduced from WS$15.0 million at
the end of 1982 to WS$7.0 million at the end of 1983.
7.        The IMF has agreed to a Government request for another standby
arrangement amounting to SDR 3.35 million to cover the period, July
1984-July 1985. The key targets of the stabilization program in 1984
are to reduce inflation. improve the balance-of-payments position
through export growth and increase the GDP growth rate.
B. Major Economic Sectors
1. Agriculture
8.        Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is estimated to
account f?y about 50 per cent of GDP and 80 per cent of export
receipts.-   In general, the agriculture sector has been beset by a
number of problems resulting in limited productivity and adverse
production trends. The problems range from the senescence of coconut
and cacao trees to inadequate measures to control diseases and pests.
The Government's remedial agricultural policies revolve around copra and
cacao price stabilization schemes, a suspensory loans scheme for
small-scale cacao plantations and a2yeforestation program.  The Bank-
financed Agricultural Sector Survey- is expected to have a significant
impact on the Government's policies in this sector.
2. Industry
9.        Manufacturing and agro-processing activities are centered
around Apia, the capital. They constitute a small but expanding sector,
1/   Total export receipts were estimated to amount to WS$25.6 million
in 1983. The major export commodities were copra and coconut oil,
accounting for 51 per cent, cacao, 16 per cent and taro, 11 per
cent.
2/   TA No. 586-SAM approved in February 1984.

accounting for about 7.5 per cent of GDP and 32 per cent of the
industrial sector in 1983. Manufacturing artivities are aimed basically
at import substitution but some gains have been made recently in exports
as well (garments, coconut oil and cream, beer, plywood aud cigarettes).
The industries cover food processing and consumer products, light
engineering and service enterprises. Major manufacturing projects that
have been established include an animal feed mill, an ice factory, a
cigay?tte factory, a plywood mill, a brewery and a copra crushing
mill- . The latter, which began operations in 1982, has contributed
significantly to the increased value of exports of coconut products.
The other major components of the industrial sector are construction
(about 4 per cent of GDP and 18 per cent of the industrial sector in
1983), commerce and tourism (6 per cent and 26 per cent) and transport
and storage (3 per cent and 14 per cent).
10.       The Government's policy is to encourage industrial development
through an Enterprises Incentive Act which was passed in 1965. However,
subsequent amendments to the Act may have been counter productive.
The Government needs to rationalize its industrial incentives system to
improve this sector's growth prospects (see para 30).
C. Financial Sector
11.       Western Samoa has a diversified structure of financial
institutions. Central monetary functions remained the responsibility of
the Bank of Western Samoa (BWS), until 1975 when a Monetary Board was
formed. With effect from 1 May 1984, Western Samoa established its own
Central Bank (CBS), which assumed the Monetary Board's functions. CBS
is responsible for the issuance of currency, management of external
resetves and for the regulation of banks and other financial
institutions. Its regulatory functions include controlling the money
supply and setting reserve requirements, interest rates and credit
ceilings. The country's monetary policies in 1983 and 1984 have been
tight in line with the stabilization program. There are two commercial
banks in Western Samoa, BWS and Pacific Commercial Bank (PCB). BWS,
established in 1959, is owned on a 50:50 basis by the Government and the
Bank of New Zealand. PCB, established in 1977, is owned by Westpac
Banking Corporation, Australia (40 per cent), the Bank of Hawaii (40 per
cent) and the National Provident Fund (NPF) and other Samoan interests
(20 per cent). The commercial banks provide the full range of banking
services. However, the amount of their term lending is not significant
and consists primarily of mortgages.
12.       The list of non-bank financial institutions includes, besides
DBWS, (i) NPF, which lends mainly for housing and to public sector
corporations; (ii) the Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) established at
the turn of the century, most of the assets of which are held in the
form of government securities; (iii) the Public Trust Office (PTO),
established after World War I to act as a public trustee for
dispossessed colonial estates, and is involved mainly in mortgage
lending; and (iv) the Western Samoa Life Assurance Corporation (WSLAC)
I/ Financed under a Bank loan of US$2.25 million (Loan No. 328(SF))
approved in December 1977.

established in 1977 to take over the operations of the New Zealand-based
Colonial Mutual Life Insurance Corporation. WSLAC has also been
involved in mortgage lending. Table 1 indicates the relative scale of
operations (domestic lending and investments) of the country's financial
institutions.

13.       The interest rate structure in Western Samoa is outlined in
Appendix 1. As part of the stabilization program, and to encourage a
higher level of savings, the Goverrnment raised commercial bank deposit
and lending rates with effect from February 7, 1983. Commercial bank
interest rates on time deposits now range from 14 per cent (on 3 month
deposits) to 17 per cent (on 12 month deposits) and the lending rates
from 14 per cent (for agriculture) to 19 per cent (for personal and
construction loans). DBWS's interest rates were not, however, changed
at that time and are presently below those of the commercial banks. The
present interest rate structure in the country is high compared with
those of other DMCs in the South Pacific.

III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A. Objective and Scope
14.       DBWS is by far the most important source of long-term
development funds in Western Samoa. The government expects DBWS to
continue to play an important role in the development of the country by
helping to promote and finance high-priority projects in the
agricultural and industrial sectors. Based on the estimated outlays
during 1980-1984, fixed capital outlays for these two sectors are
expected to be between WS$40 million and WS$50 million per annum during
1985-1987. The objective of the proposed Project is to provide DBWS
with financial and technical assistance to enable it to continue
fulfilling its role and enable it to finance a major portion of the
country's fixed capital requirements.
15.       A general credit line is envisaged as was the case under the
previous four Bank loans to DBWS. Most of the proposed loan would be
relent to small scale enterprises.
B. The Proposed Loan
1. Loan Amount, Borrower and Executing Agency
16.       On the basis of DBWS's estimated foreign currency requirements
of US$6.1 million during FY 1985-FY 19w1, it is proposed that a fifth
Bank loan of US$4.0 million equivalent-  be extended to the
Independent State of Western Samoa (the Borrower) for relending to DBWS
(Execying Agency) under a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the
Bank.-   The Loan is proposed to be made from the Special Fund ,
resources of the Bank under the standard terms and conditions.-
The Government has applied to IDA for a credit of US$2.0 million
equivalent for relending to DBWS. Once it is approved, it is expecced
that the Bank would act as Executing Agency ujer arrangements similar
to those agreed upon for the second Bank loan- to the Development
Bank of Solomon Islands, which was cofinanced by IDA. The Borrower will
bear the foreign exchange risk; for subloans exceeding US$0.2 million or
with a substantial foreign participaWon in the subprojects, the risk
may be passed on to the subborrower.-

2. Main Features
a. Purpose
17.       DBWS will use the proceeds of the proposed loan to make
subloans to finance the fof?ign exchange costs of specific development
projects in Western Samoa.-  The tentative sectoral allocation of the
proposed loan is: industry, 40 per cent; agriculture, 40 per cent;
grouplvillage projects, 10 per cent; and services including
transportation, 10 per cent (see Appendix 2). Within each sector, DBWS
will endeavor to make2 yubloans to smaller enterprises, particularly
those in rural areas.-   No subloans3 3Yll be made to finance the
construction or purchase of housing.-   The proceeds of the proposed
loan will not be used for making subloans to subprojects of 4 Lch DBWS
staff or members of its Board of Directors are beneficiaries.-
b. Utilization
i8.       The closing date for submission of subloan applications for
approval/authorization for withdrawal e ll be three years from the date
of effectiveness of the proposed loan.-   The closing date for
withdrawals6yill be one year after the closing date for subloan
submission.-
c. Amortization Schedule
19.       A fixed amortization schedule between the Borrower and DBWS
extending to 15 years including 8 years of grace period is proposed to
be maintained in view of the fact that: (i) the Government bears the
foreign exchange risk on the Bank's loans; (ii) DBWS's subscantial local
currency requirement over the projected period can largely be met by
recycling subloan repayments during the grace period; (iii) DBWS is
fully owned by the Government and is an integral element of its
development strategy, so that the benefit of a long grace period
accruing to DBWS would also indirectly accrue to the Government and the
country.   Subborrowers' repayment terms to DBWS will not exceed 15
years including three years of grace period except in the case of loans
for cacao, coconut, coffee or cattle projects, whose grace pyiods may
be up to five years because of their long gestation periods.-
d. Onlending Rate
20.       It is proposed that the Borrower's onlending rate to DBWS for
the proposed loan should be 6 per cent per annum as in previous loans.

8
The appropriateness of this onlending rate shall be reviewed by Oe
Borrower and DBWS in consultation with the Bank by 31 March 1986- .
e. Subloan Interest Rates
21.       DBWS's interest rate on subloans will be at least 10 per cent
for agricultural and group/village loans, and at least 16 per cent for
industrial and services sector loans. DBWS shall2ponsult the Bank prior
to effecting any changes in these interest rates.-
f. Free Limit
22.       Considering the size distribution of subloans under the fourth
Bank loan, the prevailing free li 1 t of US$50,000 is proposed to be
maintained for the proposed loan.-
g. Maximum Size of Subloans
23.       In order to ensure a wide and balanced distribution of
subloans, DBWS will use at least 60 per cent of the proposed loan to
make subloans amounting to US$0.2 million or less. Furthermore, DBWS
will not make any subloan in an amount exceedie US$0.4 million
equivalent except with the Bank's concurrence.-   DBWS's Policy
Statement restricts its maximum commitment in any enterprise to 20 per
cent of its equity; this limit amounted to about WS$0.98 million
(US$0.49 million equivalent) as of 31 August 1984.
h. Reimbursement of Expenditures
24.       Reimbursement of expenditures incurred up to 120 days prio
to the receipt of a subloan application by the Bank will be allowed,-
as under the previous four Bank loans.
i. Procurement
25.       DBWS will satisfy the Bank that the procurement piocedures
adopted by individual subborrowerg/under the proposed loan are
appropriate in the circumstances.-
j. Withdrawals
26.       The fourth Bank loan provided for withdrawal of 75 per cent of
the cost of "off-the-shelf" purchase of machinery and equipment as
indirect foreign exchange cost where procurement costs were less than
US$50,000 and when the foreign exchange cost could not be precisely
determined; 60 per cent of construction cost and 60 per cent of input
material cost during pre-production period for long-term tree crop
development projects 7/It is proposed to maintain these percentages in
the proposed Project.-

k. Data Monitoring
27.       DBWS will compile relevant socio-economic and financial
information for completed subprojects f?y which it has provided a loan
in excess of US$50,000 equivalent each.-
1. Quarterly Reparts
28.       DBWS will provide to the Bank quarterly reports giving details
on its operations, financial statements, resource position, arrears and
institutg7nal developments within three months after the end of each
quarter.-
C. The Proposed Technical Assistance
29.       The technical assistance the Bank previously extended to the
Government to establish DBWS provided basic institution-building and
management in its initial stage. While DBWS's institutional aspects are
generally satisfactory and its management is entirely localized, it is
considered that DBWS requires further technical assistance to upgrade
specific institutional aspects. The Government and DBWS have requested
advisory and operational technical assistance as follows: an Industrial
Sector Survey for the country and assistance in upgrading DBWS's
capabilities in project promotion, agricultural credit and accounting
and management information systems. The terms of reference for the
proposed technical assistance are given in Appendix 3.
30.       The Government's industrial incentives system requires
improvement. There is an Enterprises Incentive Act, but it was amended
in 1983 to allow for increases in taxes and duties under the
stabilization program, resulting in disincentives for investment.
Administrative procedures related to the incentive system are
cumbersome. In addition, industrial development in the country has
reached a point where priority sectors need to be identified. In order
to improve the situation, it is recommended that the Bank provide
technical assistance in the form of an Industrial Sector Survey. This
study would recommend ways of improving the existing legislative and
institutional framework affecting the promotion of industries in Western
Samoa and would indicate the directions in which promotion of industrial
projects should proceed. It is estimated that the Survey would require
the services of an Industrial Economist for three man-months.
31.       DBWS has a Research and Development Division (RDD) that, inter
alia, is responsible for promotional activities. Although the RDD has
made some useful market studies, up to now it has not been able to
undertake project promotion activities on a significant scale because of
a lack of expertise and shortage of staff. The Government has expressed
its intention to promote the establishment of import substitution and
export industries, particularly in the area of food processing, in order
to increase the country's self reliance. The Government envisages a
pivotal role for DBWS in promoting and financing such industries. Once
1/   Project Agreement, Schedule, paragraph 7.
2/   Project Agreement, Section 3.04(b).



10
the Industrial Sector Survey is completed, the Bank should provide.
technical assistance to improve DBWS's project promotion capabilities.
A Project Promotion Expert provided to DBWS would assist DBWS and local
entrepreneurs in promoting the projects identified in the Survey
and,more importantly, train DBWS staff in this area. It is estimated
that the services of a Project Promotion Expert would be required for
nine man-months.
32.       The main conclusion of the Bank Agricultural Sector Survey of
Western Samoa as regards DBWS is that DBWS needs to improve its approach
to agricultural lending. It tends to be scattered, making loan
supervision difficult and costly. DBWS's agricultural loan appraisal
procedures require streamlining and an appraisal manual for certain
types of agricultural projects is needed. DBWS wishes to receive
assistance towards realizing these objectives. It is recommended that
the Bank provide technical assistance to help DBWS in preparing and
implementing improved strategies for its lending to the agricultural
sector, streamlining its agricultural loan appraisal procedures and
advising DBWS on further assistance in the development of credit unions
(see para 49). Such technical assistance would require the services of
an Agricultural Credit Specialist for about six man-months of consulting
services.
33.       Lastly, it is recommended that technical assistance to upgrade
DBWS's accounting procedures and management information systems (MIS) be
provided also. Although DBWS's accounting and MIS are generally
adequate, the MIS needs to be rationalized and simplified and data
should be provided in a more timely manner (see para 62). In this
context, DBWS has experienced difficulties in computerization. It is
estimated that the technical assistance envisaged would require the
services of a Financial Accounting Expert with electronic data
processing expertise for six man-months.
34.        The proposed technical assistance is estimated to cost about
US$390,300, of which the foreign currency costs are estimated to be not
more than US$350,000 (see1&ppendix 4). UNDP has agreed to finance
US$50,000 of this amount.-   It is recommended that an amount of
US$300,000 be provided by the Bank on a grant basis. The technical
assistance budget of the Bank for Services to Member Countries can
accommodate this proposal (see Appendix 5). The Government and DBWS
have agreed that on their part they would meet local currency costs of
the technical assistance for providing secretarial services, domestic
transportation and other support. The Government has been apprised that
approval of the technical assistance does not commit the Bank to further
loan assistance.
35.       The Borrower would be the Executing Agency for the Industrial
Sector Survey, while DBWS would implement the other three components of
the proposed technical assistance. The components (except the project
promotion assistance) would begin simultaneously in the first half of
1985. For the Industrial Sector Survey, an interim report outlining the
direction and major findings of the study will be submitted to the
Government and the Bank within six weeks of the commencement of the
1/   It is proposed that the Bank will act as Executing Agency for
administering this contribution.



11
consulting services. A final draft report will be submitted to the
Government and the Bank for comment before finalization. The interim
and draft final reports will be reviewed by the Government and the Bank,
and a tripartite meeting with the consultants will be held if necessary.
After the parties have agreed on the conclusions of the Industrial
Sector Survey, the project promotion assistance would begin. The
consultants providing assistance for project promotion, agricultural
credit and accountiug/MIS would also be rcquired to submit draft final
reports for comment one month before the completion of their assignments
as well as quarterly progress reports.
D. Benefits and Risks
36.       The four previous Bank loans resulted in substantial economic
benefits to Western Samoa such as employment generation, development of
poorer., remote areas and foreign exchange savings. The subloans made
under the first Bank loan of US$1 million created employment for 248
persons and generated foreign exchange savings of WS$0.7 million per
annum. The PCR for the second Bank loan of US$3 million estimated that
the nine subprojects above the free limit generated about 300 jobs and
US$2.5 million in foreign exchange savings/earnings per annum. In
addition, there were non-quantifiable benefits such as development of
entrepreneurial skills and improving the literacy rate through financing
of construction of schools.  Similar types of benefits could be expected
under the proposed Project.
37.       The risks involved in the Project are considered minimal.
DBWS is a well established and experienced development bank with good
management and staff. DBWS's interest and debt-service coverage ratios
are projected to remain well above unity during 1984-1987 (see para 77).
Thus its operations and ability to service its financial obligations
would remain unimpaired. DBWS has also administered four bank loans
successfully and therefore should not encounter any problems in
channelling the proposed loan for the intended purposes. The Western
Samoa economy has begun to recover as a result of fiscal measures
enacted by the Government, the IMF standby arrangements and upturn in
the prices of some of the country's key export commodities. Against
this background, there should be an increasing demand for investment
funds including foreign exchange resources. Therefore, the proposed
loan is expected to be used as projected.
38.       The only possible risk associated with the Project is that if
DBWS's portfolio arrears position were to deteriorate, it could
jeopardize DBWS's financial soundness and impair its ability to continue
providing development assistance. However, the Mission found that the
level of DBWS's arrears appears to have stabilized (see para 73), and
DBWS is putting together a comprehensive arrears reduction program to be
approved by the Bank to address the problem. The upturn in the economy
should also have a salutary effect on the level of DBWS's arrears.
Interest rate incr e?ses agreed to by the Government as a condition of
loan effectiveness- are expected to restore DBWS's profitability.
No other problems could be identified which would entail constraints on
the successful execution of the Project.

IV. THE EXECUTING AGENCY
A. Organization and Management
1. History, Legal Framework, Share Capital
and Relationship with the Government
39.       Following Bank technical assistance, DBWS was established in
1974 as a statutory entity, wholly owned by the Government. The
authorized share capital of DBWS is WS$5 million against the paid-in
capital of WS$4.82 million as of 31 August 1984, which shows an increase
of WS$1.22 million since the last Bank loan was appraised.
40.       The Government and DBWS have a close working relationship.
The Government appoints all ten members of DBWS's Board of Directors,
the Chairman of which is the Minister of Finance. Three members of
DBWS's Boarl,represent the ministries most concerned with economic
development- and ensure that DBWS's operations are responsive to the
Government's development plans. The Government also provides
substantial financial support besides equity. Within this framework,
DBWS has operational autonomy.
2. Board of Directors, Organization and Management
41.       A list of the members of DBWS's Board of Directors is given in
Appendix 6. The Board meets at least monthly to set policies and
approve loans exceeding WS$10,000 each. Although the Board has
generally functioned adequately, the Government has agreed to make
changes in the Board. The changes would limit the tenure of members and
ensure that none of them epsept ex-officio members simultaneously sits on
the Board of another Bank.-   Before any change is made in the Board
of Directors of DBWS, the Bank 1 il be informed in time for it to
respond effectively, if need be.
42.       The organization chart of DBWS is given in Appendix 7.  As at
the time of the last appraisal by the Bank, DBWS has five Divisions at
its head office and one branch at Salelaloga and one agency at Asau in
Savai'i. The Agricultural and Industrial Loans Divisions are
responsible for appraisal and supervision of loans. The Finance
Division handles administration, accounting and MIS. The Legal Division
is responsible for security of loans and rehabilitation of problem
projects and the RDD for project promotion, market research and
training. DBWS's organizational structure is appropriate for its
developmental role and level of operations. However, with a view to
heightening its responsiveness to the growth and changes in its
operations 4/DBWS has agreed to review its organizational structure by 30
June 1985.-   DBWS has further agreed to keep the Bank informed of the
1/ The other six members represent the private sector.

results of the review and shall implement tty required changes in its
organization in consultation with the Bank.-
43.       DBWS's General Manager (GM), the chief executive, oversees the
operations of DBWS. He is assisted by an Assistant General Manager
(AGM) and the divisional managers. All of the management are Western
Samoans who have performed effectively. The GM, initially appointed in
1978, was reappointed by the Government in August 1984 for a term of two
years.  The Bank will be consulted /before any changes are made in the
appointment of GM or AGM of DBWS. -
3. Staff and Training
31
44.       The DBWS's staff increased to 90 (24 executive staff- ) on
30 June 1984 from 86 (22 executive staff) on 30 June 1981. Most of this
increase resulted from recruitment of additional project supervision
staff in the Rehabilitation Section (Legal Division), in response to a
recommendation made by the last Appraisal Mission. The quality of staff
is generally good, and the turnover has not been unduly high (13 per
cent in FY 1983). Very few of the resignations have come from executive
positions. The Government and DBWS have assured the Bank that DBWS's
personnel management (recruitment, retention, remuneration4/training and
promotioa) will continue to receive their close attention.-
45.       DBWS regularly conducts in-house training sessions.  These
have concentrated on developing financial analysis skills. In an effort
to upgrade and diversify its in-house training, DBWS's Training Officer
has set up a formal training program for FY 1985. It is scheduled to
include courses in legal, marketing, technical and economic aspects of
loan appraisal, financial analysis and loan disbursement procedures.
46.       During FY 1983 20 of DBWS's staff attended external training
courses. Of these, 11 staff attended overseas courses sponsored by
organizations such as the Bank and the University of South Pacific.
Overall, DBWS's training of staff compares favorably with that provided
by other South Pacific DFIs. The Bank will be assisting DBWS under
Regional technical assistance to upgrade its training programs. DBWS
has assured the Bank that it will continue to give high
priority to staff training and developing suitable in-house training
programs.  DBWS ha ,agreed to inform the Bank annually on the progress
of staff training.-

B. Operations
1. Activities
47.       The main activity of DBWS remains the provision of medium and
long-term loans for development proiacts in agriculture, industry
(including services) and infrastructure (including group/village
projects). Its loan operations include medium-and-long term assistance
to farmers under various Government programs for specific crops such as
cacao and passion fruit. Although it is empowered to extend working
capital loans and accept deposits, DBWS has not yet been engaged in
these activities. Up to 30 June 1984. DBWS had made only two small
equity investments, but it plans to increase its involvement in this
activity gradually .
48.       During 1983 and 1984 DBWS was appointed the agent    Western
Samoa for the Pacific Islands Industrial2yevelopment Scheme,-  and the
Center for Industrial Development (CID).-  DBWS is endeavoring to
become the agent for the Australian Joint-Venture Equity Scheme. During
April-July 1984, the Manager of DBWS's RDD worked for three months at
the CID in Belgium (at CID's expense) to firm up joint venture
proposals. Partly as a result of his efforts, seven projects with a
total cost of WS$9.2 million are in the preliminary stages of planning.
The proposed technical assistance would improve DBWS's efforts towards
project promotion, particularly in the area of training, and the
provision of extension services to its borrowers.
49.       Part of the reason for DBWS's marginal profitability and large
number of loans in arrears was its overinvolvement in making very small
agricultural loans, which amount to less than WS$500 each. These
subprojects, being so small and located in remote areas, have been
difficult to supervise and have involved high administrative costs.
DBWS has continued to cater to small agricultural borrowers (its average
size loan approval in the agricultural sector in FY 1983 was WS$1,873)
on a selective basis but has played a key role in establishing 18 credit
unions up to 30 June 1984, which can better handle small credits.
Another 11 credit unions are in the process of being formed. Two of
DBWS's executive staff comprise the management of the Samoa Credit Union
League, and DBWS provides it with secretarial services. The Governlnt
has agreed to foster the establishment of additional credit unions.-
Under the proposed technical assistance, an Agricultural Credit
Specialist would advise DBWS on the further development of credit
unions.

Industry) financial assistance plan for South Pacific countries.

and Pacific (ACP)-Lome and EEC member countries.
3/   Loan Agreement, Schedule 4, paragraph 11.



15
2. Policies
50.       The basic document guiding DBWS's operations is its Policy
Statement (formulated in 1974 in consultation with the Bank) which
remains unchanged and continues to provide satisfactory guidelines (see
Appendix 8). Any substantial amendment in DBWS's Policy,Statement will
be effected only with the prior agreement of the Bank.-   DBWS has
adopted a Development Strategy covering the period 1984-1986 (see
Appendix 9). The Strategy deals mainly with the importance and ways of
expanding DBWS's promotional activities and reducing its portfolio
arrears.
3. Procedures
51.       DBWS's operational procedures for loan processing,
documentation, procurement, disbursement and supervision are generally
adequate. However, there is scope for further improvement in the
evaluation of marketing aspects for larger agricultural and industrial
projects. A marketing expert assigned to DBWS for 1984 and 1985 under
United States Peace Corps assistance is helping to address this
deficiency. In addition, DBWS needs to upgrade and streamline its
appraisal procedures for agricultural lending. DBWS has assured the
Bank that it will continue its efforts to upgrade the quality of its
appraisals.
52.       Normal project supervision is the responsibility of the
officers who conduct appraisal. All projects are reviewed at least once
a year with more frequent reviews for problem projects. Problem
projects are the responsibility of the Rehabilitation Section which
initiates legal action where necessary. DBWS's project supervision
procedures are generally adequate, although after completion project
site visits have not been made frequently enough. To help remedy this
deficiency, DBWS plans to rely more on Government Agricultural
Department extension cfficers to supervise small agricultural projects
in remote areas. DBWS is formulating an arrears reduction program to
strengthen its supervision of problem projects (see para 72).
4.   Operational Performance
a.   Overview
53.            Highlights of DBWS's lending during FY 1981-1983 and
the first six months of FY1984 are summarized in Table 2; details of
loan operations are given in Appendix 10. DBWS's operations have
continued to be concentrated on providing loans for medium and long-term
investments.

54.       Approvals in FY]981 and FY1982 declined slightly from WS$3.5
million of approvals recorded in FY1980 mainly because of a nationwide
strike by civil servants in April-July 1981, depressed prices of
agricultural produce and recession in the economy.   In FY1983, however,
with an improved economy and export prices of commodities, DBWS's loan
approvals almost doubled. This trend continued into the first six
months of FY1984, when there were record approvals of WS$4.58 million.
b.   Sectoral Distribution
55.       A detailed analysis of sectoral classifications of the
approvals is presented in Appendix 11.  From FY1981 to 31 March 1984,
DBWS approved a total of 7,564 loans amounting to WS$18.1 million
(USS9.0 million). Agriculture continued to dominate DBWS's lending,
accounting for 92 per cent by number and 56 per cent by amount of total
loan approvals during the period. Of agricultural loan approvals, the
largest amount went to mixed farming, followed by taro, plantation
vehicles and passion fruit. One significant trend is the progressive
shift to larger agricultural loans approved. The number of loan
approvals declined from 3,760 in FY1980 to 1,932 in FY1983, and the
average size of loans increased from WS$574 to WS$1,873.
56.       Loans for group/village projects during FY1981 to 31 March
1984 numbered 170, amounting to WSS1.38 million. In terms of amount,
this represented 8 per cent of total approvals for the period. School
buildings continued to be the largest component amounting to WS$1.13
million (82 per cent). Since 1980 lending to groups has steadily
declined from WSSO.55 million in FY1980 to WSS0.28 million in FY1983.
57.       Industrial loans (including services), which declined in FY
1980 and 1981.increased from WS$0.70 million in FY1981 to WS$2.86
million in FY1983. In the first six months of FY1984, the momentum was
maintained with loan approvals amounting to WS$l.49 million. Of the
cumulative industrial approvals of WS$6.46 million for the period
FY1981-31 March 1984, services and food processing enterprises accounted
for 50 per cent and 24 per cent respectively, followed by manufacturing
(14 per cent), engineering (9 per cent) and printing and publishing (3
per cent).

c.   Size, Maturity and Geographical Distribution
58.       A breakdown of DBWS's loan approvals by size, maturity and
geographical distribution is given in Appendix 10. While there were
only 81 loans of over WS$5,000 approved in FY1981, 176 such loans
totalling WS$4.39 million were approved in FY1983, accounting for 65 per
cent in value of the total approvals in that year. Loans of up to
WS$500 declined significantly from 68 per cent by number and 18 per cent
by value in FY1981 to 40 per cent by number and 5 per cent by value in
FY1983. In the first six months of FY1984, no loans of below WS$500
each were approved. Loans of between WS$500 and WS$5,000 increased from
29 per cent by number in FY1981 to 52 per cent in FY1983; by value
however, its percentage share declined somewhat. These trends reflect
DBWS's shift towards financing somewhat larger projects and the
devaluation of the tala. The weighted average loan maturity increased
from 3.3 years in FY1981 to 4.2 years in FY1983. This change is in line
with the shift from smaller to larger loans. For the period FY1981 to
31 March 1984, the weighted average maturity of total loans approved is
estimated to be four years.
59.       The geographical distribution of DBWS's loan approvals
parallels the distribution of population and infrastructure development
in Western Samoa. During FY1981-31 March 1984, there was continued
concentration of assisted enterprises in the more developed island of
Upolu. On a cumulative basis, 75 per cent by number and 78 per cent by
value of loans approved were for Upolu and the rest for the less
developed island of Savai'i. It is expected that DBWS will make 30 per
cent of its annual loan approvals for projects on Savai'i by FY 1986.
5.   Projected Operational Performance
60.       The projected lending operations of DBWS for FY1984-1987 are
summarized in Table 3 and the details are presented in Appendix 12.

18
61.       Of DBWS's total projected loan approvals of WS$39.3 million
(US$19.6 million), agriculture would account for 51 per cent, followed
by industry (36 per cent), group/village projects (7 per cent), and
other projects (6 per cent). The projected approvals represent an
average annual growth rate of 13.5 per cent, and about 28 per cent of
total approvals is expected to go to the island of Savai'i. These
projections, which take into account the envisaged capital outlays in
the country, DBWS's operational performance in FY 1983 and the first six
months of 1984 and its existing pipeline of projects, are considered
realistic.
C.   Accounting, Audit and Financial Controls
62.       DBWS's accounts are maintained in accordance with the
requirements under the DBWS Act. The accounting system is centralized
at the Head Office and is basically manually operated, with loan
accounting partly operated on three Olivetti posting machines. The
Finance Division, which is responsible for accounting, is headed by an
experienced staff and he is assisted by a qualified accountant. Control
over the accounting functions in the Savai'i branch is exercised through
directives, periodic visits and regular reports submitted to the head
office. Although the present accounting system is generally adequate,
it needs to be improved and updated to provide speedier and more
meaningful information. Realizing the importance of timely management
information, DBWS decided in 1980, to computerize its accounting and
management information systems by engaging the services of a Government
computer bureau based in Apia. However, the system is still not yet
operational. The delay was attributed to insufficient staff and
capacity in the computer bureau in the past. DBWS is at present
considering the acquisition of an in-house mini-computer. Since the
management of DBWS is not conversant with electronic data processing, it
has requested Bank assistance for its computerization and accounting
improvement program. The Mission considers DBWS's request fully
justified and has accordingly proposed technical assistance to address
the problem.
63.       The DBWS Act requires the accounts of DBWS to be audited by
the Controller and Chief Auditor of Western Samoa or a person authorized
by him. DBWS is required to submit annually to the Minister of Finance,
a copy of its audited annual accounts and a report on its operations for
the year. The Bank loan documents require DBWS's accounts and financial
statements to be audited annually in accordanc? with sound auditing
standards by an independent external auditor.-   In practice, the
Gove-nment Chief Auditor reviews the independent external auditor's
report. Apart from the statutory annual audit, the auditors are
required under the Bank loan documents to submit from FY1983, a
long-form audit report following the standard format adopted by the
Bank. For the proposed loan, the long-form audit to be submitted will
also include a review by the external auditor of DBWS's loan portfolio
1/ With the approval of the Government, DBWS has engaged Price
Waterhouse to conduct the annual audit of its accounts.



19
and the external auditor's opinion as to DBWS's compliance with the
Bank's loan covenants. DBWS shall furnish the Bank not later than four
months after the close of the fiY7ncial year to which they relate the
auditor's long-form audit report- . The long-form audit reports
submitted to the Bank are found to be generally satisfactory. The
existing external audit arrangements are satisfactory.
64.       DBWS has an internal audit unit consisting of two staff.  The
Internal Auditor, who is a qualified accountant, reports to GM and is
guided by an audit program. An audit of Head Office and Savai'i branch
is carried out at least once a year. The internal audit arrangement is
generally satisfactory.
D.   Financial Performance
1. Interest Rate Structure
65.       In August 1983, DBWS changed its interest rate structure (see
Table 4 below) at the behest of the Government.
Table 4. Changes in DBWS's Interest Rates
Rates per annum
Sector              before August 1983   as from August 1983
Agriculture                     8 to 10 per cent         8 per cent-"
Industry/Services              12 to 14 per cent        14 per cent
a/   This change was made retroactively from 1 April 1983 for
agricultural loans.
Given the high priority it had assigned to increasing agricultural
production, the Government considered that DBWS should charge highly
concessionary rates for loans to that sector. This change in interest
rates resulted in an operating loss for DBWS in the first half of FY
1984 (see para 75). It is clearly necessary to increase DBWS's interest
rates to restore its profitability, increase its funding self-reliance
and align its interest rates with the general interest rate siyucture of
the country. Therefore, as a condition of loan effectiveness- the
Government has agreed to increase DBWS's interest rates to at least 10
per cent for agricultural and group/village sector loans and to at least
16 per cent for industrial and services sectors loans. The Government
has also agreed to consult the Bank before making any changes in DBWS's
interest rate structure and to review the appropriatenls of DBWS's
interest rates annually in consultation with the Bank.-

67.       DBWS achieved modest profits during the period FY1980-1983,
with a return on equity of less than 2 per cent. Its profitability has
been limited by concessional interest rates, a relatively high level of
operating expenses associated with supervising small agricultural
accounts and the relatively high level of its annual provisions for bad
debts. While the return from loans averaged between 10.1 and 11.2 per
cent during the period, the cost of borrowings averaged between 5.4 and
6.3 per cent. Operating expenses as a percentage of average loan
portfolio averaged between 7 per cent and 8 per cent. DBWS's net income
and return on equity declined in FY1983 because of the revision in its
interest rate structure in August 1983. Also as a result, the average
return from loans declined from 10.7 per cent in PY 1981 and 1982 to 10.1
per cent in FY1983. The financial position of DBWS remained comfortable



21
throughout the period with a debt-service coverage of not less than 6.6
times, a debt/equity ratio of not more than 2.2:1, well within the
covenanted maximum of 3:1, and a current ratio of not less than 8.4:1.
68.       DBWS's sources and applications of funds during FY 1981-1983
are summarized in Table 6. Details of DEWS's borrowings are given in
Appendix 16. During the period, loan disbursements constituted the bulk
of total fund requirements accounting for 70 per cent. Debt service was
relatively light, constituting only 8 per cent. due mainly to the eight
year grace period for Bank loans onlent by the Government to DEWS.
Internal cash generation and loan collections provided more than half the
total sources of funds. with the rest covered mainly by borrovings.

3.   Portfolio Management
69.       A detailed analysis of DEWS's portfolio and collection
performance is given in Appendixes 17 and 18. As of 31 March 1984,
DBWS's loan portfolio totalled WS$18.3 million spread over 7,941 loans
and accounted for 93 per cent of its total assets. Table 7 gives a
comparison of DBIWS's portfolio by sector as of 30 September 1981 and 31
March 1984.

a/ These are loans approved prior to 30 September 1972 by DBWS's
predecessor.
70.       Between the end of FY1981 and 31 March 1984, DBWS's portfolio
increased in line with its lending operations. The share of agricultural
loans by amount in the total portfol'o increased from 47.4 per cent to
49.5 per cent, group loans declined from 9.4 per cent to 7.0 per cent,
and industrial loans remained constant at around 42 per cent.
71.       The loan arrears situation of DBWS has deteriorated since 1981.
Total arrears by amount as a percentage of total loans in repayment stage
increased from 18.1 per cent as of 30 June 1981 to 26.6 per cent as of 30
September 1983. Between 30 September 1981 and 30 September 1983, total
loans affected by arrears as a percentage of total loans increased from
50.2 per cent to 56.1 per cent and the percentage of arrears over 12
months to total arrears increased from ;2 per cent to 79 per cent.
Sectorally, by amount the arrears of small agricultural loans increased
from 49 per cent to 76 per cent. largc agricultural loans from 19 per
cent to 26 per cent, group loans from 11 per cent to 13 per cent, and
industrial loans from 8 per cent to 18 per cent. Cash collections as a
percentage of total dues decreased from 55 per cent to 47 per cent.
72.       There are a number of factors that have led to DBWS's arrears
problem. The chief among these is the severe economic recession in the
country over the past three years. Another major reason is the
difficulty in administering a very large number of agricultural loans,
numbering 6,941 as of 30 September 1983, 4,384 of which are small loans.
Field visits are invariably time-consuming because of the great number of
accounts and remoteness of many farms. A decrease in the number of small
loans would therefore be helpful and DBWS is endeavoring to create an
alternative source of credit through credit unions. Other factors
include the lengthy legal procedures in loan recovery, lack of
sufficiently intensive follow-up by loan officers, and deficient
agricultural loan appraisals. Other remedial measures being undertaken
or considered include closer cooperation with Government Agricultural
Department extension officers in supervising agricultural loans;
appointment of influential village chiefs as collection agents; use of
collective guarantees by chiefs or several members of a village; setting
collection targets for loan officers and i-proving loan appraisal
procedures. In addition, computerization of loan arrears records will
provide more timely statistics which should help to improve arrears
control procedures. In order to accelerate legal procedures, DBWS
recruited an in-house lawyer in 1982.



23
73.       Partly as a result of the remdial measures undertaken and
following increased rescheduling of loan arrears, total arrears by amount
as a percentage of loans in repayment improved to 23.6 per cent as of 31
March 1984. In its strategy statement for 1984-1986, DBWS has set a
target of reducing its arrears to a level of not more than 10 per cent of
total loans by the end of 1986. To help DBWS meet this target, DBWS is
required to submit by 31 December 1984 to the Bank a formal arrears1I
reduction program to be approved by the Bank before implementation.-
74.       DBWS's provision for doubtful accounts as of 30 September 1983
amounted to WS$1.53 million or 10.3 per cent of total loans outstanding.
The proposed Bank loan documents provide for DBWS to maint2n provision
of not less than 10 per cent of its outstanding portfolio.-   The
accumulated provision covered about 40 per cent of total arrears. DBWS's
external auditors issued a qualified opinion on the adequacy of the
provision in their audit report covering FY1983 because DBWS had not
carried out an adequate review of outstanding loans in its portfolio
ameu-uting to WS$10,000 or less each.  In view of this, DBWS has agreed
starting from FY 1984, to undertake a full review of all outstanding
loans in its portfolio in order to determine more precislyy its provision
for doubtful accounts and those loans to be written off.-

In FY1984 DBWS is projected to incur a net loss of WS$265,000 as a result
of the lowering of the interest rate for agricultural loans (see para
65). ijt is covenanted under the previous Bank loans and in the proposed
loan- that the deficit will be fully covered by the Government by
means of a direct contribution to DBWS.
76.       The Government has agreed to make an upward adjustment in
DBWS's interest rates. With the revised interest rates. DBWS's
profitability is expected to be restored and to compare favorably with
its profitability during FY 1980-1983. DBWS's return on equity will
range from between 4 and 6 per cent for FY 1985-1987. The gross margin
from lending operations is projected to increase from 4.1 per cent in
FY1984 to about 7.0 per cent from FY1985 onwards.  Total loans are
expected to grow from US$14.9 million in FY 1983 to WSS40.4 million in
FY1987 or an average annual rate of 28.3 per cent. This growth rate is
higher than projected for loan approvals because of the large increase in
loan approvals in FY 1983 and 1984. Total borrowings are projected to
increase from WS$9.4 million to WS$27.1 million, an average annual growth
rate of 30.3 per cent.
77.       The Government has given satisfacqyry assurances with regard to
meeting DBWS's local currency requirements.-  DBWS?s financial
position is expected to remain satisfactory with a debt-service ratio
exceeding 3:1 and a debtlequity ratio of about 2.4:1, which are vell
above and wit n the covenanted limits of 1.25:1 and 3:1,
respectively.-
78.       DBWS's projected financing plan for the period FY 1984-1987 is
summarized in Table 9.

Total disbursements of loans for the period are projected to amount to
WS$37.3 million, of which the foreign currency portion would account for
about 40 per cent. Total debt-service will still be relatively light.
The major sources of finance would be from internal cash generation and
loan collections (WS$20.4 million)} borrowings (WS$19.4 million) and
share capital increases (US$4.0 million).  The Government has agreed 1o
increase DBWS's authorized capital to WS$10 million by 30 June 1985,-
to inject the remaining WS$180,000 of capital or soft loans covenanted
under the fourth Bank loan by 31 December 1984 and to inject capital or
soft loan2,amounting to a total of at least WS$1.5 million during 1985
and 1986.-
79.       As of 31 March 1984, DBWS had available uncommitted foreign
currency credit lines amounting to WS$0.2 million equivalent (US$0.1
million). The proposed Bank loan of WS$8.0 million equivalent (US$4
million) and IDA loan of WS$4.0 million equivalent (US$2 million) are
expected to be available in early 1985. Based on projected
foreign currency loan approvals for FY 1984-1987 totalling WS$14.5
million (US$7.2 million equivalent), these resources are adequate to meet
DBWS's requirements up to FY1987, Of the total projected local currency
requirements of US$29.8 million for FY 1984-1987, internal cash
generation and portfolio recoveries would provide WS$20.3 million, and
th-e rest is expected to be covered by further share capital increases
(WS$4.0 million), subordinated soft-term loans from the Government
(WS$4.0 million) and borrowings from NPF (WS$0.5 million).
E. Implementation of Previous Bank Loans
1. General
80.       The details of the Bank loans and their utilization features
are given in Appendixes 20 and 21. The Bank has provided to DBWS from
Special Funds loans totalling US$12.0 million whose overall utilization
has been satisfactory. The first three loans have been fully utilized
and closed. Commitments under the fourth loan of US$4 million amounted
to US$3.93 million as of 30 June 1984 and it is expected to be fully
committed before the closing date for crediting of 10 May 1985. Most of
the disbursements under the Bank loans so far have been on a
reimbursement basis, mainly for off-the-shelf purchases, made within the
120-day period stipulated for this purpose in the loan documents. A
breakdown for the four Bank loans by procurement by country of origin as
of 30 June 1984 is given in Appendix 22. By amount, the leading
countries were Japan, New Zealand, Federal Republic of Germany, Australia
and the United States.
2. Nature of Subloans
81.       DBWS has financed 2,862 subloans under the four Bank loans as
of 30 June 1984. By number, about 83 per cent were approved for the
agriculture sector, followed by 12 per cent for industry (including
1/   Loan Agreement, Schedule 4. paragraph 9.
21   Loan Agreement, Schedule 4, paragraph 7.



26
services) and 5 per cent for group/village projects. By amount, the
largest beneficiary was the industry sector (45 per cent), followed by
services and agriculture (22 per cent each) and group/village projects
(11 per cent). The subsector that benefited most from the Bank subloans
was food, beverage, and tobacco (US$2.37 million or 20 per cent). The
average subloan size was about US$12,000 under the first loan and
US$15,100 under the second, but it ji creased to US$2,500 under the third
loan and US$3,900 under the fourth.-   By amount, between 30 and 43 per
cent of the total subloan amounts approved/authorized under the four
loans v2ye used for subprojects which were above their respective free
limits.-   By number, above-the-free-limit subloans represented 3 to 5
per cent of total subloans approved under the first two Bank loans, and
0.7 to 0.8 per cent of total subloans approved under the third and fourth
loan. Except for the small agricultural loans, most of subprojects are
operating satisfactorily.
3. Socio-Economic Impact of Bank Subloans
82.       A precise assessment of the socio-economic impact of the
previous Bank Loans to DBWS on an aggregate basis is difficult due to the
nature of the subprojects, paucity of relevant data and the economic
environment in Western Samoa under which DBWS is operating. There are a
large number of small borrowers who are not yet fully familiar with the
monetized economy. In addition, partly because income from agricultural
sources is not subject to income-tax in the country, most agricultural
enterprises do not maintain financial records. However, DBWS has made
estimates of the economic impact of larger subloans. For the four Bank
loans, the estimated benefits for subloans exceeding US$10,000 each were
the creation of new jobs for abour 2,800 persons and foreign exchange
earnings and/or savings of about US$4.6 million per annum. The eight
above3>ree limit subloans (US$1.1 million committed as of 30 June
1984)-' under the fourth Bank loan are estimated to have generated 148
new jobs, value added of US$1.7 million per annum and foreign exchange
earnings/savings of US$2 million per annum. The non-quantifiable
benefits of the Bank loans include strengthening of the agricultural
marketing infrastructure through financing of buses and plantation vehicles,
development of many new entrepreneurs and upgrading the quality of
education through financing the construction of new school buildings
(about 140 classrooms).
1/ Under the first two Bank loans, DBWS set its own minimum amount for
subloans at WS$2,000 because of administrative costs. The Bank
introduced a simplified format (simultaneous crediting and
reimbursement procedure) under the third loan to encourage
utilization and facilitate processing of small loans.
2/ The free limits were US$30,000 under the first loan and US$50,000
under the second, third and fourth loans.
3/ These eight subprojects included a printing press and manufacturers
of sausage, wood veneer, taro chips, mosquito coils, corned beef and
plastic bags/pipes.

4. Implementation of Previous Bank Missions' Recommendations
83.       The previous review missions' malor recommendations included
the following: (i) DBWS should consider appointing a second AGM; (ii)
DBWS should introduce a bonding system for staff who receive overseas
training; and (iii) the Government should consider allowing DBWS to
increase its interest rates. DBWS has already implemented the second
recommendation and will shortly be recommending to its Board that a
second AGH be appointed. The Government has agreed to raise DBWS's
interest rates.
84.       The major recommendations of the Project Completion and Project
Performance Audit Reports covering the first and second Bank loans were
as follows: (i) DBWS needs to develop its capabilities as
regards project promotion; (ii) DBWS should design a comprehensive
arrears reduction program; (iii) DBWS should maintain a systematic
training program; and (iv) DBWS's GM should be restored to the Board of
Directors. Bank technical assistance has been proposed to upgrade
DBWS's project promotion capabilities. DBWS is developing an arrears
reduction program and is required to submit it to the Bank for its
approval. DBWS has continued to expand and upgrade its in-house training
programs and would receive assistance from the Bank in this area under
proposed Bank Regional technical assistance. The Government is presently
considering restoring the GM to DBWS's Board.
F. Compliance with Previous Bank Loan Covenants
85.       Appendix 23 contains a summary of the Government's and DBWS's
compliance with the covenants under the fourth Bank loan. For the most
part, the Bank loan covenants have been complied with. The exceptions
are as follows:
(i)  DBWS was required to consult the Bank before
making anTichanges in interest rates charged on
subloans.-   In August 1983, DEWS changed its lending
rates on all loans at the behest of the Government
without consulting the Bank.
(ii)  The Government was to inform the Bank before making
changes in DBWS's Board of Directors to enable the 2t
Bank to respond effectively to the proposed changes-.
In December 1982, the Government appointed a Board
member without informing the Bank in advance. The
Government expressed its regret concerning this
appointment and gave assurances that the requirement
would be followed in future.
(iii) DBWS was to have begun monitoring the socio-economic
impact of subprojects by collecting relevant data for
completed subprojects to which it had provided loans
1/   Project Agreement, Schedule, paragraph 3.
21   Loan Agreement, Schedule 4, paragraph 3.



28
exceeding US$50,000 equivalent each .2    However,
DBWS had not yet made progress in collecting the data.
DBWS explained that its loan officers had encountered
difficulty in collecting data from borrowers because the
latter do not keep financial records. One reason for
this deficiency is that there is no taxation of income
from agricultural sources in Western Samoa.
Nevertheless, DBWS agreed to intensify its efforts to
comply with the identical provision under the proposed
loan. DBWS plans to assist selected borrowers in keeping
financial records through its Research and Development
Division.
(iv) DEWS is required to submit its audited financial
statements to the Bank withly six months after
the end of its Fiscal Year.-  Although DBWS was able
to comply with this provision for FY 1981 end 1982, the
Bank received DBWS's audited financial statements
covering FY 1983 four months after the stipulated
deadline. The delay was caused mainly because of staff
shortages in the Government's Audit Department, which
reviews DBWS's external auditor's draft audit report on
DBWS before its finalization. The Government assured the
Mission that henceforth its Audit Department will
expedite its review of DEWS's audit by conducting its
review subsequent to audit finalization if necessary to
ensure timely submission of the report to the Bank.

V. CONCIUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
86.       Established and developed with Bank support as the only DFI in
Western Samoa, DBWS has continued to play an important role in the
economic development of the country.
87.       DBWS's institutional and operational aspects continue to be
generally satisfactory although certain areas such as arrears control
require upgrading. Its management and staff continue to be competent.
The efficiency of staff is expected to be maintained. Its policies and
procedures continue to remain generally satisfactory. Its operations
are development-oriented. its operating results are expected to improve
and its financial position is expected to remain sound. The Bank's
technical assistance and loans have been implemented and utilized
effectively.
88.       It is recommended that a loan of US$4.0 million be extended to
the Government of Western Samoa from the Bank's Special Funds resources
for onlending to DBWS on the terms and conditions enumerated in
Chapter III.B. of this Report. It is also proposed to provide technical
assistance in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of US$300,000 as a
grant for strengthening DBWS (see Chapter III.C.). The proposed loan
and technical assistance will further facilitate and promote DBWS s role
in the development of Western Samoa and will also help in further
iMproving its operations as a DFI.  The proposed loan is expected to
generate 1,000 jobs and US$2.5 million in foreign exchange
earnings/savings per annum.
89.       In addition to the standard loan covenants, DEWS and the
Government have agreed to the following: a debt/e2yity ratio maximum of
3:1 and a debt-service coverage minimua of 1.25:l;-21an increase in
DBWS's interest rates and an annual review thereof;- chjnges in the
service conditions of members of the Board of Directors;-  full
coverage of any DBWS operational deficit and provis3yns if required;-
increases in DEWS's authorized e7d paid-in capital;- further
establishment of credit unions;- submission to the Bank of a formal
arrears reduc5fon program and reduction of DEWS's arrears to 10 per cent
of portfolky;- and annual review of all loans in DEWS's
portfolio.-  The conditions for effectiveness of the proposed loan
are execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreemeog satisfactory to the Bank
and increasing the Interest rates of DBWS.-

DEVELOPMENT BANK OF WESTERN SAMOA
Statement of General Business Policies
(Policy Statement)
I. The Bank
The Development Bank of Western Samoa was established under
the Development Bank Act, 1974, as an independent statutory body. The
functions of the Bank are to promote the expansion of the economy of
Western Samoa for the economy and social advancement of its people by
making loans and in its discretion, giving financial, technical and
advisory assistance to enterprises in the agricultural and industrial
sectors of the economy in Western Samoa. In carrying out these
functions, the Bank will be guided by the following general operational,
financial and promotional policies.
II. Scope of Activities
1.        The Bank will conduct its operations within the general
framework of the Government's economic policies, plans and priorities.
2.        The Bank will assist applicants primarily in the private
sector.  The existence of Government or other public interest in an
enterprise will not necessarily preclude financing by the Bank.
3.        The Bank will finance projects aiming at increasing production
and development in the fields of agriculture including horticulture,
livestock and fishing; timber extraction and reforestation; quarrying;
industry, manufacture and processing of all kinds; tourism; transport
and communication and other service industries that contribute to
development in these fields.
4.        The Bank will finance both new enterprises and the expansion
or modernization of existing enterprises. Particular attention will be
given to promotion of the entry of new entrepreneurs in the field of
productive enterprises.
5.        The Bank will provide financial and other forms of assistance
to eligible enterprises in the following ways:
(a) extending loans;
(b) making equity participation;
(c) guaranteeing of finance provided by other sources;
(d) providing technical and managerial consultancy
services, and financial services including syndi-
cation and joint financing;
(e) assisting identification, formulation and promotion
of new projects.
(Reference to Text: Page15, Paragraph50)



42
Appendix 8
Page 2
6.        The Bank's financial assistance will be primarily for the
acquisition of fixed assets. However, the Bank may also finance in
deserving cases, seasonal and short-term credit requirements in the
agricultural sector as well as permanent working capital requirements.
III. Developmental Policies and Operating Principles
7.        It vill be one of the Bank' s important aims to investigate and
identify investment opportunities, and to promote and assist in the
establishment of enterprises of importance to the economy of Western
Samoa.
8.        In addition to the operating principles mentioned under
Section 6 of its Charter, the Bank shall also give preference in
determining whether or not any assistance is to be given to any
enterprise, to enterprises which will: (a) use local raw materials in
processing and manufacture; (b) make use of labor-intensive technologies
to provide more opportunities for employment and training of local
people; (c) contribute effectively to broadening the base of local
entrepreneurship; (d) have a good potential for expanding exports or
decreasing imports; and (e) lower cost within the country and improve
the efficiency or standards of goods and services within the country.
9.        The Bank will carry out its operations as a development bank
in accordance with sound banking and business practices.
10.       The Bank will provide financial assistance only to those
projects which on the basis of its own analysis, appear to be
economically justified, technically feasible, financially viable and
profitable. Special attention will be given to the quality of
management of the enterprise and the market prospects of the project.
I1.       The Bank will endeavor to secure its loans and guarantees in
accordance with sound banking practices, but in doing so, the Bank will
have due regard to its developmental functions in the economy of Western
Samoa.
12.       Applicants will be required to provide a reasonable equity for
the enterprise financed by the Bank to ensure that they have an
appropriate stake in their own venture. They will also have to ensure
that the total financial requirements for the successful implementation
of their projects will be available.
13.       The Bank will ensure, in making its financial assistance
available to any one borrower, that the financial requirements for the
completion and commissioning of the project are appropriately covered;
this will also take into consideration appropriate care for cost overrun
that may reasonably need to be accounted for.
14.       Loans will usually be disbursed after the promoters have made
appropriate financial contribution of their own to the project and after
having ensured that such disbursement will be in line with the
requirements of the investment schedule of the project.



43
Appendix 8
Page 3
15.       The repayment period of the loans to the Bank, including a
grace period as appropriate and needed. will be determined taking into
account: (i) the repayment capacity of the enterprise; (ii) an adequate
payout to the promoters during the repayment period; and (iii) optimum
use of Bank's own funds by maximizing the turnover of its portfolio.
16.       The Bank will closely supervise the use of its funds, the
progress of the projects financed and the performance of the enterprise
to ensure that remedial action is taken promptly, should circumstances
so warrant.
17.       The Bank will require its borrowers to keep records and
accounts in accordance with sound and generally accepted accounting
principles, and to furnish whatever information on their operations and
accounts it deems appropriate. The Bank will also maintain the right to
inspect the enterprises it finances, as well as their operations,
records and books of accounts.
18.       The Bank will endeavor to assist farmers and entrepreneurs
with the provision of managerial, technical and other advisory services.
It is the aim of the Bank to help its borrowers towards the successful
completion of their projects.
19.       The Bank will continue to build up an effective organization
and develop an adequate and technically qualified staff in order to
carry out its functions efficiently and to assist its clients in the
formulation and conduct of their projects.
20.       Business secrets and other information furnished to the Bank
by applicants or clients will be treated as confidential.
IV. Diversification of Portfolio
21.       In order to reduce the concentration of risk, the Bank will
seek to diversify its portfolio by sectors of operations and by avoiding
inappropriately large investment. In view of its developmental
function, the Bank will also pursue geographical diversification of its
portfolio.
22.       The Bank's equity investments shall serve mainly as a
catalytic agent for the establishment of new enterprises and the Bank
will endeavor to dispose of such equity investments as soon as this
becomes feasible and a reasonable price can be obtained therefrom.
23.       The Bank will not commit to a single enterprise in the form of
equity participation more than five per cent of its unimpaired paid-up
Share Capital and Reserve Fund. The aggregate equity investments of the
Bank at any time shall not exceed twenty per cent of its paid-up Share
Capital and Reserve Fund.



44
Appendix 8
Page 4
24.       The Bank's total commitment in the form of loans, equity
investments and guarantees in a single project or enterprise shall not
exceed: ti) twenty per cent of the total of the Bank's unimpaired Share
Capital and Reserve Fund; (ii) sixty-five per cent of the total fixed
assets of such enterprise in industrial sector including the Bank's own
investment; and (iii) eighty per cent of the total assets of such
enterprise including the Bank's own investment in agricultural sector.
25.       In exceptional cases meriting special consideration, limits
under Clause 24(ii) and (iii) may be exceeded provided the loan is
covered by adequate additional security over assets not forming part of
the project.
26.       In financing worthwhile projects requiring more than its
maximum lending limits under Clause 24, the Bank may seek a syndicated
cooperation of other financial institutions, both domestic and foreign,
limiting the Bank's liability in such cases to the ceiling referred to
under Clause 24 above.
V. Financial Guidelines
27.       The Bank will review and determine from time to time the rates
of interest and fees to be applied to its advances in the light of
prevailing Government policy and developments in the capital market,
with due consideration to the costs of its own borrowings.
28.       The Bank will not carry the exchange risk on its debts payable
in foreign currency. The Bank will endeavor to have such risk assumed
by Government or by a Government agency. In the event that Government
or its agencies are not prepared to bear the foreign excbange risk
relating to its repayment of debts in foreign currency such a risk will
be passed on to the Bank's borrowers.
29.       The Bank will not take a controlling interest or management of
any enterprises in which it has invested. However, should it become
necessary to protect its own interest, the Bank may take such
appropriate action as it considers appropriate.
30.       The Bank will not undertake long-term borrowing obligations,
including guarantees, that in the aggregate would exceed three times the
total of its unimpaired paid-in Share Capital and Reserve Fund.
31.       The Bank will maintain accounting records adequate to reflect
its business operations in accordance with sound and generally accepted
accounting principles and practices.



45
Appendix 8
Page 5
VI. Provisions and Reserves
32.       The Bank shall set aside in each year at least three per cent
of its approvals of loans, equity investments and guarantees in that
year as a provision against bad and doubtful debts until such times as
the provisions equal ten per cent of its loan, investments and guarantee
portfolio, and will thereafter set aside annually such amounts as are
sufficient to maintain this provision at least at that level.
33.       The Bank shall also set aside annually at least fifty per cent
of its net income to its Reserves Fund until such time as the Reserves
Fund is equal to the Bank's paid-up Share Capital.

DEVELOPMENT BANK OF WESTERN SAMOA
OUTLINE OF DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY FOR 1984-1986
Apart from its normal financing activities, DBWS will endeavor
over 1984-1986 to achieve the specific developmental objectives outlined
below:
Lending Policy
1.        DBWS vill increase gradually the proportion of its financing
to Savai'i island (as well as to projects located outside Apia). It is
intended that this proportion should be no less than 60 per cent over
the 1984-1986 period, with a target for Savai'i of at least 30 per cent
of total approvals during this period.
2.        DBWS will continue to participate with other service
institutions in the development of programme lending similar to the
on-going FAO Fisheries Fund for financing of fishing gear and boats, the
Passionfruit Production Programme, the Cocoa Suspensory Loan Scheme for
the rehabilitation of the Cocoa Industry, the IFAD Livestock Project and
the Women Advisory Council's Small Business Loan Fund.
3.        DBWS will explore the efficacy of selective lending for
specific co mmercial purposes, particularly in the rural areas and in
casea where the commercial banks and other financial institutions may
not be providing the necessary credit and other banking services.
4.        DBWS will also work more closely with the Comercial Banks,
NPF, and other financial institutions in areas such as information
gathering on mutual clients, co-financing, loan guarantees,
rediscounting of project loan portfolio, and swap arrangements.
5.        In view of the country's balance of payments problem DBWS will
pay special attention to the promotion and financing of export-oriented
and import substitution projects.
Project Promotion and Technical Assistance
6.        DEWS will get involved actively in identifying new business
opportunities, promoting projects, and seeking out and assisting new
entrepreneurs.
7.        DBWS intends to increase its technical assistance to its
clients in order to improve the formulation and design of their projects
and the organization and managerial framework of their enterprises; and
to encourage enterprise expansion and diversification.
8.        To avoid delaying implementation of projects for which
technical, managerial and entrepreneurial expertise are not available
locally DBWS will itself undertake to provide these by becomlng actively
(Reference to Text: Page 15, Paragraph 50)



47
Appendix 9
Page 2
involved as partners in joint ventures with overseas interests which
will provide the requisite expertise or as sole owners and/or partners
in locally owned ventures operated by hired expatriate expertise.
9.        DBWS will endeavor to make the best use of technical and
financial assistance available under the PIIDS of the New Zealand
Government, ADAB Venture Scheme of the Australian Government and the
assistance from the Centre for Industrial Development of the ACP-EEC in
the interests of DBWS clients and of Western Samoa. It will also seek
an equity line from the Asian Development Bank during this 1984-1986
development period.
10.       DBWS will judiciously advertise the services it provides in
local and overseas newspapers to promote joint ventures under the scheme
mentioned in 9 above, and to encourage qualified and experienced Samoans
in New Zealand and elsewhere to return and with DBWS assistance invest
their skills and other resources in the development of Western Samoa.
11.       DBWS will undertake market and other studies for specific
industries it finances as it has done for the Passionfruit. and the
Printing and Publishing Industries, in order to provide it and the
participants in the industries with working papers for discussion of
what is best for the orderly development and expansion of specific
industries within the country.
12.       DBWS will also gradually develop its capability to provide
business advisory services to its clients and eventually to the
general public.
13.       For the purpose outlined in 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 above,
the Research and Development Division will continue to be expanded and
adequately staffed by qualified and experienced local as well as
expatriate personnel.
Institution Building and Cooperation
14.       DBWS will consolidate and endeavor to improve further its
working relationship with technical, financial, market and other service
institutions along the lines as mentioned in 2 and 4 above.
15.       DBWS will actively stimulate and facilitate the process of
institution building in connection with Credit Unions and Cooperative
Societies and encourage these institutions to undertake lending
operations which will complement the mall lending operations of DBWS.
In this regard, it will seek and coordinate outside technical and
financial assistance to augment its own assistance for the establishment
and development of these institutions.
16.       DBWS will continue to pursue the expansion of a branch network
and other measures that will improve its accessibility to its clients
thereby facilitating both credit delivery and collection. In this

connection, DBWS will establish agents at villages and district levels
for collection of repayments, project inspection and arrears follow-up
and other specific purposes as required.
Staff and Training
17.       DBWS will organize an adequate and effective system of
personnel management in order to develop and retain a stable core of
experienced professional staff, especially at the middle management
level. For this purpose, DBWS will review its remuneration structure in
a comprehensive manner at least once annually.
18.       In order to upgrade staff expertise and productivity, DBWS
will intensify its in-house staff training programme to be coordinated
by its Staff Training Officer to cover all aspects of development
banking operations and personnel management, with special attention
given to project appraisal, supervision and follow-up.
19.       DBWS will continue to take advantage of overseas training
opportunities that are directly related to development banking with
equal emphasis placed on project appraisal, personnel development and
management training. In particular, DBWS will collaborate closely with
ADFIAP, APRACA, ADB, and EDI in making use of overseas training
opportunities which would complement and/or supplement the in-house
training undertaken by DBWS itself.
20.       For the purpose outlined in 17, 18 and 19 above, DBWS will
strengthen its in-house training capability under its Staff Training
Officer to assess, plan, coordinate and administer its overall staff
training requirements.
Financial Management
21.       DBWS will continue to develop and improve an appropriate
system of budgetary control and to improve its management reporting, in
consultation with the external auditors, in order to exercise more
effective supervision over its operations and further improve its
financial position. In this connection, one of the measures DBWS will
implement is to improve the computerization of its accounting systems to
enable it to speed up the processing of its management reports and the
decision-making process.
22.       DBWS will improve its Internal Audit Section to ensure that
standard procedures and guidelines for financial management and control
are strictly adhered to. To enable the Internal Auditor to assess the
effectiveness of the systems, his section will audit and review each
procedure/system at least once annually.
23.       DBWS will seek to explore other additional sources of equity,
grant, programme and soft-term funds needed for financing its expanded
and diversified operations.

Arrears Problem
24.       DEWS realizes with concern that its major problem is arrears
and whilst it recognizes that some of the causes of this problem are
beyond its control, it undertakes to remove those causes over which it
has the power in order to reduce arrears to acceptable levels. In this
connection. DBWS will undertake regular surveys to identify the causes
of arrears and their relative significance to form the basis for
remedial action it undertakes.
25.       DBWS will take steps to strengthen and upgrade its follow-up
procedures in order to promote a more intensive and enhanced supervision
of its arrears.  In this regard, DBWS will appoint agents at villages
and district levels to enable it to keep in close contact wlth its
clients and be well informed at all times.
26.       DBWS will endeavor to reduce its arrears to below 40 per cent
by number and below 10 per cent by amount during the 1984-1986 period.
Diversification
27.       DBWS will explore the efficacy of diversifying the services it
provides to meet the needs of its clients and to promote the overall
development of Western Samoa. In particular. DBWS will endeavor to
pursue the best means of its involvement in administering and managing
the development of individual and village lands which are not being
utilized for productive and commercial purposes.
Technology Transfer
28.       DEWS recognizes that it is a major financier of project
offshore costs and in this regard it can Influence the process of
technology transfer.  It must tnerefore ensure that the technology it
finances is appropriate to the needs of Western Samoa.
29.       DBWS will also monitor innovations and new developments in
technology which contribute to increasing labor and organizational
productivity as for example the field of electronic data processing
(EDP).

DEVELOPMENT BANK OF WESTERN SAMOA
Major Assumptions for the Operational and Financial Projections
FY 1984 - 1987
A.   Lending Activities
1.   Loan Approvals
(a) Approvals for FY1984 are based on the operational
performance for the nine-month period ending 30 June 1984
and extrapolated for the year taking into consideration
the existing pipeline projects.
(b) Approvals of small agricultural loans are assumed to
increase at 10 per cent per annum over FY1985 to FY1987.
The foreign exchange component of such loans is estimated
at 5 per cent.
(c) Approvals of large agricultural loans are assumed to
increase at 15 per cent per annum over FY1985 to FY1987.
The foreign exchange component of such loans is estimated
at 20 per cent.
(d) Approvals of infrastructure loans are assumed to increase
on average at 10 per cent per annum over the three years
FY1985 to FY1987. The foreign exchange components of
such loans are estimated at 50 per cent.
Approvals for Rural Development Projects are assumed to
increase at 20 per cent per annum. The foreign exchange
component of such loans is estimated at 50 per cent.
Approvals for other group loans and cooperatives are
assumed at 10 per cent per annum over the three years
FY1985 to FY1987. The foreign exchange component for
these loans will be about 60 per cent.
(e)  Approvals of industrial loans are assumed to increase at
about 15 per cent per annum over FY1985-FY1987. The
foreign exchange component of these loans is estimated at
75 per cent.
(f) IFAD approvals are assumed at a monthly average of
WS$17,500. The foreign exchange component is estimated
at 70 per cent.
(g) The Cocoa Suspensory Loan Scheme which commenced
operations in FY1984 has a target of 1,600 acres. It is
expected that a total of 836 acres will be approved in
FY1984 and the remaining 764 acres will be approved in
FY1985. It is assumed that such loans will be wholly
financed by local currency (see also item no. 2(e)).
(Reference to Text: Page 23, Paragraph 75)

2.   Disbursements
Based on past experience, the following assumptions are
applied:
(a)  For small agricultural, infrastructure, RDP and other
group loan approvals, 90 per cent of the amount will be
disbursed in the year of approval (i.e., 10 per cent of
the approvals for the year will be disbursed in the
following year).
(b)  For large agricultural loans, 85 per cent of loan
approvals will be disbursed in the year of approval
(i.e., 15 per cent of the approvals of the year will be
disbursed in the following year).
(c)  For industrial loans, 75 per cent of loan approvals will
be disbursed in the year of approval (i.e., 25 per cent
of the approvals of the year will be disbursed in the
following year).
(d)  For IFAD loans, 90 per cent of loan approvals will be
disbursed in the year of approval (i.e., 10 per cent of
the approvals of the year will be disbursed in the
following year).
Ce)  For Cocoa Suspensory loans, disbursement is expected to
spread over FYsl984 to 1987. According to the scheme, 60
per cent of total project cost will be funded by the
Government, 20 per cent by DBWS, and the balance 20 per
cent by the farmer.
3.   Loan Collections
Loan collections have been estimated as follows:
Amount         Collection Rate-
(WS$'000)              -
FY 1984                4,091              46.0
