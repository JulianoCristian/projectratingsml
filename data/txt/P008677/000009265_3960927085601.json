The Government's strategy in this period of\n            transition (1986-1996) before Portugal's full accession\n            to the EEC, is to transform agriculture into an efficient\n            and export oriented sector.  The project will assist this\n            strategy in the Tras-Os-Montes region through: (i)\n            strengthening of basic agricultural services (research,\n            extension, and planning); (ii) provision of long term credit\n            for modernization of agroindustries, and replanting of 5,000\n            ha of existing vineyards for port wine; (iii) rehabilitation\n            of 220 small traditional irrigation schemes, and\n            construction of 18 new medium size irrigation schemes; and\n            (iv) construction and rehabilitation of rural infrastructure\n            including roads, water supply and sewerage, electrification\n            and development of national and natural parks."}, "docdt": "1989-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
