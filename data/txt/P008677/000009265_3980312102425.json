Tras-os-Montes Regional\n            Development Project for Portugal were as follows: outcomes\n            were unsatisfactory, project sustainability was likely, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: when the\n            loan disbursement percentage is too low, interest in the\n            borrowing country becomes minimal, as the Bank's\n            requirements for using loan funds are considered not worth\n            the effort. In the wake of macroeconomic improvements in\n            Portugal in the early 1990s the country gained access to\n            non-grant financing sources, which the authorities\n            considered to be preferable to World Bank loan funds. In\n            such an event, early restructuring of the project is\n            desirable. Pre-project analysis, especially in countries\n            nearing \"graduation\" from the Bank, not only\n            should incorporate experience with predecessor projects, but\n            include a review of the entire country portfolio in search\n            of signs for borrowers' changes in handling Bank loams\n            and weakening of their ownership and commitment. Careful\n            review of the likely economics of investments such as\n            irrigation should be made on the basis of models or average\n            figures, prior to contracting detailed design studies, and\n            current Bank practice in this respect should be reviewed."}, "docdt": "1998-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
