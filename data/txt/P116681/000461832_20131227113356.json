Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency\n            Project for Armenia had an overall satisfactory outcome,\n            with the performances of both the Bank and the borrower\n            being deemed satisfactory, while the risk to the development\n            outcome was felt to be low or negligible. The project\n            development objective indicators as well as the intermediate\n            outcome indicators were achieved completely, and in some\n            cases, had even exceeded the target. Significant lessons\n            learned during the course of implementing the project are:\n            1) projects that are simple in design and singularly focused\n            perform well and have a high likelihood of achieving their\n            objectives; 2) addressing priority needs of local\n            populations is critical for the successful implementation of\n            rural development projects; 3) irrigation projects can\n            provide an important safety net for rural populations,\n            especially during times of economic downturn; 4) projects\n            prepared rapidly must have in-built flexibility to respond\n            to emerging needs and situations; and 5) establishing and\n            strengthening Water User Associations (WUAs) is a long-term undertaking."}, "docdt": "2013-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
