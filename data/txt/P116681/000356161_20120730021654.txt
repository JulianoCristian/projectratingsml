                                               On the special purpose financial statements of
                                Additional Financingfor the Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency Project
                                       for the period from 1 November 2011 to 31 December 2011




           We have audited the accompanying special purpose financial statements of Additional Financing
           for the Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency Project, which comprise the Statement of Financial
           Position as at 31 December 2011, the Statement of Project Sources and Uses of Funds, the
           Statement of Uses of Funds by Project Activity, Summary of summary reports and SOEs,
           Designated Account Statement for the period from 1 November 2011 to 31 December 2011, and
           a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.




           The management of the PIU is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
           special purpose financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
           Standards issued by the International Accounting Standard Board, and for such internal control
           as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of special purpose financial
           statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.




           Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose financial statements based on
           our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.
           Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the
           audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the special purpose financial statements are free
           from material misstatement.

          An audit involves performing procedures to obtain reasonable audit evidence about the amounts
          and disclosures in the special purpose financial statements. The procedures selected depend on
          the auditor's judgment including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the
          special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
          assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair
          presentation of the special purpose financial statement in order to design audit procedures that
          are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
          effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes the appropriateness of
          accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management,
          as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the special purpose financial statements.

                 position of the Project as of 31 December 2011, as well as sources and uses of funds,
                 designated account movement and its balance for the period from 1 November 2011 to 31

             2. funds have been used in accordance with the conditions of the 8106-AM Loan
