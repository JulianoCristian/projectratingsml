The\n            principle elements of the project include: 1) establishment\n            of a Council of Agricultural Research Policy (CARP) with\n            appropriate authority to formulate, through a National\n            Agricultural Research Plan, an overall strategy for\n            research.  The Council's further responsibility is to\n            set national research policy and priorities for allocation\n            of resources, and recommend allocation of funds for phased\n            implementation of research programs.  In addition to the\n            above, the project involves 2) provision of infrastructure,\n            equipment, machinery and vehicles at research institutions;\n            3) introduction of a contract research program; 4) staff\n            development and technical assistance; 5) establishment of a\n            research planning cell and project management unit; and 6)\n            strengthening of research extension linkages.  Lastly, the\n            project entails 7) incremental staff and operating costs."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
