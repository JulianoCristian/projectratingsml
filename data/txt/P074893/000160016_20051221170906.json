highly likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; Bank\n            performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. These lessons were cited: 1) Building on prior\n            sector work: The project clearly benefited from prior sector\n            work on public sector management issues. Much of the project\n            conditionality reflects the recommendations of these sector\n            reports. 2) A pipeline of reforms: The project also\n            benefited from the previous adjustment operation, the Public\n            Sector Management Adjustment Credit Project PSMAC, which,\n            among others, established the legislative framework for the\n            civil service reforms supported by the project. By the same\n            token, several of the first Public Sector Management\n            Adjustment Loan PSMAL reforms will be followed-up under the\n            new operations. 3) Limited number and specificity of\n            conditions The relatively small number of conditions imposed\n            under the PSMAL was a boon to implementation, as it\n            permitted the Government to focus on a limited number of\n            issues. The specificity of the reforms was also helpful, as\n            it provided clear targets for reform efforts. 4) High level\n            political support was critical to project success. Support\n            from the Ministry of Finance was instrumental in offsetting\n            internal and external opposition to reforms, particularly in\n            pharmaceutical procurement."}, "docdt": "2005-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
