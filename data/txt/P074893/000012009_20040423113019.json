series of adjustment operations,\n            aimed at improving public sector management in Macedonia.\n            The project will pursue five major areas of reform: 1)\n            budget formulation, to increase the usefulness of the budget\n            as a strategic policy instrument, and ensure that the\n            Government is capable of formulating a budget within\n            macroeconomic constraints; 2) budget execution, to\n            strengthen the Treasury's control over spending\n            commitments and extra-budgetary funds; 3) audit, to\n            establish an internal audit department in the Ministry of\n            Finance, and units in other key Government agencies, and,\n            strengthen the State Audit Office's ability to focus on\n            high risk entities; 4) procurement, to support the enactment\n            of a new procurement law, and the creation of a specialized\n            procurement bureau in the Ministry of Finance; and, 5) civil\n            service, to create a mechanism to enforce civil service\n            hiring requirements, and introduce a uniform, decompressed\n            salary structure for civil servants. In addition, the\n            project will support specific reforms in the health sector,\n            including improvements in the internal control system of the\n            Health Insurance Fund, and in the procurement of\n            pharmaceuticals. Linked donor finance will also support\n            technical assistance, and policy studies, aimed at improving\n            the administration and targeting of health insurance\n            subsidies, pension contributions, social assistance, and\n            child allowances. Political and implementation risks shall\n            be minimized, because key reforms will be completed prior to\n            Board presentation, and the inclusion of a second tranche\n            release will be contingent full compliance with reform implementation."}, "docdt": "2004-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
