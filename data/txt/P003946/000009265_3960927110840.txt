MEMORANDUM AND RECOMKENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENr TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A PUBLIC WORKS INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to -he
Republic of Indonesia for US$36.1 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years
grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.       Background.  The central Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and
provincial and local government public works departments are responsible for
about 70% of the total value of construction in the country. In 1987/88 the
MPW budget of US$1.3 billion equivalent represented about 60% of public works:
the other 40% was the responsibility of regional governments. The Government
of Indonesia (GOI) is now decentralizing public works and transferring many
responsibilities from the center to the regions.
3.       The major sector issues are:  (a) shortage of experienced and well
trained public works staff particularly at provincial and local government
level and the weaknesses in personnel and career development systems are
serious constraints on efficient planning, implementation and maintenance of
public works; (b) there is inadequate coordination and cost control of
training within central MPW and between MPW and the regions; (c) managerial
efficiency is low because of inadequate coordination between directorates at
MPW which is exacerbated by the lack of uniformity in procedures and
information flows in similar functional areas; and (d) nore of the provincial
laboratories has the necessary facilities to carry out tests of the quality of
construction materials; testing procedures are unsatisfactory and staff are
inadequately trained.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Improved management of all aspects
of public works and efficient utilization of staff and other resources,
including decentralization of much responsibility to local government, is
critical to the effectiveness of future development in Indonesia and the Bank
supported investments. The Bank has been beavily involved in support for
public works and in recent loans it has sought to increase the participation
of local government in planning and implementation of projects and in better
operation and maintenance of the services. The proposed project would build
on the Bank-assisted Public Works Manpower Development Project (Ln. 2258-IND)
completed in December 1988 and complement the ongoing and planned Bank
projects supporting the subsectors of irrigation, roads and human settlements
and would be a further step towards the effective decentralization and
efficient implementation of public works.
5.       Proiect Objective.  The objective of the project is to improve the
coordination of planning and the implementation of public works activities
through staff development,   e development of more efficient management
systems and procedures, and assistance to GOI in the transfer of an increasing
share of responsibilities in public works planning and administration to
provincial and local governments.



* 2 -
6.       Project Degcrintion,  The project would comprise (a) staff and insti-
tui.ional development through improvements in staff planning, and training,
career development and personnel management systems, strengthening of
provincial public works departments including the relocation of experienced
staff to key technical and administrative posts; (b) the improvement of
management systems and procedures at central and provincial government levels
for the planning and implementation of public works, including improved
management information systems, development of uniform reporting systems for
planning, programming and controlling public works projects, improved
procedures for procurement, financial control and audit and the development of
library and technical information services; and (c) the improvement of quality
control of construction works through the upgrading of provincial testing
facilities, procedures and technical staff. The Project would generally be
implemented in MPW, the provincial offices of MPW and in the Public Works
Departments of Provincial Governments. Training would be given to public
works staff at all levels including local governments. Since project
components dealing with decentralization involve Ministries and State Agencies
other than MPW, which is the implementing agency, an Interministerial Advisory
Board would be established to advise the Project Director on policy, actions,
and decisions of GOI relevant to the project and to maintain coordination
between the relevant Ministries and State Agencies, on project related issues.
7.       The project is estimated to cost a total of US$54.0 million of which
US$26.7 million is expected to be in f.oreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan
of US$36.1 million would finance 70% of the project cost net of taxes.
Estimated costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and the disbursement schedules are shown in Schedule B.
The timetable of key events in project processing is siumarized in Schedule C.
The Status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia is shown in Schedule D. A
map of the project component locations is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report is being distributed separately.
8.       Actions &gre.  During negotiations the Government has agreed to the
following: (a) key technical and administrative positions in provincial
public works offices would be filled by October 31, 1992; (b) the informatics
policy working group would be established by December 31, 1989 and maintained
for the project period; (c) the management information system would be
implemented in eight specified provinces by October 31, 1992; (d) an
Interministerial Advisory Board and a Technical Committee would be established
by November 30, 1989 and maintained for the project period; (e) the Project
Management Unit would be fully operational by November 30, 1989; (f) specified
consultants would be appointed by February 28, 1990 and MPW counterparts and
task managers appointed by March 31, 1990; (g) biannual progress reports would
be submitted to the Bank; (h) project implementation would be evaluated by
October 31, 1989 and findings submitted to the Bank; and (i) as a condition of
disbursement against specified priority training in FY1992/93 and thereafter,
there would be in operation a satisfactory system for management and
coordination of the total public works staff training program.
9.       Benefits.  The main benefits expected from the project would be that
(a) the training of public works staff would be carried out in a coordinated,
efficient and cost effective manner; (b) Provincial offices of MNPW and



- 3 -
provincial public works offices would have well qualified and experienced
personnel in key positions; (c) the public works program of national,
provincial and local governments would be more efficiently managed and
operated in a coordinated manner; and (d) testing of the normal range of
construction materials would be available in each province and carried out
professionally. Taken together, the benefits would facilitate the
decentralization process through the increased capacity of provincia3
governments to manage effectively their own public works programs.
10.      Risks.  The risks are:  (a) the uncertainty of the pace with which
GOI will implement its decentralization policy and the possible lack of
cohesion in the policies of the state agencies and ministries involved; (b)
that the decrees, regulations and procedures, which are now in draft or still
under preparation, to deal with the detailed operating procedures for
decentralization, introduce a degree of uncertainty pending their finalization
and may necessitate adjustments to project activities and timing; and (c) that
some provincial government units would lack capacity to implement the improved
and standardized systems and procedures. The risks relating to uncertainty
would be minimized by developing a flexible project design with focus on
functions which would not be dependent on organizational change and with
reviews of programs by the Interministerial Advisory Board. The risk of
inadequate capacity at the provincial level would be minimized by ensuring
that key technical and administrative positions are filled by relocation from
central MPW of experienced staff only and by introducing the new systems on a
phased basis, including pilot testing.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
