The project's\n            objectives were: (a) to improve the coordination of planning\n            and the implementation of public works activities by staff\n            development and improved management information and other\n            systems; and (b) assist the Government of Indonesia (GOI) in\n            the implementation of policies for deconcentration and\n            decentralization of responsibilities for public works. Bank\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower performance was\n            highly satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as\n            follows: (a) there was no follow-up project for IDTP,\n            although sector work on capacity building to support the\n            accelerated decentralization policies was planned; (b) the\n            need for flexibility and adaptation as national changes\n            overtake the more focused sectoral changes that are\n            generally built into a project; (c) the importance of\n            strong, effective and committed project management for\n            effective implementation; (d) the need for clear project\n            performance indicators to measure progress and outcomes,\n            particularly measures for assessing the effectiveness of\n            large Technical Assistance (TA) components, as well as\n            independent impact assessments, including tracer studies,\n            for the training programs; and (e) the need for greater\n            dissemination of individual sector experiences in\n            decentralization, both in the Bank and GOI, to guide future\n            work as decentralization policies continue to evolve in Indonesia."}, "docdt": "1997-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
