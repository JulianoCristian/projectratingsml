SEVENTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1178-MA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Completion Report (PCR) for the project financed under
the seventh loan to the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya
(NEB). The US$35 millAbn loan which became effective on March 10, 1976, was
provided to finance afproximately 20% of the foreign cost of a project
consisting of the addition of 3,120 MW oil fired units at the Pral Thermal
Power station, associated 132kV transmission lines and a rural electri-
fication study. Additional foreign exchange financing for specific imported
project related items was provided through OECF Japan, EXIM Bank Japan and
supplier's credits.
Although the project was completed in September 1981, disburse-
ments, mainly for payment of contractor's retention monies, continued until
October 1983, and the original Closing Date of June 30, 1981 was extended
twice to June 30, 1983. The Bank loan was underutilized to the extent of
US$3.23 million, of which US$3.0 million was cancelled in December 1981 and
US$0.23 million in November 1983 when the loani was finally closed.
This report was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Projects
Department, Energy Division following a project completion mission which took
place in March/April 1985, and is based in part on draft project completion
reports prepared by NEB.
In accordance with revised procedures for project performance audit
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED),
but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft PCR to
the Government and the Borrower for comments. Comments received have been
reproduced as Attachment A to the report.

SEVENTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1178-MA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
A US$35 million loan was made to NEB in March 1976 to finance part
of the foreign costs of constructing 3,120 MW oil fired units at the Prai
Thermal Power station, associated 132 kV transmission lines and a rural
electrificacion study. The first 120 MW unit was commissioned in October
1979, followed by the second unit in April 1980 and the third unit in January
1981. The project was only about 7 months behind schedule and was
accomplished with a cost underrun of about 10%. The units have been
operating satisfactorily with acceptable levels of efficiency and plant
outage rate. Except for the plant's control and instrumentation system, ill
other systems have been performing satisfactorily. The EIRR of the project
was 19.7% against an appraisal estimate of 11%, inspite of rises in fuel oil
prices, largely due to timely and adequate tariff increases. The rural
electrification study, carried out by a consulting firm, was the first of its
kind undertaken in Malaysia. It provided the basis for the country's rural
electrification programs and Bank's lending in this sector.
During the tenure of the project (1976-81) NEB's sales increased by
about 72%, at an average annual growth rate of 11%. The project was thus a
timely addition to NEB's generating capability.
Except for the year 1980 when NEB made a net loss, its financial
performance was satisfactory, due to adequate tariff increases and exemption
from payment of taxes and dividends. NEB's institutional development has
been impressive and the utility has strengthened its capabilities in many
fields. There still remain certain areas, such as distribution system
planning, performance of feasibility studies for large power projects and
improvement in operation of thermal/hydro stations, where NEB needs to focus
its attention in the future.

SEVENTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1178-MA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
The Power Sector
1.01      Power in Malaysia is supplied principally by autonomous government
owned entities. The National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB)
serves Peninsular Malaysia, while the Sabah Electricity Board (SEB) and the
Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation (SESCO) serve the two st, es on the
island of Borneo.  NEB took over the supply and distribution of electric power
on the island of Penang, from the Penang City Council in 1976. NEB also
acquired in 1982 the operations of the Perak Hydroelectric Company which
generated and distributed electricity in the state of Perak. Small generating
and distribution licensees still exist in isolated areas, where NEB's supply
is not yet available.
1.02      The generating capacity of NEB at the time of project appraisal in
end 1975 compares with the actual capacity in 1983 and the projected capacity
by 1988 as indicated in Table 1.1. The figures indicate a sustained high
growth rate of about 14 - 15% in capacity and energy capability over a period
of 13 years. As a consequence of the oil price increases from 1979 a definite
shift away from oil burning thermal stations has been planned. While gas and
coal are foreseen to be fuels for future thermal stations, proposals for
transport of hydro electricity from Sarawak to the mainland over submarine
cables are presently under evaluation.
The Borrower
1.03      The borrower NEB is an autonomous government owned corporation
established in 1949, responsible to the Ministry of Energy, Telecommunication
and Ports. It is an operating agency and has the legal power to set tariffs. l/
NEB is a well established entity with competent management. Its manor opera-
tional and policy decisions are made by the Board of Directors whose members
are appointed by the Minister. The Chairman of the Board is the Chief
Secretary of the Cabinet and the General Manager is the Deputy Chairman.
1/ Until 1984, NEB was also a regulatory agency with the power to grant
licencesto independent electricity works. Since January 1, 1984,
NEB's Inspectorate Division was converted into a Federal Government
Department and integrated with the Ministry of Energy, Telecoms and
Posts (Attachment A).

1.04      The Bank has made eleven loans to NEB since 1958 totalling US$439.5
million.  Projects under the first eight loans have been completed.  The fifth
power project was completed about three months behind schedule with a cost
overrun of 15%, whereas the sixth power project was delayed by eleven months
with a cost overrun of 31x. Both these projects were executed as planned and
achieved their major objectives. The PPAR for the sixth power project (Report
No.3506 of June 22, 1981) noted that NEB is a well managed utility and has
some effective staff training programs. It concluded that apart from the
utility's unsatisfactory financial performance in 1980 and 1981, due to
factors beyond the control of its management, the project was a success.
NEB's financial position has since improved.
1.05      Since 1975, the year of the SAR, several institutional changes have
been implemented by NEB. The organization structure has been changed and
capabilities have been substantially enhanced in the fields of system
expansion planning, engineering and design, project implementation, accounting
and auditing, data processing, system operation and cortrol, planning and
development for rural electrification, training and manpower development. The
Bank has been associated with some of these activities through loans for the
eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh power projects (Loan Nos. 1443, 1808, 2143,
and 2438-MA) in addition to the present project which initiated, inter alia,
the first systematic study for rural electrification in the country.

(a) Information available in Bank files;
(b) Quarterly Progress and Financial reports submitted by NEB;
(c) draft project completion reports provided by NEB;
(d) SARs for seventh, eighth, ninth and eleventh power projects and the
Rural Electrification. Project; and
(e) discussions with NEB personnel and field visit to Prai power station
during the Bank mission to Malaysia from March 28 to April 19, 1985.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01      The Bank has been having a continuing participation in the power
development program of Malaysia starting with the first power loan in 1958.
The present project originated during discussion of NEB's expansion plans,
between a Bank's mission and NEB's senior planning personnel, in October 1974.
A consulting firm retained by NEB made extensive studies of the Generation and
Transmission expansion program covering the period 1975 to 1983. These
studies showed that following the 3 x 120 MW Port Dickson Thermal Station (a
Bank-financed project), the least cost development plan would be:
(a) 4 x 87 MW Temengor Hydro Project (then under construction);
(b) expansion of Prai Thermal Power Station by 3 x 120 MW units;
(c) 2 x 120 MW capacity Pasir Cudang Thermal Power Station (project
financed under Bank Loan 1443-MA);
(d) new hydro development which later turned out to be Bersia
(3 x 24 M4) and Kenering (3 x 40 MW) (projects financed under Rank
Loan 1808-MA).
2.02      Extension of Prai was foreseen as the only feasible development that
could be completed in time to meet the forecast demand by the end of 1979.
This has been subsequently justified by load growth which necessitated emer-
gency commissioning of 5 x 20 MW gas turbines during the year 1979.
2.03      The original concept for the Prai power station site was for three
30 MW units in stages 1 and 2 and three 60 MW units in stage 3. A subsequent
review established that space was adequate for three 120 MW units in stage 3
and the system could accept units of this size. This has been a wise decis-
ion, as the efficiency of the larger sets is higher and the per unit cost is
lower.



-4-
Preparation and Appraisal
2.04      The project was prepared by NEB and was appraised by the Bank in
about seven months from identification. The project was prepared with
adequate recognition of the executing agency's technical and managerial capa-
bility. During the project preparation stage NEB had expressed their desire
for Bank's involvement in an accelerated rural electrification (RE) program.
Tn the absence of adequate data to assess the appropriateness of lending for
an RE project, Bank's staff emphasized the need for a comprehensive study for
RE in Malaysia, prior to possible financing by the Bank. Provision was
accordingly made in the project for consultancy services for a detailed RE
study. This study was accomplished under the project and subsequently led to
the Bank's first loan for Rural Electrification to Malaysia (Loan
No. 2146 MA).
Project Ob ectit
2.05      The main objectives of the project were to augment system's generat-
ing capability to meet the rapidly growing load, to finance a part of NEB's
132 kV transmission program and to provide 11 kV distribution facilities for
supply to two rural areas. The initiation of the first rural electrification
study; in-house design and implementation of a major thermal power project by
NEB with minimum consultancy assistance; requirement of a dialogue with the
Bank on tariiff changes and improvement of the company's financial health
through the meeting of specified financial covenants, were expected to further
strengthen the institution.
Project Description
2.06      The project as appraised comprised the following components:
(a)  Addition of 3 x 120 MW units to the existing thermal station at
Prai, having 3 x 30 MW units;
(b)  construction of a 16.5 mile 132 kV double-circuit transmission line
Lrom Majidee switching station to Kota Tinggi, a town in the rural
development area of Johore Tenggara;
(c)  extension of 11 kV distribution system to two rural areas, Alor Star
in the north and Segamat/Kluang in the south; and
(d)  consulting services for a rural electrification study.
Cost Estimate and Financing Plan
2.07      The cost estimate and financing plan for the project were as

Total                                                   14,3
2.09      NEB requested the Bank to permit utilization of the surplus to
finance ftrther augmentation of the transmission system. A number of
essential elements consistent with the objectives of the project were
identified as listed below: (see Map).
(a) Scudai-Majidee 132 kV transmission line
(b) Yong Peng - Batu Pahat 132 kV transmission line
(c) 132/22 kV substation at Kota Tinggi
(d) 275/132 kV, 180MVA autotransformer with associated switchgear at
Papan substation
(e) Prai-Penang interconnection comprising:
(i) 132 kV submarine and land cables;
(ii) Power transformer for Penang, Prai and another substation; and
(iii) 132 kV and 33 kV switchgear for Glugor substation.
The Bank accepted these additions as they were substantially in line with the
original project objectives. Items (a), (b) and (c) were components which
provided for enhancement of supply in the south, whil- item (e) was directly
associated with the off-take of power from Prai thermal station. Item Cd) was
essentially a part of the 275 kV/132 kV system development close to Prai in
the north.
2.10      The estimated cost of the above additions was US$13.6 million with a
foreign exchange component of about US$10 million.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01      Board approval of the Project was obtained on December 2, 1975, the
Loan Agreement was signed on December 17, 1975 and the loan became effective
on March 10, 1976.
Implementation Arrangements
3.02      Engineering and Construction.  NEB had the capability to engineer
and implement major thermal power station projects and undertook "his work for
Prai. NEB's engineering and design team was assisted by three engineers from
a consulting firm, (Project Manager, Turbine Design Engineer and Electrical
Engineer). Thp firm also provided the services of a Senior Resident Engineer
and an Assistant Senior Construction Engineer for field supevision during
construction and commissioning. The strategy adopted by NEB was to entrust
maximum detailed design and drawing work to the contractor, NEB playing the
role of specifying basic design parameters and reviewing contractor's
drawings. The design of the civil works for Prai was entrusted to a local
consultant. Today, NEB believes that, except for civil designs, it does not
require consultant's expertise for thermal power station projects but employs
them to supplement its own complement of experienced engineers.
3.03      The design, procurement, inspection, supervision and commissioning
of the 132 kV transmission lines and substations was entrusted by NEB to a
consulting firm, at a later stage, due to shortage of personnel. Some NEB
engineers were seconded to work with the consultants' resident engineers.
3.04      The 11 kV distribution projects were done in house by NEB.
3.05      The study for rural electrification was entrusted to a consulting firm.
3.06      The engineering and construction consultants were directly appointed
by NEB, based on their past association with NEB. Other consultants were
selected for the Rural Electrification study after inviting proposals from
consultants, shortlisted in consultation with the Bank.
3.07      The piling contract was the single largest piling contract awarded
in Malaysia and comprised 3,633, 110 to 130 feet long prestressed hollow
concrete piles 600 and 400 mm in diameter, spun at site.
Implementation Schedule
3.08      Prai Thermal Station.  An analysis of the scheduled and actual dates
of contract award and contract completion is presented in Annex 1, which also
indicates the dates envisaged in SAR (for major components which have a
bearing on the project completiou date).  It may be observed that there have
been delays ranging from 2 to 9 months in contract award vis-a-vis the SAR
projections. The delays were much less vis-a-vis 'Planned Award Dates' which
were finalized by NEB, after the SAR. With regard to Bank funded components,



the major delay has been in awarding the contract for Structural Steel Work
and Cladding. Other signiificant delays were 4 months for instrumentation, 5
months for superstructures and 36 months for cabling and earthing. In the
last case it appears that the planned award date was unrealistic. whereas
finalization of type of instrumentation and design of superstructure are
essentially due to delays in system engineering. "he award of the Boiler con-
tract was well on schedule, whereas the award of the Turbo-Generator contract
shows a delay of five months from SAR but no delay from NEB's planned date.
Significant Delavs in Construction
3.09      Signlilicant delays in the execution of contracts and reasons thereof
are highlighted below:
(a)  foundation, Substructure and Marine Works (28/22 months) L.  Unex-
pectedly high water levels, late revisions in structure design,
shortage of materials, substantial increase in scope of work. This
was responsible for overall project delay of about 2 to 3 months
only as erection work could progress before 100% completion of
contract.
(b) Structural Steel Work and Cladding (5/2 months). Delay of gaining
access caused by the foundation contract; late award of contract.
In order not to delay the boiler erection work, the method of erec-
tion was changed. Additional plant and derrick cranes were pressed
into operation. The performance of the contractor was satisfactory.
(c) superstructures (16/2 months). This was an underestimation of
erection time in the SAR.
(d) Chimney_(7/12 months). Slow start by contractor, delay in handing
over foundation and difficulty in procuring acid resisting bricks.
(e) Boilers and Ancillary Equipment (Unit 4 - 5/0 months; Unit 5 - 5/0
months; Unit 6 - 4/0 months). Delay in shipment due to dock strike
in the country of origin during initial supply and erection
periods. Units 4 and 5 boiler erection was delayed by a month due
to delay in foundations. Considering two months delay in contract
award (vis-a-vis SAR), the Boiler contractor was responsible for one
to two months delay. The performance of the contractor was satis-
factory.
(f) Turbine Generators and Associated Equipment (Unit 4 - 5/0 months;
Unit 5 - 4/0 months; Unit 6 - 4/0 months). The delays (vis-a-vis
SAR) are attributed to late award of contract, otherwise the
machines had been ready for commissioning on availability of steam
from the boilers. The performance of the contractor was satis-
factory.
1/ Delays from SARl/Contractual completion dates.



9 -
(g)  Instrumentation and Control (31/21 months).  The performance of this
contractor was unsatisfactory. Although there were delays in
contract award and engineering on the part of NEB, the major cause
of delay is attributed to the contractor. Dock strike in the
country of origin and labor strike in the contractor's works were
responsible for some part of the total delay.
In spite of the long delay in this item, commissioning of the plant
was not unduly affected due to measures, such as use of temporary
control paneis, introduced by NEB.
(h)  Cabling and Earthing (13/0 months).  This was a relatively
inexperienced local contractor who had no appreciation of the extent
and level of engineering involved. NEB took over substantial
engineering and procurement responsibilities and saw to it that this
item did not affect plant commissioning date.
3.10      Generator transformer No. 6 dropped into the sea while being unloa-
ded at Butterworth port. A new transformer was supplied and commissioned,
without affecting the project schedule.
3.11      In conclusion, there was an overall delay of 4 to 5 months in actual
commissioning of the turbine generators from SAR schedule dates, due to
cumulative delays in foundation work, boiler erection work and instrumentation
and control. However, what is significant is that the overall delays were
much shorter than what could have occurred due to some very large delays in
civil works and instrumentation. This is attributed substantially to
excellent coordination and corrective action on the part of the NEB team
responsible for the project.
132 kV Transmission Lines and Substations
3.12      Significant delays in Construction.  An analysis of scheduled and
actual dates related to implementation is presented in Annex 2. Major reasons
for the delay are reviewed hereunder.
(a)  132 kV lines.  Serious delays in the completion of lines are
attributed to a compounding of delays due to various causes:
ti) 7-11 months in getting wayleaves due to severe land acquisition
problems in Malaysia; (ii) 2 months in foundation construction;
(iii) contractor's lack of experience in stringing; (iv) nine months
due to rejection of conductors (factory inspection which was let out
on contract by the consulting firm was unsatisfactory) and (v) eight
months due to delay in supply of structures. The performance of the
contractor was not satisfactory.
(b)  Kota-Iinggi Substation.  There was a delay of 4 months in giving
land access to the civil contractor who caused a further delay of
almost 12 months.  The civil contractor had to be replaced.  A delay
of 20 months in giving access to 132 kV switchgear contractor, nine
months delay in delivery and some delay due to contractor's preoccu-



- 10 -
pation at other sites, resulted in a total delay of 17 mont1l!. The
delay of 19 months in energizing of 22 kV switchgear was due t ,o
fault of the switchgear contractor. The delay is attributed to taLe
completion of the building and delayed commissioning of the 132 kV
lines. There was no delay on the part of the cransformer
contractor. Transformers were ready and stored at supplier's works.
(c) Papan Substation. The delay is largely attributed to late
submission of switchgear and transformer foundation drawings by the
contractors and delay in civil works construction. The 180 MVA
transformer failed on induced voltage test at the suppliers works,
due to faulty tapping lead insulation. The tapping windings were
reconstructed and the transformer subsequently passed the test. The
performance of the contractor was not satisfactory.
(d) Prai-Penang 132 kV Submarine Cable Interconnection. The construc-
tion delay on this project was about one month. There was no delay
in equipment supply. Each submarine cable took about 12 days
instead of 2 days in-laying. This was due to (i) hard sandy clay
bottom near the shores which slowed down laying operations;
(ii) breakage of guide cage; (iii) rupture of a factory joint.
3.13      There is scope for improvement in NEB's performance on 132 kV lines
and substations, through more vigorous follow-up on wayleaves for transmission
lines and land acquisition for substations and achieving closer coordination
between civil contractors and equipment suppliers. Likewise, great care
should be exercised in selecting contractors for transmission line projects.
Securing wayleaves is a problem common to all projects in Malaysia and this is
being addressed by the government.
Implication of Transmission Project Delays
3.14      The delays in commissioning the Scudai-Majidee-Kota Tinggi lines,
Kots Tinggi substation and Yong Peng Batu Pahat 132 kV lines, resulted in very
poor and insecure supply conditions to the concerned areas which were earlier
served by 22 kV and 66 kV transmission. It also curbed load growth to some
extent although details are not available. No adverse effect resulted from
delay in commissioning Papan substation 2751132 kV auto-transformer, as the
loads continued to be supplied from the existing 132 kV system. Delay in
Prai-Penang interconnection was of the order of 6 months (about 5 months up to
contract placement) which prolonged expensive generation on Penang island
(small steam units and diesel generation) for this period.
Prai-Penang Submarine Cables
3.15      The cables were supplied by a Japanese firm.  Laying on land was
subcontracted to a Malaysian firm, while underwater laying was subcontracted
to one Malaysian and one Singapore firm. Cable jointing was entrusted to a
Singapore firm. As a result of the discovery of a joint fault on the cable,
some doubts were cast on the condition of the other flexible factory joints.
A detailed inspection of the other joints was not possible due to the wrapping
on the joints, however each joint was inspected before burial for traces of



oil leaks but none were found. In the handling of large three core cables,
coiling of cables places stresses on the cable sheath which show up most often
at the joints in the form of deformation or rupture of the sheath. Manufac-
turer should increase quality control and improve the method of cable
coiling. Additional tests may be required as well as limits placed on the
number of times the cables are coiled during manufacture, transportation and
installation stages. During site test on the anti corrosion covering on the
submarine cable, the North cable failed to withstand the high voltage
applied. This indicated a puncture in the polyethylene covering. A cathodic
protection system was supplied and installed by the supplier, free of charge,
to provide protection against corrosion of the cable sheath.
Project Costs and Financing
3.16      The estimated and actual costs of the project components are
detailed in Annex 3 and a summary of comparison with the SAR estimates is

3.17      There have been large differences in estimated and actual costs of
some of the components. Thus between NEB's estimates and actual costs there
has been an underrun of 35% in the boiler cost and an overrun of 29% in the
turbo generator cost, see Annex 3. The differences are also large in some of
the other items. Actual expenditure ag-.inst "Transmission and Distribution
Equipment and Materials" is much higher than the SAR figure due to later

addition of transmission and sub-station projects. Foreign equipment prices
were significantly lower than SAR estimates and price and physical contin-
gencies have not been utilized. The overall project cost underrun is about
10%, increasing to about 17% if later addition of transmission components is
not considered. The underrun on Prai is approximately 20%. Bank loan of
US$35 million was unutilized to the extent of US$3.23 million, of which US$3.0
million was cancelled in December 1981.
Sources of Finance
3.18      NEB secured finance for the project from the following sources:
(a)  IBRD, US$31.77 million at 8-1/2% interest, repayable in 15 years.
(b)  EXIM Bank Japan, M$88.9 million at 5% interest, repayable in 13
years.
(c)  OECF Japan, M$42.4 million at 3-114% interest, repayable in 13
years.
(d}  Bharat Heavy Electricals India, M$32.2 million at 7-1/2% interest,
repayable in 11 years.
(e)  Government of Malaysia, M$13.1 million at 7-1/2% interest, repayable
In 10 years.
(f)  Balance of about M$105 million from NEB's internal generation and
local borrowings.
Disbursements
3.19      A comparison of actual disbursements against the Bank loan versus
appraisal estimate is shown in Annex 4. Actual disbursements as percentage of
the SAR disbursements are tabulated below:

The delayed disbursements are due partly to procurement delays,
parcly to exteLnsion of construction period due to increased scope of the
transmission project and delays in its implementation, partly to deferment of
procurement by NEE to suiit the revised project requirements and partly due to
cost savings.
Performance of Consultants
3.20      The performiance ut consultants working on Prai Thermal station was
satisfactory. Their performance on the 13 kV transmission and sub-station
project was satisfactory except in respect of inspection of conductors for
which they sub-contracted wor;. to a local firm to whom they did not provide
adequate guidelines. The overall performance of consultants for civil designs
was satisfactoryy aIthough there were delays in revising foundation and
substructure designs. There were some problems in the beginning with the
Rural Electrification consultant with regard to scope of work and methodology
of data collection. With NEB's active interaction, the consultant produced a
report of acceptable standard.
Reporting
3.21 NEB sub-mitted a toLal of 28 quarterly financial reports for the whole
project over the period 1977 to 1983. The format of these reports was useful
in monitoring the financial commitments on the project. In addition, NEB
submitted a total of 19 quarterly reports over the period 1976 to 1980
reviewing physical progress on the Prai thermal power station. These reports
dealt with each contract till its completion and presented bar charts of
actual versus planned progress. NEB's reporting was good. Its consuLtants
also submitted quarterly reports on the 132 kV transmission system engineered
by them.
Procurement
3.22      There was a case of misprocurement on the contract for Structural
Steelwnrk and Cladding.  NEB and its consultant recommended award of the
contract to the lowest evaluated prequalified bidder. The Treasury, however,
directed NEB to award the contract to the second lowest evaluated bidder
despite the fact that the consultant had expressed doubts about the capability
of this bidder to perform, on the basis of technical deviations and the local
subcontracting arrangements. The Bank disagreed with the Treasury's decision
and the contract was treated as a misprocurement. However, the Bank agreed to
iltiLize available funds for financing of other project components. Apart from
this, there were no other major procurement problems concerning IBRD con-
tracts. In the early phase of procurement, appreciable correspondence took
place between the Bank and NEB as NEB did not fully appreciate Bank's procure-
ment policies, especially with regard to commercial matters. Subsequent
procurement actions proceeded more smoothly. 1/
3,23      IGB procedures were followed for all Bank financed contracts, as
wail as for contracts ultimately financed by Supplier's credits. The Bank
permitted NEB to use from its stock, 11 kV distribution materials, valued at
about US$550,000, that NEB had procured subsequent to signing of the Bank loan
and following ICB procedures.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Prai Thermal Station
4.01      The operating performance of Prai as briefly narrated here is based
on discussions with NEB engineers in the head office and the operating staff
of NEB during the site visit on April 6, 1985.
Operating Efficiency
4.02      The overall operating efficiency of the three 120MW units has been
satisfactory. The plant has been demonstrated to produce the rated output at
the guaranteed heat rate. The average annual heat rate of 10,114 kJ/kWh is
considered satisfactory.
Operating Problems
4.03      There have been major problems in (a) air heater corrosion which is
being tackled by providing stainless steel liner plates and Magnesium Oxide
dosing; (b) condenser tube leakages due to sea water quality being slightly
different from what was assumed; condenser tubes are being tested by eddy
current test and those having thickness below 50% are being plugged; and (c)
boiler furnace with regard to tube and other leakages.
4.04      While the efficiency of the plant has been good, there have been a
number of problems in actual operation, as indicated from the hours of forced
outage of the units over the period 1980 to 1984. Details of the outages are
maintained. In the year of commissioning, forced outage times include some
periods for testing.

/a   Prolonged outage due to fire in the ducting below one of the burners.
4.05      On an average, the forced outage rate of the units has been about
8.2% over the period 1980 to 1984. There is an improvement in the forced
outage rate in 1984 to about 4.6% and it is expected that the figure will
further reduce with the experience gained and modifications being introduced
by NEB. The outage rates are considered within acceptable range for good
operating practice.
4.06      There have been innumerable problems with the control and instrumen-
tation equipment and this has entailed considerable maintenance work. The
Data Acquisition systems (DAS) of the three 120MW units, based on Hewlett
Packard computers, are obsolete and non-operational due to lack of parts and
system support from the supplier. NEB should look into this and install
modern DAS systems to assist the staff and improve operational efficiency.
Engineering, Design and Operation and Maintenance
4.07      The engineering and design of the plant is generally satisfactory.
The station was originally designed for extension by 3 x 60MW units, whereas
3 x 120MW units were actually installed in stage 3 to achieve better effic-
iency and lower unit cost. This necessitated construction of separate admin-
istration, workshop, stores and water treatment buildings, which has led to
minor operational inconveniences. There is no heavy duty store for which a
need is felt.
4.08      The station employs 600 people which is high.  NEB is adopting the
practice of giving out major maintenance and overhaul works on contract with a
view to reducing permanent personnel requirements in the unskilled and semi-
skilled categories.
4.09      As elsewhere in the system, NEB has been facing problems in
recruiting and retaining skilled personnel and engineers. The required degree
of competence for operating and maintaining the DAS system is not available at
Prai.



- 16 -
4.10      In general, the plant is satisfactorily maintained, but there is
need to improve housekeeping.
EnvironmentaL Aspects
4.11      Prai Thermal Station is located in the port area and is surrounded
by industries such as PVC, textiles, palm oil, steel mill, sugar refinery
etc. There is thus a significatit level of environmental pollution in the
neighbourhood of Prai.
4.12      Circulating water system studies, indicated in the SAR were
conducted at the Danish Hydraulic Institution. Based on these studies a mole
was constructed for directing the hot water discharge away from the intake.
As a result, acceptable cooling water temperature and condenser vaccum have
been realized.
4.13      A tank drainage effluent treatment system was installed after the
plant was commissioned. Steps are being taken to treat boiler wash water
before being discharged into the sea. A local consultant has been appointed
to study this problem as also the problem of oil leaks in drains and recommend
a Waste Water Treatment plant. A high level of dust deposition has been
observed in the area surrounding the power station. This is most likely due
to the steel mill in the vicinity. Four monitoring stations have been
installed to study this problem.
4.14      The station regularly submits reports to the Environmental
authority. An inspection of some of the waste water pollution reports show
that monitoring parameters such as temperature, PH value, suspended solids,
iron and free chlorine are well within regulation limits. Measurements of
gaseous SO2 level are carried out at diffirent locations, about 300 meters
away from the chimney. The levels range from 0.2 to 0.4 mg S02 per 100 square
centimeters per day and compare favorably with Central Electricity Generating
Board UK classification for "low" concentration which is 0.5mg S02/100 sq.cm/day.
Air Pollution
4.15      The deposition of particulate matter ranges from 10 to 40 tons/sq
km/month in different locations. This is higher than standard industrial
complex zone classification of 11.8 tons/sq km/month. This is very likely due
to neighboring industrial plants, but the matter is being investigated by NEB.
Switchyard Insulator Pollution
4.16      Contrary to what one might expect for a station so close to the sea
and other industries, no problems have been experienced at Prai due to pollu-
tion of switchyard insulators. This is due to low sea salt density, low sea
breezes and frequent rainfall.
Transmission Lines, Substations and Distribution Systems
4.17      There have been no significant problems in the transmission,
substation and distribution components of the project. Minor problems in



- 17 -
control equipment and oil leakages in transformers at Papan substation were
rectified during the testing and commissioning stages.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Results
5.01      NEB's income statement, balance sheet and funds flow statement with
actual results and original projections for the period FY75 to FY81 are shown
in Annex 5. The results are summarized in the following Table 5.1.
5.02      Energy sales during the period FY75 to FY81 increased at an average
annual rate of 11.9% as compared to the appraisal estimate of 13.6%. The main
reasons for the lower than forecast sales growth are steep tariff adjustments
between 1975 and 1980 and world-wide recession which resultea in the close
down of a number of tin mines in 1981. During the first oil crisis in 1975
the government introduced fuel cost variation charges (FCVC) which allowed
100% recovery of fuel cost increases from industrial users. As a result,
conservation measures were initiated and actual consumption in 1976 was 8%
lower than projected. In 1979, the government stopped the application of FCVC
but approved a 13% increase in rates. The adustment was insufficient and NEB
reported a net loss in FY80. In an effort to improve NEB's finances, the
government exempted the Board from paying taxes and dividends from FY80 to
FY84. In addition, tariff was further adjusted in FY81 (52% increase in
December 1980, with abolition of FCVC and restructuring of tariff to a
progressive block rate). At the end of FY81, the Board was able to report a
net profit again (M$96 million), with average rate per kWh at Mc20.2, almost
twice the appraisal estimate of MC10.4.
5.03      While the magnitude of both revenue and costs were underestimated
(actual average annual increases of 28% and 29% respectively as against 16%
and 15Z prejected at appraisal), total capital investment for this period
followed the forecast quite closely. With government equity injections and
contributions to rural electrification projects, coupled with revised tariffs
which required capital contributions from industrial and commercial consumers,
NER's borrowings were lower than forcast. During the period FY75-81, the
Board had no difficulty in raising funds required to finance its development
program. A comparison of actual and projected financing plan of the Board for
the period FY75 to FY81 is detailed in Annex 6.
Financial Targets
5.04      With the introduciton of FCVC in 1975, NEB experienced little
difficulty in meeting the financial covenants agreed under this loan during
the initial years. During negotiations of subsequent loans, namely, Eighth
Power Project (Loan 1443-MA, effective January 1978), Ninth Power Project
(Loan 1808-MA, effective November 1981), Rural Electrification Project (Loan
2146-MA, effective January 1983) and Eleventh Power Project (Loan 2438-MA,
effective August 1984), revisions to the original covenants were adopted.
NEB's compliance with the key financial targets are summarized in Table 5.2.

specified in accordance with the fixed capital formation deflator, using FY70 as the base year.



- 19 -
5.05      For the years FY75 to FY77 NEB complied with the covenanted
requirements of rate of return on historical value of assets, debt service
coverage and short term debt limitation. In FY78 the rate of return covenant
was related to revalued assets, but NEB was unable to comply with this
covenant in FY78 and FY79 mainly due to rapid increases in fuel prices.
Government took remedial measures such as permitting tariff changes from FY79,
exempting NEB from taxation and payment of dividends and injecting equity into
NEB's resources.  From FY80 onwards the rate of return covenant was replaced
by the self financing ratio covenant with which NEB has complied from FY81
onwards. NEB has also complied with the debt equity ratio covenant which was
introduced from FY78 onwards. Bank's covenants on liquidity have undergone
three changes - in FY78, FY81, FY83 - in recognition of NEB's needs as a
rapidly growing entity supporting a large construction program. Deviations
from the liquidity covenants from FY78 to FY82 were minor. By 1983, NEB's
current ratio was 1.0, marginally lower than the covenanted level of 1.1.
This was mainly due to large payables of retention amounts on projects under
completion. NEB nas not experienced any serious liquidity shortage in all
these years and it has projected a current ratio of 1.2 by 1985.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01      At appraisal NEB was a financially sound, well organized and oper-
ated public utility. Its management structure had been reorganized in the
year 1973-74, based on a consultant's recommendations which took into account
the government's policy of providing a more equitable distribution of jobs
among the various races. NEB had an efficient finance and accounting organiz-
ation; however it experienced some difficulty in recruitment and retention of
qualified staff. It ran a comprehensive staff training program, under its
Education and Training department and planned to construct a training school
for technicians and clerical cadres. The project aimed at institution build-
ing as indicated in para 2.05. NEB's institutional development in the period
1975 to 1985 is narrated below.
Organization Structure
6.02      Notable changes introduced since the time of SAR are:
(a) Incorporation of a corporate audit department directly responsible
to the General Manager.
(b) Creation of a post of Deputy General Manager Major Projects.
(c) Shitting of the Commercial Manager to the Administration department
under Deputy General Manager Administration.
(d) Setting up of a separate Rural Electrification department (including
Minihydro) under a Chief Engineer, directly responsible to the
General Manager.
(e) Setting up of a separate Materials Management department directly
responsible to the General Manager.

(f)  Institution of a "Technical Planning" department, under Deputy
General Manager Development Planning, responsible for studies such
as Energy Utilization, Tariff and System Platning. Under Bank's
Loan 2438-MA, NEB will be engaging the services of experts to review
and advise measures to strengthen its corporate planning capabil-
ities.
A review of NEB's organizational efficiency was made by a firm of management
consultants itn 1982. NEB appointed a senior management committee and various
subcommittees to implement some of the recommendations of the consultant which
were aimed at making thle management structure more effective.
Manpower and Training (The Training Institute)
6.03      A problem that has always been faced and continues to be faced by
NEB is the recruitment and retention of technically and managerially qualified
manpower and an excess of semi-skilled and unskilled manpower. NEB con-
structed in 1982, at a cost of M$70 million, a Training Institute to cater to
all. Power Utility operations. This is one of the largest institutes of its
kind in the worLd. The institute has a staff of 320, conducts about 230
courses a year (for 3000 to 4000 personnel) related to diverse subjects like:
(a)  Basic Techinical skills;
(b)  Administration and Finance;
(c)  Management and Supervisory development; and
(d)  General and Physical education.
Training is given to new recruits as well as to existing NEB personnel for
whom it is compulsory for promotion.
6.04      The Training Institute houses a thermal po:er plant simulator,
simulating the Prai thermal station control room. The simulator is computer
based and the software mathematically models the operation of the plant.
Consequent to the experience gained with the Prai simulator NEB is procuring a
simulator for the multi fuel fired 300MW Port Klang thermal units. The
simulator will be financed under Bank Loan 2438-MA.
Accountir.g Budgeting and Data Processing
6.05      NEB's accounting systems conform to modern utility practices and
accourting applications at Kuala Lumpur have been computerized. Under Bank
Loan 2438-M4A NEB will install 'Distributed Source Data Generation Project'
wnich will transmit data from districts directly to the EDP center in Kuala
Lumper, using the Telecom Malaysia's Packet Switching Network, which is set up
by the Government as basic infrastructure. This will considerably improve the
efficiency of Accounting and Management Information system of NEB.
6.06      NEB also has plans for the following:



-22-
(a)  Computerized billing system linking the districts with the center.
(b)  Microcomputer project for technical applications and inventory
control of 70 district stores.
(c)  Computerised Materials Management system - Purchasing, Supply,
Stores Accounting and On Line Inventory Control.
(d)  Credit Control Project - Consumer Billing, Revenue Accounting,
Deposit Accounts (on line access to district bank accounts),
customer services.
(e)  Capital Works Job Accounting.
(f)  Fixed Assets and Depreciation Accounting.
(g)  Investment Forecasting.
Billing and Collection
6.07      The billing and collection system has been streamlined with on-the-
spot billing and collection through district offices, post offices and
agents. The customer's accounts receivables outstanding are about 50 day
billing.
Audit and Internal Control
6.08      NEB's accounts are audited by the Auditor General, who has engaged
the services of external auditors. Although NEB is able to produce unaudited
accounts within six months of fiscal year ending, the audited accounts take
about nine months due to delays in the Auditor General's department. The cor-
porate audit department of NEB is fairly well staffed with qualified manage-
ment experts, engineers and accountants.  Measures for augmenting and training
of staff are constantly in progress.
System Planning, Operation and Control
6.09      NEB has developed considerable inhouse expertise in generation and
transmission planning and owns and uses computer programs for generation and
transmission investment planning. Under Bank Loan 1808-MA NEB will be employ-
ing specialists to review and recommend measures for further strengthening its
system planning capabilities. NEB has a computer assisted Load Despatch
Center at Kuala Lumpur and plans to introduce regional control centers.
Institutional Performance
6.10      The key figures relating to institutional performance over the
period 1977 to 1983 are reproduced below. The figures for consumers per
employee and sales per employee may be regarded as substantially constant over
the seven year period. This is due to the rapid growth in non-technical and

IMG!' cadres required to man growing district wise and rural electrification                  -
operations as well as NEB's decision to take security staff in its employ. To
improve this situation NEB has imposed a freeze on the recruitment of
unskilled category of staff since 1981.

structure and capabilities since the time of the SAR.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01      An economic reevaluation of the 3x12OMW Prai Thermal station has
been done, essentially on the line of the SAR. The main points which high-
light the differences between the data and assumptions used in the SAR and
those used in this reevaluation are summarized below.
1/   Industrial and Manual Group:  semiskilled and unskilled.



- 24 -
Plant Capacity Factor
7.02      The SAR had assumed a constant capacity factor of 80% and a 30 year
plant life. It, however, assumed much lower energy generation in the first
three-five years of plant operation. With the present policy of moving away
from oil for power generation, energy production from Prai will decline over
the years. The PCR uses actual capacity factor values from 1980 to 1984 and
values declining from 65% in 1985 to 30% in the year 2004 as shown in Annex 7,
assuming a plant economic life of 25 years.  The capacity factors are based on
NEB's prediction of the operation of Prai Thermal Station as visualized
today.  This scenario could change in later years if Prai is converted to gas
firing following stage 3 of the gas pipeline project, for which plans at
present are only tentative.
7.03      The SAR's economic evaluation is based on a 1975 fuel oil price of
M$204/ton and a fuel efficiency of 0.225 kg/kWh yielding a fuel cost of
Me4.59/kWh.  With the sharp increase in oil prices from 1979 onwards, the fuel
oil price had risen to about M$450/ton in 1980 declining subsequently to about
M$433/ton in 1984. The PCR assumes actual fuel oil consumption and cost from
1980 to 1984 (in constant end 1980 prices) and 1984 value for the life of the
plant. The figures are indicated in Annex 7 and reflect a fuel cost level of
about M¢10.0/kWh.
Operation and Maintenance Cost
7.04      The SAR had assumed "System Operation Costs and Financial Costs for
T&D System' as MC3.3 per kWh sold. The PCR assumes actual operation and
maintenance figures for Prai thermal station for the period 1980 to 1984 (in
constant end 1980 prices) and 1984 value of M$18.7 million throughout plant
life. For the year 1984 this works out to MCO.88/kWh generated (Mol.04/kWh
sold). The operation and maintenance cost of the Transmission and
Distribution (TMD) system that could be reasonably associated with Prai
generation is evaluated on the following basis.
O&M cost of T&D         = Total System O&M cost       X      Prai Generation XO.85
associated with Prai  for T&D (including depreciation)  Total Energy Sales
The factor 0.85 assumes an energy loss of 15% for station use and in
the T&D system.  Actual figures are used for the period 1980 to 1984 (in
constant end 1980 prices) auAd 1984 value of M¢2.56/kWh generated (MC3.01/kWh
sold) for the life of the plant.
Benefits
7.05      The SAR evaluated the benefits from Prai at the rate of MC10.8 per
kWh sold, which was the approximate average incremental cost in 1975. Com-
pared to this, the average revenue per kwh sold in 1975 was M¢8.69/kWh.
7.06      The present day revenue per kwh sold for the entire system is of the
order of MC21/kWh (in 1980 prices). The PCR evaluates the benefits based on
actual revenue realized per kWh sold for the years 1980 to 1984 (in constant
end 1980 prices) and the 1984 value of MC21.29/kWh for the life of the plant.



- 25 -
EIRR Computation
7.07      Details of the economic evaluation are presented in Annex 7.  The
EIRR works out to 19.7%. The SAR had evaluated an EIRR of 11%.
7.08      The reevaluated EIRR of 19.7% compared to the SAR value of 11%,
indicates that although the fuel costs have gone up considerably, the
increases in tariff which were effected from 1978 to 1980, have been more than
compensatory and have resulted in a high level of return from oil fired
generation comparable to Prai Thermal Station. The much lower EIRR computed
in the SAR is also due to low energy generation assumed in the early years. A
sensitivity test, evaluating the benefit from 1984 onwards at MC19 per kWh,
which was the long run average incremental energy cost estimated in 1981 (ref.
SAR for eleventh Power Project), yields an EIRR of 14%.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
Achievement of Project Objectives
8.01      Construction of the Prai Thermal Station was a timely augmentation
of the generation capability of NEB, as borne out by the sustained load growth
at an average annual rate of 11.9%, which necessitated installation of 5 x 20MW
gas turbines in 1979 as the Temengor hydro project was delayed. As a matter
of interest, the gas turbines continue to meet system peaking requirements
even today. The Prai-Penang submarine cable installation not only augmented
supply to Penang and replaced costly generation on Penang island, but also
absorbed Prai generation to the extent of 90MW when transmission capacity to
Kuala Lunpur was restricted due to delays in the 275 kV line construction.
The present day loadings of the various project components are:
a)  Prai Thermal station                 -  Operates at 60-70% capacity factor.
b)  Prai-Penang submarine                -  88MW
interconnection
c)  Papan I8OMVA 275/132 kV              -  30MW (45MW when one of the three
autotransformers                        autos is out)
d)  Skudai-Majidee 132 kV line           -  148MW (approx.)
e)  Yong Peng-Batu Pahat                 -  20MW
132KV line
f)  132/22 kV Kota Tinggi                -  8MW
substation
8002      Loading of the Papan autotransformers which is low at present due to
over capacity is expected to increase substantially in the next two years.

8.03      Prai has been operating at between 60 - 70% capacity factor instead
of 80% assumed in the SAR.  Further, with shift away from oil fired generation
to gas, coal, and hydro (an indicative gas price of M$6.5/MBTU compares favor-
ably with oil price of M$10.8/MBTU for Prai) the capacity factor for Prai
operation will progressively reduce. Even so, the Prai Thermal station pro-
ject, achieves an economic internal rate of return of 19.7%, with benefit
evaluation based on present tariff level.
8.04      The Rural Electrification (RE) study accomplished under the project,
for the first time focussed systematically on the technical, socio-economic
and institutional issues of RE in the country. The study provided the basis
for the preparation of the RE project in Bank Loan 2146-MA. It was also
instrumental in the creation of a full fledged RE (cum Minihydro) department
in NEB, responsible for the planning function and area-wise agencies respon-
sible for implementation. Rural electrification in Malaysia is now proceeding
in a more rational manner although not at a rapid pace and a lot of develop-
ment work, both technical and socio-economic has been and is being accom-
plished with Bank's active interaction.
Project Implementation and Operating Outcome
8.05      Implementation of the Prai Thermal Power Station extension-with
3 x 120MW units has been achieved with a delay of about four to five months
(compared to SAR forecast) in spite of major delays in foundation construction
and commissioning of instramentation, largely due to the competent efforts of
NEB's team.  The team has coordinated the project well and taken timely
corrective action especially in expediting structural steel erection through
intensification of construction methods and equipment, in getting the cabling
system organized through taking over some of contractor's functions and in
commissioning the plant on schedule without all instrumentation, through use
of temporary controls.
8.06      Severe delays have been experienced in 132 kV system implementation
due to wayleave problems, civil works delays and poor performance of the 132
kV line contractor both in erection work and supply of conductors which were
defective. While this is a national problem, NEB needs to gear up its efforts
in organizing wayleaves. Also better coordination of civil works and exer-
cising greater care in selecting and coordinating the work of transmission
line contractors and intensifying factory inspection of materials would be
helpful.
8.07      Prai thermal station plant has achieved its guaranteed output and
efficiency. Forced outage rates in the last five years have been about 8%.
Though forced and planned outage rates are within acceptable limits they can
be further improved. NEB is taking necessary corrective action in plant
repairs and modifications and more efficient major overhauls through subcon-
tracting to external agencies.
Procurement
8.08      Inspite of Bank's involvement with NEB on a number of projects,
there continues to be substantial correspondence on tender documents,



- 27 -
resulting in procurement delays. This is primarily due to staff changes on
the borrower's side from one project to another. NEB needs to maintain con-
tinuity and consistency of approach on procurement matters under Bank loans
and follow Bank's procurement procedures more rigorously.
Performance of External Agencies
8.09      The Bank staff has worked closely with NEB on this project and there
have been six supervision visits, about one every year. This frequency is
adequate. NEB has extended excellent cooperation to Bank missions and are
appreciative of Bank's role in their power sector development.
