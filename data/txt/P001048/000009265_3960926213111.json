The project consists of: (a) construction and\n            improvement to paved road standard, and supervision by\n            consultants of two sections of the National Road Network\n            totalling about 600 km, (b) elimination of critical points\n            on about 1,500 km of the primary National Road Network to\n            ensure year-round accessibility, (c) development of a\n            routine maintenance policy for all rehabilitated portions of\n            the National Road Network, (d) studies by consultants of the\n            feasibility of improving about 600 km of the National Road\n            Network followed by a further 200 km of detailed engineering\n            and miscellaneous economic and technical studies related to\n            the transport sector, and (e) provision of fellowships for\n            training MTTP's (Ministry of Transport and Public\n            Works) staff and provision for technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1988-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
