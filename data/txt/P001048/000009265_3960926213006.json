Guinea's\n            transport sector is among the least efficient in the region\n            and one of the main obstacles to development. The Fourth\n            Highway Project attempts to improve Guinea's highway\n            sector. The project consists of: (a) construction and\n            improvement to paved road standard, and supervision by\n            consultants of two sections of the National Road Network\n            totaling about 600 km, (b) elimination of critical points on\n            about 1,500 km of the primary National Road Network to\n            ensure year-round accessibility, (c) development of a\n            routine maintenance policy for all rehabilitated portions of\n            the National Road Network, (d) studies by consultants of the\n            feasibility of improving about 600 km of the National Road\n            Network followed by a further 200 km of detailed engineering\n            and miscellaneous economic and technical studies related to\n            the transport sector, and (e) provision of fellowships for\n            training MTTP's (Ministry of Transport and Public\n            Works) staff and provision for technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1988-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
