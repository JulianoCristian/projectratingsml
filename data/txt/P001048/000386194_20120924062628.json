The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the performance of the Bank was satisfactory\n            while the Borrower's was deficient. Several lessons can\n            be learned from this project. First, adequate funds for\n            routine maintenance should be secured from user payments and\n            allocated to the project as counterpart funds. Second,\n            before the start of works, project counterpart funds\n            required for contracts should be completely paid up front as\n            an advance payment. Third, other generic issues, such as\n            procurement, custom duties, taxes, and procedures for\n            payment of local funds, should be addressed globally through\n            institutional development assistance. Fourth, technical\n            assistance should be made available for the short term, with\n            clear and monitorable objectives and performance indicators\n            that can be assessed frequently and included in the\n            consultants' contracts. Fifth, local staff should be\n            motivated and made responsible for project implementation\n            and sector management. Finally, the development of routine\n            maintenance, executed by private local contractors, should\n            include support to the MTPE road management unit."}, "docdt": "1997-06-05T10:27:01Z"}
