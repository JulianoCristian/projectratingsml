More\n            specifically, the project seeks to reduce the sector's\n            dependence on Government subsidies; help eliminate\n            bottlenecks in the Kingston area water distribution system,\n            and rehabilitate neglected water supply and sewerage\n            facilities. The project also plans to prepare a medium-term\n            investment program for NWC as well as feasibility studies\n            for extension of NWC's water and sewerage systems; and\n            to investigate and promote the use of low cost and\n            appropriate technology, principally for the rural areas. The\n            project comprises the following components: (i) technical\n            assistance to strengthen management and improve financial\n            information and billing systems; and (ii) purchase of\n            microcomputers, chlorination equipment, pumps, vehicles,\n            emergency generators, and equipment for water supply and\n            sewerage operations and maintenance upgrading. Further, the\n            project includes; (iii) modernization of workshop and stores\n            and elimination of water transmission bottlenecks in Kingston."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
