The overall objectives of the project were to: (a)\n            increase the access by rural and urban poor to medical care\n            services, especially for early detection of non-communicable\n            diseases (NCDs); (b) improve the quality of medical care in\n            public hospitals (PHs); (c) assist the country in protecting\n            the health of the population through a more effective\n            control of the safety of drugs and the quality of food, and\n            through monitoring NCDs; and (d) address critical health\n            sector policy issues focusing mainly on sector financing and\n            cost containment. Bank performance was generally\n            satisfactory in the preparation of this project. Borrower\n            performance during project preparation was satisfactory. Key\n            lessons that should be noted. The first is that project\n            implementation problems need to be resolved as early as\n            possible in the project's implementation period.  The\n            second lesson is that the project came to realize that\n            continuity problems were often caused by mandatory staff\n            rotation policies. It also found that, to some extent, these\n            problems could be mitigated by mandatory requirements for\n            better communication and cooperation between the outgoing\n            and incoming officers."}, "docdt": "1997-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
