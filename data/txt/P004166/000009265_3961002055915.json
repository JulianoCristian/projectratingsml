improve the quality of\n            medical care in public hospitals; (c) assist the country in\n            protecting the public health through more effective control\n            of the safety of drugs and the quality of food, and through\n            monitoring communicable diseases; and (d) provide\n            project-related training, and carry out a health care\n            policy-based action program and research studies. Four\n            project components support these objectives: (i) expanding\n            diagnostic and treatment capabilities of the National\n            Medical Center; (ii) upgrading equipment of the National\n            Institute of Health; (iii) replacing and adding medical\n            equipment in provincial and municipal hospitals; and (iv) an\n            action program addressing critical sector issues (hospital\n            efficiency, diffusion of medical technology, fee schedule)\n            supported by relevant research studies, publications on\n            health policy and financing, and a national consensus\n            building program."}, "docdt": "1992-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
