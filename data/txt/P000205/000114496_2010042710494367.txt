Re:
Credit No. 1968 BU (Second Urban Development Project)
Amendment to Development Credit Agreement
 Excellency:
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement (the Agreement), dated April 
14, 1989, concluded between the Republic of Burundi (the Borrower) and the 
International Development Association (the Association), for the Project captioned 
above, as amended to date.
Further to your request for an increase in the percentages of expenditures to be 
financed under the Credit during the difficult transition period being faced by the 
Borrower, we are pleased to inform you that the Association accedes to your request 
and hereby agrees to amend the Agreement as follows: 
"The percentages of expenditures to be financed under all Categories set 
out in the 
table set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Agreement, are 
increased from their 
current levels to read as follows: 100% for foreign 
expenditures and 90% for local 
expenditures. This increase will be effective 
as of the effective date of this amendment and 
shall apply until December 31, 
1996.  As of January 1, 1997, all percentages will revert to 
their previous 
levels as they were in effect on December 31, 1994."
Please kindly confirm your agreement with this amendment by signing and dating 
the duplicate original copy of this letter in the space provided therefor and by 
returning to us one duplicate original duly signed and confirmed.
This amendment shall become effective upon receipt by the Association of one
