-       Burundi'" population is *xpected to grov from 47 million
inhabitants in 1985 to over 7.4 million inhabitants in the
year 2000, increasing the already high pressure on scarce
land resources. Future expansion of cultivated areas and
necessary increases in agricultural production per unit of
land vill require groving monetary production expenditures
that thé farmers vill be able to face oaly if their
pr-sently low and stagnating monetary income grous at least
by 62 per year over the long term. This vill oaly be
possible if the domestic market for farm productr increases
accordingly.
°       The long term objective of the project ia to make this
possible through a better division of labor b-tween urban
and rural areas, the strengthening of urban rural linkages,
the development of employment opportunities in urban areas
and an acceleration of the urban population growth rate,
particularly in secondary towns.
-       On the short term, thé main project objective is to
*trengthen the economy of secondary towna and of their
hinterland. To this end, the project vould seek to
establish an institutional and financial environzent vhich
vill enable these secondary contera to provide employment,
infrastructure and services which would have a r-gional
impact and could thus benefit both the urban and
neighboring rural residents.
*         Proiect Description
The proposed project vould include the folloving components in five
secondary centers Gitega, Ngozi, Kayanza, Rumonge and Bururi, and in
Bujumbura.



Cv)
(a)     Promotion of Artisans:  t.chnical and financial assistance,
provision of vorkshops and stores, creation of activity
creas and » chine/training center*, and provision of
Installation and *quipent credits;
(b)    Uparadina of Infrastructures roade and drainage, mainly in
the urban low-incom areas that are the vorst served in
this sennet
(c)    Bousinas  upgrading of 1S ha and developsent of 30 ha at
Ga*nyi, on the northern outakirte of Bujumbura, and
opening up of nev areas at Gitega, Ruronge, Ngosi and
Eayansa.  This component also includes provision for
housing credits mainly for lov income families in Bujumbura
and Gitega, and creation of a Housing Fund;
(d)     Community Facilitioss markets vith sheds, *mall chopa,
stores, cold storage rooms and slaughterhouses. Social
facilities:  five health centers; and a community hall at
Gasenyl;
(e)     Institutional Strenatheriinzs  technical assistance for the
communes, upgrading of commune resources, reinforcement of
financial services and reform of the legislation governing
commune finances, creation of an Urban Equipment Fund for
Secondary Centers, and a study on communal resources;
(f)     Trainings  for communal financial and technical staff, and
for project staff; and
(g)     Prolect Coordinations  to be the responsibility of a
project unit established in Bujumbura. the necessary
technical assistance and facilities will be financed by the
IDA Credit.
B-nefit-s       The project vill improve the living conditions in Gasenyi
(Bujumbura) and the five secondary towns, and vill provide
650 new serviced plots in Gasenyi.  The project vill aiso
strengthen the operations of existing urban institutions
and contribute to the development of nev institutions:
ECOSAT, Housing Fund and Urban Equipment Fund for Secondary
Centers. Finally, the project vill help employment
generation by promotion of artisans and increase monetary
imcome of the urban as vell as rural population in the
towns covered by the project and in their hinterland.
Riakss          The main risks faced by the project are those derived from
veaknesses of local authorities. Specific measures,
including a high degree of instit_tional support, have been
included as part of the project to limit these risks.

lncluding it s*har- of Lake Tanganyika, Burundi totale 27,835 km2.
1.02     With an estimated Gross National Product of US$240 p-r capit-,
Burundi La one of the world's least d-veloped countriles The ov-r-ll
literacy rate in *bout 25%, and basic social infrastructure is still
l-cking. Limited natural resources, population pressure, scarcity of
qualified and expetienced manpower, and irolation from main trade routes
are the main contributors to the country9s poverty.
B.Population
1.03     Burundi had a population of &bout 4.7 million inhabitants in 1985
(sa* Annex 1). Wlth a population den lty of 180 par km2, it i8 the second
most densely populated country in Afric-. About 4.4 million people t942 of
' ~the total population) are scattered in rural arease
j     ~1.04     The dominant flow of internal migration han been from east to veut
over the past 20 ye-re. The n wly d-veloped lowlands of the Rumzis River
plain and the lake short, as w ll sa the metropolitan developm nt around
Bujumbura, have been two main factors contributing to this migration. In
rec-nt years, *ome movement into the *a t-rn lowlande han alto occurred.
However, thies- internal migr-tory mov mente are not a dominant factor in
the de=ography of the country and have been far lots important than
international migration. The outflow is mainly economic in natures
cyclical mal& lgbor emigration to the farms, plantations, and mines of
Ug nda, Tanzania, and Zaire. No *ccurate information is *v-llable on the
scale of migration. Irmmlgration vas coming mainly from Zaire, but th se
inflovs have almost stopped.
Population Growth
1.05     The population in increaslng at a rate of &bout 3% a year, because
of a r-pid decllne of mortality rate and a high f-rtility rate (6.5
childr-n par woman). Average llfe *x-p-ctancy is 45 years for mon and 48
ye-rs for women. Population projections for the 1985-2015 p-riod are *hown

Sources  World Bank Projections, 1987.
1.06     Given the already high denaities of population and the low rate of
urbanization, rapid population growth vill remain one of the main reasono
for concern over the next 25 years. Although medium-term prospects are not
favorable, regional migrations (among the Great Lake countries) must b-
con.idered as an element of the long term development strategy and one of
the major issues of regional competition with neighboring couatries.
Unlike the past, when agricultural growth could be obtained with little
monet-ry means, future expansion of cultivated areas, conservation and
lmprovement of soil fertility, and the necessary improvement in
environmental protection vill require larger investments and greater use of
cash inputs, roquiring an average growth rate of monetary expenditure in
the order of 6% per year. Given the amall aise of the rural market for
non-agricultural goods and services and the low level of productivity of
non-agricultural activities in rural areas, it is unlikely that these
actlv4ties can become a main source of growth of rural incomes. Long-term
prospects for growth of cash income per farmer from export crops are also
limited.  The major source of growth of farmers' monetary incomes in the
medium and long term vill ther-fore be the expanion of the domaetic market
for food pi:oducts, possibly *nhsnced by an intensification of food trade
vithin the Great Lakes region resulting froa  *pecialization. A demographic
i ,ai.modal linking population distribution and *conomic grovthl shows
that urban population growth rates of 102 over the long-t-rm vould allow
farmers to cope vith increasing costs of agricultural production while
ensuring a reasonable growth of the net monetary income required for rural
modernization. In contrast, continuation of present urbanization trends
vould inavoidably lead to a stagnation followed by a regression cf net
monetary incomes of far-ers, vhich vould have dramatic implications for
whole economy.

C   The lrban 8ato.:
1.07     At firat $lance, the urban sector do«s not appear to play a
strmteg1c role ln the development of Burundi. Only 310,000 people (62 of
the total population) live in 22 urban centerl, as *et fortn by decre- No.
100113 of March 11, 1986 (net Annex 2). Up until nov, significant urban
dev-lopm nt ha. been confined to the Bujumbura area, which nov ha* a
population of &bout 230,000 inhabitants. The second city of burundi,
Cit-ga, only has 11,000 inhabitants(se. Anmnx 3).
Urban Pc.licy
1.08     Burundi b-cam- part of German East Africa in 1885, as a result of
the Berlin Congrass. The Germans founded Git-ga *o as to have the capital
city at the geographic center of the country. At t!ue turn of the century,
the city grew rapidly, but this dev-lopment vas hampered by Christian
missionari.s. They played an important role in the development of Burundi,
but mainly in the countryside, as they did not vant to be close to Muslim
Swahilis who were installed in the towns for trade. After World War I,
Burundi vas mandated to Belgium and urbanization vas confined to Bujumbura,
dloser to the B-lgian Congo and administrative capital of the combined
'Ruanda-Urundi.
1.09     Since its independence, in 1962, the same policy prevailed for
various reasonss priority given to agriculture in order to meet the needs
of a groving population and vish to avoid additional constraints on
Government resources for public services such as housing, energy, vater
supply, etc. As a consequence, Bujumbura grev rapidly during the 1950's
and the 1960's at annual rates of 6-92, but its growth slowed down during
the 1970's to a current figure of 3-52 per year. In secondary centers,
growth rates have been highly unstable, vith periods of negative growth or
stagnation folloving restrictions on informal activities and trade.
Hoevwer, the need for decentralization and mobilisation of local resources
has progressively emerged during the 4th Development Plan (1983-1987). In
the Ministry of Planning, a nev directorate in charge of regional planning
(Departement de la Planification et de l'Amenagement du Territoire)
assisted by CEPRAT (Centre d'etude de la planification regionale et de
l'umenagement du territoire) has undertaken a series of tasks aiming at a
regionalization of the planning process. However, ths work vas mainly
foeussed on rural development isaues and rural areas, the 21 secondary
urban centers being put under the responsibility of the Ministry of Public
Works and Urban Development (MTPDU). For want of credit and qualified
personnel, little has been done so far in favor of these secondary towns,
except in the field of studies vith the preparation of a fev urban master
plans. Some ministries vere partly moved to Gitega but it is not clear
whether this procesa of decentralization of central administration vill
continue, given its inconveniences for both civil servants and the
administration itaelf.

1.10     The pr.paration of tbh  Fifth Development Plan (1988-1992) gave
ris. to an ln-depth debate on long-tera challen8es and the need for a
national urbanisation *trategy. It has been shown that an accelerution of
urban growth rates, both in Bujumbura and in secondary townr is a
necessary condition for modernisation of egrieulture, long-teru food
security, employaent generation und acceleration of GDP  nd income growth
ratea L'VUnion pour le Progres National (UPRONA) and the former Couicil of
Ministers discussed and approved guidelines for a national urban policy
(se- Annex 4) that vill serve as a corner atone to the vhole Fifth
Dev-lopent Plan. The main thruat of these guidelines, is to improve the
division of labor betveen rural and urban area, and to  xpand the
exchaxiges b-tueen Bujumbura, the secondary tons and their rural
hinterlands. The doubling of the présent average grovth rate of the urban
population vill be made possible by providing incentives to the development
of employment in the local (urban-rural) *conomy. These guidelines for a
national urban policy have been clearly endorsed by the nev government of
the Third Republic and a s*uary stateient should be submitted to the
Association prior to negotiations.  The nev nmme of the Ministry of Public
Works and Urban Developmont symbolizes this new emphasis on urbanisation,
and the newly appointed province governors are villing to play an active
role. During project implementation, updated three-year lnvestment and
public expenditures programs would be submitted each year, by October 31,
to IDA for its review and comments, and the Government would ansure that
investments in the urban sector are justified.
1 11     Although the draft of the Fifth Devolopment Plan is not yet
available, the folloving operations would be undertaken:
- institutional strenRtheningt creation of 4 local branches of
the General Directorate of Urbanism and Housing in Gitega,
Ngozi, Bururi, and Bujumbura;
- development of 5 secondary towns: Gitega, Ngozi, Kayanza,
Rumonge and Bururi with the assistance of IDA: this in part of
the proposed second urban development project presented
hereafter;
- uysradina of infrastructure and community facilities in amaller
townvs (Cankuso, Rutana, Karuzi and Makamba) with the
assistance of the United Nations Capital Development Fund
(UNCDF) ($3 million plus local contribution of FBu 20 million)
and
- continuation of action undertaken in Bulumburas iL the field
of improvement of municipal service, land development and
housing, cosumnity facilities and promotion of artisns.

D. Urban Institutions
1.12     The local administration vas r-organised by Decree-Lav No. 1/29 of
September 24, 1982.  The number of provinces vas increased from 8 to 15 end
the number of districts, or 'comunes  from 79 to 114.  Most of the
provinces haie a mall urban center, vhiceh is closely linked vith rural
developuent and could serve as a catalyst of economic activity and as the
delivery point for the provision of improved services. Decentralisation of
urban grovth, by lncreasing investments in sel-cted secondary centers, has
been a major goal of the Governent'. Fourth and Fifth Five-Tear Plas. The
local finances vere r-organised in J nuary 1984, principally to incr-a-e
local involvement and responsibility. In particular, nev taxes vera
established, wiech are to be coll-ct-d by the comunes.
1.13     The principal institution in th. urban sector is th  MTPDU.
Within this Ministry, the Directorate of Urbanism and Housing (DGUH) is in
charge of carrying out the Governnent's housing policy and provides overall
guidance on urban and regional development strategies. It is also
responsible for the construction of infrastructure, roads and public
buildings, The ministry controls two public housing corporations
responsiblo for construction of relatively high-standard housing chiefly
for civil servantss the National Housing Office (Office National du
Logement, ONL) and the Public Housing Corporation (Sociéti Immobiliere
Publique, SIP). ONL is now working as a contractor for SIP. A new housing
institution vas created by Decree No. 100/53 dated March 31, 1987, under
the name of ECOSAT (Encadrement des Constructions Sociales et Aménagement
des Terrains), for the purpose of taking over and moritoring the low-cost
housing projecta undertaken in association vith the United Nations Capital
Development Fund (Musaga) and the World Bank (First Urban Project), and to
carry out nev projecta of this kind. This agency may provide an
opportunity to bring *moe uniformity to the methods used in implementing
the various projecta in the field, and to regularize the procedures
(specifically, land-tenure and cost-recovery arrangements).
1.14     The National Bank for Savinigs and Invastment (Caisse Centrale de
Mobilisation et de Financement, CAMOFI) and the National Bank for Economic
Development (BNDE) are the public agencies involved in housing finance.
CAMOFI vas created in 1977 and restructured in 1979 to transform short-term
deposits into medium- and long-term loans for housing finance, primarily to
SIP. BNDE has been a major source of financing for private homebuilders
and developers of high-standard housing as vell as for private industrial,
agricultural and tourism investment. Recently created (1984) in Gitega,
the COOPECs (see Annex 9) would be able to play an important role in
housing finance in the future because they plan to cru-te cooperatives in
every commune.
1 15     The two other most important urban institutions are the National
Urban Commission and th. National Water and Electricity Authority,
Regideso. The National Urban Commission's 24 members represent all
ministries vith an interest in urban development, including the Land Title
Office, plus the Municipality of Bujumbura and the Chamber of Commerce
representing the private sector. It is convened several times a year by
the Minister of Public Works to review projects under preparation and



6
provide broad policy guidance on the direction of urban growth and urbmn
inv-stment priorities.  Regideso plans, builds, and maintains vater,
electricity, and atreet lighting networka in major cities and townis.
1.16     Bujumbura has the only municipality of the country.  Municipal
administration is headed by the Mayor, who is appointed by the President of
the Republic and in responsible to the Minister of the Interior through the
provincial governor. The Municipality's major responsibiliti-s are
s*curity, garbage collection, markets, second"ry roads and drainsâe
ditches. On July 12, 1983 SETEMU was created (Regie des Service
Techniques Municipaux) as an autonomous &g-ncy responsible for maintenance
of roads, public buildings, drainage vorka, sanitation and garbage
collection and disposal (se- para. 1.29).   In other taows, the head of the
comune in the Communal Administrator, civil servant appointed by the
Minister of Interior and reporting to the Province's Governor. Having held
little power historically, the communes are insufficiently prepared to
respond to the new decentralization policy.  Therefore, strengthening the
urban management functions of the secondary centers has now become an
important issue, which is being addressed under the proposed project.
E. Employment
The Modern Sector
1.17     Assessment of actual employment trends is hampered by a lack of
comprehensive employment data. While information is available on
employment in the government sector, comprehensive data on the rest of the
economy is not readily available. At present, employment data for the
modern sector--the informal sector is even less covered--is compiled bys
(i) the Institut National de la Sécurité Sociale (INSS) for permanent
employment in the private and parapublic sectors and fixed-term employment
in the public sector; (ii) the Ministry of Civil Service on civil service
employment and salaries; and (iii) the Service National d'Etudes
Statistiques (SNES) and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (on
employment and wages in the modern sector).
Recent Employment Trends
1.18     In 1982, 2 out of a population estimated at 4.3 million, the
working age group (defined as age 15 to 64) amounted to 2.28 million, and
the active labor force to 2.26 million, of which 2.5 percent were in the
modern sector, 13.5 percent in the informal sector and 84 percent in
traditional agriculture. The public sector absorbed 66 percent of modern
employment (39 percent in the civil service and 27 percent by parastatals)
and the private sector the remaining 34 percent. During 1983-84 (data for
1985 is not available), the share of the parastatal sector increased to 31
percent while the private sector declined to 31 percent.  In terms of
modern sector distribution, agriculture has declined in importance; the
manufacturing share has remained relatively constant, while the
2/Data on population and employment provided by the 1979 Census were updated
by the Ministries of Planning and Labor in 1982.



7
construction and comerce sectors, more sensitive to conomic *hocki,
showed large fluctuations from year to year. The transport sector has been
quite important in employment creations it generated 14 percent of the new
permanent jobs in the modern sector in 1983 and 1984.
1.19     The near stagnation in modern sector employment grovth, as
lndicated by available statistice suggests that a large proportion of nev
entrants in the labor force *ither remain self-_mployed in agriculture or
seek employment in the informal or *mali scâle non-faru sector. Data on
the informal sector is v-ry scarce, hw ever. Ther- are no ttie *eries on
sector activities and employment.  The  nnual Censuses of informal
activities undertaken by the D-partement de l'Artisanat of the Ministry of
Trade and Industry suffer from inadequate definitions and survey methode.
Thi only r-liable sources ares the 1979 census; sub-sector studies carried
out by the Ministry of Labor and the University of Bujumbura which provide
mainly descriptive information on the nature of working conditions; and the
surveya of the informal sector in Bujumbura and secondary towms in 1986
which the World Bank helped finance.
The Informal Sector
1.20     Unlike many African countries, Burundi's informal sector is not
very active and remains predominantly a rural phenomenons only 15 percent
of informal non-farm employment is concentrated in urban areas. Moreover,
informal activities seldom constitute the principal occupation of the rural
labor force; they are rather sources of additional income for farmers?
particularly during the off season.  It la estimated that the informal
sector could absorb as much as 20 percent of nev entrants in the labor
force. Past evidence indicates, however, a much more modest growth or
indeed stagnation, as shown by the 1980 and 1986 Bujumbura surveys which
found that informal sector activities may have declined. The structural
and institutional constraints at the root of this situation are both
internal--inherent to the sector's functioning and hiring modes--and
external--related to Government policies toward the informal sector.
1.21     The main internal constraints concerns  the lack of qualifications
of the labor force, the lack of working capital and credit, and the poor
and sometimes temporary facilities, all of which limit the scope for
management and technical ekills. According to the 1986 Bujumbura *urvey,
respectively 80 and 95 percent of laborers and apprentices have bar-ly
primary school education.  The apprenticeship system, the main source of
technical and managerial skills transfer, does not facilitate improvement
in the organization of enterprises, in relative isolation from more
efficient ones. A typical informal entrepreneur in unable to undertake a
correct cost-pricing exercise; about 85 percent of enterprises do not have
an accouating system; and 92 percent do not have a bank account. The lack
of credit and facilities for stock storage which most informal enterprises
face forces tLem to order raw materials in amall quantities, only for their
immediate needs. Moreover, clients are often required to finance in
advance the cost of raw materials.



8
1.22     External constraints concern the institutional arrangements and
government policies. The Departement de l'Artisanat (vithin the Ministry
of Commerce snd Industry) has the responsibility to coordinate and promote
sector activities. Thé Code de l'Artisanat vhich regulates operation of
*mali scale enterprises, offers in theory the possibility for accons to a
Guarantee Fuud for small enterprisse, but this is not yet operationai.
Also, registration of tkiu 'Chambre des Netiersl gives enterprises the
possibility to qualify for public market bide. These efforts have had
little impact on the dev-lopmsnt of the sector, hovever, *ince they are not
adapted to the actual conditions under which Lt op-rat-e.  Public
procur eme nt orders are often too lar;., and the artisans who *ucc.-d in
being admitted to the 'Chambre des Hetiers are often unable to supply the
quantity r-quested vithin the deadline. Similarly, conditions of accose to
the Guaraute- ?und and to banking credit in general appear to be designed
for modern amall-scale enterprises rather than artisans.
1.23     Progrese has been made to stimulate the development of training
progrma and production facilities for the artisans (Urban I project). The
Department of Artisanat has also been involved in undertaking feasibility
studies for artisans. However, the Department's effectiveness in meeting
demanda for assistance is being hampered by a shortage of skilled staff,
particularly acut- in survay methode and legal expertise. In addition,
because the Ministry of Commerce and Industry deals mainly vith formally
registered firmo, the Department has had difficulties in defining an
operational framework relevant to the informal sector, and in coordinating
with other involved Ministries.
1.24     A major constraint to development of the sector stoemed from
strict regulations embedded in urban planning and migration policies, which
Ln the past permitted only few artisans to establish in towns. These
policies compelled most artisans to operate in the periphery of the cities
and therefore increa-ed the cost of reaching their clientele. These
regulations vers lifted by the new Government in September 1987. Alloving
more artisans to settle in townv would expand the market for their goodas nd
services, facilitate the provision of akills and technology necessary to
anoure the quality standards required to compote vith the formal sector,
and allow for the provision of other support services (c.g. credit) to
vhich artisans have no accesa in part because of the lack of legal statua.
1.25    In Jsnuary 1987, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Burundi
(CCIB) became thé Chamber of Commerce,Industry,Agriculture snd Artisanat.
It comprises 6500 members snd plans to open regional offices in Gitega,
Ngozi and Bururi, in addition to the existing Bujumbura office. This
institution vill play a major rol. in the implementation of the SSE-APEX
IDA financed project and vould be the executing agency for au artisans
project financed by the European Development Fund (EDF).  It vould play the
*ame role for the artisans component of the proposed project (se. para.
3.09).

*. Previose Iaak XIolvent ta the Sctor
1.26    The Bank has been involved in a  Tiret Urban Project (Credit 1049-
BU, signed on July 3, 1980, of US$15,0 million). The proj.ct includod, for
lujumburas
a. Neighborhood Upgradings provision of basic infrastructure to
6 lov-inco c n ighbornhodui
b* Serviced Plots:  preparation of about 700 sites and services
plots vith iuprov-d ro-ds, storu drainage, public vater and
*l.ctricity;
c. Housing loans for construction and ùiprov_ rt;
d.  Promotion of artissns through training units and cr-dits.
Construction of a training conter and vorkehope;
a. Community Facilitites construction of 6 and renovation of 13
primary achools. Rehabilitation of a market; nd
f. Improvement of Municipal Services through provision of
*quipment and technical assistance.
1.27    Under this Pirst Urban Project, Bujumbura vas able to redrcss the
most urgent deficiencies in existing developments, while laying the
foundations for efficient future growth. This involved, among other
thinga, demonstration of the feasibility of sites and service projecte and
of housing improvement loan program. Neighborhood upgradingwvaa initiated
through the building of community facilities and  modest level; of
infrastructure (standpipes, public lighting, street improvements). Efforts
were made to improve the recording of lsnd leases, to epedite the sale of
lots, and to improve thé procees of land registration. Overall, an
important part of Bujumbura's population snd virtually all householde b-low
the poverty threshold experienced an improvement in living standards. The
maintenance of streets, drains, and solid vastes facilities vas ensured
through the establishment of a nev Technical Services Department, properly
*taffed mad *quipped. This Technical Services Department has nov be-n
absorbed into an autonomous municipal corporation, SETEMU (ses para. 1.29).
1.28    The local *conomy va  also an issue given attention.  Market armas
vere provided vith grading and drainage improvements. Measures vere taken
to create neighborhood training units nd credit to assist artisans who
suff-red from a range of inadequacies, including inappropriat. tools and
deficient raw material supplies. Moreover, the project vas able to put
Bujumbur9's financs on a sounder footing. A Municipal Collection Bureau
vsz *stablished to collect charges for on-site infrastructure, artisan
credits, nd housing lon repayments. More importantly, it va called upon
to administer the property tax and rental value tax, formerly national
taxes which vere trensferred to the Municipality of Bujumbura in 1983.
Prom very low levels, these taxes nov contribute to about 50Z of
Bujumbura's local revenues which, at US$3.2 million, in 1986 have reached
US$20 per capita, representing an increase of 400% over the 1980 level.

II. Tas PROJECT
.Gentais
2.01     The proposed project is the result of a continuing dialogue
batween the Bnak and the Governmnt iaice the beginnaing of the Firot Urban
Project. At the Governuent'9 roquest, the Bank ment a mission to Purundi
in August 1985 to identify a second project in thé urban sector.  The
mission id-ntified the proposed project and discusmed terms of référence
for f-asibility studies vith the Government. The contract Was signed in
Febru-ry 1986 and the studios started in April 1986. The firet phaso vas
compl-ted in August 1986 and a preparation mission, in September 1986,
reviewed and disc'ased the firet phase report. The second phase vas
compléted in March 1987.  A pre-appraisal mission, in May 1987, and the
appraisal mission, in October 1987, reviewod and discussed the final. report
and reached agreoments vith the Governmont on thé project scope and
description.
Prol-ct Oblectives
2.02     Thé long-term objective of the project is to set the stage for an
accolération of the urban growth rate, particulary in secondary towns. This
vill be based on a better division of labor between rural and urban aroas,
on thé development of activities and employment in urban areas and on the
strengthening of urban-rural linkages.  The proposed project ponstitutes
the eorner atone of thé new urban oolicy. and muet bé considered as the
firet step of a longer-term process of modernization of Burundies economy,
that will have implications on all other soctors including agriculture (se.
para. 1.06). In the short term, in order to str-ngthen the economy of
secondary towns, the project would provide thé necessary infrastructure and
community facilities, as vell as employment opportunities, and would
establish the institutional and financial enviroument that would help these
seml-rural agglomerations to evolve into actual urban centers. The project
would expand thé expérience of the firet urban project in improving the
living conditions of thé urban population in Bujumbura and in five
secondary centers (Gitega, Ngozi, Kayansa, Rumonge and Bururi). It vould
do so mainly by upgrading éxisting lov-income néighborhoods.
Proléct Description
2.03     The proposed project vould includ- thé folloving components in
five secondary centerss Git-ga, Ngozi, Kayanza, Rumonge and Bururi, and in
Bujumbura (see map no. IBRD 20686).
(a) Promotion of Artisanss tochnical and financial assistance,
provision of workshops and stores, creation of activity areas
and machine/training centers,mnd provision of installation and
equipment crédits;



12
(b) UiDaradint of Infrastructures roads and drainage, mainly in the
urban lov-incom  are«s that art the voret served in this
sonne;
(c) Routin:s upgrading of 15 ha (450 plots) and developuent of 30
ha (650 ame  plots) *t Gasenyi, on the northern outakirte of
Bujumbura, and op.ning up of n w are« at Gitega (23 ha),
Rumonge (17 ha), Ngosi (9 ha) and Kayansa (9 ha). This
ccupon.nt also includes provision for hou ing credits mainly
for low incoe. fmsilies in Bujumbura and Git-ga, and cr-ation
of a Housing Fund;
(d) Comunitv Facilities: markets vith sheds, small *hops,
stores, cold storage rooms and slaughterhouses. At Rumonge
two sheds, a Customs Office and depot for goods being clear-d.
Social facilities:  five health contera; and a commanity hall
at Bujumbura (Gasenyi>;
(e) Institutional Strenftheninf:  technical assistance for the
comunes, upgradlng of commune resources, reinforcement of
financial services and reform of the legislation governing
commune finances, creation of an Urban Equipment Fund for
Secondary Centers, and a *tudy on communal resources;
(f) Trainin:s for communal financial and techni4c staff,and for
prolect AtAff A n
(g) Prolect Coordinations to be the responsibility of a project
unit established in Bujumbura. The necessary technical
assistance and facilities vill be financed by the IDA Credit.
Salaries of local personnel and operating costs vill be met
under the project for 3 years and, from the Government budget
thereafter.
Six primary echools had been initially included in the proposed project,
but it was recommended to include them in the Education Sector Development
Project (FY88). A detailed description of the project is given in Annex 5
and mape show the vorks to b. don. in &c&h of these centers (Mep. nos. IBRD
20686 to 20692).
Prolect Coat
2.04     The total cost of the project is estimated at FBu 3,136
million, US$24.1 million, of which US$13.7 million, or approximately 57%,
represents the foreign exchange componeant. Base cost estimates are
xpressed in prices as of January 1988. This cost includes refinancing of
an IDA Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$700,000, which vas approved
on June 15, 1987 for project preparation. Costs of works vere estimated on
the basis of consultants' preliminary design. Since goode and equipment
for project purposes would be imported free of customs duties and internal
taxes, base costs are net of tax liabilities. Taxes on locally procured
gooda (mainly cement and fuel) estimated at 6% of local conts of vorks have
been includ.d in the estimate. They *mount to FBu 24.5 million (US$0.189
million). The cost estimates are broken dowa by year and by town in Annex
6 and s*arized belows

This project vas included in the Goverimint'. PIP, reviewed by the Bank in
October 1987 and deemed acceptable. The Government vill have to pay about
US$0.5 million equivalent in 1991, 0.7 in 1992, 0.6 in 1993 and much lesa
in 1989 and 1990. This represents at mont 3% of the 1988 budget.
Procurement
2.07     Contracts for an aggregate value of US$ 6.1 million equivalent,
including contingencies vould be avarded on the basis of International
competitive bidding, in accordance with the Bank'a guidelines for
procurement associated vith major civil works and equipment. To the extent
practical, contracte vould be grouped in bid packages estimated to cost the
equivalent of US$500,000 or more each to permit efficient procurement. For
bid evaluation purposes, under international competitive bidding, a margin
of 15% or the value of th. applicable customs duties, whichever is lover,
vould be allowed for materials and equipment manufactured in Burundi. For
civil vorks contracta, a preference of 7.52 vould be applied to bide from
local civil vorks contractors. Review of tender documents prior to bid
avard would be required for civil vorks contracte above US$300,000 and for
equipment contracte greater then US$100,000.
2.08     A number of amall contracte of leJS than US$ 1.0 million (about 30
dispersed in 6 towns) totalling US$ 6.7 million equivalent not likely to
attract foreign suppliera would be avarded after competitive bidding
advertised locally but open al*o to foreign bidders. Thevs vould include
mainlys (a) office equipment, furniture and furnishinga for the Project
Unit, the local branches and the communal services and (b) construction
vorks.   The Bank's guidelines vill b. used for the selection of
consultants for technical assistance, training and atudies (US$ 3.9
million).

Supporting documentation for these vould b. retain.d by 'the  mplementing
agency" and made available for r.view by the Bank duriag supervision.  The
annual audits of the project accounts vould include a separate opinion on
the diaoursements made under the 80  proeedure.  All other diabursements
vould b. made against normal documentation sublmitted to the Bank. The
*chedule of Cr-dit diabursements,  iven in Ann«e 7, is bas-d on the

1995.
2.12     To anoure prompt availab`lity of funds for the project, a separate
Special Account (revolving fund) would be established, in US$ in the
'Banque de la Republique du Burundi' (BRB), with an initial deposit of
US$1.0 million. The Special Account opening balance vas calculated as the
equivalent of four months of IDA disbursem.nts from the proceeds of the
proposed Credit.   Th. Borrover would also open in BRB a Project Advance
Account with an initial deposit of FBu 50.0 million. Establishment of this
account, and the initial deposit, is a condition of effectivenesa of the
Credit. Agreement should be reached that, at the beginning of *ach year,
the Project Advance Account would be replenished up to the original amouat
of FBu 50.0 million.

1II.  lIRFUEMMT!Oz AND NAMOUMDNT
3.01     The organirationl structure adopted for the project aim  to build
upon a fev existing agenciesa  the Muaicipality of Bujumbura and the
comunes of Gitega, Ngoml, Kayanua, Rumonge and Bururil the Chamber of
Commerce, Industry, Agriculture and Artisanat (CCIB); the newly *utablished
ECOSAT (Encadrement des Constructions Sociales et Amenagement des
Terrains); the COOPECs (Cooperatives d'Epargne et de Credit) and the
Project Unit (PU>) vithin NTPDU. New unit., *uch au the local branches of
BPU, and Housiny Fund (HF), vill be created only where considered necessary
in order to get the tasks accomplishod. Mev unit. vould also be cr-ated in
order to fill obvious gape, as in the case of the Urban Equipment Fund for
Second"ry Conters (FEUCS).
A. Coordination
3.02     General coordination of the project vill b. the responsibility of
the Project Unit (BPU) established under the First Urban Project, vithin
MTPDU. BPU Branches vill be established in the five second"ry centers.
They vill report to BPU but vill vork closely vith the Governors (except
for Rumonge) and vith the Communal Administrators. Every branch vill b.
composed of a manager, a civil *ngineor, a secretary, a driver, a clerk and
a housekeeper. Their salaries, as well as the operating costs, vill be
financed under this project for a period of three years, at most. Beyond
that a reviev of the financial situation of the commuunes vill be carried
out and, according to the recommendations of this review, BPU and these
branches will be financed from the national and the communal budgets.   It
is recommended that during project implementation, or et the end of the
project, these branches be transferred to the communes to form the core of
municipal technical services, folloving the conclusions of the proposed
study (se annex 11).
3.03     To ensure good communication between the institutions involved,
the National Urban Commission chaired by the Minister of Public Works and
Urban Development vould be convened on a regular basis, integrated vith
high level representatives of CCIB, COOPEC, ECOSAT, and FH. At the local
level, an implementation committee vill supervise the project
implementation, chaîred by the Governor (or, by the Communal Administrator
in Rumonge). This committee vill also comprise representatives of commercei
end artisanat.

3.05     Details of the relationship outlined above vill be confirmed in
agreements to be signed prior to effectivensess
a. Implementation agreements (convention de travail) between BPU
and the muinini-ality of Bxulmbura and the five communes which
define responsibilities for project execution and transfer to the
communes of the works after their completion;
b. Implementation agreements between BPU and CCIB, COOPECs, and
ECOSAT, which define responsibilities for project implementation;
c. Subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and the
Municipality of Bujumbura, and one of the five communes.
3.06     Annex 8 shows the implementation schedule by component and by
town. The bulk of the construction works is planned for 1990-1992.
Expenditures in 1989 vill primarily be for design, engineering and
*quipment. Based on experience with the firet urban project of Bujumbura
as vell as on the disbursement performance of other urban projects in
Africa, the project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1995.
B. Artisans
3.07     Promotion of artisans vill be don. through several actions:
- construction of activity areas;
- construction of training and service centers;
- provision of technical assistance; and
- provision of credits.



20
CCIB
3.08     CCIB in an old institution vhich, at the beginning of 1987,
expanded its activity to agriculture and artisans.  In addition, lt plans
to open regional offices in Gitega, Ngozi, and Bururi.  Under the SSE-APEX
project, a SSE bureau vill be established at CCIB, financed by the IDA
credit, vith the h.lp of technical assistance. Under the proposed project,
CCIB vill play the seme role in the promotion of artisans.
3.09     CCIB vill be responsible for operation of the training and service
contera: the existing center in Kwijabe (Bujumbura) and those to be
constructed in Ngosi, Rumonge and Bururi. Initially, woodworking vill be
emphasized, since this is most urgently needed, but other trades could
*ventually b- included. These conters vill provide machines and
transportation vhose op-ration costs vill be paid for by the artisans. In
addition, young artisans vould be trained and sup.rvised. Thes. programs
vill b. established and managed by CCIB, aided by t-chnical assistance.
After three years of operation, a review vill be done and, if possible,
these contera vill b. transferred to artisans' associations, responsible
for management, operation and reimbursement of financial charges.
3.10     CCIB vill asoo have the responsibility of helping artisans to
prepare loan applications. After finalization, these applications vill be
transmitted by CCIB to the COOPECs. CCIB vill closaely supervise the use of
these funds until the loans are totally repaid.
COOPECs (Cooperatives d'EparRne et de Credit)
3.11     In 1984, the COOPECs vere created vith French assistance, vith
their headquarters located in Gitega. By August 1987, the COOPECs
comprised a network of 34 cooperatives in the central part of the country,
including the provinces of Gitega, Ngozi, and Kayanza, vith over 41,000
members, deposits of almost FBu 140 million (US$ 1.0 million approx.) and
outstanding credits of almost FBu 17 million (US$ 130,000). The COOPECs
are groving at a fast rate and their operations are expected to double in
volume by mid-1988 (se. Annex 9). In order to me-t a condition of the
agreement betwven the Government and COOPECs, it is proposed that the
project contribute to their installation cost in new provinces for a total
of FBu 18.0 million (10 million the firet year, 2 million the four
folloving years).
3 12     Although they represent an important development as the firet
financial institution to operate vithin rural areas, the COOPECs are as of
yet not accredited by BRB. Therefore, they vill have no access to the
National Guarantee Fund to be established. Their lending volume is amall
and mostly for consumption loans.
3.13     The COOPECs vill have no need for additional resources, *ince the
total deposits are expected to reach FBu 370 million by the end of 1988,
FBu 536 million by the and of 1989, FBu 708 million by the end of 1990 and
FBu 880 million by the end of 1991.  Thus, they vill have no problem in



21
granting the creditu, which have been .nvisaged in the proj3ct for the
centera of Git-ga, Ngosi and Kayansa, to the artisans.  The creation of
cooperativea in Bujumbura, Rumonge and tururi is not plann.d to occur
before threo or four y.ars, due to their management'. desir. to pace their
growth.  Until thon, BPU vill b. responsible for granting the credits to
artisans in the« centers.  The respective  mounts, .stimated *t FBu 130
million, is included in the IDA credit.
C. Infrastructure
3.14     This component vill b. implemented by BPU and its local branches
under the supervision of the local implom-ntation committ-es, according to
the implémentation agreements to be signed botweon BPU and the five
cowmunes (Gitega, Ngozi, Kayanza, Rumonge and Bururi). For Bujumbura the
ex-cuting agency vill be the technical department of the municipalîty.
Works vill be carried out by firme s-l-cted through competitiv. bidding and
supervised by BPU and its local branches until their completion.
3.15     After completion, maintenance of roads, drainage vorks and
*tandpipes vill be the responsibility of the municipality and communes, and
Regideso vill be responsible for water and olectricity vorks. Since the
roads sub-division of the MTPDU in not responsible for maintaining the road
network in the towns, it vill be recommended to contract the responsibility
of maintenance vith a private firm. Drainage canals and ditches vill be
maintained by the communes.
D.  Bousmnt
3.16     ECOSAT vill be the executing agency for the housing component in
Bujumbura (upgrading, site and services). The creation of new plots In
secondary centers vill be the responsibility of the communes, assisted by
the local branches of BPU.
ECOSAT
3.17     ECOSAT vas crsated on March 31, 1987, by decree no. 100/53, as a
national low-cost housing corporation. It in an 'Etablissement public à
caractère commercial', in charge of implementing the social housing policy
of th. Government.  Although its first fiscal year is 1988, ECOSAT inherits
exp-rience and staff from the previous MUSAGA Project and Social Housing
Project (PHS), financed by UNDP-UNCDF and Sviss Cooperation. The latter
project realized about 1,000 plots and 675 housing units since 1984 and vas
completed by the end of 1987. The proappraisal mission, in May 1987,
reviewed the decree establishing ECOSAT and requested that it be amended to
clearly specify the developer role of ECOSAT. This is a condition of
diebursement for the housing components in Bujumbura.   A new
organizational chart (Annex 10) vas proposed by the Government and approved
by the Bank.



22
3.18     ECOSAT'a objectivée, human resources and five-year financial
projections show that lt would be able to implement the housing component
of the proposed project in Bujumbura. It vould also take over the
collection of reimbursement for the housing credits of the firet urban
project, presently managed by the collection bureau vithin the Bujumbura
muntcipality.  In addition, the fund  a*lready recovered from the firet
urban project (about FBu 78 million) It,ve been allocated to ECOSAT for a
firet op-ration in 1988.
Bousing Fund (FR)
3.19     The housing credit component of the IDA Credit vould b. chan.lled
through a Housing Fund (FH - Fonde de l'Habitat). it vill receive grant.
and loans from the Governiment and external donors, and reimbursem.nts of
previous housing operations. A loan committee viii decide the avard of
short term loans to ECOSAT for site and services operations and longer term
loans to individual- for house construction or home improvement. The Fund
vill be a Special Account in an existing financial institution (SBF, for
example) managed by a *teering committee chaired by the MTPDU and
comprising representatives of the ministries of Finance and Interior, and
the Municipality of Bujumbura. A amall staff vithin the General
Directorate of Urbanism and Housing vill assist the committee for the
administrative tasXs. Detailed institutional and financial arrangements,
including, inter alia, staffing, organizational structure, operating
policies and proc-dures vill b. submitted to the Association for review and
comments.  Submission of a draft decree satisfactor- to the Association for
the creation of the Housing Fund vill b. a condition of effectiveness of
the IDA Credit.
Bulumbura uPxrading and off-site vorks
3.20     ECOSAT will be responsible for this sub-component on behalf of the
Bujumbura municipality, to which this infrastructure belongs. Cost
recovery vill be the responsibility of the municipal collection bureau,
through land and rental taxes.
Gasenyi Site and Services (Bulumbura)
3.21     The role of ECOSAT is to develop infrastructure (roads, drainage,
water, electricity) and to control house construction by the beneficiaries.
ECOSAT will receive a short term loan (FBu 95 million) from FH to finance
site and services vorks. This loan amount takes into account the
remuneration of ECOSAT and the progressive payments by the beneficiaries
during the vork time.
3.22     ECOSAT vill call for candidates and make a preselection according
to the conditions of avard (see para. 4.18). The number of eligible
applicants will probably be superior to the number of plots available. A
lottery will take place in order to determine the final list of
beneficiaries. An agreement will be signed by the beneficiary including
the total payment of the plot within a two-year period. As soon as the



23
payment in complited, the beneficiary vill beco. ovner of the plot and
receives an occupancy permit (TOP, titre d'occupation provisoire). At the
*nd of the two year period, ECOSAT vili have fully r-imburesd the short
term loan to FH.
Housint Credits
3.23     ECOSAT helpa nav beneficiaries choose convenient housin& units, in
accordance vith their income, and pr-pare loan applications for PH. As
soon as this loan is granted, the ben.ficiary authorises ECOSAT to use the
amount of the credit fort
- payment of materiales;
- payment of SSE and artisns; and
- itu owm faos for studies, administration and building
supervision
ECOSAT prepares the reimbursement achedule of individual credits, collecte
the funds reimbursed, keepa a percentage of the sums recovered for its
services and transfers the remainder to FR.
3.24     Having bought their plot and contracted individual credits, the
beneficiaries vill be owners upon entering their houes. On one hand,
ECOSAT vill not be able to threaten them for expulsion for arrears, as in
the case of renting. Cases of incapacity or unwillingness to pay would be
resolved legally by a court decision to seise and sell the house. On the
other hand, the owners vill legally be La a position to enlarge or improve
their house or also to build another house on their plot for rental
purposes, in order to get more revenue for the reimbursement of their
housing credit.
Home Improvement Credits
3.25     This component is one which La a continuation of the Firat Urban
Project. ECOSAT vill establish a special bureau to rec-ive applications
for home improvement, review them in relation to the applicant's income,
estimate the works coet, supervise the works, pay the contractors and
artisans, and recover the credits vithin a maximm thre- year period.
Taking into account the great number of very amall credits, it ia proposed
that FH open a lin. of crédit to ECOSAT for FBu 10 million and replenish it
up to this amount when exhausted.
Unserviced Plots in 4 Secondary Towns
3.26     The objective of this component (FBu 86.5 million) is to help
local authorities manage the expansion of these towns and teo allov them to
propose regular plots, TOP included, vith accesa roada, aven if no other
service iL provided, initially. In the future, vater and electricity vill
be provided by REGIDESO, according to its on developmant program. Land
acquisition and vorks vill be implemented by BPU, through its local



24
branches. After completion, the vorks vill be transferred to the coamme,
viich vill then be thon responsible for maintaining and selllng the plots.
Ultiately, if the housing credits are to be provided in GITEGA, Lt is
proposed that ECOSAT be involved, but not prior to 1992.
. Institutional Strenathb*ein
3.27     This component aÏmJ at  aproving human and fin ancil resources of
thé comaunes in order to allo th.m to play their role In the country's
gn.ra-l *conomic d-velopment and particularly, in the dev-lopsent and
management of local facilities and services. Proposed actions includes
(i) an in-d-pth developmnt of communes' tax system  (iI) supporting
policies to *trengthen local financial services; and (iII) establiashmnt of
a facility by which th. government can help local developm.nt.
3.28     Developing a t-x system involves improving procedures to identify
and evaluate the t-x base (taxes on busin.ss.s and rental incomes, and land
taxes), and improving recovery of all taxes and increasing t-x schidules.
To support this instituc4onal *trengthening, a tax economistflavyer
consultant vould be provided for 12 months over a 3-year period.
3.29     Financial services must be strengthened to handle the increase in
the communes' responsibilities. To do se, financial specialists - level
A2 - vill b. recruited by the communes to supervise accounting services,
tax issuance and recovery services, and the budget. This staff vill be
trained as soon as they are recruited (see para. 3.32). In addition a
=têtute vill be prepared for communal staff in order to attract higher
level staff and to obtain greater managerial efficiency.
3.30     The communes can reimburse the investments made under the project,
provided that the loans granted to them be made at concessional terms. In
order to replicate such op-rations for these communes, as vell as for
others, it iL proposed that their repayments be made not to the Government
but to an Urban Equipment Fund for Secondary Centers (FEUCS) to be created
under the proposed project. Thun, this fund vill institutionalize the
Government.'s contribution to the urban development of secondary centers.
The Fund vould intervene as an intermediary betveen don.rs (lncluding the
Government) and the communes. It would r-c-ive th. funds to finance *very
type of investment envisaged, make loans and grants (according to
Government subsidies), assure recovery of loans and manage the eventual
revolving fund, depending on grace periods and differential loan rates.
This Fund would thus introduce regularity and rigor into the financing of
urban infrastructure in the secondary centers.
3.31     In order to enhance institutional strengthening at thé country-
vide level under the proposed project, a communal resources study needs to
be und-rtaken. This study vould assess the present financial situation of
the communes, make recommandations on municipal finance reforma, on
municipal accounting, propose a draft statute for communal staff and give
guidance on how FEUCS could be mobilized in order to support the



25
expenditure needs of local authorities. Tentative terma of reference are
given ln annex 11. Terme of Reference and a short liat of consultante vill
be submitted to the Association by December 31, 1988, and the final report
by June 30, 1990.
P. Trainina
3 32     An Important role of BPU is to organize training programs,
partleularly from the time of project start-up.  The proposed programe are
as follouse
- two inspectors of comunal projecte vill be trained as
trainers for one year abroad, so as to create a monitoring and
consultation framework vithin the Ministry of the Interior'.
inspectorate of communal projects;
- for three months, two training experts vlll provide 12 A2
level staff vith additional training in local taxation,
administration and management of communes, and project
management. Five of them vlll be recruited by the five
communes as financial managers (sce para. 3.29) and five
others by BPU as local branch managers;
-   training program  for communal accountants vill inerease the
proficiency and technical knowledge.  ESCO vould execute these
programs, possibly on a continuing basis for the whole
country.  However, given the present lack of specifie
training, a foreign trainer vill be appointed along vith a
Burundian traîner provided by ESCO;
-   technical staff of the communes and of BPU vill receive formal
and on-the-job training. Priority vill be given to upgrading
of technical skills in maintenance of infrastructure, roads,
drainage, vater supply, sanitation, solid vaste collection,
and publie lighting.
G. Accoutinta and Auditing
3.33     Separate projecte accounts vill be established for the
Municipality of Bujumbura, the five communes, CCIB, COOPECs, ECOSAT and FH.
Consolidated accounts vill be maintained by BPU.
3.34     CCIB, COOPECs and BPU vill be required to prepare financial
*tatements of project transactions vithin three months of the close of the
government fiscal year. Auditors' opinions on these financial statements
vill be prepared, by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and submitted
to the government and to IDA vithin eight months of the end of the fiscal
year. The audit report of BPU wvll include a separate analysis of the use
of IDA funde under the special account. ECOSAT and FH vill also be
required to submit audited accounts to IDA, vithin *ight months of the
close of their fiscal year. Assurances vere obtained at negotiations that
a short lit of qualified auditors vould be sent to IDA by June 30, 1989.



26
H   Nonitortri. Revortizo and Supervision
3.35     BPU vill be responsible for monitoring the progreas of the project
toward its atat-d objectives. It vill pr-pare progres reporta eàch
quarter that vould briefly identify major problems and recommend solutions;
reviev the performance of implementing agencies; nd maintain key
indicators of progres in fulfillment of project goals. In particular,
population increase shall be closely monitored for *ach town au vell as for
the ar-as dev-loped under the project. Ccncerning the achools to b- built
under the *ducation project, EPU vill be responsible for informing the
Ministry of Education of the population increase. As soon as this increase
r-aches 1500 inhabitants in any of thé contera, the Education Project Unit
(BPE) vill *tart the construction of the achool. Prior to the atart of
each budget year, the progresa reporte vould include a statement that
sufficient counterpart funda have been included in the Finance Law for that
year. In addition, a Project Compl-tion Report vould be prepared, on the
basis of an outline mutually agreed upon, and sent to IDA vithin six months
of the Credit closing date.
3.36     IDA supervision of the project would require up to 60 weeks of
staff and consultant time during the six-year implementation period. This
level of involvement would be concentrated in the firet three years, after
vwhich some activities would wind down and BPU vould have acquired greater
management experience.

IV. PlINNCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Flow of Funds
4.01     About one third of the Credit amount vill be on-lent by the
Government to the Municipality of Bujumbura, to the comunes covered by the
Project, to home owners and to artisans. The Government vill bear all
foreign exchange risks. The cash flow for the project is shown in Annex
12. By 1995, when all project components have be-n implemented, the
cumulative inflows for the project vill be FBu 4,000 million (about US$31
million). The cumulative surplus by the year 2009, when all housing
cr-dits snd loans for the comunes are reimbursed, vill be FBu 2,653
million (about US$20 million). The bulk of the surplus funds relates to
the recovery of upgrading costs, the sale of the nev plots and the
beneficiary repayments (communes, householda and artisans). This surplus
vill be deposited a) for the communes in the Urban Equipment Fund of
Secondary Centers (FEUCS) for the corresponding amount (FBu 1,300 million,
i..., US$10 million); b) for households in the Housing Fund (FH), for the
part concerning the housing credits (FBu 778 million, i.e., US$6 million);
and c) for artisans in a special account at BRB prior to the repayment to
IDA. This vill allow the replicability of the project in other urban areas
of the country.
E. Comunal Finance
4.02     The financial povers of the comunes are for the most part set
forth by Decree-Law No. 1/24 of July 30, 1977, which reforma commune
organization. Although that law affirme the principle of autonomous
management, the substance of commune taxation is not defined; it is merely
specified that the introduction of surcharges is subject to approval by the
Ministry of Finance, The transfer by the Government of Land taxes and
those on rental income to the communes (Lave Nos. 1/002 and 1/003 of
January 8, 1987) will have a favorable impact on commune revenue, but under
current legislation the receipts from those two taxes are low.
4.03     As a condition of negotiations, the Government submitted to the
Association draft decree-laws amending the Laws of January 8, 1987, as
requested by the Association. The schedule of Land taxes is as follovss
- tax on improved real property
FBu 36/m2 for buildings of permanent materials
FBu 24/m2 for buildings of semi-permanent materials
FBu 15/m2 for buildings of non-permanent materials
- tax on unimproved real property
FBu 2/m2 in neighborhoods vithout infrastructure
FBu 31m2 in neighborhoods vith minimum infrastructure
FBu 4/m2 in upper-bracket neighborhoods



28
The second draft decree-law concerna the tex on rental income and abrogates
Article 4 of Law No. 11003 of Jsnuary 8, 1987, which excluded corporate
bodies under public or private lw as vell as de facto associations from
the provisions regarding the transfer of the tax to the comaunes.
Promulgation of these decr---lasw in a condition of effectivenese of the
IDA Credit.
C. Cout Recovery
4.04     The cost recovery mechanisme eetablished for the Firet Urban
Prcoect should be refined and improved. The folloving table gives a
breakdown of total project conte by moue of r-covery. The coste are
expressed ia total values (base cost plus provisions for physical and price
contingencies).
Table 4.1 Schedule of Cost Recovery
Millions of FBu    Z
-   Recoverable directly from beneficiaries
(housing loans, loans to artisans, sites   802.7       25.60S
and services)
-   Recoverable indirectly from
usera (upgrading and commercial
infrastructure, etc.)                       488.6      15.582
-   Long-term recoverable (infrastructure

TOTAL                       3135.6   1002
A breakdown of this table is given in Annex 13.
Artisans
4.05     For loans to artisans, the recommended approaches would all mean
1002 recovery and rapid r-cycling of funds, 80 that the operations can be
replicated.  Limited to the centers of Bujumbura, Rumonge and Bururi (see
para. 3.13), the credite would be of three types: installation, equipment
and supply.  The following conditions would be adopteds
-   installation credites  the amounts range from FBu 200,000 to
FBu 500,000, for a term of five years at 12% interest and a
grace period of one year;



29
-   *quipm.nt crodits:  the omounts range from FBu 55,000 to FBu
675,000 for a torm of one to three years;
-   supply crodites  repayable over the v-ry short torm, maxiau
throe monthe.
The table in Annox 14 recapitulattes those credits by type and conter.
Housing
4.06     The loan contracte, the wording of which vill be subjoct to
approval by the Bank, vill includ- clauses (a) to the effect that there is
a transfer of ownership upon contract signature and (b) offering sufficient
guaranteos to the lender and allowing *viction in thé *vent of non-paym nt.
The recovery of home construction and improvement loans vill be made
through direct monthly paymonts. Housing credits, granted for 15 years
vith two years of grace, vill b. charged interost of 122. Home improvoment
loans, granted for a maximum torm of thr-- y.are, vill be charged intereet
of 12Z. Given the particularly high risk in this type of credit, tho
guarantee clauses to be included in the contracte vill be studied closely.
4.07     Subject to the changes to bo made to ECOSAT's statutes, it is
agreed that that entity vill be the executing agency for tha housing
component of tho project. The agreement to be concluded between BPU and
ECOSAT to formalize this arrangement should in particular specify the
remuneration ECOSAT is to receive for managing the lending operations and
loan recovery. Reasonable remuneration vould be 3Z of the amounts
recovered.
4.08     ECOSAT vill recover the loans on behalf of the special financial
institution to be created for that purpose, tho Housing Fund. That Fund
vill recoive the share of tho IDA credit allocatod to the housing component
under the project for Bujumbura alone. The Fund vill be responsiblo for
the reimbursemont of the IDA Crodit and it vill bear the exchange risk. A
chart showing the financial flove for the housing component under the
project is given in Annex 15.
4.09     The cost of the upgrading vorks in Gasenyi vill be recoverod from
the beneficiaries through a land extra-tax (centimes additionnels). The
cost of the sites and services vorks on new plots vill be recovered from
the purchasers, in two years (down payment). The cost of the off-site
vorks vill not be recovered directly from the beneficiaries, but from the
municipal budget. Together, the three headinge above represent total coste



30
of FBu 147.5 million. It la planned for ECOSAT to carry out the vorka
uuder the agreement to be concluded betwe.n it and the BPU. The cost of
the sites and services vorks in the four secondary centers (FBu 86.5
million) vill be recovered directly from the beneficiaries.
Commune Investment
4.10     Commun  investments conist ofs
- commercial facilities (markets, slaughterhouses, etc.), vhicb
vill be used by private parties or for activities that
generate a return;
-   social facilities, the use of which is generally free of
charge and for which State assistance is .nvisaged;
-   infrastructure vorke carried out *ither for a particular
neighborhood or for the entire commune; their use i. free of
charge but costs are recovered either from tne individual
beneficiaries, the beneficiary entity, or both.
4.11     For the Commercial Facilities (FBu 3C9 million, i.e.,
approximately US$2.8 million), the principle of cost recovery is based on
the existing tax system (market upkeep and slaughterhouse taxes.) It is
proposed to increase the revenue generated by those taxes by introducing
nev schedules and changing the payment system. The additional revenue
generated by these measures vill cover the repayments of the loan that each
commune vill have to borrov in order to build these facilities and cover
related maintenance expenses.
4.12     For the social facilities (FBu 56 million, or US$0.4 million), the
recovery of costs from usera is not envisaged; instead, normal tax receipts
vill in theory be used to finance these investments. The five health
centers to be built vill be operated by the Ministry of Health (MH).
Before the beginning of their construction, an agreement should be reached
between MH and BPU on the staffing of these centers. This vill be a
condition of disbursement.
Training and Technical Assistance
4.13     The project activities related to training and technical
assistance can be saummarized as followss
Artisans                                  FBu million
-   Training                               118.8
-   Technical Assistance                   143.1
261.9

Institutional strenathenint               FBu million
-   T-chnical assistance                   416.8
-   Training of communal staff           _106.2
Total                   523.0
As no coat can be r-covered during thé project, the national budget muet
bear all related expanses.
D. Affordability
Gas-nvi OpReration
4.14     The project assum.d that the &ffordability ratio could not *xceed
20% of income for upgrading, 232 to 25 of income for new lots for »o*t
categories of purchasers and 302 of income for the cat-gory that could
afford the better lots. The selling prices are consistent with this
objective, but overall equilibrium requires that the two operations of
upgrading and newly serviced lots be coupled, as the latter would offset
the former. The percentage of non-nationale is high in the suburbs of
Bujumbura, almost 40%. They are allowed to buy and soll land or houses.
They have access to housing credits. Nonetheless, under the Firet Urban
Project, no plot of the site and services component ws aollocated to a
foreigner, although no legal document prohibited to do so.
Upgrading
4.15     This upgrading should permit maintenance of population on the
site. A recent study (March 1987) dons on the neighborhood which is to be
rehabilitated, shows that thé project would retain virtually 100% of
householde. As the coste shall be recovered through land tax surcharges
the municipality would pay these coste of upgrading ln four years.
New Plots
4.16     The targ-tted population almost covers the whole income *cal but
completely bypasses the first two deciles (monthly income of less than FBu
10,200). The 9th and 10th deciles also are excluded, since it is proposed
to limit access to households having monthly income b-low a ceiling of FBu
50,000 (middle of the 8th decile). The costa are recovered vithin two
yeare. At that time, thé purchasers, who would have taken possession of
their lots and began construction of their houses, can begin to repay their
housing credits.
Housing Credits
4.17     For new homes, the emount of each loan would be determined so that
the repayment inestallment does not exceed 302 of household income; the
grace period (2 years) would als avoid overlapping financial burdens



32
(purchase of plot and construction of home). As with access to new lots,
accesa to housing credits completely bypasses the first two dociles.  For
home improvement, the same accessibility criteria is used, but the credits
are granted for 3 years instead of 15 years. The housing credits will be
subject to the following conditions of awards
-   maximum monthly income of FBu 50,000
-   maximum amount of individual credits2
- FBu 600,000 for new construction
- FBu 400,000 for improvement

A table of affordability according to the type of construction is shown in Annex 16.
B. Reiplicability
Housing
4.18     If the recovery of housing credits is properly managed, a very
substantial fund of nearly FBu 700 million for construction credits in 15
years, and FBu 80 million for home improvement loans in three years can be
accumulated. The possibilities of replication depend on how the funds thus
capitalized are used. As 122 is a normal interest applicable to housang
credits (this rate vas applicable to Firet Urban Project's housing
credits), and between 5% and 6Z is necessary to cover 'ianagement cost8
(including remuneration to ECOSAT for managing the individual loans), the
net margin vould be 6% to 7%. In addition, the large difference in the
reimbursement periode (15 and 40 years) would permit FH to build up a
surplus that would assure replicability.

4.20     In the past, SETEMU carried out costly works vithout the Mayor's
approval, on decision of the Government. These investments (especially the
Ntahangwa bridge and the Boulevard du 18 Novembre) represent a heavy burden
on municipal financial resources, since the municipality had to borrov for
the financing of these vorka.   This indebtedness exceeded FBu 800 million
by the end of 1987 (capital *u»m only), the heavieut part represented by
two CAMOFI lons:s a 203 million loan at 16% intereat for 5 years, and a
151 million loan at 152 interest for 6 years. The Treasury has already
paid for the interest charges. By December 31, 1988, the Governuent vill
submit to the Association the resulte of a financial *tudy taking account
of the expected revenue generated by the transfer of the totality of the
land taxes and rental income taxes to the Municipality of Bujumbura and to
the communes.  The study will include five-year financial projections.  On
the basis of the8e projections, a decision on the transfer of these two
loans to the Treasury will be agreed upon by June 30, 1989.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION - SNENFITS AND RISIS
A. Prol.ct Benefits
5.01     The project vill have a direct immediate impact on the local
economy by stimulating activities, promoting employment, increasing incomes
of rural and urban households and improving fiscal revenues of communes.
Beyond these direct, immediate benefits, the project vill have a vider,
medium term impact on the pace of structural change, modernization and
specialization of the whole economy of Burundi.
Direct Benefits
5.02     Concerning public expenditures, proposed investments will more
than double total public expenditure (financed by local and central budget)
during 3 to 4 consecutive years in the commune of Gitega. They vill be
multiplied by 3 in other communes and 5 in Bururi. Most works vill be
implemented by domestic enterprises from Bujumbura, subcontracting to local
SMEs and artisans and using local materials as much as possible. The
project will provide employment to about a total of one thousand vorkers in
the project area (Bujumbura, the five secondary towns and their
hinterland). The phasing of the project has been determined se as to
provide SMEs and artisans vith a steady predictable vork load.
5.03     The upgrading of urban infrastructure, market places and related
services vill help strengthen commercial activities in both urban centers
and surrounding rural market places, a key element to stimulate the
division of labor and urban-rural linkages, and improve resource
mobilization.
5.04     The upgrading of infrastructure in centraL low-income
neighborhoods vill favor development of informal activities, mainly in
construction, trade and household services. It is expected that the
economic activity of these neighborhoods in 5 secondarJ towns vill more
than double as a result of the project. Part of the employment generated
in the artisanal sector by this development of urban economic activity vill
be supported by the 'promotion of artisans' component of the project.
5.05     The housing scheme in Bujumbura vill result In 650 new plots and
housing units, and credits for housing improvement affordable to low and
mid-lov income households. The project allovs for more than one household
on each plot, thus giving lower income households the access to housing,
through rental arrangements, and increasing the returns of the site
investment. The creation of simple allotments in secondary towns vill
avoid uncontrolled building, subsequent difficulties and costs of upgrading
in slope sites and favor private investment in housing.
5.06     The monetary income distributed, directly and indirectly, by the
project to artisans and vorkers vill increase the purchasing pover of non-
agri-iltural households and their demand for food and other rural products.
This, in turn, vill increase monetary incomes of rural households and their
purchasing pover for non-agricultural, urban goods and services. The



36
corresponding generation and circulation of incomr b-twe-n rural nd urban
ariea ha* been analyzed for Gitega, Ngosi and Ruhororo (ses Annex 17).
5.07     The total fiscal revenue of the five communes covered by the
project vill triple, from FBu 84 million in 1988 to FBu 243 million in 1994
(in constant 1986 prices). Annual per capita fiscal revenue vill increase
from FEu 240 to FBu 580 (or from $1.8 to $4.5), during the mame period.
The major source of this growth vill crem from the taxes on land and rental
income, which vill provide from 15S (in Bururi) to 45Z (in Rumonge and
Gitega) of the total communal revenue by 1994, nd the taxes on market
places. The sharo of communal fiscal revenues that vill be levied on the
urban areas (wh re 82 of the total population of the 5 communes in
presently living) vill increase from 222 to 392, a fundamental change that
breaks &round for a future Imunicipalization' of urban areas   This
increase in revenues, together vith the proposed project vill enable to
finance a doubling in current expenditures, from FBu 55 million to FBu 129
million.
LonRer Term Impact
5.08     The proposed project is part of a national urban policy aiming at
accelerating growth through division of labor between agriculture and other
sectors, and between rural and urban areas, and through the resulting
Intensification of exchanges at all levels. The population of the five
secondary towns covered by the project is expected to grow from the present
low level of 3.252 per year to  omore 10  by 1992.
5.09     The consequences of this growth have been estimated to be as
followss
(i) monetary incomes of farmers vill grow, on average, at 1.72 per
year instead of decreasing;
Cii) long-term growth of the communal GDP is estimated at 5.4%
instead of 3.32; and
(iiI) revenues and expenditures of local governments are expected to
grov at about 62 per year, due to the development of trade and
other activities in the secondary towns nd in their
hinterland. This increase in revenues vill allow communes to
play a more active role in local economy, by increasing the
volume of local public expenditures that vill stimulate local
activities.
Even in the high urbanlzation scenario, which served as basis of the
project, the pressure of population on arable land would remain high, since
the available arable land per farmer vould decrease by about iZ per year.
However, the situation vould be manageable in the long term since the
maximum of agrieultural population would be reached by 2020.  In the
current trend scenario, the land constrainc vould be much worse, vith an
average decrease of land available per farmer reaching 2.32 per year and a
prolongation of the growth of total agrieultural population vell beyond
2040.

a.  Cout-enf lt Analsit
5.10     The economie rate of return has been estimated for the project as
a whole and by town, taking into account the components for which b-nefits
can b- quantifieds artisans, infrastructure, housing and commanity
facilities g-nerating direct incom  (mark.t places, slaught.rhousss and the
port of Rumonge). The rates of return are 142 for the six towns
altogother, 152 for Gitega and Ngosi, 142 for Kayansa, 16Z for Rumonge; 10Z
for Bururi and 13S for Bujumbura. It *hould be noted, however, that those
rates of return do not take into account the indirect iLpact of the project
on the regional *conomy (Annez 18). An assesament of individual rates of
r-turn ha. been und-rtaken for two components of the projects promotion of
artisans and infrastructure.
Promotion of Artisans
5.11     The project vill promots the growth of artisanal activities ln
Bujumbura and five secondary towns through, inter alla, the expansion of
the market for artisanal products, training, and financial and technical
assistance. A dotailed analysis of the future demand for artisanal
products in the five communes covered (Bujumbura excluded) shows that the
value of the artisanal products purchased vould grow, ln constant terms,
from FBu 0.5 billion ln 1986 to FBu 1.6 billion ln 1996, the bulk of this
threefold increase being concentrated ln the urban centers of the five
communes. The number of artisans vould grov from about 1,700 ln 1986 to
5,300 in 1996.
5.12     A large part of these artisans wlll pertain to the informal
_ector. The cost beneflt analysis presented below has been therefore
developed for the some 1,100 artisans that vill be installed in Gitega,
Ngozi, Kayauza, Rumonge and Bururi vith credLts provided by the project
(directly or through COOPECS). The main conclusions of this analysis are
the folloving
- First, the number of formal artisans (presently very low) ls
llkely to lncrease (vith the project support) in response to a
larger market for their products, both during the
implementation of the project (execution of physical
components) and laser on as the linkages between the urban and
rural sectors develop.
-   Second, the net monetary income generated by artisanal
activities vill be high enough to promote division of labors
artisans wlll b. able to fully rely on this single source of
income, and purchase their food (rather than producing lt as
is the case today).
-   Third, the rate of return of investments needed for the
installation of these artisans is 152 lncluding the training
and service centers and 192 vithout these centers.



38
Infrastructure
5.13     This component represents 20% of the total base costs of the
project. For *ach of the urban conters cov.red a coat-beneflt analysis has
been undertaken, according to the following methodology and assumptions:
-   costs include physical contingencies, maintenance and periodic
reneval of investmentu, they *xclude taxes.
-   benefits are measured by the differ-nce b-twe-n the value of
market value of land in the neighborhood where infrastructure
is upgraded, and the present value of this land without
project.
-   present value of land is taken as equival-nt to the present
value of future rente (including renta equivalent to self-
housing) paid by the population living ln the neighborhood. A
2% natural growth rate (without project) of these renta ia
assumed, as a consequence of the growth of urban population
and economy, involving changes in land use and income
distribution in the neighborhoods which, in all six towns
covered, are located near the urban centers.
-   within a few years following the improvement of
infrastructure, the land value increases by some 20 to 40%,
and, in the longer term, the growth rate of this land value is
increased to 3% per year in the secondary towns, as a
ceonsequence of the acceleration of urban growth rates and
improvement of urban economy.
5.14     For the whole infrastructure component, the rate of return is 15%.
City by city, the highest rates of return are ln Rumonge (18%), Ngozi
(17%), Bujumbura and Gitega (13%). In Kayanza and Bururi the rates of
return are 10% and 6% respectively.
C. Urban Poverty Aspects
5.15     The Centre Universitaire de Recherche sur le Dévaloppement
Economique et Social (CURDES) has assessed poverty thresholds for urban and
rural areas ln 1986 as follows (per householdlyear):
-   Bujumbura residents who do not rents  FBu 150,000
-   Bujumbura residents who rentt FBu 190,000
-   Farming Familles:  FBu 100,000
Using these poverty thresholds, the 1987 Bujumbura household survey shows
that 27% of the non-renters and 36% of the renters fall below this line,
and rural surveys by SNES show that over 90% of the rural population would
fall below this poverty threshold.  In secondary towns, the only source of
information on household incomes ls the survey undertaken by the consultant
in Gitega and Ngozi. This survey provides a good estimation of the average
income of different categories of urban households (farming, mixed



39
activlties, informal oector, clvil servants, moder sector), but lacome
distribution inid- thes» categories cmnnot be obtained from this li itod
survey. Ont can estimate, hwvever, that about 302 of urban householde have
the same pattern of expendituess and Incomes as do farming familles vlth an
average income (including self-consumption) of &bout FBu 100,000 par year.
5.16     All components of the projcct directly or iadir.ctly beneflt the
poor urban dweller. The infrastructure component of the project foeuses on
neighborhoode whar- the proportion of poor in hlgher than the urban average
and in market places that serve the urban economy, includiag lts
traditional and informal sector. For the nev servic-d sites ln Bujumbura,
accessibllity tests have shown that 17% of the plots vill be directly
accessible to the third decile (10,200-13,500 FBu) ln a 24-month payment
plan, thanks to the design of allotments and oizos of plots. Mor-over,
since more than one family house on *ach plot is accepted, new owners vill
*oon offer roomu or annexes for leasing - as Lt occurs almost
*ystomatically in other neigehorhoods, and already appears ln the first
urban project in Kvijabe - so that the percentage of poor concerned vill
probably reach the city average.
D. Prolect Rieke and Provosed Remedies
5.17     The proposed second project largely builds upon experience gained
during the firet urban project, and other Bank-financed projects, such as
ASECO. Most of its components have already been tested, therefore, the
technical risks associated vith each component are limited. However, this
project innovates ln two ways that involve some risk: it deals vith small
tovwas where urban functions are still embryonic, and it tends to structural
changes in present population trends.
5.18     The main source of risk associated vith the proposed component of
the project in Bujumbura concerne the housing component.  This is to be
implemented by the newly-created ECOSAT. The decre. establishing ECOSAT
has been reviewed and vill be amended (se. para. 3.17), a condition of
effectiveness of the Credit.  ECOSAT inherits staff and experience of the
previous PHS (Projet d'Habitat Social), especially in the aspects related
to cost recovery and vill also be recruiting part of th. staff who dealt
with the housing component under the firet urban project.  During the
preparation of the proposed project, special attention vas given to the
organization of ECOSAT, and an acceptable organization chart vas agreed
upon (ses Annex 10).
5.19     Concerning the secondary towns, riake fall into three catego-riest
(i) riaks linked to the socioeconomic and economic impacts of the project
on the local economy; (ii) risks inherent in the insertion of the project
in the development policy; and (Iii) riake inherent in the relative
complexity of the project.
5.20     The project unit vill have to carefully monitor the implementation
process to avoid bottlenecks (early advice of artisans, credit, technical
assistance, etc*). Durable division of labor will only take place if
householda clearly perceive that their income vill durably cover their

NATIONAL URBAN POLICY GUIDELINES
The Demographir and Macroeconomic Setting
1.        In a space of 20 years, from 1967 to 1987, the population of Burundi
has risen from 2.5 to 5 million.  Barring some major diszster, it can be
expected to double again over the next 20 years, to 10 million. Even if the
pace of natural growth slows down over this next period, the adults who will
be seeking jobs in 2007 have already been born and their number is double
today's active population. The only uncertain factor therefore is the number
of under-20s at that time. For the past 20 years we have justifiably trusted
in the courage, skill and solidarity of our farming populace to support,
employ and feed almost all of our country's incremental population, since all
our cities put together contain and provide vork for only 101 of Burundi's
total population. Burundi atll has some thinly populated areas that of fer
farming or stockraising possibilities. It would undoubtedly be wise to
organize settlement of these areas so as to relieve the overpopulated areas,
subject however to the development of productive farming or livestock
activities instead of just migrant subsistence farming. Possibilities als
remain for raising land and labor productivity, provided that funds are
available to procure the necessary inputs, which certainly cannot be said of
faiily micro-holdings.
2.        There are nevertheless limits to increasing rural population
density. With 2.5 million people living on 28,000 km2 of land, Burundi had
less than 1 ha of cultivable land per rural inhabitant. Today, the ratio is
only 0.6 hectares, and in 20 years, at the present rate, it will be down to
0.3! While this continuous decline in useful farmland per rural family does
not necessarily imply famine, it leaves no hope of agricultural progresa and
consequently no hope of development for the country. Indeed, it makes that
development more difficult, more costly and more improbable every day, with
subsistence farming absorbing more and more of the country's labor force.
3.        In one way or another, development depends on raising labor
productivity and on the capacity of each individual to produce in excess of
his needs so that he can exchange the surplus for the things he does not
produce. Our agriculture is not producing any significant surplus: apart
from products such as coffee, tea and cotton (the ar    under which cannot
expand much while available agricultural land is dwina ng and whose prices
are unstable), there is no market for increased agricultural production for
lack of any substantial urban clientele.
4.        Lacking income, our rural areas in turn offer no outlet for
manufactured goods - even though our country is located in the heart.of one
of the most densely populated and best developed regions of Africa and
possesses an abundant, hardworking labor force and many trained supervisors
and managers. There is an urgent need to recognize the essential moter role
of urban development in breaking this vicious circle.



47 -
5.        Surveys have moreover confirmed that Burundi's rural households
already obtain quite a large portion of their income from jobs in the urban
centers and that Bujumbura is surrounded by large villages whose only claim to
the definition of "rural" is their name and their lack of infrastructure and
which therefore from time to time have to be annexed to the city and
restructured. We also know that the developed countries have all been through
this difficult transition phase before un. Our generation must face up to
this challenge in its turn, taking advantage of the experiences of those who
have preceded us and of our own social structures. We need to formulate and
promptly implement a positive urban policy, i.e. one capable of both fostering
urban development and controlling its impact.
URBAN POLICY GUIDELINES FOR THE FIFTH PLAN
Urban Population Growth
6.        Economic development level is in the final analysis no more than the
resultant of the division of labor and intensity of trade flows. While in the
short term an increase in the production of export commodities can and muat
generate incremental household and government income, their market outlets are
narrow, competition very strong and world prices capricious: already today,
despite the low degree of irbanization, rural monetary incomes from export
crops are lower than those from the sale of agricultural produce in the
markets.  A significant, stable and durable increase in rural in6pmes
therefore depends greatly on growth of demand by the domestic non-farming
sector. That is a condition of accesa by farmers to indispensable inputs and
to consumption of non-farming goode and services. It is on the other hand a
source of activities and incomaes outaide agriculture. To meet the increase in
the job-seeking population, therefore, it is essential to promote sustained
urban development capable of generating a large number of jobs - stemming
first all from the actual construction of the urban life setting
(infrastructure, housing, plant), then from increased skill specialization and
the continuous addition of new functions, spurred by the increase in and
concentration of urban demand, higher urban income levels, better information,
and the scale or external economies offered by the city.
7.        At the same time, urban development, particularly that of the
secondary centers, will generate an improvement in local supply of goods and
services, to the benefit of both rural and urban dwellers, and consequently
slow down the exodus (today substantial) of local income from the region and
even from the country.
8.        However, faster and properly controlled urban growth cen be brought
about only by concerted efforts on the part of the various sectors of economic
and social life in pursuit of common goals.  This made it essential to adopt
an indicative rate of urban growth for all growth-related projections and
studies. For the Fifth Plan a rate of 10% a year was adopted.
Distribution of Urban Growth
9.        Bujumbura, which today contains 80% of Burundi's urban population,
has an essential role to play in the nation's urban growth. Moreover,
compared with the other African capitals and large cities with similar



- 48 -
functions Bujumbura cannot be regarded as overpopulated. We must accept that
Bujumbura's population will reach the one-million mark by the beginning of the
21st century and make the necessary preparations, without in so doing vasting
agricultural land or putting up with uncontrolled development of substandard
housing.
10.       Now that a national roads network in in placE that facilitates
communications and trade flows, it is necessary at the same time to proceed,
without fear of opposition, to actively implement the policy for development
of secondary centers. The regional development policy will aim at turning
these secondary centers into service and employment poles that will act as
nuclei for the development of commercial agriculture and relieve the strain of
urban development movement between the rural areas and the metropolis. The
case of GITEGA, the country's second city, merits particular attention. The
transfer of economic activities from the capital to this geographically
central pole needs to be pursued carefully but unremittingly.
MEANS TO BE DEPLOYED DURING THE FIFTH PLAN
Spatial Developmei., Planning and Decentralization
11.       Formulation of the National Spatial Developflnt Plan (Schéma
National d'Amenagement du Territoire). This plan will serve as a commoa
frame of reference for all ministerial departments and the various public and
private decision-making centers for coordination of their activities,
particularly those concerning urban and regional infrastructure, with the
object of facilitating flows between the urban centers and their rural
hinterlands.
12.       Implementation of decentralization and coordination between
Government and communes. The decentralization policy will be actively
pursued, taking due account of the specific needs and responsibilities of the
communes that are in process of urbanization. The Government will actively
support these communes through the medium of the Province Governors and
decentralized government agencies and by means of a method of shared financing
of certain urban investments whose cost is more than they can afford. The
MTPDU departments responsible for urban planning will be decentralized by
setting up regional branch offices. The human and technical resources of the
urbanizing communes will be strengthened.
Urban Development Management and Control
13.       Action will be taken to:
-    adjust the Bujumbura City spatial planning and urban development
master plan and institute master plans for Burundi's other urban
centers;
-    prepare land-use plans specifying the precise use of each parcel;
-    put an end to all uncontrolled development projects in every urban
center, making a building permit obligatory for every new
construction project;



- 49 -
-    apply strict rules in managing the nation's land assets and pool the
skills of the various agencies responsible for socioeconormic
planning and monitoring so as to coordinate their activities and
stifle land speculation (this involves the ministries responsible
for Planning, Agriculture, Interior, Trade and Land Titling);
-    strengthen the urban planning services by providing them with the
necessary physical and human resources to ensure better space
management.
Urban Plant
14.       Under this heading, action will be taken to:
-    make the population aware of the need to share in sites and services
financing. The Government must not entirely substitute for the
obligations of private persons in financing basic capability
infrastructure. While its role vill continue to be to mobilize the
necessary funds to increase the supply of serviced sites, it will
need to recover their cost 80 that the operations can be repeated;
-    strengthen the f inancial resources of the urbanizing communes and
install multiannual municipal investment programming;
ensure rational utilization of urban lands, particularly by
encouraging high-rise construction (vertical densification). This
will make the occupation of urban space financially remunerative and
reduce sites and services cost per awardee;
-    give priority to the creation and rehabilitation of economic plant
(trade and business centers) and facilitate the promotion of craft
skills tailored to the mechanism of functioning of the city;
-    mobilize the funds of private persons and parastatal companies for
the promotion of urban economic activities.
Urban Housing
15.       There is a need for an active urban housing policy.  Housing is a
mass need second only to food and on a par with clothing and a major motor
force of urban development in a developing economy, i.e. an economy in process
of construction.
A fourth or a fifth of the nation's total annual investment will
need to be allocated to this purpose. But in order to be sound, housing
financing must be fueled mainly by savings, which in our 902 rural country
means rural as well as urban savings. This transfer of resources is
fundamental and must be organized.
16.       To ensure the steady production of housing it has been decided to
set up a National Housing Promotion Fund (Fonds National de Promotion de
l'Habitat) to channel and coordinate all housing finance operations.
Practical rules of operation of this Fund need to be worked out and respected



50 -
that ensure not only the financing of housing construction programa but alo,
and above all, replicability of the operations through recovery of the loans
granted.
It is necessary to define the status and identify the legal
ownership of every parcel, since these data are essential for sound management
of the nation's land assets. This problem is arising more and more as rural
land is increasingly being urbanized as the urban centers expand. It has been
resolved in part through standardization of titles by the issue of a
provisional occupancy title (titre d'occupation provisoire -- TOP) in
neighborhoods on the outskirts of Bujumbura, a solution that should be applied
generally.
17.       The folloving action is recommended in order to guarantee housing
promotion:
-    encourage investment in rental property, which moreover offers an
initial means of accumulating essential capital for later economic
investment;
-    make private real-estate property promotors eligible for the
benefits of the Investment Code in the same way as other economic
actors, giving preference to promotors of collective housing of the
impangu or multi-story type.  This vould not only create more
dwellings but also save space by raising occupation density.
However, aIl these programs must ensure an agreeable lifestyle by
setting aside green spaces and leisure areas as an environment for
human development.
-    in the construction and public works sector, promote the use of
local construction materials, original architecture, Burundian
consultancy firms and the profession of building contractor.
18.       This latter point, promotion of the building contractor profession,
is fundamental. In order to strengthen the fabric of national and local
construction and public vorks enterprises, measures will be taken to
facilitate access to public contracts, credit and public works equipment and
materials, to encourage the organization of the profession, and to pursue
technical assistance to construction firms, particularly concerning financial
and accounting management.

(51 plots), 2 Ha in Ngozi (68 plots) and 2 Ha in Kayanza (51
plots);
b. construction of training and service centers in Ngozi, Rumonge
and Bururi, where these services are not available; and
c. provision of credits which would cover 80% of the costs for
workshop construction, equipment and raw material supplies.
4.       While the trades involved will vary according to the centers, they
are mainly those involving wood-working (carpentry), iron works (welding,
tin), construction materials (brickworks), automobile and motorcycle repair
and garment.
5.       Credits will be made available to artisans by COOPECs in Gitega,
Ngozi and Kayanza, where they are installed. The project will contribute
to their installation cost for an amount of FBu.18.0 million. As long as
there is no COOPEC in Bujumbura, Rumonge and Bururi, the project unit will
be responsible for granting credits to artisans. Annex 14 shows the
distribution of credits by town and by type of creditss
- installation creditss 200,000 to 500,000 FBu, 12% per annum,
5 years ineluding 1 year of grace;
- equipment creditss 55,000 to 675,000 FBu, 12Z per annum, 1 to
3 years;
-   supply credits   very short term, 3 months, 12Z per annum.

BURUNDI
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Savings and Credit Cooperatives (COOPEC)
In 1984 an agreement vas signed betw.en the Ministry of Rural
Development and the Credit Mutuel (CICM) of France on technical and
financial assistance in the creation of a network of savings and credit
cooperatives (COOPEC) in the rural districts of Burundi. The objective of
the project vas to raise living standards in the rural &reas where 95S of
the population live through encouraging savings and developing mutual
credit system. According to the agreement, French assistance would
provide FF 4.9 million of which 50Z vas for investment and 50% covering
initial operating expenses. The original agreement vas for an initial
trial period of 30 months but this has since been extended to 3 years.
COOPEC (Cooperatives d'Epargne et de Crédit) started functioning in June
1984 vith the arrival of a French expert from the French Credit Mutuel vith
headquarters in the provincial town of Gitega and a network of autonomous
cooperatives. Each COOPEC - cooperative - takes in savings from members as
deposits on which interest is paid and offers credits to members. The
membership fee for an individual is FBu (approx. $4).
An individual COOPEC is able to lend up to 30Z of its deposits and
the COOPEC central office up to 50% of total deposits. After 6 months of
savinga each member may borrov up to 5 times the amount of his/her
deposits. Members act as guarantors for each other's credit.
The maximum of a credit to an individual by a COOPEC is FBu 50,000
(approx. $400). The Central Office is permitted to make loans to a maximum
of FBu 500,000 ($4,000). Loans are generally mude for 36 monthe at
interest rates of between 11 and 142 depending on the type of loan. The
rate for agricultural loans is 11% and 14Z for trade.
In general it takes about 1 month for a member to obtain a loan.
The growth of the COOPECs has been impressive. One reason has
been that members may save vith COOPEC in place of the compulsory savings
required with CADEBU (Caisse d'Epargne de Burundi - the state owned savings
bank). Individual COOPECs are required to deposit funde in excess of FBu
200,000 with the Central Office on which they are paid 3.52. Indivîdual
members receive 3Z on their COOPEC savings. The Central Office nov
deposits all its fund vith CAMOFI (Caisse Centrale de Mobilisation et de
Financement, - a savings and financing institution for the public sector)
for fixed terms of 24 months at 8Z.

As can be se-n from the above figures while *till relatively mml1
in volume, the savinga deposit. and the credits given out are increasing at
a fast rate. However the COOPEC organization both at the headquarters nd
at cooperative level remains liquid and *till have adequate resources for
lending before r-aching the limits net by the operating regulations.
Most credits are for consumption and are small - around FBu
30,000-40,000 average (approx. $220-300) but some loans up to a maximum of
FBu 150,000 ($1,200) have been given for income generating activities to
farmers and artisans.
The COOPEC Central Office operates services to issist individual
COOPECs in the management of their finances.  It also offers training and
advisory services for members and has a unit that inspects and audits the
operations of each COOPEC.
So far, the COOPECs have not been accredited by BRB as recognized
financial institutions but they already represent a significant extension
of the financial system into areas and communities where the formal banking
institutions do not operate.

BURUNDI
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPIIENT PROJECT
Communal Resources Study
Tentative T-r. of Ref-r-nce
1  LOCAL CONTEXT
Burundi iL  divided admd istratively irto 15 provinces, subdivided
into 114 communes. Only one of these communes, the capital, Bujumbura, has
the statue of municipality. Apart from the capital city (220,000
inhabitants, a budget of FBu 600 million in 1986), the communes of the
interior are relatively underdevelopeds Gitega, the country's second city,
has around 11,000 inhabitants and an annuel budget of FBu 11 million. The
communes, which at present are no more than simple decentralized *chelons
of the State, are governed principally bys
-    Royal Decree No. 001/570 of December 18, 1964 regulating the
communal accounting systems;
-    Decre--law No. 1/26 of July 30, 1977 relative to communal
organization reform, the above-mentioned Royal Decre-
remaining in effect;
-    Decree No. 100/176 of December 18, 1979 relative to
organization of the municipal police.
A first urban development project, financed by the World Bank
(1980-1987), vas designed to develop the financial and technical capacities
of Bujumbura municipality, and resulted principally ins
-    obtaining additional resources for the city through the
transfer of taxes and levies formerly collected to the
benefit of the State;
-    creating municipal technical services;
-    setting up a financial structure (Collection Bureau).
A study for a second development project vas conducted in 1986-
1987, covering five secondary centers (Kayanza, Ngozi, Gitega, Rumonge,
Bururi) and providing for continuation of the activities in Bujumbura.

2. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
The purpose of the prosent *tudy is, in the firet stage, to obtain
an overall approach to the situation of the communes, their role, the
distribution of responsibilities betwen them and the State, and the
dev-lopment issues involved. The *tudy vill ther-for- consist of carrying
out an extensive survey of a representative *ample of 10 communes, in
addition to the fiv- commnes covered by the project, making a diagnosis,
and offering initial recomendations ont
-    role and institutional framework of the communes;
-    financial situation and local taxation systems;
-    administrative and financial organization.
Following discussion with the authorities, the second phase vill
cover preparation of the project execution dossiers.
3. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED IN STAGE I
3.1 Assessment of present situation and problems
Based on recent studies, policy and sector work, legielation
and current practices, the consultant vill:
-    analyse the function and responsibilities of communes in
various fields including territorial administration, local
dev-lopment, and promotion of local economy.
-    assess the means at the disposal of communes to undertake
their duties, including human resources, financial resources,
institutional mechanisms, planning and budgetl'g tools,
relations with the provincial and central administration and
other agents.
-    propose a typology of communes according to development
criteria including population growth rate and population
distribution (communes with high rate of resettlement,
communes with urban centers, etc.) and economic
characteristice.
-    construct an extensive survey of a sample of 10 communes
representative of the various categories of mostly rural
communes identified in the typology, in addition to the 5
communes of Gitega, Ngozi, Kayansa, Rumonge and Bururi
covered by the second urban project.

Annex 11
Page 3 of 5
Based on this review and detailed survey, the consultant vill present an
overall diagnosis of the present potentialities and constraints of communes
and identify major medium-term issues.
3.2 Enhancement of the role of communes in development
The consultant vill make necesaary recommndations in termas of
revision of the communal law, creation of urban comunes, adaptation of the
national-regional planning programming-budgeting process to the
decentralization and urbanization policies.  The respective roles of
central, provincial and commune budgets vill be clarified, and proposals
vill be made to improve the mechanisma of subsidies and inter-communal
tranfers when necessary. If the creation of urban communes is recommended,
the consultant will carefully analyze the modalities of implementation of
such a creation and its implications. The consultant vill identify the
tools required by various categories of communes in terme of data bases,
cartographic documents, exchanges of information with other institutions,
planning-programming-budgeting instruments, etc.
Taking into account the future role of communes in development as
assessed in the previous task, the consultant vill present a more detailed
analysis and recommendation in the two following fields:
3.3 Financial situation and local taxation systems
The consultant will:
(a)  analyze the overall financial development of all of Burundi's
communes over the past five years, giving a breakdown of
operating and investment budgets by revenues and
expenditures. This analysis should be expressed in current
francs and in constant francs. It vill use a number of
significant ratios, such as revenues per capita, investment
ratio per capita, etc., identifying trends;
(b) in order to propose the necessary adjustments, perform a
detailed analysis ofs
- the structure of revenues and expenditures of different
categories of communes, both for operations and for
investment;
- each type of revenue, indentifying any problems relative
to tax base, rate, or collection.
(c)  offer any proposals for improving financial resources,
including the creation of new revenues, and study the
suitability of setting up an ongoing system of communal
development financing (Urban Equipment Fund for Secondary
Centers), intercommunal transfers and transfers from the
State, access to credit, etc.

Annex 11
Page 4 of 5
3.4 Administrative and Financial Organization
The consultant vills
(a) analyze .xisting administrative and accounting procedures,
submitting proposals for adapting them to the real needs of
the local authorities, according to their specific
characteristics (sise, budget);
(b) appraise existing human resources and id-ntify short and
medium-term personnel and training n-eds;
(c) study the current comunal personnel statute and propose
necessary changes.
4. TASK TO BE PERFORhED IN STAGE II
After the authorities have approved the report, the mission vill
return to Burundi to prepare the execution dossiers for the projects
selectod. Without anticipating the decisions that vill be taken, ve may
expect that this second stage vill mainly conaist ofs
(a) drafting of legislative texts, in such areas as revision of
the communal law, the personnel statute, regulation of
communal accounting systems and user's manual, preparation of
tax legislation;
(b) detailed description of training activities decided on and an
estimate of the financing required.
5. PROFILES AND ASSIGNMENT TIMES OF EXPERTS
The study vill requir. four experts for the first stage of
identification/diagnosis/recommendations, and also for the second stage of
preparation of selected projects:
-    one regional development expert, providing coordination;
-    one financial analyst, specializing in taxation;
-    one specialist in commune managementl ; and
-    one le-al expert, specilizing in urb       o institutions.

6. GOVERN ',NT CONTRIBUTIONS
The study will substantially involve all of the government
agencies concerned, primarily the Ministry of the Interior, and also the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Planning, and the Ministry of Justice,
and the Directorate General of Urban Development and the provincial
authorities.
In view of the financial analysis that is to be carried out in the
first stage, it is essential that the data be collected before the experts
arrive. These data relate tos
-    overall execution of the operating and investment budgets of
the 114 communes over the past five years,
-    detailed budget execution, for the sample selected,
-    administrative surveys for the five years of the analysis.
It is also necessary that the government delegate staff to be
responsible for facilitating access to documents and to follow the study
from beginning to end.

SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Urban-rural linkages and the functioning of communal economy'
A. Introduction
1.        The aim of the study of linkages between the secondary cities and
their hinterland was to identify the principal economic actors, with a view to
measuring the volume of those linkages and their impact on local development.
The three communes selected have similar characteristics in terms of
population densities and agricultural production, but they have different
levels of urban development. With this particular selection it is possible to
assesa the consequences of urban development on the linkages mentioned and on
the monetarization of the regional economy.
2.        Gitega, Ngozi, and Ruhororo are located in the wealthiest and most
densely populated regions of Burundi (270-350 inhabitants per square
kilometer). Despite the steady 2opulation growth rate (2.8% a year) and high
land-use intensity (average farm size is between 60 and 70 acres), food
production per inhabitant remains unchanged and migration to the cities is
sparse. The city of Gitega (11,000 inhabitants) is growing at an annual rate
of 62, and Ngozi (4,000 inhabitants) at 4%. (Not very much is krown about
these rates; they seem to have undergone major fluctuations in recent years).
3.        The following procedure was adopted:
-    collection of the basic materials necessary to the study:  surveys
of households and of activities carried on in the communes
concerned, supplemented by talks with the local and national actors
(in Bujumbura);
-    processing and analysis of earlier surveys and of those carried out
in parallel by SNES;
-    preparation on the basis of groass results of consolidated economic
accounts for each category of agents: households, economic
activities (markets, businesses, services and craft-workers,
enterprises), government.  This accounting system reconstitutes the
receipts and expenditures of those agents as well as the source of
the receipts and the geographic location of the expenditures;
-    reconstitution, on the basis of these accounts for the various
economic agents, of a general economic accounting system for the
1    The following annex suimarizes some results of the study "Echanges
régionaux des communes de Gitega, Ngozi et Ruhororo" undertakei' by the

coumune (identical to that normally used at the national level),
making it possible to prepare a "matrix of monetary linkages among
economic agents" and a "general pattern of economic flows among
economic agents";
-    preparation, on the basis of this model matrix of linkages among
agents, of economic development scenarios providing a means of
evaluating, inter alia, the impact of urban development on the
commune's rural hinterland, according to several demographic growth
and income hypotheses for the urban and rural populations.
B. Incomes, expenditures, and linkages of the economic agents
4.        Overall, the average incomes by household (home-consumed production
included) are relatively close: FBu 112,000 per year in Gitega, FBu 105,000
per year ini Ngozi, and FBu 91,000 per year in Ruhororo. Agricultural
production, valued at local market prices, is practically identical:
FBu 56,000 and 61,000, respectively, and monetary incomes from marketing of
surplus agricultural products are very close: FBu 13,000 in Gitega,
FBu 17,000 in Ngozi and Ruhororo. The disparity is greater where monetary
incomes from non-agricultural activities are concerned, since these grow with
the level of urban development: 43,000 in Gitega, 30,000 in Ngori, and 13,000
in Ruhororo. Those households that may be regarded as "purely urban" are very
much in the minority in Gitega (5.7% of all households in the commune) and in
Ngozi (2.51). Nearly all the other households live within an intermediate
economy system, regardless of their place of residence (urban or rural): this
"primarv" population, whieh largely makes its living from agriculture, finds
opportunities for supplem %tary economic activities and incomes in the urban
center without this leading to actual migration to the city.
5.        Taking account of income disparities, the average expenditure of an
urban household is more than twice that of its rural counterpart:
approximately FBu 200,000 for urban households in Gitega and Ngozi, against
FBu 85,000 (including home-consumed production) for rural households in the
three communes. But the expenditure of urban households within total communal
expenditure is lower by reason of their population share: 452 in Gitega (232
with home-consumed production), 291 in Ngozi (122 with home-consumed
production). Even when only the monetary expenditure is taken into account,
food purchases by all communal households exceeds half the total in the three
communes, which may be explained by the low average income levels.
6.        Over one-half the wealth produced by household expenditure in Gitega
and Ngozi benefits other communes. Approximately one-fourth of this leakage
comes from the expenditure of the non-primary population, and three-fourths
from the expenditure of the primary population; 30% benefits the commune's
farmers, and of this 15-20% comes from the expenditure of the non-primary
population and 10-152 by that of the primary population. Barely 202 goes back
to the merchants in the urban center, and of this 72 comes from the
expenditure of the non-primary population and 132 from that of the primary
population.  This percentage of "imports" from the rest of the country is
partlv explained by the small size of the communal lands under consideration.
Also, these "imports' are partly offset by exports to neighboring communes.
However, the low urban development rateS reflected irn the low level of local
supply of non-agricultural goode and services, results in a major leakage of
vealth to the benefit of communes other than those where the households reside.



77
7.        Overall, the turnover from economic activities represents
FBu 3.2 billion in Gitega (of which 1.1 billion comes from agricultural
production), and FBu 2.2 billion in Ngozi (of which 0.9 billion comes from
agricultural production). A major share of the commercial activity of Gitega
and Ngozi comes from the wholesale and transit function of these two communes;
this function accounts for over one-half of the business turnover. Overall,
these activities generate monetary incomes (688 million in Gitega, 470 million
in Ngozi, and 38 million in Ruhororo) benefiting the households residing in
each of the three communes. Some 95% of market sales benefit primary
production: the traveling merchants who sell products of non-agricultural
origin all live outside the urban center and are classified as belonging to
the primary population. Of the incomes generated by commercial activities and
services, three-fourths benefit the urban dwellers in Gitega and two-thirds
those in Ngozi: the larger the demographic share of urban dwellers becomes ir
the total population of a commune, the more the job opportunities in the
center are snapped up by urban dwellers to the detriment of the rural
population.
8.        Businesses in the urban center and service activities receive many
more benefits from the expenditure of farm households than from that of
non-farm households. In Gitega and in Ngozi, merchants in the center receive
practically the same income that Ngozi receives from purchases of foodstuffs
by the non-primary population. The area of influence of both Gitega and Ngozi
covers a territory that is almost twice the area of the commune itself, with a
radius of 10-15 km; the share in market turnover of purchases by residents of
other communes represents about one-fourth of the total in Gitega and
one-third in Ngozi.
9.        The impact of the two RDCs on the communes of Gitega and Ngozi may
be estimated, respectively, at FBu 90 and 110 million, of which about one-half
represents wages paid, while cherry purchases account for 7% in Gitega commune
and 19% in Ngozi commune. The brewery at Gitega distributes about
FBu 80 million in wages in the commune, for a turnover in excess of one
billion. No sub-contracting has resulted from the installation of this
company, whose impact on local economic life is limited to wage distribution.
Local authorities
10.       Taxes collected at the communal level represent a monetary transfer
which goes back into the commune of origin in the form of personal payments,
operation of services, and investments. State expenditures are characterized
by a large wage bill, in particular in Gitega, and by investments that are
hard to identify but not inconsiderable.  The impact of these flows of money
is very great in the urban centers of Gitega (38% of total inceme) and Ngozi
(22%); but it is not inconsiderable either in the rural areas where school and
health establishments employ part of the working population. A comparison of
total taxes collected from resident households with State expenditures shows a
positive net flow in favor of Gitega (approximately 250 million spent and
80 million collected) and Ngozi (approximately 110 million spent and
45 million collected). If we take into account the tax on total expenditures
in Gitega and Ngozi, regardless of the place of residence of the final
consumer, total taxes collected exceed expenditure: 380 million in Gitega and
330 million in Ngozi.



78
C.  Functioning of the communal economy:  case of Gitega commune
il.       For reasons of clarity, we give below the results of the example of
Gitega coune. Linkages are formed around two f low categories: internal
flows (within the commune), and external flows (between the commune and the
rest of Burundi or foreign countries).  The latter take the form of outflows
and returrs of wealth into the commune.  The analysis of these flows in Gitega
shows that for overall household incomes on the order of FBu 2,027 million,
FBu 972 million, or 48S, is represented by home-consumed production, and does
not therefore create any linkage. In other words, almost one-half of the
wealth produced in the commune is not monetarized.  Almost all incomes
(FBu 950 million out of 1,055 million) are spent, and are converted into
incomes distributed partly within the commune (FBu 375 million), and partly
outside the commune (FBu 575 million). On the other hand, Gitega receives
FBu 557 million from expenditures effected in the commune by external agents.
(a)  External monetary flows
12.       These flows break down into flows leaving and flows entering the
commune.

(i)    Flows leaving the comeune
60S of the expenditures of Gitega'. households, i.e. FBu 575
million, are converted into incomes for agents outaide the comune.
Those incomes break down as follows:
-    159 million (35S) is redistributed in other rural comaunes in
the for, of income for farmers and merchants who come to sell
their products on the uarket at Gitega;
-    199 million (28S) is redistributed in Bujumbura, generated by
the sale of manufactured or processed products, or those that
have simply transited through Bujumbura;
-    89 million (15%) returns to the Central Governuent in the form
of taxes;
-    128 million (222) is exported abroad to pay for manufactured
goode or inputs.       0
(ii)    Flows returning to the commune
In turn, expenditures are effected by the various agents outside the
commune, and part of these are converted into incomes for Gitega.
These incomes represent a total of FBu 557 million, which breaks
down as follows:
-    208 million (372) comes from other rural communes in the form
of purchases in Gitega;
-    35 million (62) comes from Bujumbura, also in the form of
purchases of products in Gitega;
-    232 million (422) is distributed by the Central Government in
the form of vages (187 million) and foodstuffs consumed in
school and health establishments;
-    57 million (102) comes from abroad, in the form of receipts
from coffee exporte;
-    25 million (5%) comes from transfrrs among households (gifts,
dowries, rent, etc.)
This 557 million, which constitutes revenue for the commune of
Gitega, is redistributed in the form of incomes.
13.       Overall, flows entering and leaving the commune seem fairly vell
balanced (575 million against 557 million). The Central Government returns to
the commune a sum equivalent to 2.5 times that of the taxes collected.  Thia
redistributed money is essentially made up of wages.  Public investment, which
may be estimated to average some 20 million a year in the commune, represents
an additional flow of money, but only a small fraction of this is converted
into income for Gitega's enterprises.



80
(b)  Internal monetary flows
14.       The rural dwellers, whose monetary incomes are higher overall than
those of the urban dwellers (587 million against 456) obtain a large part of
their receipts from what they sell on Gitega's market (287 million), their own
production accounting for two-thirds. However, the largest share of their
monetary resources (300 million) comes from non-agricultural activities:
business activities in the urban center or in the hills (76 million),
wage-paying activities at the RDC, for the government, or in households
(167 million), and, lastly, coffee marketing and craft activities
(57 million).   Over half a billion (525 million) is spent by the rural
dwellers on the markets and in businesses in the center: food products still
represent the largest part of their consumption (some 210 million in
foodstuffs and 140 million in other food products). These expenditures make a
large contribution to commercial activity in the urban center.

15.       The origins of urban incomes are highly diversified:  of a total of
456 million, approximately 402 comes from the governament (179 million), 12S
from wage-earning employees of the RDCs and the brewery (55 million), while
the balance consiste of commercial activities (163 million) and other
miscellaneous activities (59 millinn).  The impact of the expenditures of the
urban dwellers is *till *light, both on the farmers in the cowiune and on
commercial activities in the center. In total, the wealth generated in the
center, Gitega, by purchases by rural dwellers is larger than the wealth
induced by urban foodatuff consumption.

D.        Effects of urban development on reaional linkages and monetarization
16.       Two contrasting scenarios projecting urban population have been
prepared to measure the effects of urban demand on the productivity and
monetary incomes of the farmers.
-    The trend hypothesis (Hyp. 1) shows city population increasing at an
annual rate of 6.2% (rate recorded over the past eight years).  The
rural population also follows the historical trend, averaging 2.2%
between 1986 and 2000 and 2.12 between 2000 and 2010, i.e. a total
growth rate of 2.8% and 32 for the commune as a whole. In this
hypothesis, the urban urban/rural population ratio will go up from
its present 112 to 25S in 2010.
-    The high hypotheses (Hyp. 2) accelerates urban growth and reduces
that of the rural population as a result of migrations to the city.
Gitega is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 10.4% up to
the year 2000, when the rate will decline to an average of 8.62 by
2010. In this case the urban/rural population ratio is 452 at the
end of the period.

Effecte of urban develooment on rural incomes
17.       In the first hypothesis, urban incomes grow fairly slowly; the
impact of this on rural incomes from sales of foodstuffs is minimal, reflected
in an average increase of FBu 200 per household per year. In the high
hypothesis, total urban income is considerably higher than rural incoaes from
2002 onwards, rising from 419 million to 6,324 million by 2010, against
1,470 million to 3,034 million for the rural inhabitants. The impact of this
growth on the monetary income of the rural dwellers is in this case five times
higher than in the preceding hypothesis, vith the sale of foodstuffs rising by
an average of 6% per annum.

Effects of urban development on consumption of goods and services
18.       The impact of expenditures on the production of wealth in the city
measured by the consumption of goods and services produced in the urban center
currently represents a flow of money equivalent to 4.52 of urban incomes and
9.7T of rural incomes. This difference is due to greater expenditure on the
part of the urban dwellers in Bujumbura and elsewhere. In the trend
hypothesis, with the same expenditure structure, a slight increase is noted in
average incomes from sales of goods and services: FBu 27,000 to 29,000 per
year for households affected by such sales (non-farm, urban and rural
households). This income breaks down into 13,000 of urban origin and 16,000
of rural origin. In the high hypothesis, these incomes would increase from
FBu 27,000 to 39,000 per household involved per year, i.e. 25,000 of urban
origin and 14,000 of rural origin. However, in the high hypothesis, the rapid
progress of urban development should be reflected in an increased local supply
of goods and services and a gradual substitution of imports and of products
manufactured in other regions, leading to an increase in local expenditure to
the detriment of expenditure in Bujumura and elsewhere.  It is assumed that
this portion would represent 8% of incomes of urban dwellers (against 4.52
previously) and 152 of rural incomes (against 9.72). In this case, the
increase in the incomes of households involved in the sale of these goods and
services would clearly be larger, and would be reflected in an average gain of
FBu 66,000 (against 39,000 in the preceding case), i.e. 44,000 of urban origin
and 22,000 of rural origin.

BURUNDI
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Cost-Benpfit Analysis
A.   Promotion of artisans
1.        The project has t-uo kinds of activities in the six cities
covered: Installation of artisans, and creation of development of
machine/training centers. The project vill promote the growth of
artisanal activities through variovs channels and incentives, help
existing artisans who vant to settle in secondary towns and provide
training and assistance to newcomers, essentially urban and rural
farmers, who are willing to get a permanent source of monetary income
indep2ndent from agriculture
2.        The firet issue to be raised about this component of the
project is the magnitude of the market for artisanal products: promotion
of artisans is possible only if these artisans have access to a groving
market fer their products.  The second issue is the economic
justification of the proposed investments in the sector. The
consistency between the projected growth of the market vill be checked,
while making sure that the monetary income generated by the estimated
activities vill promote division of labor by allowing artisans to fully
rely on this single source of income, and checking that the economic
rate of return of 4nvestments is satisfactory.
Analysis of the market for artisanal products
3.        The bulk of this market corresponds to household expenditures
for clothing, furniture, other horsing equipment, maintenance and
reneval of housing units, and construction of new housing units to
accommodate population growth and redistribution of population.
Household consumption in private services such as food and beverage
preparation, transport, commerce, etc. is not considered here. The
focus is put on monetarized expenditures as recorded in household
consumption surveys. Public expenditure is also a source of activity
and income for artisans. Intermediate consumption of artisanal products
by local activities should also be considered, but will be ignored, for
lack of information.
Present level of household snd communal expenditure
4.        According to the household consumption surveys carried out ln
Gitega and Ngozi for the study, the total and per capita consumption of
households in the urban centers and in the rural areas of the communes



85
Annex 18
Page 2 of 12
are the folloving (see Table 1). TiLse consumption levels cover only
monetarized expenditures, and are probably under-estimated. For the
flve secondary towns covered by the project, the total urban population
in 29,000 and the total rural population is 342,000 (corresponding to
the population of the five comuunes).  The total consumption in the five
communes can be estimated by using the average consumption levels
measured in Gitega and Ngozi.

5.        In addition to these consumptions, one must take into account
houuehold investment, mostly in housing.  This investment is not known,
but an order of magnitude can be obtained as follows. The stock of
housing units increases at: the same rate as population: around 4% in
urban areas and 3% in rural areas. The renewal of existing stock of
houses corresponds to an additional 4% in urban areas and 4% in rural
areas. The average cost of one housing unit in equivalent to 1 year of
household income, including self-consumption. Per capita income is
50,000 in urban areas and 18,000 in rural areas. The corresponding
annual investment in housing (including self-help housing) is therefore
the following:
Population  Growth  Per Capita       Investment in housing
(1000)    rate Z    income             (FBu million)

A significant proportion of this housing investment in rural
areas is not monetarized.  However, carpenters contribute to these
constructions.

6.        About half of the expenditures of communes is used for the
purchase of local building material and for remuneration of local
artisans. This corresponds to a total of about FBu 40 million for the
five communes considered. It is assumed that investments and
expenditureu by central administrations han no impact on local artisans
in the present situation.
7.        On the whole, the total local expenditures involving artisanal
activities is of the order of FBu 1.2 billion.
8.        The household surveys show that about 80% of the household
expenditures for clothing, furniture and household equipment is made on
the local market places and commerces. On the average, about half of
the expenditures correspond to the purchase of goods that are produced
by artisans, or to value-added by these artisans. This leads to a total
of FBu 120 million of artisanal products. For housing, we assume that
about 20% of current expenditures and 50% of investment correspond to
artisanal goods, which is to say, FBu 60 million and 270 million
respectively. On the whole, the purchase of local artisanal products
vould amount to about FBu 500 million. Exports to other communes are
hard to assess and will be disregarded. This volume of artisanal
products corresponds to full-time employment of about 1,700 artisans,
out of whieh about 25% have been identified in the five urban centers,
the remaining 75% presumably being dispersed in rural areas.
Projection of the consumption of artisanal products
9.        The projection of household expenditure during the following
10 years is based on a projection of population distribution and of per
capita consumption. The urban population of the five communes is
expected to grow at 10% per year. For the rural population we may
consider either the rural population of the five communes (the growth of
which is expected to be 2% per year) or the population of the area of
influence of the urban centers. This area of influence is hard to
define and to project. We will consider that the rural population
directly influenced by secondary towns is initially the population of
the five communes, and that this population will grow at 4% per year,
expanding beyond the limits of communes under the influence of
urbanization.
10.       The projection of household consumption in urban and rural
areas is based on the following assumptions:
- in urban areas, total (per capita) consumption will grow at the same
rate as population. Per capita consumption of clothing, furniture, and
housing will grow at 1% per year as a consequence of the upgrading of
the infrastructure and revival of urban economy. In addition to
consumption, the urban growth implies that investments in new houses
will correspond to 10% of the housing stock.
- in rural areas, total (monetarized) per capita consumption will grow
at 1.5% per year as a consequence of the development of urban
consumption and urban-rural exchanges. The surplus of monetarized

Page 4 *-f 12
income vill generate grovth of per capita exponditures in clothing,
furniture, and housing at an average of 3% par year. In addition,
investment ln houses vill grov at the sam  rate au population.
11.       The total expenditures of households for clothing, furniture,
housing and housing inveutuwnt has been projected in the folloving table
(ses Table 2): total expenditure vould double from FBu 2.7 billion to
5.5 billion. Expenditures for clothing, furniture and housing would
more than double from FBu 0.6 billion to 1.4 billion, housing investment
vould nearly triple, and the total of these two categories of
expenditures, that constitute one essential portion of the market for
artisans, vould grov from FBu 1.1 billion to 2.8 billion, at an average
rate of 9.4%. The share of urban areas in this total vould grov from
33% in 1986 to 45% in 1996.

This total vould grov from 33Z in 1986 to 45% in 1996.
12.      The incomes of the flve communes is expected to quintuple in ten
years. Hovever, the debt service vill absorb nearly half of income, and
expenditures on local artisanal products vould ouly grov by a factor of
2.5, from FBu 40 million to 100 million. Other public expenditures vill
play a role. The project itself vill provide employment to about 800
artisans and vorkers during 3 to 4 years. Other sources of public
expenditure should follow to sustain urban growth. It is reasonable to
assume a continuous flow of public expenditure (ln addition to the
expenditures financed on communal budgets) of the order of half of the



Annex 18
88                               Page 5 of 12
flow of expenditures on physical components of thé urban project, which
vould correspond to about FBu 230 million per year (equivalent to $3 per
inhabitint and per year at thie cowuunal level).  Ha]f of this &Mount
vould correspond to the local goode and services.
13.      Using the same ratios of consumption of locally produced goode
as in the base year for household expenditures, the total amount of these
artisanal products vould reach FBu 1.1 billion. "Import" substitution
resulting from a diversification of locally produced goods could expand
this total to FBu 1.35 billionu Adding public expenditures on local
goods, on local budget (100 million) and other sources (120 millions)
leads to a grand total of about FBu 1.6 billlon in 1996, about three
times the figure of 1986 and an average grovth rate of 12% per year.
14.      Assuming a constant productivity, the number of full-time (or
equivalent full-time) artisans would grow from about 1,700 to 5,300, the
bulk of that growth being in urban areas.
Economic Justification of the artisanal component of the project
15.      The project is intended to provide assistance and credit to
about 1,100 artisans belonging to the formal sector in the five secondary
towns. This represents only a fraction of the total number of new
artisans that are expected in the five secondary towns. Part of these
artisans vill be in the informal sector. So, the size of the project is
consistent with the expected growth of activity in secondary towns.
16.      Hovever, it is also necessary to check if proposed investments
(in the form of credits to artisans) vill be profitable. For this
purpose, a cost-benefit analysis has been developed in the case of a
typical carpenter workshop proposed in the project. Carpenters represent
the largest share of artisanal crafts and can be regarded as
representative of the sector.
17.      According to the study, the typical production unit vill need
the following investments (including taxes, in FBu 1986):
- purchase of a plot                                               34,000
- construction of the workshop,
connection to the electrical network                            304,000
- purchase of equipment (tools, ...)                               60,000

18.      This production unit is intended to provide full employment to
one senior artisan and to an average of three apprantices.  We vill
consider that the initial net income of the artisan must be FBu 300,000:
this income is compatible vith the present average income of
non-agricultural households in secondary tovns, ranging from FBu 200,000
to FBu 440,000 per household vith more than one activity per household.

Wa assum. that the income of the senior artisan vlll grov at k - 3% par
year. The incoma of apprentices vill be fixed at an average of FBu
100,000. This figure is comparable to the income of agrieultural
householde, and i above the prneant leval of remunaration of unskilled
labor &ad apprentices in urban areas. WV assume that the level of
remuneration of apprentices vlli romain constant ln the future.
The total initial income of the artisan and three apprentices lu
therefore v - 600 (ln constant 1000 FBu). The total income vill grov (in
constant prices) at k - 3% par year correspondlrg to a real increase of
the income of the senior artisan, and, *ither to an increase in the
average number of unskilled vorkers (apprentices) or to a promotion of a
fraction of these apprentices to the statue of artisan.
19.      The total present value of investments and maintenance costs ls
computed, using the folloving assumptions:
lifetime of installation (I1)             T1 - 15 years
lifetime of equipment (I 2)               T2 m  4 years
cost of naintenance of installation:    e1 - 2% per year
Including successive reneval of installation and equipment and

where: a is the initial output in a fully operational workuhop; JI is the
parameter characterlitic of the time needed to meet the full production
level ( r- 0.20 means that production reaches 632 of its maximum after
five years of operation); 9 in the time between the beginning of
installation a and the firet production: O is of the order of one year;
and k in a long-term growth rate linked to changes in technology,
modification in output, etc. We take k - 3%. The total discounted
present value of future production is therefore:
(i-k  <jkI~ e -(J-k)e
(-k) (J -k+r)
Let us call i the proportion of inputs (cost of raw materials,
electricity, tranfport, local taxes, etc.). The study shows that in the
case of a carpenter shop, the cost of inputs is i - 62% of output.
22.      The balance between costs and benefits at the discounting rate j
implies that:
f+ E +    + i Y = Y
or                  Y I+ r+V
1-i
In the case considered:
- 1326 + 8571 - 26,045
0.38
and therefore       a ' Y (J-k) (j-k+4 e (J-k)e - 0.101 Y- 2640
23.      The economic rate of return of the carpenter workshop as
proposed in the project, that creates four full-time employments, is
hlgher than 10% (the selected value of the discounting rate j) if the
output at market prices is more than FBu 2,640,000 in a normal year (full
production stage). This is likely to be the case since the study shows
that the average output of such a workshop could be of the order of FBu
3.1 million.
24.      The typical workshop described in the project assumes that one
starts from scratch. In many cases, the artisan will probably invest and
borrow lesq than indicated in the project. Therefore, it is hard to
assess the actual profitability of future activities created by the
project, but the preceding analysis shows that the rate of return ehould
be at least 10% in the case of the most "capital intensive" solution.
Other trades assisted by the project (brickyards, forges, solder shops,
mechanics, etc.) have similar capital output ratios and lead to
comparable rates of return.

physical contingencies, but vithout price contingencies iu the f olloving

Total                          122              368            490
Using the sanme ratio as above, and assuming that an investment of FBu 1.1
million will generate four jobs (ane senior artisan and three
apprentices) and a total output of FBu 2.7 million, thA project as a
whole would generate 1,100 jobs in secondary towns (including
apprentices) and 400 Jobs in Bujumbura and a total output of FBu 750
million in secondary tovus and 250 million in Bujumbura. The total output
of FBu 7hO million in the f ive secondary towns is relatively high in
comparison vith the z~arket for artisanal products as projected above (FBu
1600 million in 1996 for the f ive communes). This cames from the f act
that the typical workshops proposed in the project are more capital
intensive and productive than the average real artisans, who wili remain,
for a large part, either informai or vith a lover investment per worker
than assumel. in the study.
B. Infrastructure Component
Cost of the project
26.      For each city, the costs taken into account include investments
vith physical contingencies, net of tax liabilities, and recurrent
expenditures. The cost of maintenance is assumed ta be 3% of the
investment per year, and periodic renewal is estimated at 20% of initial
investment every f ive years. The lifetime of investment, properly
*   maintained, is assumed ta be infinite.
27.      The market value of land in the neighborhoode vhere
infrastructure is upgraded is taken as equivalent ta the total discounted
*   value of future housing expenditures (including self-housing) of the
population living in the neighborhoods. Initially, the number of
households n vith an average income b spend a proportion h of their
income on housing, so that the total housing expenditure of the
neighaborhood ls n b h. Since infrastructure investments concern not only
residential neighborhoode (for a proportion s of total investments), but
also activity areas (for a proportion 1-s), total expenditures by
households and activities ls taken as v0 - n b h.
S
28.      In the situation vithout project, this initial value of housing
expenditure grovs at an average of k 0 (for instance, k  --2%) that is
determined by the grovth of the city, the location of 2he neighborhood
inside the city, and the evolution of land use in the neighborhood
(densification, development of activities, etc.). The total discounted

29.      The effect of the prolect in (i) ln the short and sodium term to
antlcipate the transformation of the neighborhood by raising the market
value of land and ralsitg in the sare proportion the income that land
ovnere vant to obtain from their land: landowners increase the number of
their tenantes by adding rooms or housing unita for renting, or they
increase the average rent by offering housing units with better services;
similar changes happen in the houses occupied by owners and (II) in the
longer term, to increase the growth rate of the city's population
and economic activity. In the central neighborhoods, this i translated
into an increase of the value of the parameter k, for instance from 2% to
3%. In addition to k representing long-term trends, three parameters are
used to characterize the medium-term effect of the project on the market
value and the corresponding value of housing expenditure ln the
neighborhood.
- The firet parameter O is the period of time between the beginning and
the end of infrastructure vorks: O is of the order of two years.
- The second parameter a is the proportion of increase of the total
market value of land (and housing expenditures) that the project vill
have produced vhen its impact will be fully developed.
- The third parameter A is characteristic of the time needed for the
project to progressively develop its Impact on land values. For
instance, if >L- 0.4, 63% of the Impact of the project vill be reached in
2.5 years. At the date t, the increase in housing expenditure is
written:
àv (t) - 0 if   t < 0
Av (t) - a v  [- e -j4(t-e) e k(t-0) e k0e  if t>e
30.      The total dîscounted value of the future housins expenditure is:
= j-k [ j-k+J      j-ko  ]
The relative increase in discounted value of future housing expenditure,
taken as a proxy of the increase in the market value as a result of the
project, is therefore:
-V    ,    j-ko   ra  +  k-ko  e -(j-ko)o
V         j-k   lj-k+r        j-ko J
At the discounted rate J, costusad advantages of the project are

Conclusion
32.       For the whole infrastructure component (Bujumbura and five
secondary towns altogether), and at the discounting rate j - 10%, the
benefits of the project balance total costs (including maintenance and
periodic renewal) if the project generates an increase in the market
value of land of 20% for a value of JL.- 0.4 (63% of the project impact
is reached after 2.5 years) and if the long-term growth rate of the land
value is increased from 2% to 3% except in Bujumbura. These increases
of the land value are quite plausible for neighborhoods that are located
at the center or not far from the center of the cities.  The upgrading
of these neighborhoods will result in a higher level of private
investment in housing, higher densities of population and activities,
and a modification in income distribution.
33.       All the calculations have been made with the parameter k  - 2%
and k - 3% except in Bujumbura. This value of k is relatively
conservative if tte future urban growth rates are high, as assumed in
the project. The parameter k may vary from 1% to 5% when the urban GDP



94
Annex 18
Page 11 of 12
growth rate varies from 3% to 10. The relative increase in land value
needed to balance conts and benefits of the project (parameter a) la
sensitive to the value of k: for instance, a should reach 34X if
k - k - 2X This shows that the profitability of infrastructure
invesQment depends on the dynaxism of the urban economy.
34.       The value of a is also sensitive to the value of the parameter
which characterizes the pressure of the market (demand for lmproved
land in the neighborhood considered). If the demand for improved land
is veak ( - 0.1: only 40Z of the impact of the project on land use and
land market land prices are reached after five years), then the value of
a that could balance costs and benefits should reach 302.
35.       City by city, and for the whole infrastructure component, the
rates of return have been computed, assuming the following values of
parameters.
- long-term growth rate of land value k: 2% in Bujumbura and 3% in
secondary towns.
- parameter : 0.40.
- medium-term increase of land value a: 20% in Bujumbura, 40% in
secondary towns.
The rates of return are: 18% in Rumonge, 17% in Ngozi, 13% in Bujumbura
and Gitega, 10% in Kayanza and 6% in Bururi. For the whole component,
the rate of return is 15%.
C. Overall Coat-Benefit Analysis
36.       In addition to the installation of artisans and infrastructure
components, a benefit-cost analysis has been done for the other
components producing direct benefits: service centers for the artisans,
housing and community facilities (market places, slaughterhouses, port
of Rumonge).
37.  .   For the service centers, total investments, maintenance and
current expenditures during 4 to 5 years have been taken into account.
Benefits have been taken as equivalent to the cost of current
expenditures excluding the training agents, plus amortization of
equipment.

Annex 18
Page 12 of 12
For the housing component, coste include investents and their
reneval every 20 years and maintenance (3% per year). Benefite include
rent values taken as equivalent to 15% of investment in Bujuabura and
12% in secondary tovus. These rente start one year after lnvestent and
follov the trend described ln the infrastructure component.
38.  ,    For the comunlty faclilties, costs luclude investment reneval
*very 20 years and maintenance (3% per year). The benefits have been
taken as equlvalent to 50% of the increase of present vaiue of comuncal
incoae guenrated by these faciilties. In the case vithout project, this
incom is supposed to grov at 2% par year. The project impact ls to
generate a medlum-term growth of this licom (multiplication by 3 to 4
between 1989 and 1995 ln secondary tovns) and to increase the long-term
growth rate of this income from 2% to 4%. Only 50% of this gross
additional income ls taken into consideration as net benefits.
39.  .    The present values of costs and benefits of all components for
a discouuting rate of 10% are summarized in Table 4, which also presents
the rates of return for each component and for each town. These rates
of return range from 13% to 15% for the various componente and from 10%
in Bururi to 16% in Rumonge, all components considered.
