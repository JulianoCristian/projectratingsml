However, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, since only a\n            very small number of staff from the Boru Hatlari ile Petrol\n            Tasima A.S.(BOTAS) - the state owned company authorized to\n            operate oil and gas pipelines - were actually involved in\n            the implementation of the study to optimize the feasibility\n            of the proposed pipeline project. Despite the relatively\n            small project, lessons suggest that BOTAS could have\n            financed the study itself, but the Bank assistance was\n            requested in order to enhance the credibility of the study.\n            This strongly suggests that for the Bank, the operation\n            proved an expensive project per dollar loaned. However, it\n            places the Bank in a better position to evaluate the export\n            pipelines from the Caspian region - both oil and gas - and\n            possibly assist with their financing."}, "docdt": "2000-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
