3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Backiground
The countries of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan in the Central Asia Region have significant
proven reserves of oil and gas. Due to their landlocked nature and the constraints in capacity of the



existing infrastructure for transporting oil, the opportunity for export of their crude to international
markets, particularly Western markets, in large quantities has been limited. As a result, it has been
difficult for them to develop rapidly these resources for export and to use the revenues from the sale of the
oil and gas for economic development. A practical way to overcome this problem is to construct dedicated
export pipelines which would transit through several countries (such as Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia,
Iran, Russia Turkey etc.).
Based on Turkey's strategic geographical location and the existence of excess crude oil handling capacity at
its port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean coast, a dedicated transit pipeline through Turkey for the export of
crude oil from Azerbaijan and the Central Asian countries could be a viable option for resolution of this
problem. In this regard, Turkey hadl decided to undertake a feasibility study that would evaluate the
viability of such an option. If found viable, the proposed transit pipeline would resolve a variety of issues.
First, it would provide an alternative option for the export of crude oil from Azerbaijan and the Central
Asian countries, and hence stimulate the rapid development of crude oil in those countries; second, it
would serve as a bypass around the congested Straits (Istanbul Strait, Marmara Sea and Canakkale Strait)
that link the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea; and third it would provide an additional reliable source of crude
oil supply for domestic consumption.
Orieinal Obiectives
The objectives of the proposed project were to:
(a) identify and evaluate technically viable and environmentally sustainable pipeline routes for the export
of up to 45 million metric tons per annum of crude oil from Baku in Azerbaijan to Ceyhan in Turkey;
(b) conduct optimization studies of the routes so identified to arrive at the most robust pipeline route and
configuration which merits further and more detailed technical, financial and economic evaluations; and
(c) recommend a realistic commercial structure and financing scheme for building/constructing and
operating the selected pipeline.
The scope of the project was limited to a feasibility study as the actual thruput of the pipeline was not
known at the time of the study. A detailed engineering study would have been premature.
3.2 Revised Objective:
There was no change in the objectives of the project.
3.3 Original Components:
There were three components to this project.
Component 1: A Feasibility Study including conceptual design, cost estimates, economic analysis and
financing scheme.
Component 2: Route Survey and Environmental Audit.
- 2 -



Component 3: Training
3.4 Revised Components:
The original components generally remained the same, only with minor changes. The survey of the alternate
routes via Armenia was not done.
3.5 Quality at Entrv:
Not rated.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcomelachietvementofobjective:
The overall outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory, the feasibility study was completed and the
results discussed between the Borrower, the implementing agency and the Bank's supervision team.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Component l:Feasibility Study
This component was fully completed. The feasibility study included a diameter optimization, conceptual
design of pipeline, pump stations, terminal and ocean tanker loading facilities in Ceyhan, cost estimates,
pipeline tariff calculation and determination of economic feasibility and a financing scheme for the
proposed pipeline project. The component output is rated satisfactory.
Component 2: Route Survey
This component was fully completed in 1998. The route survey within the territory of Turkey included
several alternative routes. In accordance with OD4.01, the proposed Project has been classified as
Category C as it would not involve any construction activity; however, an environmental audit for the
selected route was carried out. The component output is rated satisfactory.
Component 3: Training
Training was given to the PIU on pipeline optimization techniques, route selection, environmental audits,
tariff calculations and economic analysis. The component output is rated satisfactory.
4.3 Net Present Valute/Economic rate of return:
Net Present value or Economic Rate of return was not calculated for this project.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Financial Rate of Retum was not calculated for this project.

4. 5 Institutional developmenit impacie:
BOTAS is the state owned company in Turkey authorized to design, construct and operate Oil & Gas
pipelines. Only a very small number of staff from BOTAS were involved in the implementation of the
study, therefore the development irnpact of the study on BOTAS was limited though not negligible.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors ouitside the control of government or implemienting agency:
A factor that positively affected the project is that there is significant concern in the Turkish population
about the potential increase in crude oil tanker traffic via the Turkish Straits (Bosphorus and Dardanelles)
originating from the Caspian Region, and the enviromnental risks associated with it. Therefore the project
received a significant amount of attention and interest from the Turkish population, which on balance
favors a pipeline which would avoid the straits. This view was strengthened by forthright support from the
US government which strongly favored a Baku-Ceyhan pipeline route for Caspian oil, long before the
results of the feasibility study were known.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
For geopolitical reasons, the GoT had a strong interest in the prompt implementation of this project. The
positive effect of this was that the study received full govemment backing and support throughout all
stages. However, there was also a perception that the GoT had a considerable interest in a favorable
evaluation of the Baku Ceyhan route compared to alternate pipeline routes.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
A key factor which positively affected the implementation of the project was that BOTAS as the
implementing agency was able to provide very experienced staff which were able to give qualified support
to the consultant for the Turkish pait of the pipeline section.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The estimated cost for the project was US$5.25 million of which US$5.0 million is in foreign currency and
US$0.25 million in local currency. The proposed Bank loan was provided as a fixed rate single currency
loan, for US$5.0 million, and would cover the foreign currency requirements of the project. The loan was
made to the Government of Turkey (GoT), but onlent to BOTAS in US dollars under similar conditions.
The local costs were borne by BOTAS in the form of support services, office space and facilities. Actual
costs were $2.94 million paid from the Loan and $0.25 million paid by BOTAS.
6. Sustainabilitv
6. / Rati(onale for suistainability riting:
The study was to assist the Government of Turkey (GoT) to evaluate independently the technical and
economic viability of a pipeline route for the export of crude oil from the Central Asian Region.
Confirmation of the viability of such a route would: (a) strengthen its political support internationally; and
(b) facilitate the ability of the Government to secure financing of the pipeline from private investors,
commercial banks, and IFIs. The study did not confirn ( or not confirm) that the pipeline was the least
- 4 -



cost option for exporting Caspian crude, but it did indicate it was feasible and potentially viable. The
pipeline may well be built.
6.2 Transition arrangement to r egular operations:
The feasibility study was fully completed, follow-up discussions with the Government of Turkey (GoT) and
implementing agency are taking place on a regular basis.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The request for this technical assistance loan was made by the Government of Turkey (GoT) to the World
Bank. The project was prepared in compliance with all Bank guidelines at that time. While this project did
not directly have any enviromnental impact, the borrower's obligation to conduct an environmental
assessment of pipeline route options was strengthened.
7.2 Siupervision:
The legal agreement drawn up by the World Bank and the technical annex states the conditionalities of
effectiveness are Goverunent of Turkey (GoT) to: (i) provide evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, that the
Governments of the transit countries on whose territories the project shall be carried out have no objection
to the study; (ii) sign a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with BOTAS, the loan beneficiary; and (iii) ensure that
BOTAS signs the contracts with the consultants to carry out the study. The loan was declared effective on
03/20/1997, a delay from the original schedule of 12/3011996. World Bank staff on a supervision mission
agreed to start the comprehensive analysis of the base route, and to undertake a desk study to evaluate the
viability of alternative route options.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The implementation progress was adequately monitored and reported. The performance ratings in the
Project Supervision Reports (PSRs) were realistic. The Bank's supervision team, borrower and
implementing agency worked together in a proactive and flexible manner. No deviations from Bank
policies and procedures were made. The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.
Borroier
7.4 Preparation:
The Government of Turkey had taken certain steps to prepare for this project.
(a) Political Sensitivity: The decision on the selection of export route or routes for crude oil from the
Caspian Region (CAR) has been the subject of several discussions between the international producers
represented by the Azerbaijan International Operating Companies (AIOC), the Azerbaijan National Oil
Company (SOCAR), and the Governments of Georgia, Russia and Turkey. Although the Bank has not
been directly involved in all of these discussions, it has maintained a position of neutrality and to the extent
possible, expressed its willingness to assist the parties once an agreed decision has been made. There is,
- 5 -



therefore, little danger that the Bank's support to Turkey's initiative to conduct this study could be
construed as bias of the Bank in favor ( or against) a pipeline route through Turkey rather than through
other countries.
(b) Clearance from Transit Countries: Government of Turkey (GoT) initiated discussions between the
Goverunents of Georgia and Azerbaijan to secure their support for the study. While the project was being
negotiated with the Government, discussions were still to be initiated with other possible transit countries.
It was determined that, in the event that positive responses from the Governments of these countries were
not received prior to contract negotiations with the consultants, the route options through these countries
would not be included in the study.
(c) Cooperation with the Producers: In order to upgrade the credibility of the final route selected, it was
prudent for Turkey to consult also w(ith the producers including those not represented by AIOC and also
SOCAR. Turkey has confmed to the Bank that such consultation has taken place and both AIOC and
SOCAR have expressed their no objection. AIOC has also informed the Bank that several of its
shareholders, but by no means all of them, would be interested in financing and participating in the equity
of a separate corporate entity that would build and operate a pipeline to transport oil from the CAR. The
Turkish study could thus serve as a basis for AIOC shareholders' decision on their options for the pipeline
issue.
7.5 Governmenit inmplen7entation pefformance:
BOTAS, the sole state-owned company in Turkey authorized to construct and operate intemational and
domestic petroleum, petroleum products and natural gas pipelines, was appointed by the Government to be
responsible for implementing the study with assistance of internationally reputable pipeline engineering
consultants. A Steering Committee composed of MENR, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Undersecretariat
of Treasury, BOTAS and TPAO was established by Government of Turkey (GoT) to review the outcome
of and oversee the progress of the study. The performance of this committee was satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
BOTAS established a Project Implernentation Unit (PIU) and assigned managers and key personnel for
supervision of the consultant and day-to-day operation of the study. BOTAS and the government were in
agreement with the World Bank that, since the actual throughput of the pipeline system is not yet known, a
detailed engineering study at this stage is premature. The scope of the project was limited to a feasibility
study that would evaluate the viabilily of the route options. This approach would contain the cost and
complexity of the study and would facilitate its rapid implementation.The terms of reference for the study
and the short list of consultants were finalized by the PIU in agreement with the Bank. The performance of
the PIU was satisfactory
7.7 Overall Borrowver perfonnance:
Satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
This was a very small but highly visi'ble project. BOTAS could have easily financed the study itself but
-6 -



requested Bank assistance in order to enhance the credibility of the study. For the Bank, this was quite an
expensive project per dollar loaned. However, it places the Bank in a better position to evaluate the export
pipelines from the Caspian (both oil and gas) and possibly to assist with their financing.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borroit'esr/inmplenienting agency:
The implementing agency emphasizes that as an Independent engineering Firm, PLE GmbH has perforned
the tasks within its scope of work at its Home Offices in Germany. BOTAS has attended the review and
approval sessions as well as the seminars and trainings as set forth in the agreed project schedule.
B. FURTHER REMARKS
Background (3.1 third last paragraph)
Although initially it might be the objective of the project to utilize the surplus crude handling capacity of
the Ceyhan Terminal, it has eventually been decided to consider a new terminal exclusively dedicated to the
project instead.
Revised Components (3.4)
The original components remained to a large extend the same, except the inclusion of the construction of a
new export Terminal in Ceyhan and the Back-up consultancy Services acquired through an additional
Agreement.
Outputs by Components (4.2)
The Feasibility Study was fully completed by the end of 1997 and approved by the World bank in August
1998.
Net Present Value (4.3) IEconomic Rate of Return and Financial Rate of Return (4.4)
Although they were not calculated, a software has been developed to reflect impact of alternative
organizational structures and financing scenarios on basic economic and financial indicators like the Net
present Value or Economic Rate of Return.
Ratings for Achievement of Objectives/Outputs of Components (Annex 5)
Content with the positive progress regarding the Project following the reaching of Agreement on basic
Project Documents and Agreements, borrower/implementing agency perceive that main objectives of the
study have been to a large extent attained, and therefore would be high rated.

Annex 3: Economic Costs and Benefits
This was a technical assistance loan to finance a feasibility study; therefore, financial estimates were not
made at appraisal nor at ICR. However, the firm PLE did an economic analysis on building of the pipeline
in their study (see Appendix III of PLE report). It should be noted that the study did not confirm whether
the pipeline was the least cost option for exporting Caspian crude.
