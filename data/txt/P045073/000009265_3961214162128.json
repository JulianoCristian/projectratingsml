environmentally\n            sustainable pipeline route options for the export of crude\n            oil from Baku in Azerbaijan to the international markets\n            throughout Ceyhan in Turkey, under various throughput\n            assumptions; b) conduct optimization studies of the routes\n            so identified to arrive at the most robust pipeline route\n            and configuration which merits further and more detailed\n            technical financial and economic evaluations; and c)\n            recommend a realistic commercial structure for building,\n            construction and operating the selected pipelines. The\n            project will be carried out by one or more consultants and\n            will consit of the following components: a) review and\n            update existing studies by Boru Hatlari ile Petro Tasima\n            A.S. (BOTAS) on the various pipeline routes; b) preliminary\n            design, route survey, implementation plan; c) economic and\n            financial analysis on various throughput assumptions to be\n            agreed with BOTAS; d) commercial structure and development\n            of Tariff models; and e) an environmental audit."}, "docdt": "1996-08-19T00:00:00Z"}
