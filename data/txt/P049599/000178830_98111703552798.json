employment\n            for the very poor and financing initiatives to assist the\n            most vulnerable groups such as orphans, street children,\n            persons with disabilities, the aged and those affected by\n            Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS); and c) enhance\n            in-country capacity to identify, prioritize, and implement\n            projects by training stakeholders. There are five main\n            components. The first, Community Subprojects, finances\n            demand-driven community-based socio-economic infrastructure\n            projects, social mobilization and capacity building,\n            beneficiary targeting, and project monitoring and\n            evaluation. The second component, Public Works, finances\n            labor-intensive works as a safety net scheme, and includes\n            information, education, and communication (IEC) activities.\n            The third component sponsors subprojects to construct and\n            rehabilitate facilities and provide services (including\n            transportation, care, etc.) to benefit vulnerable, and\n            includes IEC activities that focus on sensitization and\n            clarification. The fourth component, capacity enhancement,\n            strengthens the capacity of the Management Unit and supports\n            capacity building for all other stakeholders involved in\n            implementing subprojects.
