First, ECD program will support both national\n            and international, the continuous review and updating of the\n            policy framework. It will provide quality improvements to\n            complete the simplification and rationalization of the Bina\n            Keluarga Balita (BKB, or Parent-Child Program) modules of\n            program activities and field-test the changes before they\n            are implemented in the project districts; and it will\n            finance the integrated training program for the Posyandu and\n            BKB cadre. It will also develop an Information, Education,\n            and Communication (IEC) program for supporting an integrated\n            approach to ECD, and support the development of IEC\n            strategies and IEC campaigns. The activities will include\n            civil works, provision of necessary educational materials\n            and equipment, and teacher recruitment and training. Second,\n            ECD management capacity-building will support capacity\n            assessment and development at the province, district and\n            central levels. The component will also finance operational\n            support to al levels in the form of office equipment and supplies."}, "docdt": "1998-07-07T00:00:00Z"}
