F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objectives of the project are to support the short and long-term early
child development needs of poor children between the ages 0-6 in IDT villages in
selected provinces. The immediate short-term objective is the provision of emergency
complementary food to infants between 6 and 24 months. The longer term objectives are
to increase access, quality and utilization of ECD programs targeted to these poor
children.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
During the 1990's, it became apparent that most Early Childhood Development (ECD) programs
in Indonesia were considered less than effective. This was particularly evident in communities
with predominantly low-incomes families.

In an effort to address these shortcomings, the GOI accepted the need for policy reforms and a
framework that would integrate the policies for child survival (health and nutrition) and cognitive
and psycho-social development (early childhood education) into a more holistic and effective
approach. This resulted in the Bank's agreement to finance a loan to support the implementation
of the ECD project on August 14, 1998.

At Appraisal, the ECD policies of the Government of Indonesia (GOI) were fragmented. This
resulted in inequities and poor quality services in many regions of the country. Three major
policy-related concerns were identified. Each of these became part of the investment rationale for
the ECD project. The first was the recognition that pre-school children in these communities had
decreasing access to school readiness skills development. The second was the recognition that
these children also had decreasing access to health and nutrition programs. It was also noted that
the affected communities had a significant lack of family access to information concerning the
nurturing and quality care of pre-school children.

This project was clearly designed to support the sector-related goal of the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), CAS 16691-IND (last discussion before appraisal ­ July 10, 1997). This CAS
goal was: to enhance human resource development through investment projects aimed at
developing a national ECD program for Indonesia.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The original project development objective (see Loan Agreement, Schedule 2) is to assist the
Borrower in: (i) protecting children between the ages of six months and two years against the
effects of malnutrition and enhancing such children's growth and development (termed PDO1 for
purposes of ICR); and (ii) improving the access to and the quality and utilization of the
Borrower's Early Childhood Development programs in the Borrower's provinces of Bali, South
Sulawesi and West Java (termed PDO2 for purposes of the ICR).

The original key project performance indicators (PPIs) are listed as follows (see Loan Agreement,
Schedule 6):

A. Early Childhood Development Program Support
1. By the end of the project, scores in standardized achievement tests of studies in project TKs
    and BKBs have increased significantly;
2. By the end of the project, there is at least an 80% utilization of functioning ECD facilities in
    project villages;
3. By the end of the fourth year of project implementation, at least 75% of the target numbers of
    TK teacher supported clusters are meeting on a regular basis;
4. By the end of the fourth year of project implementation, there is at least a 60% improvement
    from the baseline in participation rate at BKB/Posyandu meetings;




                                                 1

5. By the end of Fiscal Year 2001/2002, 80% of children receiving complementary feeding
    under the project have improved their weight for their age as indicated on the growth
    measuring chart (Kartu Menuju Sehat/KMS); and
6. By the end of the third year of project implementation, a satisfactory level of community
    participation has been reached as evidenced by the signing of at least 70% of the targeted
    annual contracts with LKMD for the construction of ECD facilities in districts included in the
    first phase, and at least 70% by the end of the fourth year of project implementation in
    districts in the second phase.

B. Early Childhood Development Management Capacity Building
1. By the end of the third year of project implementation, at least 85% of fellowships have been
    granted; and
2. By the end of project implementation, at least 85% of ECD work plans (as measured in terms
    of agreed targets and budgeted expenditures) have been implemented.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
The PDOs and Key PPIs were not revised by the original approving authority. However, both
were operationally elaborated to provide more detail. The increased detail allowed the PDO to be
broken down into intermediate/short-term and long-term objectives which could then be more
closely aligned with the key indicators as stated below.           This improved the project's
documentation and provided a more logical structure that could be supported by the monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) process established for the project.

The elaborated PDO of the project is to support the short and long-term early childhood
development needs of poor children between the ages of 0-6 years of age in IDT villages in
selected provinces. The immediate short-term PDO is the provision of emergency complementary
food to infants between 6 and 24 months of age. The long-term PDO is to increase access,
quality and utilization of ECD programs to these poor children.

The original PPIs for this project were modified during the implementation to reflect the rapidly
changing economic situation and GOI funding priorities and decisions. Associated with the
above, the Borrower's decision to cancel the nutrition component (Section 1.7) required a
significant adjustment in the key performance indicators to reflect the reduced output that would
be expected from the project. The final, PPIs are as follows:

Short Term - Intermediate Indicators
1   a. There is completion and adoption of curriculum for BKB/Posyandu training in each of the
    provinces;
    b. 80% of annual targeted cadres are trained;
2. 100% of locally recruited kindergarten teachers are trained at an accredited IKIP by the end
    of the project;
3. 100% of ECD facilities (integrated ECD centers and BKB/Posyandu facilities) are fully
    equipped with necessary books, educational toys and other materials before facilities open;
4. 100% of the production and dissemination of IEC materials is completed under the project;
5. BKB/Posyandu sessions are conducted on a regular basis per month in all of the ECD
    facilities constructed under the project;
6.  By the end of the project, 100% of ECD centers have regular contact with health workers.
    (ECD Centers are project-supported facilities that implement both education and
    BKB/Posyandu activities);
7. By the date agreed, there is completion of the Impact Evaluation;
8. By the date agreed, all studies have been completed and submitted to the Bank; and


                                                2

9. By the date agreed, the MIS/GIS monitoring and evaluation system is established.

Long-term Indicators
1.   By the end of the project, there is at least 80% utilization of functioning ECD facilities in
    project villages;
2. By the end of the project, standardized achievement test scores have increased significantly
    amongst students of the project's ECD center;
3. By the end of project, 75% of target number of TK Teacher Support Clusters is meeting on a
    regular basis;
4.   By the end of project, there is a 60% improvement, above baseline, in participation rate of
    parents and children in BKB/Posyandu meetings;
5. By the end of project, satisfactory level of community participation is signified by the signing
    of at least 70% of target annual contracts with LKMD, a community-based organization
    within local village administration structure;
6. By the end of project, 85% of fellowships awarded and completed under the project; and
7. By the end of project, 85% of ECD work plans are fully implemented under the project.

1.6 Revised Components
No component was revised although the nutrition subcomponent of PDO1 was cancelled (Section
1.7).

1.7 Other significant changes
The nutrition sub-component of the project (operational title - Emergency Food Assistance) was
cancelled during project implementation. This amounted to about 50% of the total project loan.
This cancellation resulted from an investigation of the project's procurement of blended baby
food by the Ministry of Health. This investigation found that the proposed winner of the
procurement contract had supplied false information about its capacity to produce and deliver the
contract requirements. The Bank concluded that due diligence had not been exercised throughout
the bidding process.

The Borrower agreed with the Bank's advice and requested that US$10.60 million be canceled on
September 3, 2001. An additional US$51,484 was cancelled on October 29, 2001. In September-
October 2001, the Bank and Borrower reviewed and reallocated the project budgets and then
scaled down project outputs as required. The primary result was the dropping of the nutrition
sub-component from the project.       This scaling down may be seen in the revised project
performance indicators (Section 1.3).

The project completion date was also extended from the original date, 3/31/2005 to 12/31/2006.
This was due primarily to delays in procurement, construction, and delays in the government
budget (DIP/DIPA) process.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The project used a single integrated approach that addressed health, nutrition and education issues
in ECD. When the project was conceived, the use of such approaches in the fields of health,
nutrition and education was relatively new in Indonesia. For this reason, special care was taken to
understand and adopt lessons learned from prior projects implemented in Indonesia and other
countries. These lessons were drawn from more than 15 projects (PCD, 11/03/1997) worldwide.
Of particular importance were the following four learned lessons:

1. Physical growth of children is affected by the interplay between various psycho-social
    interventions (that respond to the social and psychological needs of children ) and nutritional
    interventions (McGuire and Austin, 1987; Werner 1979; and Pollitt, 1987);
2. The poor and disadvantaged are the main beneficiaries of interventions in ECD (Chaturvedi,
    et al, 1987);
3. ECD is most effective when complemented with parental education and support programs
    (Zuloaga and Winkler, 1982); and
4. ECD is most effective when supported by professional and para-professional staff with
    adequate training (Myers, 1992).

A review of the project design shows that these important lessons were recognized and included
in the project design. A JGF grant was utilized to support initial project preparation activities.
Some grant funds were used during early project implementation to finish project preparation
activities (such as the establishment of nutrition baseline and the completion of the GIS activity).
Later the grant was extended to support the cost of consultants in the area of project management
and ECD psychology, and some research activities (periodic community survey by universities to
monitor nutrition subcomponent).

Project Identification. Initial project identification was generally well conceived and implemented.
Project objectives were identified and formulated in a satisfactory manner. There is
documentation that demonstrates that extensive discussions were held during project
identification with the Government, donor community, NGOs and civil society at national,
provincial and community levels. Early project identification and documentation was found to be
Satisfactory.

Project Design. The project design was comprehensive and based on data and specific lessons
learned from in-country and international experience. The design was fully discussed with the
Borrower and Bank management, and it reflected a realistic understanding of the country's ECD
needs at national, provincial and community levels. As mentioned above, the project featured the
use of health, nutrition and education components within a single project. The project also
featured significant policy discussion and reform.

In the project design, community participation and the decentralization of management and
resources were emphasized.        Efforts were also made to design and implement appropriate
research-based activities (i.e., impact evaluation, situational analysis of daycare and playgroup
programs; review and development of degree (ECD) teacher training programs, and the
development of instruments for early detection of children with special needs) to provide
guidance for future decision-making in ECD development. The project design also recognized a
need to strengthen the capacity of the management teams associated with the project.




                                                    5

The project did require an extension to the project's closing date. The reasons for the extension
do not seem to include shortcomings in the initial project design, but, instead, were more driven
by changing project circumstances and implementation problems (Section 2.2).

Project preparation. Project preparation was well planned and implemented. Strong teams were
used by the Bank and the Borrower.           From Bank's side: the team was supported by an
experienced task manager, an ECD specialist, an education economist, and from the field office,
procurement, M&E, financial management (FM) and facilities specialists. From the
Government's side, the team included specialists in education, parenting education, and a child
development psychologist from the University of Indonesia

The PAD and working papers reveal a comprehensive understanding of the issues and a serious
study of similar projects planned and implemented in other countries. During project preparation,
an emphasis was placed on Financial Management (FM) and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E).
The project team prepared a clear, well structured set of performance indicators to support M&E.
These indicators were changed during the implementation of the project to reflect the changing
economic situation and needs of the Borrower. These needs included the reduction of project
scope after the cancellation of the nutrition subcomponent (Section 1.7).

Risks and Mitigation. The project did prepare a risks and mitigation matrix. The ICR found that
the critical risks (PAD, page 16) and the more detailed list (page 20) were for the most part, stated
in terms that were too general, and for that reason were not as useful as they should have been.
They did not adequately identify and discuss many of the more obvious risks and mitigation
strategies associated with: (a) delays in land acquisition; (b) poor construction practices; (c)
inadequate staffing and training; (d) poor distribution of goods to remote sites; (e)
implementation delays and governance issues associated with procurement; (f) inconsistent
access to counterpart funding; (g) untimely transfer and replacement of key staff; (h) and the
potential for inadequate national, provincial and local project management in the emerging
Government policy environment of decentralization.

During final project preparation and early implementation, the project team did demonstrate its
concern about some of these risks by including a project management sub-component designed to
enhance the capacity of project management teams. The team also encouraged the Government
to support a work plan agreement for all candidates which enabled them to pursue Masters and
PhD programs while remaining employed. The project also had loan conditionality that was
designed to address some of these issues.

The rather weak analysis and discussion of risks and mitigation strategies must be seen as a
shortcoming in the project's preparation and quality at entry. Many of the problems that arose
during project implementation were predictable as other Bank projects in Indonesia have had
similar problems and have found effective ways to address those problems. Effective risk
identification and mitigation strategies would have been important as a tool to improve project
implementation of this particular project. For this reason, the ICR rates Project Preparation,
Design and Quality at Entry as only Moderately Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation
Early years. Project activities related to PDO1 (mainly the procurement of the Blended Food)
was undertaken by the Ministry of Health (Depkes), whereas the rest of the project activities
related to PDO2 were undertaken by the Ministry of National Education, through the
Implementing Unit under the Directorate General for Out of School Education. The earlier
Implementation Unit was Dikmas (Directorate for Community Education) and in 2001 the


                                                  6

responsibility was shifted to the newly established Direktorat PAUD (Directorate for Early Child
Education).

Project implementation started slowly and was problematic during the first two years of project
implementation. Very little of the project was implemented during the first year (Aide Memoire,
5/17/99). The loan became effective in October 1998, but Dikmas the main implementing agency
for Education did not request the DIP (budget) during the previous year. Depkes, the other main
implementing agency for health and nutrition obtained its DIP, but did not implement due to the
previously stated problems with infant food procurement.

In the early years, most of the problems came from concerns about procurement, construction
design, local consultants, etc. However, as the management and implementation units became
more fully established and involved with the project, the Bank team was able to provide
additional inputs to project implementation. Although implementation of activities associated
with PDO1 remained unsatisfactory, project implementation for the PDO2 subcomponents
gradually improved during each year of the project's implementation and in the last years of the
project, the implementation of the project was the most satisfactory.

In September-October 2001, the procurement of Emergency Food Assistance Program was
discontinued due to the reasons stated in Section 1.7 above. With this discontinuance, the
nutrition sub-component (also known as Emergency Food Assistance) was cancelled and the
project no longer had any direct nutrition intervention. Seeking to provide some service in this
area, the project then took up a facilitating role by raising awareness among various stakeholders
on the importance of nutrition for child development. Simultaneously, the government took
proactive measures to support the nutrition program. This is evidenced by the launching of ECD
as a National Program by the President (2003) which facilitated cross sectoral intervention in
ECD. These actions also complemented the pre-existing government nutrition programs,
including the Vitamin A supplement, Nutrition Counseling, Education and Referral Program
(Posyandu, Puskesmas and local hospital), self-financed nutrition programs (Posyandu and ECD
centers) as well as Iodine Fortification. As the consequence of the cancellation of the Nutrition
sub-component, the project no longer had in place the system and associated resources to monitor
the impact of the non-project nutrition initiatives. Therefore, data is not available on the impact
of these programs on the weight-gain of the children. The corresponding PDO1 in the Loan
Agreement was not formally revised to reflect this change, as the ICR team feels it should have
been. The revision appears to have "fallen between the cracks" with the reassignment of this
project to a new and relatively less operationally experienced TTL and less than clear guidance
form management on the question of formal restructuring.

Later Years. During the later years of the project, the Bank and project management units were
able to develop an excellent, collaborative relationship. As a result, project implementation
picked up to a point where all project objectives and most of the performance indicators detailed
in Schedule 6 of the Loan Agreement were met or exceeded.

The Mid-Term Review. The Mid-Term Review (April 10, 2002) revealed a number of
implementation concerns that were addressed effectively. There was a concern that (a) project
implementation was falling behind the original appraisal schedule. Delays in procurement were
noted and several adjustments were also made to the school construction program. The project's
budget and performance indicators were revised to reflect these changes. It should be noted that
the informally revised performance indicators met or exceeded the expected outcomes of the
original project.



                                                   7

Project Extension. Due to delays in procurement, construction, and the government budgeting
(DIP/DIPA) process, the project was extended from a closing date of March 31, 2005 to
December 31, 2006. To support the extension, it was also agreed to reallocate some of the loan
funds and add a number of additional outcomes to the project.

Notwithstanding the previously stated concerns regarding the nutrition subcomponent, the Bank
project team, management and implementation teams and MoNE should be commended for their
willingness to be flexible during the implementation of this project. As mentioned above this
project was prepared and implemented during difficult times (financial instability and a major
move toward decentralization in education and health services) and the project was the first in the
associated sectors to use an integrated approach to meet ECD needs.               During project
implementation, this project witnessed significant changes. This led to significant policy and
institutional changes that improved the national system to support ECD. As issues came up,
frequent consultation was held between all parties and adjustments were agreed upon and carried
out to improve the performance of the project. For these reasons, the implementation of this
project is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The M&E design was well conceived. Outcomes were clearly established and performance
indicators were developed. Where feasible, performance indicators were drawn from established
data sets that provided for the establishment of baseline comparisons. With these elements in
place the M&E design utilized the Bank's standard approach to monitor the progress of the
project (ISRs, audits, and mid-term reviews). All of these activities were carried out as planned.
As project funding was reduced, performance indicators in the project were modified as required
during project implementation to maximize the project's impact within the limitations of its
available funding. M&E was rated as Satisfactory.

Impact Evaluation. A major feature of the M&E scheme was the impact study. The baseline study
was conducted in 2002 and the report of the evaluation was submitted on October 2003. The
follow-up, second impact evaluation was conducted on December 2004 and the report was
available in 2005 (Studi Dampak Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini). Subsequent Bank team review of
the methodology and outcomes of the study found that the study was methodologically flawed. It
was noted among other things that the differences observed between groups could be due to
`selection effects', rather than resulting from the services provided by the early childhood
development centers.

For this reason, the Bank team conducted a second, separate analysis of the original data. The
analysis was based on data collected through two surveys conducted in December 2002 and
December 2004 in villages where the ECD activities were implemented. In 2002, the project was
in its early phases of implementation. At this time, children aged 19-24 months, and children aged
49 to 56 months were tested. For both age groups, two groups were interviewed: those that did
participate in ECD activities, and those who did not. The sample size was around 450 children for
each age group. In December 2004 the same children were tested again. Based on names and ID
codes, 326 children from the young age group and 383 children from the older age group could be
matched across the two surveys.

A summary of the results (table 1 and 2) shows that for the younger group of children,
participating in ECD activities was associated with increases in the scores on social ability (a
difference of 0.24 standard deviations). For this age group, no impacts were found for the
indicators measuring social, cognitive, language, psychomotor, or academic skills development.
For older children, significant impacts are found for reading scores and overall school readiness,


                                                 8

also in the order of 0.2 standard deviations. No significant impacts were found for older
children's writing and counting skills. The estimates are based on children for whom data are
available from the 2002 and 2004 surveys. The results (outcome variables) are obtained from
scores from 2004, and the estimates correct for the scores in 2002, parental education and
consumption, and age of the child (independent variables).

Note: Impact in terms of standard deviations of test scores. T statistics in parenthesis. Estimates
correct for baseline test scores, age at baseline, parental education and consumption. Treatment
group are children that participated in ECD activities in 2002.

The impact estimates above provide the best possible estimate of the impact of the PAUD project
with the available data. There is, however, room for improvement in the design and analysis,
providing lessons for the evaluation of the next ECD project. First, it would have been desirable
to have one firm collect both rounds of the survey. Because more than one firm was involved,
testing instruments are not comparable across the two years, and many children could not be
traced in the data. Also careful pre-testing of the measures used would have helped prevent
obvious errors, such as not collecting age for older children in the second round. Last, it would
have been preferable to draw the control group from different areas than the treatment group.
Although this approach was better than the earlier analysis, it is still hard to distinguish between
selection effects (more advantaged children enrolling in ECD activities) and intervention effects
(impact of ECD services) if the control and treatment group are from the same villages.

Based on the above, the ICR found the Impact Evaluation Unsatisfactory as originally
implemented, but Moderately Satisfactory as recovered through the efforts of the Project team.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
There were no special or specific safeguard policies identified in the PAD or the Loan Agreement.
The Environmental Assessment rating was rated as `C', reflecting a determination that the project
should have no significant environmental impact. At completion, the Project was in full
compliance with the Bank's standard safeguard policies and guidelines. Because no special
safeguard policies had been identified, the Safeguard Compliance was Not Rated

The project was prepared with significant inputs from a financial management specialist.
Financial management records were maintained on the project, reviewed during missions, and at



                                                  9

project completion. All audits were conducted as agreed and opinions and comments were
followed up by the Government. Although the auditors found no significant irregularities, there
were delays in following up on other findings although eventually these issues were addressed in
a satisfactory manner. At present there are no outstanding audit issues relating to the project.

It should also be noted that throughout the project implementation period, there were delays in the
government budgeting process which negatively affected the efficiency of project
implementation.

The Fiduciary Compliance was rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
There is evidence of sustainability and replication of the ECD program at the district, sub-district
and community levels. ECD programs have now been well institutionalized. This is reflected in
the handing-over of the ECD facilities supported by the project from the national government to
district governments with an MoU signed by bupati (regent) and head of DPRD (local
parliament). The district governments have agreed to continue financing and maintaining the
ECD programs in their respective districts. In all of the participating districts, the district
governments pay the teachers' salaries and the community contributes to other operational costs.
An exception is in one of the project district (Kota Denpasar-Bali), where the communities were
able to cover both teacher salaries and operational costs. These findings indicate that the program
is well sustained.

There are reasons to be optimistic about the potential for sustainability of ECD programs at the
central level. Many project models are now adopted as national policy for central funded
activities. The project's more cost-effective facility designs have also been adopted by MoNE as
models for future development of ECD programs. In addition, the new instructional materials and
trained teachers combine to provide a much stronger pedagogical model and potential for
improved quality of ECD programs. It is also noted that the budgets necessary for ongoing
support of these new and upgraded ECD programs have been fully integrated into the planned
budgets of the MoNE.

Taking lessons learned from the ECD project, in collaboration with the Bank and the Netherlands,
the Government has recently (2007) established a new project, Early Childhood Education and
Development (ECED). The development objective of the project is to improve poor children's
overall development and readiness for further education within a sustainable quality ECED
system. To achieve this objective, the project will: (a) increase the capacity of poor communities
to engage in participatory planning that will result in new or improved ECED services for their
children and families; (b) prepare the foundation for a sustainable ECED system through
budgetary commitments from participating districts, establishment of a national quality assurance
and professional development system, and district capacity building; and (c) ensure continuous
improvement of service delivery and system building through establishing effective project
management, and monitoring and evaluation.

The project will target an estimated 738,000 children ages 0 to 6 and their parents/caretakers
living in approximately 6,000 poor communities located in 3,000 villages within 50 poor districts
throughout Indonesia meeting specified criteria (i.e., an average of 123 children per community).
Particular attention will be given to children ages 2 to 4 as some children may enroll in formal TK
at the age of 5. The project is expected to have a demonstration effect that the Government can
use as a rationale for the expansion of ECD coverage of services for poor children in Indonesia.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
As mentioned in Section 1.1, this project was clearly designed to support the sector-related goal
of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), CAS 16691-IND (last discussion before appraisal ­
July 10, 1997). As stated in the CAS, this goal was: to enhance human resource development
through investment projects aimed at developing a national ECD program for Indonesia. The
project also supported specific sector-related goals of the Bank and the Government of Indonesia
(GOI). These were clearly identified and documented during project identification. As this
project funding was reduced (cancellation of the nutrition sub-component), the scope of services
provided by the project was necessarily adjusted to reflect the lower levels of funding.
Unfortunately, with the elimination of the nutrition sub-component, PDO1 was effectively
eliminated as an objective in the project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
PDO1 - Protecting children between the ages of six months and two years against the effects
of malnutrition and enhancing such children's growth and development ­ Even though
PDO1 was never formally removed from the project, it ceased to be a viable objective when the
large nutrition subcomponent (Schedule 2, Part A, Sub-component 5) was cancelled (see more
detailed discussions in Section 1.7 and 2.2). Although the Borrower did provide resources to
these targeted children outside the project, results data was not available to the project. The
project's performance indicator below was not met. Therefore, the ICR rated the achievement of
this PDO as Unsatisfactory.

Associated PPI
    By the end of 2001/2002, 80% of children receiving food supplement gain weight. ­ not
    measured. As described on section 1.7 and 2.2, no measurement system was in place to
    measure this indicator as the project shifted its strategy from providing direct nutrition
    intervention into a coordinating and facilitating role.

PDO2 ­ Improving the access to and the quality and utilization of the Borrower's Early
Childhood Development programs in the Borrower's provinces of Bali, South Sulawesi and
West Java - This PDO was fully monitored and evaluated throughout the project implementation
period and the progress of project performance indicators indicated that PDO2 was full achieved
and in some cases exceeded. The ICR rated the achievement of this PDO as Satisfactory based
on the following project performance indicators:

Associated PPIs
    Higher scores on tests to measure readiness to enter grade one (as compared to children
    not served by the project) ­ Achieved. The overall trend was positive, with the nature of
    this impact varying according to children's ages and the aspects of development that were
    assessed. Analysis of the data collected for the project impact study indicate that the
    younger children (aged 19-28 months at the baseline in 2002) achieved significantly higher
    scores on a "social ability" test two years later. For this age group, no significant impacts
    were found for "social thinking," cognitive development, language, psycho-motor
    development, or academic scores. For older children (aged 49-56 months at the baseline in
    2002) significant impacts were found for reading and school readiness scores. No significant
    impacts were found for writing and counting scores.

    80% utilization of functioning ECD facilities in project villages ­ Exceeded. (i) The
    project built 430 new facilities (Integrated ECD Centers and BKB/ Posyandu) and renovated


                                                 11

251 existing facilities. Project monitoring revealed that the utilization rate for the ECD
facilities was 100% as measured by the utilization of building facilities, learning materials,
furniture, teacher, cadre, organizer, learners, and parents.

The project team indicates that facilities available at the ECD centers can be utilized as one
proxy to measure the extent to which the centers are well-functioning. These educational-
supported facilities include kindergarten teacher, learning materials, and regular contact with
or support from health worker. The project data shows that the project has (i) successfully: (i)
trained 326 Diploma 2 kindergarten teachers (100 percent of the project target). Local
governments in the participating districts also contributed to the provision of 48 additional
scholarships for Diploma 2 kindergarten teachers so that the total number of D2 kindergarten
teachers available for the project was 374. This, in turn, enabled the project to allocate two
kindergarten teachers for each kindergarten-supported project (integrated ECD center). (ii)
The project has also successfully provided books, furniture, and educational toys to the
targeted ECD centers' supported project.; and (iii) With regard to the presence of health
workers who were supposed to make regular contact with the kindergarten's supported
project (in the integrated ECD centers), the data shows that all of the kindergartens were
regularly visited by health workers from local health center (Puskesmas).

These findings also suggest that the ECD centers are now fully functioning. Since their
establishment, the total number of children received integrated services in the 297 integrated
ECD centers was on average 8,672 children, and the attendance of the BKB/Posyandu was
19,665 children.

By end of year 4, 75% of TK teacher support clusters meet regularly ­ Exceeded. The
project encouraged the teachers of the 187 integrated ECD centers (TK) to establish teacher
support clusters. In 2004 on the average, 50% of the targeted schools held meetings of these
teacher support clusters. In 2006, 75% of the teachers' attended cluster meetings and thus,
the target was achieved. In addition to these cluster meetings, the teachers also joined TK
teachers meeting organized by the IGTKI (TK teachers association) in respective sub-district/
districts.

By end of year 4, 60% improvement from baseline in the participation rate at BKB/
Posyandu meetings ­ Exceeded. The project PAD established an improvement of
participation rate of parents and children in BKB/Posyandu meetings at 60% above the
baseline data which was estimated at 16.6%, 30.9%, and 11.2% for West Java, Bali, and
South Sulawesi respectively.

When a comparison of participation/attendance rate was made over the baseline value, it was
found that the increased rate was almost double in West Java (31.1%), more than twice in
South Sulawesi (35.2%) and even three times higher in Bali. It is likely that the latter
achievement in Bali was so high because the BKB/Posyandu activities were held in Banjar
(center of community social and cultural activities). Consequently, the Balinese regarded the
BKB/Posyandu as a part of their compulsory social activities, for which they traditionally
apply a social sanction for non attendance. This was not the case for BKB/Posyandu in other
regions where the attendance at BKB/Posyandu was regarded as a voluntary activity.

Increase in community participation ­ 70% annual contracts with Community
Organization - Exceeded. The ECD project adopted participatory approaches in order to
build community ownership and sustainability. Different from the community participation

    approach being used in a subsequent ECD project, this project identified LKMD ­ local
    community development councils ­ as an official representative of the local community. .

    By the end of project, satisfactory level of community participation is signified by the signing
    of at least 70% of target annual contracts with LKMD. The contract is an agreement signed
    by the District Project Manager and the head of LKMD, stating the amount of grant received
    and agreement in the part of the LKMD that they will execute the grant according to the
    agreed guidelines, concerning specification of construction, hiring and supervising of labor
    and procurement of materials.

    The project data shows that the number of contracts with LKMD and the community
    representative forums were 100%, exceeding the targeted rate of 70%.

· By the end of the third year of the project, at least 85% of fellowships have been
    awarded - Achieved ­ overall 95% fellowships awarded.. The awarding of fellowships to
    pursue the diploma program was successful ­ all of the 326 fellows for the two-year diploma
    (D2) for kindergarten teachers and 3 fellows of the diploma (D3) in nutrition completed their
    studies in a timely way. There was, however, an issue with the fellowships for post-graduate
    degree programs: 11 out of 34 master's degree program fellows were not able to finish their
    degree, and none of the 6 PhD candidates were able to complete their degrees, having
    completed course work but not the dissertation. The evaluation of this fellowship program
    revealed that province-based staff was more successful than the Jakarta staff. One factor
    contributing to the better achievement of the province-based staff was that they were released
    from their routine activities and allowed to do a full-time study; this was not the case for the
    Jakarta-based staff, whose academic work had to compete with their routine jobs, which
    included intensive travel to various provinces. The Director General of Out of School
    Education took the initiative of discussing the matters with both the fellows and the National
    University of Jakarta (UNJ), but the problem remained unresolved because the Jakarta office
    was never able to release the fellows from their work, and the opportunity cost for the fellows
    was high. An action plan has been undertaken to address this problem. It was agreed that the
    fellows to continue their study and to cover their own expenses after the project expires and
    they will be released from their tasks to be able to focus on the completion of the study.
    Although in general the failure of the Jakarta-based staff to complete their degree studies
    does not substantially affect the outcomes, this case strongly indicates that the award of the
    fellowships was not based on an appropriate staff development plan or a sound institutional
    need assessment. This lesson has been incorporated to the design of the new ECD project.

    By the end of each year of Project Implementation, at least 85% of ECD work plans (as
    measured in terms of agreed targets and budgeted expenditures) have been
    implemented. Achieved. The project shows that about 100% of the ECD work plans have
    been implemented under the project. This achievement is indicated by the disbursed
    payments of 100% as of April 30, 2007.

3.3 Efficiency
The efficiency of the project is reflected by both the high benefit-cost ratio and the cost-
effectiveness of investing in ECD (Annex 3). The most significant and measurable benefit of
investing in ECD is the improved education attainment in the medium term and thus improved
labor earnings in the long term. It is estimated that in Indonesia, the average benefit-cost ratio of
providing ECD services to a group of disadvantaged children is 7.26, close to if not higher than
those in some comparable developing countries.



                                                 13

The investment in ECD is also cost-effective compared with alternative public investment aimed
at helping the most disadvantaged child achieve primary education completion. As the impact
evaluation results show, a child going through an ECD program would better develop cognitive
and social skills, and readiness for formal primary education.           Alternatively, without going
through an ECD program, this child may need special attention and assistance to complete the
primary education cycle, which would require additional public resources. For example, the unit
cost of primary education is estimated at about US$230 per year in Indonesia. In comparison, the
current special education in Indonesia has a much higher unit cost of US$920 per year. Therefore,
to bring a disadvantaged child to primary education completion, the special education (without
ECD) approach would cost 2.65 times as much as the ECD approach, as the ECD program can
prepare the child well enough to go through regular primary education.

In addition, the project has adopted the cost-effective measures in several key investment areas,
including using the extension of existing buildings to expand Posyandu/BKB services and
adopting double-story structure for kindergartens construction.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

PDO1 was not fully achieved. Due to reasons discussed above (Section 1.7), the funding for
PDO1 was cancelled and the associated activities were dropped from the project. It is the
judgment of the ICR that the expected outcomes of this PDO were important and the dropping of
the associated activities from the project was unfortunate. Although it is understood that the
Government took over many of these important activities associated with this PDO, the removal
of the nutrition component from the project negated the potential for project monitoring and
evaluation of this objective, so there is no clear evidence that the intended outcomes of the project
were met by other means. Since PDO1 was never formally removed as an objective of the project,
the ICR must rate the outcome of PDO 1 as Unsatisfactory

PDO2 was fully achieved and in some cases exceeded. The only exception was the finding that
about 17 graduate fellows had not completed their program of study by the end of the project.
However, it is understood that some, if not most of these fellows will finish using other sources of
funding.

When all outcomes for PDO2 were considered, it is evident that significant change has taken
place in ECD as a result of this project. The activities associated with this PDO were strongly
relevant to the needs of ECD and the outputs from those activities demonstrated an approach that
significantly improved the quality of ECD in the project focused communities. The lessons
learned from this project have been clearly understood by the Borrower and as a result, there is
evidence of significant policy reform that will serve the needs of ECD nation-wide. The ICR
rated the achievement level of PDO2 as Satisfactory

Rationale for overall outcome rating. When one looks at the many issues associated with the
implementation of the project and the poor performance of PDO1 as compared to the original
objectives of the project, it is difficult to rate this project as fully satisfactory. Throughout the
duration of the project, the PDOs and project components were not formally modified. Therefore,
the original objectives and components, as specified in the LA, must be used to rate the
achievement of the project objectives and associated activities. When this is done, it is evident the
project did not fully achieve the original objectives. The project witnessed: (a) the cancellation of
the nutrition subcomponent which constituted about 50% of the project funding (through to the
results of a misprocurement case); (b) many project implementation delays in the first two years


                                                   14

of the project implementation; (c) delays in budget process (DIPA) due to the changes in the
Government financial management regulations that affected the implementation schedule of the
project in 2005; (d) audit issues that were slow to be resolved; and (e) documented cases where
financial management was less than satisfactory

On the more positive side, PDO2 has had significant achievements and it generally met, and in
some cases, exceeded all its planned operational objectives as measured by the PPIs. The impact
of PDO2 is expected to be substantial in the development of ECD and the next project has
profited from the many lessons learned from this project.

On balance, the project is not fully satisfactory, but it can be argued that the project deserves to be
considered Moderately Satisfactory based on the previously discussed criteria.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The institutional changes noted below resulted in an equal opportunity for both boys and girls in
poor, rural areas to enroll in the target ECD programs/schools. The Government is currently
preparing a campaign to improve access and gender balance in ECD programs. Recognizing that
over time, improved school access and quality have a direct impact on poverty in rural areas, the
project has focused much of its resources on the selection of ECD program/school sites that are
located in such areas. The policy reforms also sought to support decentralization of decision-
making down to the community level.

These changes influenced the design of the new ECED project (Cr.4205-IND). To contribute to
the Government's objective of reducing poverty by making service delivery responsive to the
needs of the poor, it targets children and their parents/caretakers living in poor village
communities in selected poor districts throughout Indonesia meeting specified criteria. The
village communities will be empowered to establish a forum with balanced representation by
women, youth, and the poorest to voice their needs and to share responsibilities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
ECD is a comparatively a new agenda of the Ministry of National Education. When the project
was started in 1998, the Ministry of National Education covered only pre-school education, i.e.,
for children of 4-6 years old. The project has inspired the Ministry to establish the Directorate of
Early Childhood Education (PAUD - Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini) within the Ministry of National
Education (MONE) structure in 2001. The institutionalization of the ECD program is also marked
with the establishment of ECD sections ­ or, at least inclusion of ECD into the mandate of
community education section -- at the participating districts as well as the establishment of ECD
Forum at national, provincial and district levels. In addition, the mainstreaming of ECD was
reflected in the law of national education system. The flourishing ECD emphasis in Indonesia has
also strengthened partnerships among national as well as international agencies to support ECD-
related activities. An example of this may be found in the establishment of ECD program in
women's organizations (PKK, Aisyiah Muhammadiyah, and Muslimat NU, etc.).

The MoNE and the MOH have also recognized the importance of integrated ECD programs
which provide both education and health services to support ECD. Government policies have
been adopted during this project to further this approach. The project has witnessed MoNE
reassess its commitment to ECD. It has also begun to formalize ECD as an important aspect of
education, giving more staff, facilities and resources to the effort.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None noted.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
No Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops were conducted during the implementation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible
The development outcomes of this project are clearly within the mainstream of MoNE, MOH and
donor priorities. As such, there is little reason to assume that the outcomes would be at risk in the
foreseeable future. The only outcome that might be more carefully considered is the
Government's commitment to support improvements in nutrition within ECD programs. It seems
possible that this effort could be held back by one or more the following possibilities: (a) lack of
acceptance by the civil society; (b) inability of MOH to fully sustain the introduction of nutrition
programs in rural ECD programs/schools; (c) the selection of an inappropriate approach to
support the effort; (d) prohibitive long-term cost to fully implement the nutrition program; and (e)
lack of long-term sources of supply of suitable food and nutrition supplements.

Not withstanding the above factors, it is the opinion of the ICR that the Government has placed a
high priority on ECD as an objective to support future education development.             With the
Government improving its capacity to fund such programs, it seems unlikely that MoNE will fail
to continue upgrading and improving ECD programs nation-wide.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
The project was not assessed at entry by QAG.

The ICR found that the identification, preparation, pre-appraisal, and appraisal missions were
adequately staffed. These activities used the services of five specialists in ECD areas, one
architect, one economist, and one program management specialist as well as support from the
regional office in the areas of M&E, procurement and financial management (FM). Project
negotiations were also well planned, managed and implemented. Evidence of this effectiveness
may be seen in the Bank teams' ability to work through a new, innovative, integrated approach
wherein both MoNE and MOH would participate in the project. The project was also identified
and prepared in less than one year, a rather short period of time for such projects in an unstable
economic environment.

The identification and preparation missions were able to assist the Government to produce a
thorough and comprehensive project design that did not change much during the subsequent
stages of project preparation and implementation. To support quality improvement of ECD, the
preparation missions paid special attention to the holistic integration of equipment, facilities,
pedagogy, curricula and staff development in the project design, and the need for the project to be
flexible in a time of political or economic change.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The supervision teams were generally well staffed and their aide memoires (prepared in
collaboration with the Government team) were generally well prepared. Besides the Bank team, a



                                                   16

number of other consultants were asked to provide substantive input to ECED (two consultants
funded through the Danish Trust Fund and one consultant funded through the Dutch TF) during
the early stage of the new ECED project preparation). The supervision missions also used the
ongoing support of an architect and a construction specialist as well as those of a CDD/program
management specialist. Under agreement with the TTL, the CPMIU also hired other ECD
experts to support the supervision process. These included one consultant (from University of
Florida) who introduced the BCCT approach in children learning and another specialist in
parenting education. The ICR also found that the supervision teams consistently monitored the
safeguards and fiduciary aspects of the project as required by Bank guidelines. The Project
Performance Indicators were reviewed and updated during each supervision mission. The project
was consciously linked with the previous Bank project and with other education projects with
commonly defined objectives. It is noted that the supervision of the project steadily improved
through the duration of the project and during the last two years, in particular, became efficient
and effective.

It is noted that throughout the duration of the project the Task Team Leaders (TTLs) for the
project (there were a total of three) effectively utilized regional personnel and consultants that, in
the end, saved considerable cost in the supervision for this project.

A review of the PSRs/ISRs and their associated aide memoires revealed that there have been
many other problems that were effectively addressed by the supervision teams through close
collaboration with the Government. In particular, procurement of goods and construction has
been problems throughout the implementation of the project. The supervision team has carefully
monitored the implementation of these activities and when necessary, acted quickly to effectively
protect the interests of both the Government and the Bank. In all cases, specific actions were
agreed upon with the Government to bring the project back in line with the implementation plan.
Relations with the Borrower have been strongly collaborative and productive.

On the downside, associated with the supervision process, the project team failed to recognize the
importance of formally revising the project to reflect the 50% cancellation of loan proceeds and
the dropping of the Health sub-component (PDO1). This shortcoming resulted in a downgrading
of the overall performance of the project. It is primarily for this reason that the ICR rated
supervision as only moderately satisfactory..

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
As mentioned above, this project has been challenging for the Bank to support. The project
design team did not adequately identify and address the potential risks to the project and many of
these risks proved to be real issues during project implementation. This shortcoming must be
considered less than satisfactory since many of the undeclared risks were identified and addressed
in meaningful ways in previous Indonesia projects. There were also many project management
and other implementation issues which were, in part, brought about by the effects of political and
financial situation in Indonesia. There is evidence that Bank management and project teams made
substantial efforts to address the changing needs that were brought on by this situation. Project
documentation clearly reveals that the project team stayed focused on the Project Performance
Indicators and effectively used M&E and the Project Performance Indicators to measure project
success as required by Bank guidelines. This was particularly true after the restructuring of the
Project Performance Indicators during the Mid-term Review. The project team also exhibited a
willingness to be flexible, while at the same time maintaining the required rigor of project
implementation.




                                                  17

PDO1 was not fully achieved due to the reasons discussed above (Section 1.7). The ICR did find
that the project team should have moved to formally revise the loan agreement to reflect the
cancellation of about half of the loan proceeds and the elimination of the Health sub-component.
Regarding PDO2, most of the project issues were addressed in ways that allowed for its
successful completion as measured by the revised PDO Indicators. This resulted in raised targets
and final outcomes that went beyond the original project design for that PDO. There is also
significant evidence that many of the policy reforms recommended in the project were accepted
by the MoNE. An example of policy reform may be found in the Government's decision to
channel grants to the communities and to support the apprenticeship program for ECD teachers.
Furthermore, there is reason to assume that most of the programs and reforms developed and
witnessed during the project will be sustained in the future.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: N/A

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: N/A

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Project Identification and Preparation.         As a response to the specific need to provide
emergency food assistance to pre-school youth, the Bank and the Borrower agreed to quickly
prepare and process this project. Both the Borrower and the Bank were able to effectively
mobilize the necessary resources, and to select and field strong teams to identify and prepare the
project. The Borrower's counterpart team participated actively in the preparation of the project
and was particularly effective in the Bank/Borrower's consideration of options and the collection,
organization and analysis of the data required to develop the project design. As preparation
activities were initiated, the counterpart team made many significant contributions to the quality
and scope of the project design. As the Bank team must take some responsibility for the failure to
identify the major risks to the project, as part of the overall project design team, the Borrower's
team must also take some responsibility. This judgment is partially based on the fact that many
of the unidentified risks were apparent from previous projects.

Project Implementation. Project Implementation was effectively stalled during the first year.
Initially the project's Management and Implementation Unit (CPMU) experienced some
difficulty with project implementation when the initial community-based approach did not
function well.    As adjustments were made and local teachers were recruited and trained,
implementation of the project became more effective in the rural communities served by the ECD
facilities. This allowed the CPMU to initiate many of the other activities that were required by
the project. It is noted that, in some project years, the MONE and its provincial and district
agencies were slow to approve and coordinate the adequate provision of counterpart funding and
needed staff at the district level. Once this took place, the local implementation of the project
was strengthened.     The CPMU worked closely with the Bank's task team. As the project
experienced problems with procurement, disbursement, etc., this close collaboration enabled
quick agreement on necessary changes to bring the project back on schedule.              As project
implementation proceeded, the increased experience and knowledge of the CPMU become
increasingly evident.     For this reason, during the later years of the project the CPMU
demonstrated a much stronger management approach that resulted in the high achievements
previously noted for PDO2.



                                                 18

The ICR found that the Borrower's implementation performance was unsatisfactory during the
early years of the project and satisfactory during the later years. The overall rating must be
considered Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

· A strong community pre-conditioning program is required to ensure ownership and
    sustainability of the project's activities. Initially, a community-based approach was taken
    to implement the project; however, from the beginning, the approach did not go well. This
    was due to inadequate pre-conditioning measures that were taken prior to the program
    initiation. However, as time passed, the community resistance disappeared. It was also seen
    that community resistance began to disappear after the teachers took their positions in the
    respective communities. With their coming and interaction with the community, the program
    was gradually understood and became well accepted. This lesson was incorporated to the new
    ECED project, which supports a more intensive program to socialize the communities during
    the preparation and early implementation stages.

· Locally recruited teachers improve potential for sustainability.                 Qualified ECD
    teachers/educators are important factors in the success of ECD programs. Unfortunately, the
    recruitment and continued employment of teachers in poor-rural settings is almost always a
    challenge. Instead of "importing" qualified staff from cities, the project decided to empower
    local youth within these communities by employing and training them as ECD teachers. Each
    of the district villages was required to nominate qualified teacher candidates. The selected
    candidates were then enrolled and trained as kindergarten teachers in a two year D2 program.
    The three teacher training institutes were located at UPI Bandung, UNM Makassar and
    UNESA Surabaya. Graduates were then contracted for two years by the project. At the end of
    this period, the teachers' employments were continued by the district government. Not only
    were the communities empowered, the program has also proven to be sustainable.

· ECD interventions that are targeted for the poorest children show the highest benefits.
    In line with international experience, the impact study of this project found that the
    interventions were more beneficial to the disadvantaged children in the project than they were
    for more advantaged children. Results from the impact evaluation of the ECED programs in
    Indonesia have already brought promising results. The evaluation of the pilot project
    followed the development of nearly 500 children participating in ECED programs. Test
    scores of ECED children were compared with an equal number of children randomly selected
    from the same villages.      The findings suggest that children participating in the Early
    Childhood Development pilot project for 2 years had higher scores for school readiness at age
    6, after taking into account potential confounders and using a propensity score approach to
    counter potential selection bias.      ECED appeared to have greater effect on most
    disadvantaged children, who live in poorer districts or whose parents have lower education

· The integration of education, nutrition and health, and parental education is more
    effectively achieved at the village/program level (than at the district, provincial or
    national levels). Within the scope of the project, several government ministries were
    involved in the welfare of young children, and each was responsible for a specific area of
    development: health and nutrition, social protection, and education. While the integration of
    these services was important, it was often challenging and difficult to accomplish at the
    national or provincial level. The project found that such integration was much more easily
    accomplished at the community level. In most communities, it was not difficult to get the



                                                19

  ECD teachers, women volunteers (Kader BKB) and the village health workers collaborate in
  the provision of services for the young children.

· The use of block grants at the community level requires "preconditioning" within those
  communities to maximize the impact of the grants. The project was designed to support
  the provision of community-based ECD services. Under this scheme, the communities were
  given responsibilities to manage and use block grants, and to eventually manage their own
  program.     In reality, the project only communicated with the LKMD (an official body
  representing the community at village level and no longer in existence). The "grant
  agreement" was made between the PIU and the LKMDs. The LKMDs were responsible for
  the selection of the location for the ECD facilities and the management of the block grant for
  the construction. To support this process, the PIU provided each district with a construction
  management consultant. After the ECD facilities were successfully established and the
  teachers were trained and placed in their positions, it became apparent that schools and
  programs were under-enrolled. After a review was conducted, it was found that the parents
  of young children were not properly prepared (conditioned) to understand or participate in the
  ECD program within their respective communities. In the end, the teachers proved to be the
  key to solving this dilemma. Upon their completion of the D2TK program and their arrival
  back in their communities, they worked very hard, knocking on the doors of parents with
  young children to introduce the service and invite the parents to send their young children to
  the facilities.  This approach proved to be quite successful. Parent understanding and
  commitment increased and the enrollment within the ECD schools and programs increased to
  a full level. This lesson was considered by the new ECED project (effective in Nov 2006)
  which is designed to provide extensive "preconditioning" for communities to ensure better
  participation in the program.

· A unified management approach is likely to lead to a better result in the
 implementation of ECD programs. During the project preparation, the Bank and the
 Bappenas agreed that major emphasis of this project was to empower community.
 Accordingly, although the main activity was to introduce/ expand access of poor children to
 pre-school/kindergarten education, it was agreed that the project to be managed by the
 Directorate of Community Education (under the Directorate General of Non Formal
 Education - DGNFE). However, throughout the nation, the Directorate of Kindergarten and
 Primary Schools (under the Directorate General of Primary and Secondary Education --
 DGPSE) had line authority for such programs.               Eventually issues of management
 responsibility were addressed, but the lesson for the long term is that ECD program
 responsibility and management may best be accomplished through a single, primary
 Government agency, or alternatively through an inter-agency steering committee.

· Projects should allocate sufficient time within all fellowship programs to allow for full
 completion of degree programs. Associated with this issue is the need to understand that
 working government staff may need significantly more time to complete a degree since they
 often continue to work as well as participate in their program of study. There is also a need to
 ensure that their work schedule/study schedule is mutually agreed between the candidate and
 their supervisors at their work place. Taking the lesson from this program, for the fellowship
 program under the new ECED project, the PIU will develop a set of criteria acceptable to the
 Bank; among others, they will require the managers to release their staff to do full-time study
 and the participants to fully commit on the program.




                                              20

· Delays in the provision of counterpart funds directly affect the overall quality of project
    implementation. Project implementation took place during the difficult transition period
    when the Government was converting its entire management structure from a centralized to
    decentralized approach. This heavily affected the budgeting process, not only of this project,
    but others nation-wide. Almost every year the budget was delayed by three to four months.
    The worst situation was seen in 2005, when the budget (DIPA) was released in October,
    leaving the PIUs only 2 months to complete the activities. This was one of the reasons that
    the project was extended to December 2006.

· Poor families need easier access to ECD services. Although the project's goal was to
    locate the newly-built ECD centers in poor communities, the centers were often less
    accessible than was intended. Cost was one barrier, and another was location. The distance
    from there the poorest families lived and the ECD center often made it impossible for parents
    to get their child to the center. These issues have been taken into account in the design of the
    new ECD project.

· There is a need to provide a structured program of orientation to new task team leaders who
    take over projects that are under implementation.         As evidenced in this project, poor
    transition practices often result in miscommunication with the Borrower and the inability of
    the new task team leader to understand the nuances of project implementation as well as tasks
    that remain undone; and

· Experience counts for much in large scale project management. New task team leaders
    should have access to advice and mentoring from experienced task team leaders when they
    take over full responsibility for large scale project management. As evidenced in this project,
    the lack of experience can lead to decision making that negatively affects project outcomes
    and the confidence and credibility of the Bank with its clients.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component A ­ ECD Program Support

Subcomponent A.1 - Policy Framework ­ Review and revise policies based on project
experience for Repelita VIII. Throughout the duration of the project, the Bank team has provided
policy suggestions, working papers and other types of technical assistance to the Government as
policies were reviewed and reforms were sought. Significant policy reform has taken place in
MoNE regarding ECD. The experience and lessons learned from the project were repeatedly
used to support the rationale for these reforms.

Subcomponent A.2 - Improving quality of ECD programs through:
1. Reviewing, simplifying and testing BKB module ­ The Project reviewed, and supported the
Government's adoption of a revised curriculum for the training of BKB/Posyandu cadres.
2. Designing and implementing integrated training for Posyandu and BKB cadres ­ Using
the revised curriculum, the project planned to train 80 percent of the BKB/Posyandu cadres by
project completion. It was planned that 3000, 3800, and 4050 cadres would be trained for West
Java, Bali, and South Sulawesi respectively. Project data reveals that the target of achievement
was not fully achieved. The actual percentage of cadres (planned verses actual) trained was 63%,
79%, and 75% for West Java, Bali, and South Sulawesi respectively. The shortfall was primarly
due to changes of government financial structure and system in 2005 that significantly delayed
the DIPA processes.
3. Developing and implementing In-service training for TK teachers. The Project provided
in-service training program for total 901 teachers of the ECD centers (including the TK) in the 12
participating districts. 187 of them were sent to apprentice program to learn from the best
practices in Jakarta and Surabaya. In addition, since 2002 TKs have been transformed into ECD
centers providing integrated services for young children. These services consist of TK for 4-6
years old children, play group for 2-4 years old and BKB/Posyandu services for 0-6 years old
children and their parents. Accordingly, the Project also provided an orientation for 561 teachers
and 600 local leaders on the integrated concept and management of ECD Centers. For quality
assurance purposes, the Project also trained the supervisors of the TK and Non Formal
Education/Community Education.
4. Reviewing and evaluating TK curriculum ­ A study was conducted (2001) and project
teams were able to provide ongoing support to review and evaluate existing TK curricula with a
view toward making improvements that articulated with the focus of the ECD programs and the
identification of instructional materials that were needed to effectively support the respective
ECD programs. Based on these findings, the project provided books, furniture, and educational
toys to 187 newly build ECD Centers and 110 rehabilitated ECD centers. Books and educational
toys were also provided to 384 BKB/Posyandu.
5. Designing and evaluating child assessment instrument ­ A child assessment instrument
was developed and tested by consultants as a part of the more inclusive Impact Evaluation Study,
(Studi Dampak Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini) (Section 2.3).

Subcomponent A.3 - Increasing demand for ECD programs, through
1. Developing IEC program (Information, Education and Communication) ­ Early in the
project, the project team was able to develop a viable IEC program. This program was then
authorized for piloting within the project institutions by MoNE.
2. Producing and disseminating IEC - Based on the above program design, IEC materials were
designed by an IEC consultant. A total number of 129,000 copies of the IEC materials have been
produced and distributed to the intended recipients. These included: (a) 11,700 booklets; (b)
3,900 posters; (c) 78,000 leaflets; and (d) 390 manuscripts.



                                                  23

3. Monitoring and evaluating IEC ­ The implemented IEC program was monitored and
evaluated by the projects M&E system. Findings suggest that the implemented program was
effective and an important factor in the establishment and sustainability of ECD programs in the
project institutions. The MoNE has reviewed the findings and moved to establish similar IEC
programs in other non-project provinces and districts.

Subcomponent A.4 - Expand access, through:
1. Construction of ECD centers (including Posyandu and BKB) - The project built a total of
430 new facilities with 297 of these facilities being Integrated ECD Centers. Project monitoring
data suggests that the current utilization rate for the new ECD facilities is about 100%. Since their
establishment, about 8,672 children received services in the 297 Integrated ECD centers. Total
attendance in the project's BKB/Posyandu programs was about 19,665 children.
2. Rehabilitation of ECD centers and TK - The project has renovated 251 existing ECD and
TK facilities. Project monitoring revealed that the utilization rate for the renovated facilities is
about 100%.
3. Education materials ­ A total of 681 (100% of expected project target) project supported
ECD facilities were provided with a full complement of furniture and educational toys required to
support their respective programs. A total of 571 (100% of expected planned target) project
supported ECD facilities were provided with appropriate sets of books.
4. Contract teachers ­ The project successfully contracted 374 TK teachers at the 187 ECD
centers. In addition, along with the establishment of the play group program in 2003 and 2004,
the project also hired 187 play group teachers. Starting FY 2006, their hiring and professional
support were handed over to the respective local governments.
5. Teacher upgrading (D2) for TK teachers - The employment of sufficient numbers of
qualified staff for assignment in poor-rural areas was a big challenge for the project. The project
chose a cost-effective approach that empowered local youth by employing and training them as
TK teachers. Each of the district villages nominated qualified teachers candidates who were then
sent to one of three teacher training institutes (UPI Bandung, UNM Makassar and UNESA
Surabaya) to study for a two-year kindergarten teacher diploma (D2). Upon completion of their
study, they were contracted for two years by the project and then had their employment continued
by the district government. Not only were the communities empowered, the program also proved
to be sustainable

The project has successfully: (i) trained 326 Diploma 2 kindergarten teachers (100 percent of
project target). Local governments have also provided 48 additional scholarships for D2
kindergarten teachers, thus the total number of D2 kindergarten teachers trained through the
project is 374. This number enables the project to allocate two kindergarten teachers for each
kindergarten-supported project (integrated ECD center.

Subcomponent A.5 - Emergency Food Assistance ­ The subcomponent was cancelled (for a
more in-depth discussion regarding the cancellation see Section 1.7). With this cancellation, the
project no longer had any direct nutrition intervention. Instead, the project took up a facilitating
role, including (i) awareness raising among various stakeholders (including parents and
community members) on the importance of nutrition for child development and (ii) the launching
of ECD as a National Program by the President (2003) that facilitates inter-sectoral supports for
the development of ECD program.              These actions also complemented the pre-existing
government regular nutrition programs as well as community-based program on child nutrition,
including food complementary programs, Vitamin A supplement, Iodine Fortification; Nutrition
Counseling, Education and Referral Program (at Posyandu, Puskesmas and local hospital); and
self-financed supplementary food program managed by Posyandu cadres. It is also understood,



                                                  24

but not confirmed, that, in the absence of the subcomponent, other government agencies may be
playing a role in the mitigation of the child malnutrition effects in the nation.

As the consequence of the cancellation of the subcomponent, the project no longer has a system
and resources to monitor the impact of the non-project nutrition initiatives. Therefore, no data is
available on the impact of these programs on the weight-gain of the children. The corresponding
Development Objective in the Loan Agreement was not formally revised to reflect this change.

Component B - ECD Management and Capacity Building

Subcomponent B.2 - Capacity Building:
1. Fellowship and training to key project staff and TA - Although awarding of fellowships to
pursue the diploma program diploma (D2) for kindergarten teacher and D3 (3 fellows) in
nutrition was successful (see Subcomponent A.4.5), the achievement of the program for post
graduate degrees was below target. This is particularly the case for the fellowship program
provided to Jakarta-based staff. In that group, only 3 out of the 10 master degree program fellows
were able to complete their study, and none of the 5 Jakarta-based PhD fellows completed their
study. They were able to complete the course work, but were unable to complete the dissertation.
In contrast, the situation was better for the province-based staff: 12 out of the 13 master's degree
fellows in South Sulawesi and 9 out of 11 fellows in West Java have been graduated. The
following table provides a summary of all fellowship training with an overall completion rate of
about 95%

2. Annual planning and budget workshop ­ During each of the project years, annual planning
and budget workshops were conducted. This process enabled the project team to accurately
predict the real needs of the ECD programs which faced changing requirements as new students
were enrolled and the economic situation improved.
3. Impact evaluation of TK education and Posyandu and BKB intervention - Impact
evaluation of the project intervention on child growth and cognitive development was contracted
out to a consultant company. The baseline study for the program impact was carried out in 2002
while the follow up study conducted in 2004. The Bank team found that the original approach
used flawed methodology and that the results were questionable. As a result the team reanalyzed
the data collected from the two studies using more rigorous assumptions and analytic tools, and
has issued a new set of findings. For a more detailed discussion of the impact evaluation see
Section 2.3.
4. Studies ­ The following studies were completed by the project:
(a) Baseline survey (2002) and follow up study (2004) for impact evaluation (Section 2.3); and
(b) Study of curriculum development for kindergarten has been completed (2001).
5. Office equipment for all project institutions­ As needs were identified by the PMU, all
project supported ECD and TK facilities were provided with necessary office equipment.

Subcomponent B3 - Strengthen Project Management
1. Reporting - A functional monitoring and evaluation system (M&E) and reporting system
were designed and developed for the project at district, province and central levels. At the central,
level, M&E consultant(s) were hired to establish related systems for field-based data collection,
organization and analysis to support M&E. Information on the progress of project implementation
was gathered twice annually. At the province and district levels, M&E functions were performed
by government staff. Data collection was first initiated at district level, and then the information
submitted to the project monitoring staff at the province level for review and further submission
to the central project M&E consultant for final analysis and reporting. The recruitment of local
education staffs to conduct the monitoring tasks was intended to ensure the sustainability of
future program monitoring once the project reached completion. Associated with this effort, the
project also developed an MIS/GIS for ECD program monitoring purposes, but the MIS/GIS has
not become fully functional because it still needs to be further refined. MONE plans to further
develop the MIS/GIS as part of its Education MIS located at Directorate of PAUD (under the
Directorate of Non-Formal Education) to support ECD activities through out the country.
2. Technical audit ­ Technical audits were conducted as a part of the M&E process by
consultants employed to review the progress of each project supported ECD program and TK.
Additional audit activities were conducted by CPMU staff and by Bank Supervision teams as they
visited project sites. Reports of these findings, with recommendations for improvement, were
regularly included in project documentation as required.
3. Office equipment for project offices. All project offices were provided with the necessary
office equipment including desks, chairs, computers and printers.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

As discussed in Section 3.3, a cost benefit analysis was conducted during the preparation of this
project. The findings for this analysis may be found in Annex 4 of the PAD, A second cost
benefit study was conducted as part of the preparation for the upcoming (second) ECD project.
This study was based primarily on 2003 data. While this does not address the specific returns to
the project that is the subject of this ICR, it does provide assurances that investments in ECD in
Indonesia yield a high return. A summary of this economic analysis is therefore presented below.

I. Benefit-cost Analysis
The cost-benefit analysis uses the concept developed by Van der Gaag and Tan (1999), looking at
the ratio of added net present value of an ECD project vis-à-vis its total costs.

Benefit:
The ECD programs can have benefit in the short-term, medium-term, and longer-term. The short-
term and direct benefits include improved health and nutrition, prevention of abuse and neglect,
and benefits to other family members including parents and siblings. The medium-term benefits
include lower grade repetition and drop-out and higher education attainment. The longer term
benefits include higher wages as well as reduction in crime.

The most measurable benefit is the education benefit in the medium term and improved labor
earnings in the longer term. Schooling shows significant returns on the Indonesian labor market.
Table 1 is a summary of the estimates of returns by education level, based on 2003 SUSENAS
data. Primary education has the highest returns of nearly 30 percent.

Cost:
The total cost of schooling not only include the direct costs paid by parents and the government
(Table 2), but also should include the opportunity cost of schooling in the form of forgone labor
income (Table 3).

Combining the total benefit and cost of education, the age-earnings profile in Indonesia is
illustrated in the figure below. Although higher level of educational attainment will require
longer and higher investment in the short term, the long-term total returns on the labor market
will largely surpass the initial investment.

Benefit-cost ratio:
Table 4 summarizes the targeting indicators. We divide the most disadvantaged children into
three groups according to the indicators. Group 1 has the lowest performance measured by these
indicators. We further use national average of these indicators as target to estimate total project
benefit.

The sensitivity of the benefit-cost ratio to the change of discount rate is also tested (Table 6).
Although the benefit-cost ratio is sensitive to the assumption of discount rate, 9 percent discount
rate can still ensure a benefit-cost ratio of above one in value.

II. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.
The cost-benefit analysis considers whether all of the benefits of the program were greater than
its costs. Cost-effectiveness analysis considers whether the benefits of a particular program are
greater than those alternative programs aimed at improving child outcomes. One strong argument
is that equalizing initial endowments in wealth, ability, or opportunities is much cost-effective
than remedial measures to compensate the differences in the final outcomes.

The ECD program is cost-effective compared with alternative public investment aimed at helping
the most disadvantaged child achieve primary education completion. Assume that a child going
through a high quality ECD program would better develop cognitive and social skills, and
readiness for formal primary education. S/he does not need additional public programs during the
primary education cycle. Alternatively, without going through an ECD program, this child would

need special attention and assistance to complete the primary education cycle, which would
require additional public resources. The unit cost of primary education is estimated at about
US$230 per year in Indonesia (Analisis Biaya Pendidikan Dasar Dan Menengah, Oleh: Abbas
Ghezali,dkk, MoNE, 2004). The unit cost ratio of special education to regular education is 1.90 in
the US on average (US Department of Education: SEEP Report 2: How Does Spending on
Special Education Students Vary Across Districts? An Analysis of Spending by Urbanicity,
District Size, Median Family Income, and Student Poverty Levels in 1999-2000). The current
special education in Indonesia has even higher unit cost. Pupil-teacher ratio at special education
is 5:1, and most teachers have 2 years higher qualification thus higher salaries. Table 7 shows
that given the high cost of providing special primary education, investment of public resources in
ECD programs seems to be a more cost-effective way of helping disadvantaged children
complete primary education.

4. ICR Preparation
   To measure the PAUD project performance, there will be a calculation of percentages
   between the actuals and plan in DIP/PO (standing for Project Proposal/Operational
   Instruction) of the Fiscal Year 1999/2000 to FY2004) or DIPA/RKAKL (standing for Budget
   Implementation Proposal/Work Schedule of Ministry and Institution Budget (from FY2005
   to FY2006) for Output and a calculation of percentages between the actuals and plan in the
   Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for Outcome.
  4.1.     Measurement of PAUD Project Performance
     1). Output and Outcome
          i.     Highly satisfactory, if assumed that the actuals are 80-100%
         ii.     Satisfactory, if assumed that the actuals are 60-80%
        iii.     Unsatisfactory, if assumed that the actuals are 30-60%
        iv.      Highly unsatisfactory, if assumed that the actuals are less than 30%
     2). Support to Program Sustainability
         i.      Highly likely, if indicated that the support is 80-100%
        ii.      Likely, if indicated that the support is 60%-80%
       iii.      Unlikely, if indicated that the support is 30%-60%
       iv.       Highly unlikely, if indicated that the support to program sustainability is less
                 than 30%
     3). Measurement of Development Project Objectives
           As set out in the PAD (Project Appraisal Document)
     4). Qualitative Measurement
           If quantitative measurements (in %) of output, outcome and support to program
           sustainability after PAUD project closing date cannot be taken, assessments will be
           carried out in qualitative measurements.

5. Evaluation of Development Objectives and Design
  5.1.      Development Project Objectives (Original)
           This Early Childhood Development Project has two objectives: First, to formulate
           and implement a Policy Framework of Early Childhood Development in an
           integrated way, Second, to improve access to, quality and utilization of the Early
           Childhood Development Project, particularly for the poor in underdeveloped villages
           in the Provinces of Bali, South Sulawesi, and West Java and protect children at age 6




                                                38

     month and 2 years from poor nutrition effects and improve their growth and
     development.
5.2. Revised Development Project Objectives
     The original objectives remain unchanged, but without provision of emergency
     supplementary food for children at age 6 months to 2 years following an economic
     crisis in Asia, including Indonesia, since 1997 due to misprocurement, the objectives
     of this development project are modified.

8. Main Factors Affecting PAUD Project Implementation and Outcome
  8.1.  Factors beyond Control by the Government or Implementation Unit
        (CPMU/PPMIU/DPMIU)
        The following factors generally inhibit the PAUD project implementation and thus
        affect the outcome..
        1). Asian Economic Crisis
            At the outset of the project implementation in 1999, Indonesia faced the Asia's
            economic crisis since 1997 but Indonesia's economic condition since that time
            and until now has not been recovered. This, of course, significantly affects the
            effectiveness of the PAUD project implementation. The exchange rate of Rupiah
            against US Dollar surged from Rp. 6,000,- per US Dollar to Rp16,000,- per US
            Dollar (in 2001) leading to skyrocketing prices including prices of civil works,
            and thus the civil works were in abeyance until 2000/2001. This eventually
            affected the D2-Kindergarten Fellowship Program for TK/RA teachers and
            procurement of educative toys, study materials and furniture for PAUD Centers.
        2). Secondary RK and RM Budget in DIP/DIPA beyond Control by
                Implementation Unit
            From the beginning of implementation with the 1999/2000 budget to the
            completion of the PAUD Project 31 December 2006 (closing date) various
            activities have been carried out to achieve the development objectives. However,
            the implementation was often postponed due to late disbursements because the
            House of People's Representatives (DPR) did not approve the budget yet thus
            leading to late budget discussions in the Ministry of Finance.
        3). Change in the amount of loan from the World Bank beyond control by the
                 Government
            A blended food program in category 3 was cancelled for misprocurement,
            through the World Bank's Letter to the Minister of Health No. No. M-
            318/ECD/VII/2000 dated 21 July 2000.

            Change in the amount of fund in Loan Agreement
            No.     Original loan             Reduction in loan (US$)     Amended loan I

                    agreement (US$)                                       (US$)

  8.2.  Factors on the Government's Side
        The factors on the Government's side particularly concern Government
        economic/monetary policies that involve:
        1). Changes in the exchange of Rupiah against foreign currencies
        The exchange rate of Rupiah tends to weaken against US$ affecting PAUD project
        financing.
        Changes in Exchange Rate of Rupiah against US Dollar


            Year                              Exchange Rate for 1 US$

            1999       Rp. 6,638 (15 July)                  Rp. 8,911 (8 September)
            2000       Rp. 7,171 (11 January)               Rp. 9,549 (22 December)
            2001       Rp. 8,382(7 August)                  Rp.16,686 (23 November)

           Source: Processed from SPM RK, SP2D RK and RKBI

           2). Government Budget Policy
               The basis for fiscal year has been changed since 2000 on the calendar year (1
               January to 31 December), formerly on the fiscal year of 1 April to 31 March of
               the following year. So, FY2000 starts from 1 April 2000 to 31 December 2000
               while FY1999/2000 starts from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000.

9. Performance of the Bank and Borrower
   The Bank Performance and the Borrower Performance as a whole can be considered
    satisfactory.

10. PAUD Program Sustainability
    An analysis of PAUD program sustainability is intended to find out how far support can be
    given to the PAUD program sustainability after termination of financing by the World Bank
    through loan IBRD 4378-IND since the closing date of 31 December 2006.
    10.1.     Government Commitment
           The commitment of the Government, in this case Central Government and Regional
           Governments in support of the PAUD Program Sustainability emphasizes studies:
           Funding Aspect and Institutional Aspect.
           As a whole, the Government Commitment is considered having likely performance..
    10.2. Institutional Empowerment
           Kabupaten/City Governments will empower institutions for continuity and
           sustainability of the PAUD program in their regions, involving among others:
           1). Institutional Organizations
           2). Human Resources
           3). Agency main duties (Tupoksi)
           The institutional empowerment is considered having likely performance.
    10.3. PAUD Centers
           The sustainability of PAUD Centers is the main focus because the existence of
           PAUD Centers in terms of physical presence as well as programs is a valuable asset
           jointly owned by Central Government, Kabupaten/City Government and local
           communities.

           The sustainability of PAUD Centers is considered having likely performance.

    10.4. Public participation
           The participation of children's parents is essential particularly in taking their children
           at early age of 2-6 years to PAUD Centers for access to early child development
           services.

           The sustainability of public participation is considered having likely performance.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

West Java Province
   1) The ECD program has a potentially bright future in both its formal and informal forms
       because it provides a strategic means to procure human resources. To ensure this, the
       Education department of the West Java local government will make a conscientious effort
       to design programs that will accelerate services conforming to the National or local
       government objectives. (Team Leader of Family Welfare Movement and Head of
       Education Department , West Java)
   2) The implementation of Program PAUD has not received adequate professional attention
       especially in comparison with the attention paid to other education programs. However,
       more attention is being paid now than was paid in the early years when the ECD program
       was first rolled out. (Project Leader/ P2K West Java)
   3) At least the current ECD program stimulates ECD Centers to empower local human
       resources by providing Non degree Kindergarten Teacher Training scholarships to
       guarantee qualified educators who will provide adequate education to young children.
       (Head of ECD section, Education Office, Indramayu District)
   4) The reach of ECD centers to children aged 0-6 years must be expanded. Increasing the
       number of ECD centers and having one in every village would ensure that no young child
       is left behind. (Project Office, Lebak District)

South Sulawesi Province
   5) Discussions during the Bali meeting confirmed that ECD centers are effective in
       supporting the government and the public. Moreover, ECD centers help expand the
       public's access to services and support ECD management at the district level.
       (Commission E, DPRD Kab. Gowa)
   6) We expect total integration between the players that will facilitate the effective
       fulfillment of their main function. A budget must be drawn up for the Health department
       which is suitable for the ECD centers. Teamwork is essential as are training and
       internships at ECD centers or the ECD program. (Health Department and National
       Familiy Planning Board, Gowa District)
   7) The ECD center is very supportive of child development and according to ECD the
       golden period for child development is 0 ­ 6 years. Therefore, the ECD center should
       develop good ECD program and budget to ensure optimum utilization of this time
       period.(Head of the Education department, Gowa District)
   8) Kindergartens managed at ECD centers are able to compete with other kindergartens at
       the local level. Educators at the ECD centers have an upper hand compared with their
       non-ECD center counterparts due to their experiences and internships in Jakarta. (Project
       Manager, Gowa District)
   9) In fact, ECD centers at the local level have a positive impact and have given maximum
       results to stakeholders in the form of building our facilities and also adding to the skills of
       the educators. However, it is expected that the local and central government will provide
       continuous and follow-up training. (Pimbagpro/ Manager, Gowa District)
   10) There are some clear impacts that I see coming out from the project: expansion of service
       available to parents, young children and community ­ as well as improved knowledge
       and awareness among parents about education and parenting. (Drs. Baharuddin, National
       Family Planning Board, Gowa District)
   11) A harmonious approach between the lending agencies, expansion of access and quality.
      (Megawati Baso, Bachelor of Public Health, District Health Office, Gowa District)

12) Through the ECD project I gained a lot of knowledge concerning child development ­ a
    key skill for a Child Development Worker at the Village. (Drs A. Thahir Taba, Trainer of
    Child Development Worker, Bone District)
13) I am really motivated to continue with my study in Nutrition Science because nutrition
    and education are two integral parts in Child Development. (Paulina Pumpung ­ District
    Health Office, Bone District)
14) The ECD project has made a significant impact in the Bone District and if possible (the
    project) should be continued. The project has i) constructed 14 kindergarten with good
    facility and located at the village level, ii) established 28 BKB/ Posyandu centres ­ all
    located at the village, iii) rehabilitated 15 existing kindergarten, most of them in the rural
    areas, iv) provided employment to 42 teachers and 14 janitors; v) provided ECD service
    to more children aged 0 ­ 6 and vi) motivated communities to establish kindergarten.
    (Drs. Karim Pananrangi ­ Head of Teacher Union, Bone District)
15) The ECD center is still understood as only Kindergarten instead of an integrated program.
    The ECD program is one that should be supported and developed in every village. It is
    the most complete service available to young children. Also, imperative to the
    implementation of the program is the fact that the public considers the ECD program a
    free service (community member, Gowa District)
