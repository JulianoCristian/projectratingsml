SMALL-SCALE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In April 1976, the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) asked the Bank for
assistance in designing strategies to reduce the high rate of urban unemploy-
ment. A special Bank mission visited Jamaica in November 1976 and recommended
the development of a small-scale enterprise (SSE) project to increase pro-
duction in manufacturing and reduce urban unemployment. Two missions in May
and August 1977 discussed the project concept and design and agreed with GOJ
on developing a SSE project covering the entire sector. The proposed project
was appraised in December 1977 for a possible Bank loan of US$7 million.
1.02      While the Bank has been involved in the sector through the
US$1.9 million industrial component of the Second Urban Project (Loan 1003-JM),
the project would be the Bank's first integrated SSE development project in
Jamaica. It is aimed at: (i) financing of modern small-scale enterprises
through the commercial banking system. Bank of Jamaica (BOJ), the central
bank, will be the apex institution under this component; (ii) financing of
very small-scale enterprises through the Small Enterprise Development
Corporation (SEDCO), a new specialized small industry bank which would be
built up under the proposed project; and (iii) providing technical assistance
to SSEs to supplement both financing programs.
II. THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
Role in the Economy
2.01      Manufacturing plays an important role in the Jamaican economy in
terms of value added, employment and export earnings. In 1976, the sector's
value added was J$539 million, or about 20% of GDP. Manufacturing has been
the leading sector in value-added terms since 1974, when it passed the distri-
butive trade sector. In 1976, manufacturing sector employment was 75,000, or
11% of the employed labor force, and exports of manufactured goods (excluding
sugar) reached J$69 million, or 11% of merchandise exports.
Past Performance
2.02      Between 1969 and 1973 the sector experienced an average annual
real growth of over 5%, due to rising local demand, favorable industrial
incentives, and heavy protection of the domestic industry. The initial
impetus for industrial production arose from the demands of the sugar and
bauxite/alumina sectors. However, between 1973 and 1977 there has been an



average annual decline of about 4% in real terms, with the result that value
added of the sector in 1977 was roughly at the level of 1970. Several factors
were responsible for the poor performance after 1973. Owing to the
deteriorating balance of payments situation, import restrictions were imposed
during 1976 and intensified in 1977 which reduced the availability of raw
materials and intermediate goods. At the same time, in response to severe
fiscal constraints, the government introduced a taxation program in early
1976, which led to higher prices for a wide range of consumer and capital
goods as well as raw materials. Frequent industrial disputes, the over-valued
exchange rate, the low level of activity in the construction sector and the
growing concern in parts of the private sector about the expanded activity of
the public sector were other important factors.
Main Characteristics and Development Constraints of the Sector
2.03      For a developing country of about two million people, Jamaica has a
relatively broad-based and sophisticated manufacturing sector, which produces
a wide variety of products. The key subsectors in terms of value added are
food, beverages, tobacco, chemical and metal products, and repairs (Table 2-1).

2.04      Jamaica has thus far followed a typical pattern of industrial
development by concentrating on import-substitution industries, mainly
consumer goods. In the past, BOJ has granted tax and other fiscal concessions
to industries under the Industrial Incentives Law (IIL) and the Export
Industry Encouragement Law (EIEL). Both laws were passed in 1956 and amended
in 1974 through the Industrial Incentives (Regional Harmonization) Act.
Concessions under these laws include: (i) up to a ten-year tax holiday;
(ii) duty-free imports of machinery and raw materials; and (iii) deprecia-
tion carryover after the tax holidays. This generous incentive system
has been supplemented by a system of protection from foreign competition
for approximately 70% of enterprises producing for the domestic market.
This protection has been provided in the form of import licenses, the system
being administered by the Trade Administrator's office.  The size of the
import quota is determined by the gap between domestic demand and domestic
supply. If an approved firm's installed capacity is adequate to meet local
demand, it is completely protected from foreign competition. Before protection
is granted, each manufacturer is expected to satisfy the government that its
ex-factory price will not exceed the c.i.f. cost of equivalent imports plus
the customs duty that would be levied, although there are a few exceptions.
However, there is no systematic check of prices once protection is granted.
2.05      GOJ's past strategy of promoting import-substitution industries has
resulted in a manufacturing sector that is capital intensive and import
dependent. This is understandable, given the small size of the Jamaican
market which does not provide economies of scale. Until the devaluation of
April, 1977 (and subsequent exchange rate adjustments in October 1977, and
January and May 1978), the overvalued exchange rate exacerbated this situation.
The main development constraints of the Jamaican manufacturing sector are
discussed below.
2.06      Capital intensity.  One of the main characteristics of Jamaica's
manufacturing sector is that the capital/labor ratios are relatively high.
The duty-free imports of capital goods and the whole system of protection
have enabled purchasers of capital goods to pay a low price. Threats of
strikes and demands for higher wages have also influenced the substitution
of capital for labor in many industries. From limited data, it appears
that the factor combinations that typify export-oriented industries (mainly in
the production of leather goods, garments, toys and cigars) more closely
approximate Jamaica's comparative advantage than do those manufacturing for
the local market (i.e. refrigeration equipment, plastics, fiberglass boats,
pharmaceuticals, chemicals, steel pipes, electrical goods, motor vehicle
tires and tubes, chemical fertilizers, etc.).
2.07      Import dependence.  Jamaican industry is relatively import dependent.
The government estimates that the ratio of imported raw materials at local
prices to the gross value of output in the manufacturing industries is about
40%. As a result, Jamaica's manufacturing sector has been particularly hard
hit by the current restrictions on imports.



- 4 -
2.08      Under-utilization of existing capacity.  Jamaica's manufacturing
sector is characterized by very low levels of capacity utilization, mainly
due to the industrial policies that encouraged import-substitution industries.
Over the last few years, capacity utilization has decreased due to (i) the
decrease in demand for some products as a result of the general economic
downturn; (ii) shortage of imported raw materials and capital goods; (iii)
the continued emigration of qualified white and blue collar workers,
especially at the supervisory level, and (iv) problems of security and lack of
adequate transportation. Capacity utilization in the sector, based on 1.5
shifts per day, is presently only about 33%, which contributes to the current
high level of unemployment of 24%.
2.09      Exports.  During 1972-76, manufacturing exports increased by 59%,
from J$41 million in 1972 to J$65.3 million in 1976. However, in real terms
there has been a 24% decline during that period. Annex 1 provides detailed
figures of Jamaica's manufacturing exports. As Jamaica's exchange rate
remained unchanged in this period, there was a real positive increase in
foreign exchange earnings, but considerably less than 59%. Jamaica has been
successful in exporting to CARICOM markets, mainly due to the absence of
competition from other countries outside CARICOM. In 1976 exports to CARICOM
countries accounted for 44.5% of total manufacturing exports compared to 33.4%
in 1972. During 1972-76, exports to CARICOM countries increased at an annual
rate of 23% compared with only 6% for non-CARICOM countries.
2.10      Manufacturing exports from Jamaica fall into two produce groups.
One is based predominantly on local resources (raw material and/or labor), and
the other, on imports of intermediate goods. The industries based on local
resources (agroindustry, alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, garments
and jewelry) have provided most of the non-CARICOM exports. Of these, rum
and liquor and cigars have been successful in increasing their exports due
to their comparative advantages both in price and quality. However, garment
exports have, in fact, declined because the producers prefer to sell their
products locally, where they enjoy higher prices and at the same time import
all inputs duty free, than in export markets.
2.11      The import-dependent manufacturing industries were set up primarily
to serve the Jamaican market. Until 1976 they exported only 10% of their
output, mainly to CARICOM countries. However, there are indications that in
1977 manufacturers increased their exports to CARICOM at substantially lower
prices than in previous years to secure import licenses for raw materials and
other inputs to produce for the local market. This development suggests
cross-subsidization of domestic sales for exports. The range of export price
discounts to domestic ex-factory prices has been from 5% to 60% for 35 out of
the 55 exporting firms surveyed in a recent study by the Jamaica Manufacturers'
Association. Presently, exporters' ability to further increase exports at
marginal costs is constrained by the availability of imported raw materials.
The proposed project will allow financing of imported raw materials to enable
manufacturers who qualify under the project to increase their output for local
consumption and exports by using the excess capacity (para. 6.15).



- 5 -
2.12      The prospects for manufactured exports based on local resources
are good. However, the future of import-dependent industries will depend
much on their ability to become more competitive in the non-CARICOM markets.
The recent devaluations totalling about 68% have increased the competitive-
ness of manufacturing enterprises but would need to be supplemented by
aggressive marketing, quality control and reorientation of their operations.
The Jamaica Exporters' Association, a private organization, has taken an
active role to promote Jamaican exports. Also, GOJ recently set up the
Jamaica Export Trading Company (JETCO) to assist SSEs in locating export
markets (para. 4.10). Given that GOJ and the Trade Administrator have placed
top priority on allocating foreign exchange to exporters, Jamaican manu-
facturers have no other alternative than to attempt to increase their exports.
Prospects
2.13      GOJ's long-term development strategy in the manufacturing sector
has the following major objectives: (i) reducing import dependence;
(ii) generating additional export earnings; and (iii) promoting SSEs and
crafts. The government's current economic program contains two measures
that should do much to assist the manufacturing sector: a realistic exchange
rate policy and a restrictive wages policy. The recent devaluations have
increased the international competitiveness of Jamaica's manufactured products.
The government's new restrictive wages policy should help control the cost of
Jamaican products. In the past, Jamaica had a high wage structure, brought
about by the high wages in the growing and profitable mining sector during the
1960s and early 1970s, which set the wage standard in other industries.
2.14      GOJ intends to overhaul, in the future, its industrial incentives
system so that there will be greater reliance on domestic sources of supply
and on the substitution of labor for imported capital, where feasible. In
this connection, it plans to place particular emphasis on the modification of
the relative prices of capital and labor and on the promotion of industries
such as agroindustries, which would process mostly local raw materials. 1/
The measures now being considered include imposing import duties on capital
goods, reducing depreciation allowances, and granting tax credits and other
incentives to firms hiring additional workers. Also, JETCO was set up in 1977
to promote exports. Such measures, coupled with the recent modification in
wage and exchange rate policies, should exert a positive influence on the
future development of Jamaica's manufacturing sector. Under the proposed
project, funds would be made available to increase the capacity utilization
of efficient SSEs. In this connection, a system of tests would be applied to
ensure that only economically justifiable investment proposals in priority
subsectors are financed (paras. 6.20-6.21), taking into consideration Jamaica's
relative factor endowments.
1/   Food processing, furniture, garments, footwear, metal casting, leather
goods, wooden toys, metal products, and wood products.



- 6 -
2.15      The success of GOJ's manufacturing sector programs and policies
will depend largely on establishing a favorable climate for private investors.
While GOJ has repeatedly stated its commitment to a "mixed economy," many
private investors are still assessing GOJ's intentions and its ability to
pull the economy out of the current recession. At present, mainly smaller
and exporting enterprises are expanding their activities while large enter-
prises and affiliates of multinational corporations are generally delaying
their investment decisions. One recent important development which has
adversely affected the investment climate in general is the establishment in
November 1977 of the State Trading Company (STC). Initially, STC will
concentrate on food, raw materials for building and pharmaceutical products;
it is also expected to undertake all purchases under bilateral agreements.
While the establishment of STC is likely to benefit many of the SSEs which are
currently paying higher prices than larger enterprises to importers of raw
materials, there remains a need to convince large private investors of GOJ's
commitment to a mixed economy since they account for the bulk of output and
employment in the sector.
2.16      Although Jamaica is facing severe short-term macro-economic problems,
it has both natural resources (bauxite, sugar and bananas), and a skilled
labor force to achieve positive rates of real growth in the medium and long
term. Jamaica's medium and long term economic prospects are discussed in the
Economic Memorandum on Jamaica (2076-JM) dated May 26, 1978. The memorandum
indicates that the proposed project, which is expected to be on stream in
early 1979, would be implemented in an improved economic climate.
The Small-Scale Enterprise (SSE) Sector
2.17      Definition.  Several definitions of "small-scale enterprise" are
currently used in Jamaica. These include: (i) an enterprise employing less
than 10 persons, or, in the case of construction, employing less than 5 persons
(Department of Statistics); (ii) an owner-manager company with not more than
J$25,000 in fixed assets, not counting land and buildings, and not more than
J$200,000 in annual sales (Small Industries Development Division--SIDD);
(iii) an economic organization in which the owner/operator makes most of the
key operating and strategic decisions without the benefit of specialized
staff (Small Business Development Centre--SBDC); and (iv) an enterprise
where the major shareholder/owner is involved in the core of the business,
possibly as owner-manager or operator and accountant, or the value of total
assets does not exceed J$20,000 and the annual turnover J$100,000, or the
loans outstanding are not in excess of J$50,000 (National Planning Agency).
2.18      Without trying to reconcile this variety of definitions, eligibility
for receiving loans or other assistance from government institutions is deter-
mined primarily by loan size requirements. However, the size of a loan is not
necessarily indicative of the size of the recipient enterprise. The maximum
size of loans to SSEs by government institutions varies between J$25,000 and
J$50,000. The government-owned bank, Jamaica Development Bank (JDB), restricts
small business loans to firms with net fixed assets below J$150,000 equiva-
lent, while another government-sponsored program for SSEs--Small Businessmen's
Financing Scheme (BOJ)--restricts eligibility to firms with maximum annual
gross sales of J$300,000.



- 7 -
2.19      One of the main problems facing GOJ in developing the sector is the
lack of up-to-date reliable data. There is a need to systematically collect
and compile data on SSEs, including value added, output, imported and local
material inputs, and fixed assets on an ongoing basis. This information would
also be helpful for evaluating the proposed project and preparing future
projects. The GOJ is well aware of the need for reliable sector information
and has agreed to use its best efforts to cause its concerned agencies [the
Department of Statistics, and the Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation
(JIDC)] to carry out a manufacturing sector survey by June 30, 1980. For
purposes of analysis and to allow for the different financial and technical
assistance needs, the Bank, in consultation with GOJ, identified two SSE
target groups, both of which would have access to the proposed loan:
Target Group (A):  Modern small-scale enterprises with net fixed
assets (excluding land and buildings) up to
US$100,000 equivalent prior to applying for
a subloan; and
Target Group (B):  Very small-scale enterprises with net fixed
assets (excluding land and buildings) up to
US$20,000 equivalent prior to applying for
a subloan.
Firms in Target Group (A) generally employ between 10-50 workers, while most
firms in Target Group (B) employ less than 10 workers. These definitions
of SSEs would be reviewed from time to time, based on the implementation of
the project and the outcome of the proposed sector survey mentioned above.
Size, Sectoral and Geographical Distribution
2.20      Based on limited data from the National Insurance scheme, it is
estimated that SSEs defined as Target Groups (A) and (B) together employ
approximately 32,000 workers, or about 43% of the 75,000-member labor force
employed in manufacturing in 1976. The value added by these enterprises is
estimated at J$215 million, or 40% of manufacturing value added.
2.21      Target Group (A).  In 1976, there were 537 manufacturing estab-
lishments in Target Group (A), employing about 12,000 persons. Table 2-2
presents the sectoral distribution of this group. Their combined value added
was about J$81 million (15% of manufacturing value added). In 1976, 71% of
the firms in Target Group (A), accounting for 72% of the employment in this
target group, were located in St. Andrew's Parish (which includes Kingston).
2.22      Target Group (B).  In 1976, there were about 2,000 firms (i.e. firms
employing at least one worker besides the owner) and about 10,000 self-employed
businessmen in this target group. Together they accounted for about 25% of
manufacturing value added. Wearing apparel and footwear account for about 35%
of employment in this group, followed, in order of importance, by metal
products, food and woodworks. St. Andrew's Parish accounted for 65% of the
recorded employment in this target group in 1976.

2.23      This concentration of industry around Kingston is understandable
due to Jamaica's demographic distribution. The government is interested in
industrial decentralization to slow the urban drift, but industrial services
and markets are generally better in the Kingston area. However, zoning
restrictions and the building of industrial estates have already moved many
firms out of Kingston to the surrounding areas.
2.24      Construction.  Although the above discussion concerning the size
and distribution of small firms relates only to the manufacturing sector,
the construction sector also has great potential for increasing employment and
output. Total employment in construction in 1976 was about 36,000, with 70%
of construction workers being employed by the small-scale construction firms
(employing less than 5 workers). The government expects these firms to
play an important role in the housing projects for low income earners. The
proposed project will permit financing of small-scale contractors (para. 6.20).
Main Development Constraints on Small-Scale Enterprises
2.25      In addition to the problems affecting Jamaican industry in general,
such as (i) the restrictions on the import of raw materials, (ii) the continued
emigration of qualified blue and white collar workers, and (iii) uncertainty
about the future role of the private sector (para. 2.15), SSEs face the
following special problems:
(a)  Purchase of raw materials.  Compared to large producers,
SSEs have to pay higher prices for raw materials because
suppliers frequently give discounts for bulk purchasing.
Moreover, SSEs normally face difficulties in obtaining
import licenses, which are granted on the basis of past
levels of production. As a consequence, SSEs are often
forced to purchase inferior quality raw materials at higher
prices. Under the proposed project SEDCO and the Premier
Investment Corporation (PIC) would assist SSEs to obtain
raw materials at reasonable prices (para. 6.24). STC is
also expected to give special consideration to the needs
of SSEs.
(b)  Working capital financing.  The main financial problem of
SSEs is the lack of working capital, since the amount of
fixed capital needed in these businesses is relatively small.
Under the proposed project, both SEDCO and the participating
banks would finance permanent working capital (para. 6.15).
(c)  Technical assistance.  The lack of expertise in the areas of
project preparation, bookkeeping, marketing, and general
management is a key obstacle to the efficient growth of
existing SSEs. Under the proposed project both SEDCO and
JIDC would provide the above services to SSEs to increase
the flow of viable projects and the productivity of SSEs.
Also, advisors with experience in assisting SSEs would be
employed by PIC, JIDC and SEDCO (para. 6.22).

III. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Introduction
3.01      The Jamaican financial sector is well developed.  It consists of
a relatively wide range of capital market institutions, 1/ including commer-
cial banking, savings, insurance, development banking, stock market and other
institutions. This chapter focuses mainly on financial institutions which
lend to SSEs and evaluates the lending experience as well as their capacity
to act as intermediaries in the proposed project.
3.02      The major financial institutions involved in SSE financing include
BOJ, nine commercial banks, the Small Business Loan Board (SBLB), JDB and
its subsidiary Development Venture Capital Financing Ltd. (DVCF). Long-term
financing of private projects is handled largely by the government
institutions - SBLB, JDB and DVCF. Commercial banks and finance companies
mainly lend to SSEs for the purchase of commercial vehicles, some capital
equipment and for working capital purposes, on either an installment basis or
short to medium terms ranging from one to three years.
The Bank of Jamaica
3.03      Since its establishment in 1960, BOJ, as Jamaica's central bank,
has played an active role in establishing locally owned financial institutions
for development banking, unit trusts, mortgage banks and export credit insur-
ance activities, which had not been serviced adequately by the private finan-
cial sector. Also, BOJ administers a credit guarantee scheme for SSEs. BOJ
has regulatory control over the financial system in Jamaica and all foreign
exchange transactions. BOJ is considered one of the outstanding institutions
in Jamaica and has a good staff.
Commercial Banks
3.04      The commercial banking system in Jamaica represents the most
important institutional mechanism for mobilizing and allocating resources
to various economic sectors. There are nine commercial banks in operation,
with 160 branches throughout the island. Up until recently all commercial
banks were controlled by foreign banks, except for the Workers' Savings
and Loan Bank, which is 100% locally owned. On August 15, 1977, the govern-
ment acquired Barclays Bank, the second largest commercial bank, and renamed
it National Commercial Bank, Jamaica Ltd. Table 3-1 provides data of the
assets, deposits and the number of branches of individual banks as of
-September 30, 1977.

3.05      Role of commercial banks in mobilizing resources.  The share of
commercial banks, as a percentage of total savings mobilized, was 67% in
1976. 1/ The system is still the most important mechanism for mobilizing
savings in Jamaica, although its relative importance has declined with the
growth of other financial institutions such as building societies, credit
unions, trust companies, and merchant banks. Table 3-2 provides a breakdown
of deposits in commercial banks. In September 1977, savings deposits
accounted for 49% of total deposits, compared with 44% in the previous two
years. The rapid increase in savings deposits is due mainly to the decline
in the interest rate for time deposits caused by the present high level of
liquidity in the system (para. 3.07). The share of individuals in all forms
of deposits mobilized by commercial banks is around 61%, the balance being
contributed by institutions, firms and government.
1/   Excluded from this list are the National Housing Trust and the
National Insurance Scheme, both of which are funded by mandatory payroll
deductions.

3.06      Lending operations of commercial banks.  The aggregate loan portfolio
of commercial banks during the last six years is given in Annex 2. Loans and
advances outstanding increased rapidly from J$420 million in 1972 to J$702
million in 1976, due mainly to the commercial banks' financing of real estate
and consumer durables. Loans for construction and distribution increased
from only J$142 million in 1972 to J$234 million in 1976, an increase of 64%
in current prices. During the same period, loans to the manufacturing sector
increased by 43% from J$85.9 million to J$123.0 million. During the first
nine months of 1977, however, the aggregate loans and advances declined by 8%
to J$646 million due to the significant downturn in the economy. The major
decline was in the real estate sector, which experienced a decline of 20%.
Loans to the manufacturing sector declined by 7%.
3.07      In the past, the largest share (18% in 1976) of commercial bank
lending had gone to the construction and land development sectors. Most of
these real estate projects were geared toward the medium and high income
groups and overseas investors, and were of speculative nature. Because of
lack of demand from the high income groups and the excessive build-up in the
real estate sector, most banks have suffered significant loan losses. Also,
the overall decline in the economy resulted in a contraction of loan demands
in all sectors. This has been further exacerbated by the lack of foreign
exchange. The banks' ability to lend to the productive sectors (agriculture
and manufacturing) is constrained because borrowers cannot use loans in
Jamaican dollars to import needed raw materials. As a result, the banking
system is highly liquid at present, but this liquidity could be absorbed
fairly rapidly once the overall foreign exchange constraints are overcome and
the economy begins to recover. The availability of program-type external
assistance (e.g., the US$30 million from the Bank and US$40 million from the
United Kingdom) together with IMF financing should help alleviate the foreign
exchange shortage of the manufacturing sector. Also, the National Housing
Trust is in the process of implementing a large housing scheme (about



- 13 -
J$50-60 million p.a.) and this could provide impetus to the economy. Under
the proposed project, foreign exchange would be made available to SSEs to
import necessary raw materials and other equipment inputs.
3.08      The bulk of credit granted by commercial banks is essentially short
or medium term. Instalment credit for commercial purposes is almost exclu-
sively used by SSEs. The instalment credit figures include those from
commercial banks, dealers, and finance companies. The share of instalment
credit assigned to SSEs includes that for commercial vehicles, acquisition
of capital equipment, and business purposes. In 1976 commercial banks
provided J$57 million to the manufacturing sector through instalment credit,
of which J$33 million was in medium-term credit. Almost 50% of total credit
advanced by commercial banks has involved loans of less than J$100,000.
However, these data include personal loans made for non-business purposes and
hence it is difficult to estimate credit availability to the SSE sector. A
sample survey of loan approvals by a large commercial bank in 1976 showed that
65% of the loans approved below J$150,000 went to enterprises with total
assets of less than J$150,000. This indicates that the commercial banking
system has been a major lender to SSEs in Target Group (A).
3.09      Interest rate policies of commercial banks.  Table 3-3 shows the
weighted average interest rate for different forms of commercial bank credit
and the percentage distribution by loan category as of December 1975 and 1976.
The weighted average rate for commercial credit increased by 1% to 13.8%
during 1976, though the rate for instalment credit remained fairly stable.
In February 1976 the central bank rate was raised by 1% to 9% and the prime
lending rate from 10% to 11%. The weighted commercial interest rate was
approximately 2.5-3% over the prime lending rate during 1976. Similar lending
rates prevailed during 1977 and early 1978.

3.10      Commercial banking--cost of financial intermediation.  The admin-
istrative cost of intermediation for commercial banks is one of the main
factors in determining the spread requirements for lending to SSEs. However,
the administrative costs and lending risk vary significantly depending on
the client and the nature of the lending operation and are also different
for individual banks, reflecting their operating costs. The mission's calcu-
lations of key operational ratios reflecting cost and benefit of intermediation
by three representative commercial banks are provided in Table 3-4.

3.11      The informat'ion contained in table 3-4 shows that the proposed
spread of 4.5% under subprogram I of the proposed loan (para. 6.16) should
be adequate to attract commercial banks because (i) there will be no admin-
istrative costs in resource mobilization (costs of mobilizing resources from
small savers are quite high in Jamaica); and (ii) the foreign exchange to
be made available under the proposed loan would enable the commercial banks
to provide additional loan funds using their own local resources and therefore
raise the total returns on their assets.  Four commercial banks (National
Commercial Bank, Royal Bank, First National City Bank, and the Workers'
Savings and Loan Bank) have indicated their interest in participating in the
proposed project.
3.12      Role of commercial banks in lending to SSEs.  Although the com-
mercial banking system is not yet meeting adequately the needs of SSEs,
the system represents the largest pool of SSE lending expertise in Jamaica.
A self-sustaining financial intermediation system for the SSE sector could
evolve if they could be encouraged to increase their long-term lending to
SSEs. Presently most commercial banks lend to SSEs for short-term needs on



- 15 -
a fully secured basis. Except for the Royal Bank and the National Commercial
Bank, staff have limited experience in project lending. Commercial bank
branches at present have only limited authority (up to J$25,000 in one case)
to approve business loan applications. However, granting greater loan approval
authority to the branches needs to be preceded by training programs for branch
staff. Furthermore, loan supervision often involves financial counselling and
ensuring observance of sound accounting procedures by SSEs. Therefore it would
be necessary to build up a sufficient project lending capacity in the banks.
In this connection, the Premier Investment Corporation (PIC), a wholly owned
subsidiary of BOJ, would arrange training for commercial banks' officers in
project appraisal. The Jamaica Institute of Bankers (JIB) would also play an
active role in training commercial banks' loan officers.
3.X3      All four potential participating banks (para. 3.11) have indicated
that they would be prepared to create a SSE lending unit in their headquarters
as a part of the Bank-financed project once it is under way. Projects would be
appraised at the headquarters and later administered by the appropriate
branches. At the second stage, branch offices could increasingly assume the
lending responsibility after sufficient training by JIB (para. 6.10).
Operating policies and procedures of the commercial banks for long-term SSE
lending need to be developed and institutionalized, for both loan appraisal
and supervision. In connection with the proposed project, PIC would be
responsible for preparing appraisal and supervision manuals, standard loan
applications, and guidelines for disbursements acceptable to the Bank (para.
6.07).
Small Businessmen's Financing Scheme
3.14      To encourage the commercial banks to increase long-term credits
to the SSE sector, in 1975 BOJ established SBFS, a credit guarantee scheme,
through PIC. The scheme limits eligibility to firms whose annual gross
revenue, after project implementation, is less than J$300,000. Maximum
loan amount are J$25,000 for fixed assets and J$10,000 for working capital.
The maximum term is ten years. The interest rate charged is 1.5% over the
prime lending rate (currently 11%) as applicable from time to time. Collat-
eral requirements vary, depending on the purpose of the loan, at the discre-
tion of the individual banks. PIC covers 50% of the aggregate loans granted
by each bank under this scheme in any 12-month period, without a fee and
subject to a ceiling of J$1.5 million on the total guaranteed amount.
3.15      Table 3-5 provides the amount of loans granted under the scheme
and the sectoral breakdown. Up to September 30, 1977 commercial banks had
granted 255 loans amounting to J$2.1 million. In the past, commercial banks
were reluctant to utilize this facility because the interest rates for both
instalment credit and commercial credit were higher than the onlending rate
(12-1/2%) allowed under the scheme. The spread available to commercial banks
under the scheme is barely adequate, particularly under conditions of credit
rationing when the marginal cost of funds tends to be high. Also, the maximum
amount of loan (J$25,000) is low considering the financial requirements of
most borrowers. However, since May 1977 commercial banks have increasingly
used this facility because of: (i) their high liquidity; (ii) lack of loan



- 16 -
demand from larger firms; and (iii) free guarantee for loans. The most active
bank under the scheme has been the Royal Bank, which made 187 loans amounting
to J$1.6 million, or 72% of the total amount guaranteed.

3.16      From the limited experience, it appears that the credit guarantee
scheme has encouraged commercial banks to lend to SSEs that would not normally
qualify for their loans because of lack of collateral. However, such a scheme
would be more useful in giving promising enterpreneurs access to commercial
bank lending without its present interest rate restriction. BOJ has agreed
to modify and expand the SBFS (para. 6.09).
Jamaica Development Bank/Development Venture Capital Financing Ltd
3.17      JDB, the government-owned development bank, is facing severe finan-
cial and institutional problems. The Bank, through its agricultural lending
operations, and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) are assisting JDB in
overcoming these problems. IDB has dealt mainly with SSEs in Target Group (A)
using two credit lines from the Inter-American Development Bank. JDB has not
been very successful in lending to SSEs because of: (i) its predominant orienta-
tion toward large enterprises; (ii) lack of local funds; (iii) procurement
restrictions under international loans; and (iv) lack of technical assistance
services.



3.18      In the past, JDB passed on to DVCF riskier small projects and
other loans which did not meet JDB's minimum lending criteria. Consequently,
DVCF incurred substantial losses and was decapitalized. However, DVCF is now
being recapitalized and restructured in connection with a US$1.9 million
component of the Bank's Second Urban Project (Loan 1003-JM). JDB would not
participate directly under the proposed project but DVCF could participate
as an intermediary at a later stage (para. 6.06). DVCF presently has
adequate resources to carry out its operations over the next two to three
years.
The Small Business Loan Board
3.19      SBLB has been the major institution servicing Target Group (B).  How-
ever, the institution clearly lacked the managerial, technical, and financial
resources to make a significant impact on the sector's development, and has
also been subject to undue political influence. It had no guidelines specifying
its operating policies, project appraisal and/or loan supervision methods.
SBLB was neither sound nor efficiently managed, and GOJ has taken steps to
liquidate it, simultaneously establishing SEDCO, a specialized small industry
bank, to service enterprises in Target Group (B) (Chapter V). SBLB ceased
its lending operations on May 31, 1978. SEDCO will start operations by July 1,
1978. Up to 1977, SBLB had received about J$7 million in grants from GOJ,
but the value of its assets is uncertain.  Its accounts have not been audited
since 1974 and, as of May 1976, about 50% of its portfolio was affected by
arrears. SBLB's accounts are now being audited. During negotiations it was
agreed that the government would take all necessary action to transfer by
August 31, 1978 to a Special Fund of SEDCO the assets of the SBLB (para.
5.05). Employees of SIDD and SBLB were given an opportunity to compete with
other candidates for positions in SEDCO and four of them were selected.
IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Overview
4.01      There are a variety of institutions involved in providing technical
assistance to industry in Jamaica. 1/ Medium- and large-scale enterprises and
some modern SSEs (Target Group (A)) are receiving assistance from the Jamaica
Industrial Development Corporation (JIDC) and the Jamaica National Export Cor-
poration (JNEC). Very small-scale enterprises (Target Group (B)) ar~e serviced,
to a limited degree, primarily by two institutions--the Small Industries Devel-
opment Division (SIDD) of the JIDC and the Small Business Development Centre
(SBDC).
4.02      In general, technical assistance services for both target groups
contemplated in the proposed project have been ineffective. Most institutions

prise Sector in Jamaica," December 1976.



- 18 -
have not been able to establish clear priorities or to focus on particular
growth areas, but have tried, with limited success, to solve on a random basis
a myriad of individual problems of SSEs. This has led to a fragmentation of
programs and the absence of a comprehensive effort to identify and deal with
the key problems facing SSEs in Jamaica. This chapter assesses the current
status of the major technical assistance institutions and recommends a techni-
cal assistance strategy for the proposed project.
Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation
4.03      Background.  JIDC was established in 1952 as an autonomous, statutory
body to stimulate industrial development and attract foreign capital to Jamaica.
Through the 1960s JIDC gradually expanded and diversified as the industrial
base in Jamaica grew and as the UNDP assisted it in entering into various areas
involving services to industry. Because of the decline in foreign invest-
ments and lack of leadership, JIDC became an increasingly ineffective insti-
tution without a clearly defined role. Also, GOJ's involvement in industry
expanded steadily as a number of parastatal enterprises were established.
JIDC's main activities were limited to conducting investigations in regard
to the incentive laws and implementing parastatal projects.
4.04      Organization and staffing.  In November 1977 JIDC was completely
reorganized and a new management team was appointed consisting of the chair-
man of the board, managing director, and two division heads (a third division
head position is vacant). The new management has been recruited with due
consideration being given to technical competence. The main thrust of the
reorganization was to streamline the organization, reduce the fragmentation
of actitivies, and focus efforts in several key areas where the new management
feels the greatest results could be obtained.
4.05      JIDC presently has a total professional staff of about 65 and three
divisions (Annex 3):
(a) The Project Planning and Research Division is headed by the former
Director of Industry (Ministry of Industry and Commerce) who was
recently transferred to JIDC. This division is expected to be
GOJ's "think tank" on industrial policies. Although this division
has been assigned a wide range of industrial research responsibi-
lities, its main functions will be sector analysis and feasibility
studies. The first task will be to prepare sector reports on the
major industrial subsectors in Jamaica (tentatively leather and
footwear, food, garments, metal fabrication, and furniture) and to
develop a national plan for these sectors. Subsequently, JIDC will
prepare feasibility studies for the public sector or mixed investment
in new enterprises. This division will also evaluate the appli-
cations for incentives, perform strategic analysis leading to
government policy decisions concerning the revisions in the incen-
tive laws, and compile industrial sector data. It is planning to
set up a data bank and carry out a manufacturing survey in con-
junction with the Department of Statistics (para. 2.19).



- 19 -
(b) The Productivity and Industrial Services Division will mainly provide
technical assistance and extension services to private sector enter-
prises, focussing on the industrial subsectors listed above, with
particular attention to improving the performance of firms located in
factories or industrial complexes owned by JIDC. The division will
specialize in providing assistance in engineering, cost accounting,
and training. JIDC already has substantial expertise, partly through
the presence of eight expatriate advisors in these areas.
(c) The Prolect Implementation and Monitoring Division will act as a holding
company for 12 parastatal enterprises and provide technical assis-
tance as needed. This is clearly JIDC's most difficult undertaking,
partly because the government has not yet decided as to whether
these firms should be operated on a commercial basis or should follow
national employment policies to provide necessary items at low cost
to consumers, and also because JIDC salaries are inadequate to attract
the caliber of staff necessary for the division. This division's
responsibilities are likely to increase as Jamaica moves more towards
a mixed economy.
4.06      Prospects.  The major challenges of the reorganized JIDC will be
to act as a holding company for the government and also to promote private
investments in the priority sectors. This latter activity will require
gaining the confidence of the private investors and providing on-site tech-
nical assistance services in accounting, production and marketing. While
the management of JIDC seems competent, its success will depend upon its
ability to recruit and retain qualified staff. Vast disparities presently
exist between public sector and private sector salaries, and the recent
emigration of many qualified professionals has created a strong demand for
engineers, accountants, and experienced managers. GOJ is presently studying
the issue of salaries for parastatal enterprise employees with a view toward
determining necessary improvements.
4.07      Although the objectives of JIDC may seem too ambitious, it can be
expected that significant improvements in its performance and impact will
occur. The management has been substantially strengthened, the board has been
designed to foster coordination with other industrial services available in
Jamaica, and the emphasis on key areas should allow JIDC to take the best
advantage of its limited number of quality staff members under the proposed
project.
Jamaica National Export Corporation/Jamaica Export Trading Company
4.08      The JNEC, a statutory board under the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, was set up in 1969 to promote the development of Jamaica's export
trade. The principal activities of JNEC include: (i) market research;
(ii) sponsoring and establishing trade fairs and missions; (iii) publication
of manuals and directories; (iv) certifying exports under CARICOM, United
States General Scheme of Preference, and international cocoa agreements;
(v) acting as advisors to the ministry in matters affecting trade policy;
and (vi) training of exporters.



- 20 -
4.09      JNEC has identified several products with good export potential.
These include processed and fresh foods, horticultural products, essential
oils and spices, alcoholic beverages, footwear and leather, garments, furni-
ture of metal and wood, plastic, handicrafts, toys, and jewelry. JNEC's
main function was to expedite the bureaucratic processes that exporters
must follow, but it is now taking a more active role in export promotion,
mainly by sponsoring overseas promotions and sales missions, and sponsoring
visits by foreign buyers, mainly from the USA and the EEC.
4.10      JETCO.  In May 1977 JNEC established JETCO to promote non-tradi-
tional exports (excluding bananas, sugar, and alumina-bauxite). JETCO's
initial focus will be on promoting exports of fresh foods, limestor.e, horti-
cultural products, oils and spices, and some processed foods. At a later
stage JETCO would promote greater local processing of these items and the
export of some manufactured goods of small- and medium-scale industries. In
most cases JETCO would purchase the goods directly from the entrepreneur
on receiving an order, funding 80% of the cost through the Jamaica Export
Credit Insurance Corporation (JECIC), a subsidiary of BOJ, and 20% from
its own working capital. JETCO would add a 10% fee to the price of the
product to cover its services. In other cases, JETCO would act only as agent
for the same fee.
4.11          JETCO's resources include equity contributions of J$150,000
from BOJ and J$150,000 from JNEC, and a US$1 million loan from the European
Development Fund. Permanent sales offices have been established in New York,
London, Brussels, and Miami and overseas missions will be set up in other
places. Under the proposed project JETCO, which will be represented in the
Project Coordinating Committee (para. 6.26), will assist the borrowers from
SEDCO and commercial banks in locating overseas markets.
Small Industries Development Division of JIDC
4.12      SIDD was created in 1973 to assist SSEs by preparing feasibility
studies, providing market research for products, assistance in raw materials
and equipment procurement, and guidance in factory accommodation and layout
and by helping in the preparation of loan applications for lending institutions.
These technical assistance services were given free. SIDD was ineffective,
due to its lack of focus, and on January 2, 1978 GOJ abolished SIDD and
transferred its budget allocations and functions to SEDCO (Chapter V).
Several of SIDD's most qualified staff members are now employed by SEDCO.
Small Business Development Centre
4.13      SBDC was established by a group of Jamaican professionals and busi-
ness executives in 1972 to provide management training and advisory services
to SSEs. Its main contribution has been the organization of short-term train-
ing courses and management seminars. SBDC is funded through donations from
financial institutions, and from tuition fees. All instructors work free
of charge, so costs are low. The courses have been successful and demand
for them has been rising steadily. SBDC has also established a small library
and information center, and in 1978 will offer to SSEs some courses in
exporting.



- Li. -
The Proposal for a Technical Assistance Strategy
4.14      Given the different technical assistance needs of enterprises in the
Target Groups (A) and (B), there is a need to develop two separate technical
assistance programs. Since there already exist a few major technical assist-
ance institutions with potential to assist SSEs in Target Group (A), an
appropriate technical assistance strategy should be to improve coordination
among those institutions and direct their efforts to that target group. The
recently reorganized JIDC could actively assist modern SSEs.
4.15      JIDC has approved a detailed plan (Annex 4) to implement a technical
assistance program and terms of reference for an expatriate advisor. The main
activity of the technical assistance unit would be to assist entrepreneurs in
preparing investment plans suitable for obtaining commercial bank financing,
and to provide assistance during project implementation. JIDC would not
intervene in the close relationship between banker and borrower, but would act
as technical advisor to both. Also, JIDC would develop a technology referral
service to assist entrepreneurs in identifying and procuring machinery and raw
materials, and would develop a consultant referral service for entrepreneurs
who need intensive technical assistance. Project preparation and referral
services would be given free of charge, while major in-plant assistance
would be provided at a small fee or through the consultant referral service.
During negotiations GOJ, JIDC, BOJ and the Bank agreed on the detailed plan
for the proposed technical assistance unit and the necessary funding (para.
6.13). Under the proposed project, coordination of the technical assistance
and credit activities for Target Group (A) will be the responsibility of a
Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) composed of representatives of PIC, JIDC,
JNEC/JETCO, the Trade Administrator and the participating commercial banks
(para, 6.26).
4.16      Presently, there is no single institution in Jamaica that can
effectively assist SSEs in Target Group (B). The government has recognized
this and has decided to establish SEDCO as a multifunctional institution,
which would provide both financial and technical assistance to very small
enterprises (Chapter V). The proposed project supports this strategy.
V. THE SMALL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
Background
5.01      In November 1977 GOJ established SEDCO as a wholly government-
owned company to perform credit and technical assistance functions formerly
performed by SBLB (para. 3.19) and SIDD (para. 4.12). Both SBLB and SIDD
have been rather ineffective and have been abolished. The Bank has been
instrumental in assisting GOJ in establishing SEDCO. SEDCO will provide
both working capital and fixed assets financing to viable, very small-scale
enterprises with net fixed assets (excluding land and buildings) below
US$20,000 equivalent (para. 2.19).



- 22 -
Scope and Objectives
5.02      SEDCO's major objectives are to:
(a) make short-, medium- and long-term loans to viable SSEs;
(b) provide technical assistance primarily to its borrowers;
(c) promote labor-intensive industries;
(d) encourage industries which are based on local raw materials;
and
(e) promote local entrepreneurship.
5.03      SEDCO is now formulating its lending strategy to meet the above
objectives and is training its staff. It is expected to start operations
by July 1, 1978 on a modest scale and initially would limit technical assis-
tance services to its clients. Subsequently, it may undertake other activi-
ties to support the development of SSEs, such as assistance in marketing and
purchasing and promoting industrial estates.
SEDCO's Autonomy
5.04      SEDCO's success will depend heavily on whether it can gain credi-
bility as a viable and sound development finance institution for SSEs. The
government is keen to see that SEDCO does not repeat the mistakes of SBLB
and SIDD. Accordingly, it will need a board with broad representation,
strong management and sound operating policies and it will have to be
protected from political interference. During negotiations GOJ agreed that
SEDCO would be allowed to conduct its business and operations in a manner which
would ensure financial self-sufficiency and viability.
Ownership and Board
5.05      SEDCO is a wholly government-owned company and is expected to have
an initial authorized capital of about J$13 million. During negotiations
GOJ agreed to pay in at least J$2.5 million in 1978; J$3 million in 1979
and 1980 each; and J$4.5 million in 1981. SBLB's assets of about J$7 million
would be transferred to SEDCO as a Special Fund by August 31, 1978 (para.
3.19). The amount to be paid in by GOJ in any year would be reduced by the
net cash flow generated by the Special Fund for SEDCO in that year.
5.06      Annex 6 provides a list of SEDCO's board members who are expected to
be appointed by July 1, 1978. SEDCO has a board of 14 directors headed by a
chairman appointed by the Minister of Industry and Commerce. The current
chairman is an active private businessman. The board is composed of members
of the private sector organizations, the government-owned financial institu-
tions (JDB, BOJ and JNIC), the Ministries of Finance and Industry, and SEDCO.
The private organizations represented include: the Jamaica Manufacturers
Association, SBDC and the Small Business Association. SEDCO is represented by



- 23 -
its managing director and a staff member. Board members will serve for a term
of two years. It is expected that the board would mainly play a vital policy
making and advisory role, leaving day-to-day business to SEDCO's management.
Organization and Staffing
5.07      As of May 1978 SEDCO's staff numbered 14, including the managing
director, who has commercial banking experience. By July 1978 SEDCO is
expected to be fully staffed as shown in its organization chart (Annex 5).
The key position of financial director still needs to be filled. For
SEDCO to be a viable institution, it would need to employ and retain highly
qualified staff. It should also not be subject to civil service procedures.
During negotiations GOJ agreed that SEDCO would be allowed to employ and
retain its staff strictly on a merit basis.
5.08      Under the present structure, SEDCO has three main divisions:  Manage-
ment Advisory Services, Finance, and Administration. Their major activities
would include the following:
(a) Technical Services Division (10-15 professionals):
(i) provide technical assistance and extension services mainly
to SEDCO borrowers, primarily in the areas of accounting,
marketing, and production management;
(ii) focus intensive efforts on particular subsectors (e.g.,
garments, shoes, and wood products), raw material
procurement and marketing; and
(iii) coordinate with other relevant agencies.
(b) Finance Division (8-10 professionals):
(i) perform preparation and analysis of loan requests, based on
simple-format appraisals;
(ii) supervise outstanding loans on a periodic basis through client
visits and a simplified reporting system;
(iii) seek assistance for credit clients as needed; and
(iv) control the flow of funds, prepare financial statements,
control the portfolio, handle all financial affairs of
SEDCO, and prepare projections.
(c) Administration Division (5 professionals):
(i) carry out the administrative, personnel, and legal functions
of SEDCO; and
(ii) handle in-house training and oversee property.



- 24 -
5.09      While the finance division must be independent and objective in
analyzing the viability of a project, project implementation in many cases
must be combined with a technical assistance program for the borrower. To
control the quality of lending operations and maintain effective coordination
between the technical assistance and credit functions, SEDC0 will have a loan
committee consisting of the three operating divisions' heads and the managing
director. The committee will approve loans of J$5,000-20,000 while loans
over J$20,000 will be approved by SEDCO's Board of Directors. The loan
committee is expected to play an active role and ensure that non-viable
projects are weeded out before reaching the board.
Policies and Procedures
5.10      SEDCO's statement of policies and procedures, which the Jamaican
Cabinet has already approved and which will shortly be submitted to SEDCO's
board for ratification, is provided in Annex 7. It is quite comprehensive and
gives clear guidance to SEDCO in its various fields of operation. Its
principal features are:
(a) the target group is industry, construction, transport, tourism
and other viable productive enterprises with less than US$20,000
equivalent in net fixed assets;
(b) equity investments are not permitted;
(c) projects will be selected based on financial, economic, and
technical viability criteria;
(d) loan supervision and portfolio recuperation will be given high
priority, with higher interest rates charged for loans in
arrears;
(e) SEDC0 will not fund more than 75Z of project costs except in
special cases justified on creditworthiness as well as project
grounds;
(f) SEDCO's long term debt/equity limitation is 4:1; and
(g) SEDCO will establish adequate reserves to cover any possible
portfolio losses and shall periodically review and update such
reserves to cover losses on its operations.
5.11      SEDCO's statement of policies and procedures is satisfactory except
for the interest rate policy which states that: "The minimum interest rate
charged by SEDCO shall reflect the cost of funds to SEDCO and the cost of
administration but interest rate charged shall not normally exceed the
commercial banks' prime lending rate." The current prime rate in Jamaica
is 11%, while the weighted commercial rate is 13.5X. Given the overall
interest rate structure in Jamaica and high costs of lending to very small-
scale enterprises, there is no justification for SEDCO's interest rate to be
below the prime commercial rate. This would not only imply a subsidy for
SEDCO borrowers but could also prevent SEDCO from charging an adequate interest



- 25 -
rate to be viable. Therefore, during negotiations GOJ, SEDCO, and the Bank
agreed on a revision of SEDCO's policy statement including a provision that
SEDCO would charge no less than the prime lending rate with a minimum interest
rate of 11% p.a.
5.12      The main task of SEDCO's management and staff during the first
half of FY1978/79 is to set up operating procedures, prepare a manual, and
establish a reporting system. The Netherlands have agreed in principle
to provide technical assistance in this area, and the Bank will draw upon
the experience of similar institutions to assist SEDCO in this task. The
major objective of the technical assistance effort would be to enable SEDCO
to process efficiently a large number of small loans, to provide technical
assistance to its clients in priority areas, and to present SEDCO's manage-
ment with timely and comprehensive operational information.
Business Outlook
5.13      SEDCO presently has 1,300 pending loan applications, amounting to
about J$5 million. These applications were transferred from the now defunct
SBLB (para. 3.19). However, due to SEDCO's limited appraisal capacity and
start-up delays, SEDCO's operations in the first year are likely to be only
about J$2 million. SEDCO's medium- and long-term prospects are good, as
Jamaica intends to emphasize labor intensity and the use of local raw materials
in future industrial promotion and policy. The construction sector is expected
to receive a boost from the National Housing Trust, and small-scale industries
should perform well. Technical assistance provided by SEDCO should increase
the flow of viable projects. Also, the proposed project will make available
much needed foreign exchange to cover the working capital imports of SSEs.
Projected Resource Requirements and Financing Plans
5.14      SEDCO's projected resource requirements and financing plans are
provided in Table 5.1. During the next four years (FY79-82) SEDCO would need
J$15.5 million (J$14.5 million for new loans and J$1 million for liquidity).
GOJ has agreed to provide SEDCO with J$13 million in equity over the period
(para. 5.05). The proposed project includes a subprogram of US$2 million
(about J$3.1 million) to cover a major portion of SEDCO's foreign exchange
requirement. The amount of the subprogram is determined on the basis that
SEDCO (i) has access to GOJ's resources which were channelled to SSEs
through the now defunct SBLB; and (ii) could not absorb a larger amount
of Bank funds. Moreover, there is a possibility that CDB could provide
additional resources to SEDCO if needed.

Projected Financial Results and Positions
5.15      SEDCO's projected financial results and position for FYs79-83, as
well as the underlying assumptions, are provided in Annex 8. For SEDCO to be
financially viable it would need a spread of about 9%. Such a spread could be
obtained by either charging a high interest rate (15% p.a.) or having a high
equity base. Since SEDCO is not likely to charge more than 11% p.a. without
an increase in the prime rate, the projections are based on the latter option
of capitalizing it. This involves an element of subsidy to SSEs which, however,
is necessary to foster the development of SSEs in Jamaica. During the first
two years SEDCO is expected to incur losses of about J$500,000 due to high
start-up costs and low returns on its portfolio. However, since SEDCO is
expected to charge 11% on all new loans, the return on SEDCO's overall assets
is projected to increase from 9.6% in FY79 to 10.3% in FYs82-83. Administra-
tive expenses as a percentage of average total assets, initially very high
due to SEDCO's low assets base, are projected to decline to 4.6% in FY83.
Administrative expenses, including salaries and benefits, are projected to
increase by 20% p.a. during 1978-80 and 30% thereafter. This reflects both
the increase in the number of SEDCO's employees and cost escalations. SEDCO's
financial results, while acceptable, would improve if it were to charge
management fees on SBLB's portfolio. This matter would be raised during
project supervisions. With the expected improvement in SEDCO's appraisal



- 27 -
capacity and the average grace period of 2-3 years for new loans, SEDCO's
losses are projected at 4% of new disbursements, which is reasonable. SEDCO's
policy statement states that it will establish adequate reserves to cover
possible portfolio losses (para. 5.10). SEDCO's provisions for losses are
projected to remain at 4% of its year-end portfolio. This level of provisions
is reasonable given the expected improvement in project appraisal capability
and the proposed increase in the average subloan grace period to 2-3 years.
5.16      SEDCO's financial position is also projected to be acceptable.
Its assets are anticipated to increase from J$2.3 million in FY79 to J$19.9
million in FY83 if it can obtain the expected resources. With the debt/equity
ratio remaining well below 1:1 throughout the period, SEDCO would have adequate
debt service capacity. Provided that it follows the prudent financial policies
discussed above, SEDCO can be considered creditworthy to use US$2 million in
Bank funds. Funding of SEDCO's technical assistance operations has been
assumed to be covered by GOJ's annual budgetary allocations, continuing the
practice of supporting SIDD's similar functions in the past. SEDCO's policy
also provides that it will engage independent external auditors of established
status to carry out its annual audit. During negotiations it was agreed that
SEDCO would appoint auditors acceptable to the Bank.
Technical Assistance Requirements
5.17      Although SEDCO's management has experience in commercial banking
and small industry development, expert assistance in development banking would
be needed in the initial years. Thus, SEDCO would need to employ one advisor
with broad experience in development banking for two years and a financial
advisor for one year. The two advisors would assist in all facets of SEDCO's
operations, but would focus on developing sound financial and loan appraisal
policies and procedures. The appointment of the advisors will be a condition
of disbursement for SEDCO (para. 6.22). In addition to these advisors SEDCO
would have access to funds administered by PIC to contract short-term experts.
The total foreign cost of this program is estimated at US$150,000, to be
financed by GOJ from the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan (para. 6.13).
VI. THE PROPOSED INTEGRATED PROGRAM FOR SSEs
Background
6.01      Under an earlier urban project (Loan 1003-JM in 1974) US$1.9 million
was allocated for onlending to SSEs. This component had to be restructured in
August 1977 by making DVCF fully responsible for its implementation, without,
however, attempting to tackle the complex problem of assisting SSEs in Jamaica
on a wider scale. The proposed project would support the first integrated SSE
development program in Jamaica.
Objectives
6.02      The principal objectives of the proposed SSE development project
are to:



- 28 -
(a)  support GOJ's development objectives by providing much needed
foreign exchange for SSEs to import essential raw materials and
intermediate goods, and machinery and equipment (including spare
parts) as necessary;
(b)  involve the commercial banking system in medium- and long-term
lending to SSEs in the productive sectors (manufacturing, agro-
industry, and construction);
(c)  assist GOJ in establishing SEDCO as a viable and effective
institution for servicing very small-scale enterprises;
(d)  increase the flow of bankable projects to financial interme-
diaries by providing focused technical assistance services; and
(e)  provide a framework for a dialogue with GOJ on industrial
policies (such as revising the existing industrial incentive
schemes to provide more stimulus for exports), partly by
instituting systematic data collection relevant to SSEs.
Rationale for the Institutional Arrangement
6.03      The existing institutional framework for both financial and tech-
nical assistance is inadequate for satisfying the development needs of the
SSE sector. There is also no specialization to serve the differing needs of
enterprises in both target groups. An effective program for developing SSEs
should therefore contain the following elements:
(a)  provision of permanent working capital and fixed assets
financing to individual clients from one source to avoid
coordination problems between different financial institutions;
(b)  easy access to financial services through a branch network that
could provide routine banking and financial services to SSEs,
as well as monitor the performance of individual borrowers;
(c)  a technical assistance program which would support the above
financial services and assist entrepreneurs with project
promotion and formulation as well as provide extension services;
and
(d)  assistance to very small-scale enterprises in procuring raw
materials and marketing finished products. In some industries,
assistance in organizing production to achieve minimum quality
standards is also needed.
6.04      Commercial banks, which have been providing the bulk of short- and
medium-term credit to SSEs, are in an advantageous position in lending to
SSEs in Target Group (A). Commercial banks represent the most important
institutional framework for mobilizing domestic savings. A self-sustaining
financial intermediation system can evolve if they are encouraged to increase



- 29 -
their term lending to SSEs. Commercial banks have experience in dealing
with SSEs as a result of their own lending as well as through GOJ's credit
guarantee scheme and several other schemes. Finally, the commercial banking
system consists of a branch network of 160 offices which provide a good
-coverage of all potential borrowers in Jamaica. While the commercial banks
represent the best available vehicle for dealing with SSEs in Target Group
(A), they would not be suitable for dealing with very small-scale enterprises
(Target Group (B)) as they could not provide the substantial technical
assistance supervision and promotional efforts that are needed. Therefore,
GOJ established SEDCO as a specialized small industry bank to serve Target
Group (B).
Subprograms and Cost
6.05      The proposed project would have three subprograms as shown in
Table 6.1. Total project costs covering a period of three years are estimated
at US$11.7 million, of which about 60% involve foreign costs. The proposed
loan to GOJ of US$7 million would cover tegn exchange compo-
nent.  The allocat on       e  posed loan by components would be revfw 
after two years.

Subprogram I - Financing of Modern Small-Scale Enterprises
6.06      US$4.5 million of the proposed loan would be onlent by GOJ to BOJ
to establish a rediscounting facility which would be administered by PIC.
The maximum subloan amount under this subprogram would be US$100,000 and
any participating commercial bank (para. 3.11) could rediscount up to 100%
of the specific loan amounts, subject to a ceiling of 65% of total subproject
cost. BOJ, in consultation with the Bank, would accredit any commercial bank



- 30 -
which makes a commitment to create an adequately staffed project unit and to
build up expertise in appraising SSE projects, and which is considered credit-
worthy. No funds will be disbursed under this subprogram untiL BOJ accredits
at least one commercial bank satisfactory to the Bank. DVCF, which has adequate
resources to carry out its operations over the next two to three years, could
be considered as a participating intermediary under the scheme at a later
stage if it needs additional resources.
6.07      Role of PIC.  PIC is currently responsible for administering the
SBFS (para. 3.14). Under the proposed project, PIC's role would be expanded
to include:
(a)  determining eligibility of loans for rediscounting (para. 6.08);
(b)  coordinating and monitoring the performance of the participating
financial intermediaries and technical assistance agencies under
the project (para. 6.26);
(c)  administering an expanded loan guarantee scheme (para. 6.09);
and
(d)  developing, in consultation with the participating banks,
a project appraisal manual, standard application form, and
subloan processing procedures acceptable to the Bank.
During negotiations it was agreed that PIC would, no later
than December 31, 1978, establish the above procedures in
consultation with the Bank.
6.08      The rediscounting facility.  Projects would be identified either
through entrepreneurs approaching the participating banks or through JIDC
promotion in certain priority sectors (Annex 4). Entrepreneurs who have
adequately prepared projects would deal only with the participating banks,
while those project proposals needing additional assistance would be aided by
JIDC. For a project needing assistance the participating bank in question
would indicate its interest in the project, and JIDC would assist the
entrepreneur and commercial bank in project preparation. JIDC's involvement
would range from a cursory review (for relatively well-prepared investment
plans) to preparing financial projections, identifying potential markets,
referring for financing and other consulting assistance, and recommending the
use of technology and purchases of specific equipment and materials.
Subsequently, the investment proposal would be presented to the participating
bank for its evaluation and after approval the loan could be referred to PIC
for rediscounting. PIC would review these projects following the criteria
agreed upon during negotiations (paras. 6.20-6.21).
6.09      The Small Businessmen's Financing Scheme.  During negotiations BOJ
agreed to modify and expand the SBFS by August 31, 1978. The revised scheme
is shown in Annex 9. BOJ would guarantee up to 50% of the loan amount against
a one-time 2% fee to be paid by the borrower. The fee will be reviewed from
time to time. The amount of the maximum guarantee per loan has been raised



- 31 -
from about US$20,000 equivalent to US$50,000 equivalent, or 50% of any loan
that could be rediscounted, whichever is smaller. There is now no restriction
regarding the interest rate to be charged by the participating banks. To
cover the potential risk and meet its operating expenses under the scheme, PIC
would need an additional capital of about J$400,000. During negotiations BOJ
agreed that it would increase PIC's capital by at least J$400,000 over a
period of two years, with at least J$150,000 being paid in 1978 and not
less than J$250,000 in 1979.
6.10      To perform the above functions, PIC would need to employ an advisor,
to be financed under the proposed loan, a project manager and one project
officer. BOJ has already appointed a project manager and has asked the Bank
to help identify the advisor. The appointment of the advisor will be a
condition of disbursement for the subprogram I (para. 6.22). Also, agreement
was reached with BOJ at negotiations that PIC would appoint an independent
auditor acceptable to the Bank. JIB, under the auspices of BOJ, would be
responsible for organizing training programs in project appraisal for officers
of participating commercial banks, which would share the local costs of these
programs. To the degree necessary foreign exchange costs of JIB's training
programs could be funded from the unallocated amount of US$250,000 under the
proposed loan. During negotiations BOJ and the Bank agreed on the nature and
timing of the proposed training program.
6.11      PIC would also have the responsibility of coordinating with the
Trade Administrator's office, which issues all import licenses. PIC will
ensure that necessary licenses for equipment and materials imports would be
made available to subborrowers for project implementation and would assist
these enterprises to continue to obtain licenses to maintain the higher levels
of production achieved with goods imported under the loan. During negotia-
tions assurances were obtained from GOJ that it would cause the Trade
Administrator to issue the necessary import licenses to the subborrowers under
the Bank loan and that in the future it would make efforts to have import
licenses granted to the subborrowers under the loan.
Subprogram II - Financing of Very Small-Scale Enterprises through SEDCO
6.12      In November 1977 GOJ established SEDCO as a wholly government-owned
company to perform credit and technical assistance functions formerly assigned
to SBLB and SIDD (see Chapter V). The proposed project includes a subprogram of
US$2 million to cover a major portion of SEDCO's foreign exchange requirement
(para. 5.14).
Subprogram III - Technical Assistance
6.13      The technical assistance programs would cost US$750,000 and would
have four facets:
(a) JIDC's promoting and assisting in the preparation of SSE
projects for financing by the participating banks, and JIDC's 2
developing consultant and technology referral and SSE extension
services; this part of the program would require about US$300,000
(of which US$50,000 in Bank financing);



- 32 -
(b) about three man-years in advisory assistance for SEDCO costing
about US$150,000;
(c) about US$50,000 for one man-year's assistance to PIC in
developing procedures and a project monitoring system; and
(d) US$250,000 to be used by PIC for training and special consultant
services, as needed.
For component (a) of the technical assistance program JIDC would need
an immediate allocation of four new positions, to perform the task described
in Annex 4. During negotiations GOJ agreed that it would provide JIDC with
funds adequate to employ four qualified staff in consultation with the Bank.
Two of the staff would be employed by December 31, 1978 and the remaining two
by June 30, 1979 (para. 4.15).
Financing Plan
6.14      The proposed loan of US$7 million would finance 100% of the project's
total foreign exchange costs, or about 60% of total project costs. The
remaining funding would be provided by the intermediaries (19%), enterprises
(19%), and GOJ (2%). Details of the financing plan for the proposed project
are summarized below (in US$ million):
Subprogram I    Subprogram II    Subprogram III    Total
World Bank                4.50             2.00               0.50           7.00

Use of Bank Funds
6.15      As stated earlier, Jamaican industry is highly dependent on imported
raw materials and therefore has been hit hard by the current import restric-
tions. While Jamaican industry is making efforts to switch increasingly
to local raw materials, this is only partly feasible and only in the medium to
long term. To have the greatest impact in terms of both increasing production
and creating jobs at relatively low marginal costs, the proposed loan
would allow financing of raw materials imports. To illustrate, a company
which is operating only one shift due to the shortage of raw materials could
operate two shifts with the additional raw materials and employ more workers
without making any new investment in fixed assets. Under the proposed project,
it is estimated that more than half of the proposed lending component of
US$6.5 million would be used for permanent working capital financing. Bank
funds would be used only for financing SSE in productive sectors which meet
the criteria agreed upon during negotiations between the Bank and GOJ (paras.
6.20-6.21). Trade financing will be prohibited.



- 33 -
Interest Rates and Foreign Exchange Risk
6.16      Under Subprogram I the interest rate for subborrowers will be tied
to the weighted commercial rate, which is calculated monthly by the Bank of
Jamaica with a lag of about two to three weeks. The rate is simply a weighted
average rate of all commercial bank loans to business concerns excluding per-
sonal, instalment and mortgage credits, as well as loans to parastatal enter-
prises. BOJ started publishing this rate in late 1975. During 1976-77 the
rate fluctuated between 13.3-14.5%. The rate is a relatively good indicator
of cost of funds to most commercial borrowers and is in line with the interest
rate structure in Jamaica (Annex 10), which is determined largely by market
forces. With the present interest rate structure, financial institutions in
Jamaica experience no problem in mobilizing local resources. During negotia-
tions it was agreed that subborrowers under the Subprogram I will be charged
a minimum interest rate of 13-1/2%, but no less than the weighted commercial
rate. The relending rate for subloans would be fixed at the beginning of each
quarter and will not be varied during the life of subloans approved during the
quarter. The rate would be calculated by using the average rate of the last
three months. Adjustments in the relending rate for new subloans will be
made only if the variation in the weighted commercial rate from the previous
quarter exceeds 0.25%. To allow an adequate spread for the participating
banks and to minimize the exposure of BOJ, commercial banks will rediscount
their loans at the BOJ at a rate of 4.5% below that charged their subborrowers
regardless of the level of the weighted commercial rate.
6.17      It was agreed during negotiations that, under Subprogram II, SEDCO
would charge no less than the prime rate with a minimum interest of 11% p.a.
SEDCO's policy statement will be amended accordingly (para. 5.11). The rate
of 11% would provide SEDCO with an overall spread of about 9%, if a weighted
average cost of the funds available to SEDCO for lending operations were
computed. This minimum rate could be considered acceptable because:
(a) it would be a substantial increase over SBLB's current 7.5%
rate; and
(b) it would exceed substantially the maximum bank deposit rate
of 7% and government bonds yield of 8%.
To keep its relending rate parallel with developments in the financial markets
SEDCO would adjust its rate upward with the movement in the prime lending rate.
6.18      During 1972-76 inflation averaged 15.9% per year, due mainly to
sharp increases in food and energy prices, and declined to 14% in 1977.
Owing to the recent devaluations totalling 68%, the inflation rate in 1978
is expected to be higher than during 1976-77. However, the proposed interest
rate schemes provide for adjustments to reflect changes in relending rates by
financial institutions caused by higher inflation rates. Given the difficulty
in forecasting the future inflation rates in Jamaica with any reasonable
accuracy, it was agreed during negotiations that the above formulas for sub=
lending interest rates for the commercial banks and SEDCO would be reviewed
and agreed upon annually between the Bank, GOJ, PIC and SEDCO during the
commitment period of the loan. In the absence of such agreement no further
commitment of Bank funds would be made.



- 34 -
6.19      During negotiations it was agreed that GOJ would onlend the proceeds
of the proposed loan to BOJ and SEDCO in local currency at the prevailing Bank
rate. GOJ will bear the exchange risk for SEDCO's subborowers without charge
but would collect a nominal fee of 1% p.a. from PIC's clients, which is
reasonable.
Project Evaluation, Free Limit and Follow-Up
6.20      Given the expected large number of small subloans (about 100 loans
under Subprogram I, and some 300 under Subprogram II), it would not be feasible
for the participating banks to carry out calculations of economic and finan-
cial rates of return. However, there is a need to ensure that Bank funds
are used to finance projects in those sectors which the government and the
Bank consider to be of high priority. The initial list of sectors eligible
for financing under the proposed project presently consists of: garments,
food processing, woodwork, footwear, light metals, building materials, toys,
and crafts. Also, the Bank will finance loans to viable small-scale building
contractors (para. 2.24). This list was agreed upon during negotiations and
would be reviewed from time to time by GOJ, BOJ, and SEDCO in consultation
with the Bank.
6.21      On the micro level the following procedures would be adopted to help
assure that subloans would be made to efficient industries:
(a)  Subprogram I.  The maximum subloan size will be US$100,000
and the free limit for PIC will be US$80,000. The Bank would
approve the first two subloans of each participating intermediary
and the aggregate free limit for all subloans under this subprogram
will not exceed US$2.25 million. Participating banks will carry
out internal financial rate of return (IFRR) calculations for all
subloans. Simplified internal economic rate of return (IERR)
calculations (in line with the Bank's "Guidelines for Calculation of
Economic Rates of Return on DFC Subprojects") will be carried out
by PIC for all projects receiving subloans above the free limit.
In addition to demonstrating their financial viability, projects
below the free limit will have to (i) be labor intensive (normally
the investment cost per job would not exceed US$10,000 equivalent);
and (ii) produce goods whose ex-factory prices will be reasonable
compared with c.i.f. prices for comparable imported goods. In cases
where c.i.f. prices for comparable imported goods are 20% below
ex-factory prices, an IERR will have to be calculated by PIC to
determine whether subloan financing can be justified. For goods
which have not been previously imported, PIC, in consultation
with the Trade Administrator, will establish their reasonable c.i.f.
prices. PIC would review subloan request submitted by the banks in
light of these criteria. Loans below US$25,000 would be submitted
to PIC in a short form that shows project eligibility. Detailed
guidelines of PIC which are prepared in consultation with the Trade
Administrator and the Bank are shown in Annex 11.



- 35 -
(b) Subprogram II. The maximum loan size will be US$20,000. Bank
approval will be required for the first 10 projects. Written
guidelines for providing a simplified procedure for evaluating
projects are being finalized by SEDCO and will be submitted
for the Bank's approval. SEDCO's guidelines are essentially a
point system which weighs heavily on the management and the
financial viability of the prospective borrower. In addition,
after sufficient experience is gained it may be possible to
develop models for projects in a few subsectors, which could
facilitate subloan evaluation.
6.22      During negotiations it was agreed that PIC, SEDCO and JIDC would
employ experienced advisors acceptable to the Bank to assist them in the
development of the appraisal capacity of both institutions. The appointment
of these advisors is a condition of disbursement for the respective subprograms.
In addition to the subloans above the free limit (this would represent about
25% of the total loan amount), the Bank would review ex-post in the field an
adequate number of subprojects to ensure that Bank funds are used to finance
only economically and financially viable projects.
Channelling of Bank Loans, Amortization Schedule, and Use of Rollover Funds
6.23      The proposed loan of US$7 million, with a fixed maturity of
17 years including four years of grace, would be made available to GOJ. GOJ
would bear the foreign exchange risk for SEDCO's borrowers without charge and
collect a nominal fee of 1% p.a. from PIC's clients. GOJ would pass on US$4.5
million to BOJ and US$2 million to SEDCO on the same terms in Jamaican dollars.
Repayment of the subloans to the GOJ will be made in Jamaican currency equiv-
alent to the foreign exchange value of the funds disbursed, calculated on the
date of disbursement by using the then prevailing exchange rate. Since the
average subloan terms of PIC and SEDCO are likely to be about five years
including two years of grace, there would be substantial rollovers of funds
within PIC and SEDCO. This is Justified on project and sector grounds, as
there is a need to build up long-term resources for the target groups.
Rollover funds would be directed to the same target groups. The final date
for subloan submission will be October 31, 1981 and the closing date will be
June 30, 1982 (see Annex 12). The allocation of the proposed loan by com-
ponents would be reviewed after two years.
Procurement and Disbursement
6.24      The goods and services required under the proposed project would
be purchased by the borrowing enterprises through local commercial channels.
Given the small size and great variety of subloans, bulking for the purpose of
carrying out competitive bidding would not be feasible. Furthermore, in
Jamaica there exists a comprehensive import licensing system which was set up
in early 1977, in response to the current balance of payments problems, to
ensure that import licenses are issued only to companies meeting the criteria
of (i) earnings or savings of foreign exchange; (ii) high local value added;
(iii) linkages with other sectors; and (iv) essential goods production. In an
attempt to increase economy and efficiency, in November 1977 the government



- 36 -
centralized importation of leather products and textiles through two locally
owned companies and a State Trading Company was established (para 2.15).
If these companies cannot provide the above raw materials in quantity, quality
and prices suitable to the enterprises the Trade Administrator would then
consider issuing import licenses, provided the above criteria are met.
Furthermore, to ensure that goods procured are of reasonable quality and
price, PIC and SEDCO would see to it that: (i) whenever feasible, borrowers
obtain and submit at least two price quotations from suppliers/contractors;
(ii) each subproject appraisal include a review of the adequacy of procurement
procedures used; and (iii) disbursements by PIC be made directly to the
suppliers/contractors. A project borrower unable to obtain import licenses
could request PIC to present his case to the Project Coordinating Committee
(PCC) for consideration (para. 6.26). If justifiable, the committee would
then make recommendations to the Trade Administrator. Similar administrative
procedures would be established for SEDCO. During negotiations GOJ, BOJ and
the Bank agreed on the above procurement procedure. GOJ also agreed that it
would make its best effort to have import licenses issued to subborowers under
the Bank loan (para. 6.11).
6.25      The Bank would disburse funds as follows:
(a) Subprogram I - 100% of foreign expenditures for goods;
50% of local expenditures for goods locally procured
and for construction costs;
(b) Subprogram II - 100% of foreign expenditures for goods;
50% of local expenditures for locally procured goods; and
/ (c)  Subprogram III - 100% of foreign expenditures for technical
assistance.
For all imported items, disbursements would be supported by standard documen-
tation, and for all local expenditures disbursements would be made under
certified statements of expenditures with the supporting documentation retained
by PIC and SEDCO and available for periodical review by Bank supervision
missions. The above disbursement percentages would result in the Bank's
financing of the equivalent of 100% of the foreign exchange component of
US$7 million of the proposed project.
Project Coordinating Committee
6.26      Coordination of the technical assistance and credit activities of
Subprogram I of the proposed project will be the responsibility of a Project
Coordinating Committee (PCC), composed of representatives of PIC, JIDC,
JNEC/JETCO, the Trade Administrator, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and
commercial banks. The committee will be appointed by BOJ and chaired by the
general manager of PIC, who would be responsible for overseeing the implemen-
tation of the entire program and reporting its progress to the Bank. This
committee will meet once every two months to review the progress of the
project and initiate necessary policy actions to expedite the implementation
of the project. PCC will consider proposals and make recommendations to



- 37 -
PIC and the agencies concerned for specific sector studies, identification of
growth areas and export potential, training of staff and employment of consul-
tants. During negotiations the scope and responsibility of the PCC was
agreed upon (Annex 13). The appointment of the committee by GOJ should be
a condition of disbursement for Subprogram I.
Benefits and Risks
6.27      The proposed project would be the first integrated SSE development
project in Jamaica designed to increase employment primarily in the urban
areas and to boost manufacturing production. The major project benefits would
be to: (i) improve the existing institutional framework for lending and pro-
viding technical assistance to SSEs; (ii) assist the recovery of the manufac-
turing sector; (iii) bring the commercial banking system into the area of term
lending to SSEs; (iv) increase the number of bankable projects in the sector;
and (v) increase productive sector employment.
6.28      Subprogram I would provide credits averaging about US$69,000 to
about 100 enterprises in the productive sectors. SEDCO is expected to make
loans averaging US$13,000 to about 300 enterprises with fixed assets below
US$20,000 equivalent. Most borrowers would be those who do not currently have
access to the existing financial institutions. It is expected that some 1,360
new jobs at an average cost of about US$8,000 per job 1/ would be created
directly, mainly by increasing the capacity utilization of existing enter-
prises; backward and forward linkages would create additional indirect jobs.
This is particularly important, given the prevailing high unemployment rate
(about 30% in 1977) in Jamaica. The employment estimate is based on a limited
sample of projects financed by DVCF and one commercial bank. Since most
enterprises are located in the urban areas, the employment impact on the urban
poor would be substantial.
6.29      The Bank would play an important institution-building role, as
SEDCO is expected to perform better than the two institutions it has replaced.
Bringing the commercial banking system into the area of lending to SSEs could
also have a significant long-term impact. The commercial banking system has
the capacity to mobilize savings from small investors and, therefore, if the
project is successful, they could expand lending to SSEs with their own funds
in the future.
6.30      Currently there is no systematic data collection on SSEs in Jamaica.
Under the proposed project, GOJ will cause its concerned agencies to carry out
a survey which will provide essential data on SSEs (para. 2.19). The proposed
project should therefore improve the knowledge of the SSE sector in Jamaica
and would enable the Bank to enter into a more meaningful dialogue on indus-
trial policies.
1/   The UPP target for Jamaica is currently about US$10,000 per new job
created.



- 38 -
6.31      Owing to the present uncertain investment climate in Jamaica and the
limited experience in lending to very small-scale enterprises, the proposed
project is somewhat riskier than the Bank's more traditional DFC lending. If
GOJ is unable to regain the confidence of the private investors, the
implementation of Subprogram I could be delayed. Also, SEDCO is a new insti-
tution and there will be a prolonged learning period to perform the difficult
task of lending to very small-scale enterprises. However, the risk would be
minimized with the proposed technical assistance program for SEDCO. Moreover,
the Bank would monitor SEDCO closely to ensure that SEDCO operates as an
independent institution with sound financial policies. A detailed monitoring
system will be devised by the advisor. On balance, the expected benefits of
the proposed project should far exceed its potential risks.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached between the Bank and GOJ
that:
(a) GOJ would use its best efforts to cause its concerned agencies
(Department of Statistics and JIDC) to carry out a manufacturing
sector survey with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank by
June 30, 1980 (para. 2.19);
(b) GOJ will transfer, by August 31, 1978, to a Special Fund of SEDCO the
assets of the SBLB (para. 3.19). GOJ will furnish J$13 million
to SEDCO over a four-year period, in accordance with a schedule
agreed to with the Bank, and the amount to be paid in by GOJ in
any year would be reduced by the net cash flow generated by the
special fund in that year (para. 5.05);
(c) SEDCO will be permitted to operate in a manner which will ensure
financial self-sufficiency and viability (para. 5.04) and will
employ and retain its staff strictly on a merit basis (para. 5.07);
(d) JIDC will establish a technical assistance unit with terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank (para. 4.15), and GOJ
will provide JIDC with funds adequate to employ, in consultation
with the Bank, four qualified persons to carry out the
function envisaged under the proposed project (para. 6.13);
(e) BOJ will develop a project appraisal manual, standard
application form and subloan processing procedures satis-
factory to the Bank by December 31, 1978 (para. 6.07). Also,
PIC and JIB will arrange training programs for commercial
banks' loan officers (para. 6.10);
(f) BOJ will increase PIC's capital with at least J$400,000 over a
period of two years with at least J$150,000 to be paid in CY78
and J$250,000 in CY79. BOJ will make necessary modifications
in the credit guarantee scheme by August 31, 1978 (para. 6.09);



- 39 -
(g) GOJ will cause the Trade Administrator to issue import licenses
to subborrowers under the Bank loan and make its best efforts to
grant needed import licenses to them in subsequent years so
that they will be able to maintain the higher levels of production
achieved as a result of borrowing Bank funds (para. 6.11);
(h) GOJ will onlend the proceeds of the proposed loan to BOJ and
SEDCO in local currency at the prevailing Bank rate. Under
Subprogram I BOJ will provide a spread of 4.5% to the
participating banks, and subborrowers in Target Group (A)
will be charged the weighted commercial rate with a floor of
13.5% p.a. plus an exchange risk fee of 1% p.a. The rate
will be fixed at the beginning of each quarter and will
not be varied for the life of subloans approved during the
quarter. The rate would be calculated by using the average
rate of the last three months. Changes in the rate for new
loans will be made only if the variation from the previous
quarter exceeds 0.25 percentage points (para. 6.16). SEDCO
will charge a minimum interest rate of 11% p.a. but no
less than the prime commercial rate (para. 6.17). The
Government will bear the exchange risk for SEDCO's clients
without a fee (para. 6.19);
(i) The interest rates and formulas determining such rates under
Subprograms I and II will be reviewed and agreed upon annually
between the Bank and GOJ during the commitment period of the
Loan. In the absence of such agreement, no further commitment
of Bank funds would be made (para. 6.18); and
(j) SEDCO and PIC will finance only projects in the priority
subsectors and projects which meet the agreed selection
criteria (paras. 6.20-6.21).
(k) SEDCO and PIC will appoint independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank (paras. 5.16 and 6.10);
7.02      The appointment of advisors for PIC and JIDC would be a condition
of disbursement of Subprogram I and the appointment of the two advisors for
SEDGO would be a condition of disbursement for Subprogram II (para. 6.22).
7.03      Before disbursement under Subprogram I, BOJ should accredit one
commercial bank acceptable to the Bank (para. 6.06), and BOJ should appoint
the Project Coordinating Committee under terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank (para 6.26).
7.04      With the agreements obtained, the proposed project constitutes
a suitable basis for a loan of US$7 million equivalent on terms and
conditions outlined in Chapter VI.

ANNEX 4
JAMAICA
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE SMALL INDUSTRY PROJECT UNIT
Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation
Background
1.        The proposed World Bank Project is based upon three key principles
of industrial development:
(a) Modern small-scale industry can contribute substantially to
economic development through increasing output and employment;
(b) Policies toward small industry should be based on a positive
developmental attitude, seeking to aid by promoting efficiency,
adaptation to prevailing conditions and growth; and
(c) An integrated program that works on a carefully selected
combination of factors simultaneously is much more likely
to be effective than a single factor development effort.
2.        JIDC will assume responsibility for implementing a Management and
Technical Assistance (MTA) program in support of the proposed project. JIDC
has been selected to implement this program because: (i) government has
assigned it primary responsibility for promoting industrial development in
Jamaica; (ii) JIDC has substantial experience in industrial promotion and
assistance; (iii) JIDC has the capacity to assist industry in a wide range
of technical areas; and (iv) improved coordination between the private and
public sectors can facilitate achievement of national industrial development
objectives.
Purpose
3.        The basic purpose of this MTA program is to promote and assist
preparation of SSI projects for financing by commercial banks involved in
the proposed project. However, a prerequisite of project preparation in some
cases will be identification and resolution of problems facing the existing
firm. JIDC's role would be to provide the businessmen with expert guidance
in preparing new investment plans, and, as needed, in improving ongoing oper-
ations with the purpose of facilitating new investment. The main categories
of JIDC services would be project appraisal, advisory services, and coordina-
tion. Each area is summarized below.
4.        Project appraisal.  The SSI projects would be of three basic types
depending on (i) the quality of project preparation, and (ii) the creditworthi-
ness of the sponsor:



- 44 -
ANNEX 4
(a) Type 1: Projects that are sufficiently well prepared and
sponsored that they can obtain financing under the project
without the need for MTA;
(b) Type 2: Projects that lack adequate preparation but have
adequate sponsorship (i.e., creditworthy sponsors with adequate
guarantees) to obtain financing; or
(c) Type 3: Projects that are adequately prepared but lack sponsor-
ship.
For Type 1 projects, JIDC services would not be needed except as a "second
opinion" that the preparation is adequate and to offer suggestions in some
instances. For most of these projects, the commercial banks and project
sponsors could arrange financing without drawing upon JIDC services. For
Type 2, the commercial banks would refer the sponsor to JIDC for identifica-
tion of his MTA needs and assistance in preparing the project. Finally, JIDC
would prepare project proposals (Type 3) in certain priority sectors (to be
identified), and would promote these projects among entrepreneurs with the
ability and resources to implement them.
5.        Advisory and extension services.  Upon request by the commercial
bank or prospective borrower, a Project Preparation and Implementation Unit
(PPIU) would diagnose problems of the firm and prepare recommendations and/or
a terms of reference for assistance in overcoming these problems. The entre-
preneur would bear the direct costs of assistance in carrying out this terms
of reference. Most of these services would be directed to firms with Type 2
projects.
6.        In addition to direct MTA services, SSI firms in Jamaica also need
reliable information and referral services to answer specific questions they
have or refer them to an appropriate source. This kind of assistance is
particularly necessary when a firm is selecting consultants or auditors, and
when the firm is selecting machinery and materials. JIDC would assume respon-
sibility for developing these consultant and technology referral services.
Besides meeting a real need of SSI, the availability of these services would
permit JIDC to maintain its role as an advisor to businesses by referring
clients to consultants when detailed work in a particular area is needed.
7.        Coordination.  A number of institutions (e.g., Bureau of Standards,
Scientific Research Council, Jamaica Institute of Management, Jamaica National
Export Corporation) have substantial capability for servicing industry, but
very little of these services has been directed to SSI. Also, coordination
among the major institutions providing services to industry has been weak.
Under this project, JIDC would take the lead in fostering coordination of the
institutions.

ANNEX 4
Overall Structure
8.        Staffing.  In order to carry out its role under the proposed project,
JIDC would create a Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU). The
minimum staffing of this unit would be one manager/coordinator and three indus-
trial promoters with skills in fields such as engineering, accounting, market-
ing, purchasing, and financial analysis. The emphasis would be on hiring
technical specialists with a broad knowledge of their field and experience in
dealing with SSI. Additionally, the unit would be assisted by an expert
adviser during its first year of operation (separate terms of reference).
This core group of four persons in the PPIU would work only on tasks related
to the proposed project's target group and identified below. JIDC could supply
additional staff to the PPIU to undertake these tasks for clients other than
those in the proposed project's target group, but in any case would not expand
the functions of the PPIU beyond those described below except as JIDC and the
Bank should agree.
9.        The head of the unit would report to the Managing Director.  Special
efforts would be made to ensure close coordination between the PPIU and other
units within the JIDC. Each six months, PPIU would prepare a manpower assis-
tance request indicating the number of man/days of assistance it would need
from other JIDC units, to be approved by the Managing Director of JIDC.
10.       Although the PPIU would be a regular operating unit within JIDC,
its special relationship to the proposed small industry project would be recog-
nized. The project management unit would be located in PIC of BOJ, and would
manage the project and ensure proper coordination of project entities. Project
coordination would be facilitated by the Project Coordinating Committee,
chaired by PIC and having a representative from JIDC. Every six months, the
PPIU would prepare an operating plan detailing its planned services to the
proposed project and submit this document for review and comment by PCC and
subsequent approval by PIC and the World Bank. This plan would then become
the basis for directing the activities of the PPIU for that six-month period.
JIDC's management would supervise PPIU's implementation of this plan, receiv-
ing progress reports from PIC as needed and ensuring that the goals of the
plan are met.
11.       Services to Type 1 Projects.  Type I projects will typically be
those that are undertaken by an entrepreneur experienced in manufacturing that
product and considered creditworthy by the commercial banks. These projects
would generally involve expansions of existing production lines of a success-
ful firm. Since the entrepreneur is already experienced in producing the
product and has established markets and adequate financial controls, little
assistance from PPIU would be needed. However, PPIU would review the invest-
ment plan as a check on the quality of the preparation, and make suggestions
as necessary.



- 46 -
ANNEX 4
12.       These projects would be designated as Type I by the commercial bank
referring the client to PPIU. From the Bank's point of view, this designation
would mean that the commercial bank project unit is prepared to make a favor-
able recommendation on the loan, but would like PPIU's opinion in the tech-
nical areas.
13.       Services to Type 2 Projects.  Most projects would fall into this
category, meaning that the project sponsor is generally considered creditworthy
by the commercial banks but the proposed investment plan is not adequately
prepared. PPIU would begin by reviewing the operations of the existing firm,
if any, in order to identify existing problems. PPIU would make recommenda-
tions for solving major existing problems, and would refer the entrepreneur
as needed to public or private entities that could provide the services and
expertise he needs. If PPIU is requested to provide intensive services, it
would charge the entrepreneur a fee intended to recover direct costs. At this
point, PPIU would determine, in conjunction with the commercial bank, whether
further project processing should await resolution of existing problems. In
cases where existing problems raise serious doubts about the health of the
firm or advisability of the proposed project, processing would be delayed.
14.       Subsequently, PPIU would review the proposed project to assess
whether inadequacies are in the areas of financial analysis, market/input
analysis, production design, or economic analysis. In light of this review,
PPIU would assign an appropriate team of experts to work with the investment
plan. This team would identify specific inadequacies in each area and recom-
mend to the entrepreneur how these weaknesses can be overcome. To the extent
possible, the team would avoid doing extensive preparation work itself but
would either show the entrepreneur how to do the additional preparation work
required or refer him to another group that could provide the needed assis-
tance. In cases where PPIU became involved in the detailed preparation work,
the entrepreneur would be charged a fee intended to recover the direct costs
of these services.
15.       Services to Type 3 Projects.  In most cases, Type 3 investment
proposals would be prepared by PPIU and promoted among qualified potential
sponsors. PPIU would prepare model investment plans in such sectors as
garments, furniture, shoes, and leather products, and promote these projects
among current entrepreneurs in these fields. In some instances, other agen-
cies such as JETCO or the National Institute of Craft would prepare investment
proposals for certain industries, and PPIU would promote these. Close coor-
dination with the commercial banks would be necessary to ensure that project
sponsorship is solicited only from creditworthy sponsors.
16.       Technology referral services.  PPIU would develop a technology
referral service to advise SSI on the selection of machinery and materials.
Except in rare cases, PPIU would draw on available sources of information of
this kind from the Chamber of Commerce and suppliers, and avoid doing the
original research. PPIU would establish relationships with suppliers in
Jamaica and other countries, and investigate the possibility of obtaining



- 47 -
ANNEX 4
discounts for their clients. For priority sectors, PPIU would make available
to entrepreneurs lists of available equipment and prices for the equipment
from various suppliers. Also, PPIU would maintain a listing of used machinery
for sale and make this information available to its clients.
17.       Consultant referral service.  PPIU would maintain a consultant
register that would list all private or public groups, including accounting
firms, that were interested in providing services to SSI. This register would
include an assessment by previous SSI clients of the work of each group. Upon
request, PPIU could make recommendations for using specific consultants, but
would avoid doing this in most cases. Funds paid to PPIU for services would
be used only by PPIU to procure additional manpower to aid in carrying out
duties under this terms of reference.
18.       Supervision.  During implementation, commercial banks would monitor
projects to ensure that the investment is carried out according to plan, call-
ing on PPIU to provide guidance to the project as necessary and/or to design
technical assistance programs for the firm. Subsequently, PPIU would visit
the firm within a year after implementation to assess the success of the
project and determine if additional MTA is needed.
19.       Other activities.  The director of PPIU will be a member of the
Project Coordinating Committee. He will also be charged with (i) preparing
six-month work plans, (ii) assigning teams to work on individual projects,
(iii) coordinating and strengthening relations with other project entities,
particularly the commercial banks and institutions that could provide services
to SSI, and (iv) establishing work priorities. In all cases, work on indivi-
dual projects would take priority over developing the referral services or
general SSI assistance efforts, with Type 1 projects having priority over
Type 2, and Type 2 over Type 3. Time permitting, the PPIU would also assist
in SSI policy work such as making recommendations for a SSI data collection
system, policy measures to support SSI, and laws that support SSI development.
20.       The six-month plan prepared by PPIU would also evaluate its perfor-
mance during the previous six-month period, taking into account the previous
plan. The most important criterion will be PPIU's success in dealing with
Type 1 and Type 2 projects, as judged by (i) the number of projects of each
type that receive financing and (ii) the lag time between referral of the
project to PPIU and the termination of PPIU's preparation. Additional criteria
of success in order of importance are:
(a) feedback from other project entities, especially commercial
banks, on the responsiveness and quality of PPIU's work;
(b)  feedback from clients;
(c) number of Type 3 projects financed; and
(d) goals achieved for the referral services.

21.       The salaries above include perquisites.  The US$300,000 cost of this
program represents about 5% of the total amount of loans expected under the
SSE project. This is the maximum level of publicly funded services that the
project's clients should receive, so the PPIU would charge clients for any
additional services. Accordingly, additional funds raised by PPIU through
user charges would be used by PPIU to contract additional assistance in carry-
ing out its duties under the proposed project.
22.       The Bank would disburse against 100% of the expert year.  Initially,
this plan assumes four professionals per year for three years, but, with the
approval of the government and Bank, the number of staff hired per year could
be changed during the course of the project. The government would hire four
local professionals in consultation with the Bank. The Bank would approve
the expert.
24.       Either the Bank, PPIU, or PIC may propose modifications to these
terms of reference, with acceptance of the modifications requiring approval
of all three.

SMALL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
Statement of Policies and Procedures
The Small Enterprises Development Corporation Limited will carry
on its business in accordance with the following policies:
THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CORPORATION
SEDCO shall promote and assist in the establishment and development
of small productive enterprises in Jamaica. To this end, SEDCO will:
(a) provide loans for the development of small industries,
artisan and other viable economic activities;
(b) provide technical and management services for the purpose
of promoting small scale enterprises;
(c) provide purchasing and marketing facilities and;
(d) administer such special funds as may from time to time
be placed at its disposal.
A.   GENERAL POLICIES
1.   SEDCO shall undertake its activities within the framework
of the Government's economic policies.
2.   SEDCO shall concentrate its efforts on small scale
enterprises. Assistance shall be furnished to existing
enterprises as well as new enterprises whose net fixed
assets (excluding land and buildings) do not exceed
J$25,000. Technical assistance will be given to SEDCO
borrowers regardless of size. A relationship should be
established between the fixed assets and loan ceilings
so that borrower does not fall outside SEDCO's clientele.
3.   Projects assisted by SEDCO may be undertaken by individuals
or legal entities, including enterprises organized as
associations such as co-operatives, community enterprises
and workers enterprises.
4.   SEDCO shall undertake other developmental activities
which are complementary to the provision of financial
assistance in order to facilitate balanced development
of the sector. Such activities shall be subject to the
availability of funds and to the priorities that are
accorded to various programs.



- 52 -
ANNEX 7
5.   SEDCO shall promote the development and use of indigenous
technology.
6.   SEDCO shall not confine its assistance to projects submitted
to it but shall identify and promote, directly or indirectly,
the development of existing or new firms when they are of
significant benefit to Jamaica.
7.   SEDCO shall collaborate with Government agencies, public and
private organizations in framing development plans for the
small scale industrial sector and shall ensure a continuing
framework of communication between organs of the public
and private sectors.
8.   SEDCO shall provide decision making agencies with information
and criteria, to enable the formulation and implementation of
plans, programs, projects and policies affecting the sector
to be consistent and effectively co-ordinated.
B.   CREDIT AND INVESTMENT POLICIES
1.   The following transactions may be financed by SEDCO.
(a) The purchase and/or installation of machinery
and equipment.
(b) The purchase, construction, reconstruction, addition
or expansion of industrial buildings and the instal-
lation of services.
(c) The investments needed to maintain or expand production
levels through the financing of working capital.
(d) SEDCO may not normally finance more than 75% of the
project costs of an enterprise except when the credit-
worthiness justifies this.
(e) SEDCO will not lend more than 10% of its equity to any
one firm or group of firms.
(f) For both new and existing enterprises SEDCO will not
normally provide financing which will raise the debt/
equity ratio of the client above 3 to 1.
(g) Contracting for technical assistance and the preparation
of feasibility, organization or market studies, accounting
services and training programs for managers and workers.



ANNEX 7
2.   In appraising projects the following criteria will be considered.
(a) Profitability.
(b) Provision of employment and utilization of under-
utilized productive resources.
(c) Contribution to the training of workers and managers
and the provision of adequate working conditions.
(d)  Contribution to the use of local raw materials.
(e) Contribution to industrial decentralization and
regional economic development.
(f) Contribution of Foreign Exchange earnings or
savings.
(g) In all cases, the corporation shall be reasonably
satisfied that the applicant will have a continuing
commitment to the business enterprise and that the
likelihood of timely loan repayment will be reason-
ably assured.
3.   In project appraisals, an effort will be made to find the
optimum relationship between the planning horizon, amorti-
zation term, period of grace, interest rate, and fund
availability and level of indebtedness of the applicant
firm, so that the nature of the financing may ensure, as
far as can be foreseen, the success of each project.
4.   The maximum loan size will be $40,000.
5.   Loan periods should be established such that proceeds
from the project can be reasonably expected to cover
the amortization of the loan.
6.   SEDCO will not provide project loans to full time employees
or to enterprises controlled by them. SEDCO may however grant
loans to Directors or part time employees subject to special
procedural action aimed at ensuring the observation of
organizational and personal integrity determined by SEDCO's
Board from time to time.
7.   In order to analyze the impact of its operations and to
evaluate the extent to which the objectives and goals set
are being achieved, the management shall submit quarterly
to the Board of Directors detailed studies of its operations
carried out in the immediately preceding quarter.



- 54 -
ANNEX 7
8.   Whenever the financial and managerial situation of an enter-
prise so warrants, SEDCO shall make the grant of its loans
subject to action by the enterprise to obtain effective
technical assistance services. To this end, SEDCO shall
determine the technical assistance requirements of its
clients and shall provide such assistance whenever necessary.
9.   Except under special circumstances, SEDCO shall not grant
loans for the purpose of refinancing projects.
10.   SEDCO will seek adequate security for its lending such as
mortgages, promissory notes and guarantees. The kind and
amount of security required will depend on the nature of
the assets, the standing of the guarantor/s and the
viability of the project.
C.   FINANCIAL POLICIES
1.   It will be the general aim of SEDCO's financial policy to
maintain the value of its capital, and manage its funds
in such a way that it is able to achieve a profit margin
on its financial operations. Technical Assistance costs
that cannot be covered through the margins on onlending
must be financed from other sources.
2.   SEDCO shall establish adequate reserves to cover any
possible portfolio losses and shall periodically review and
update such reserves to cover losses on its operations.
3.   In order to increase the funds available for credit and
cover its various needs for financing the enterprises it
serves, SEDCO shall make every effort to raise the
resources it requires.
4.   SEDCO shall not contract, assume or guarantee any debt if,
as a result of such operation, the total indebtedness
contracted, assumed or guaranteed by SEDCO exceeds an
amount equal to four (4) times its net worth. The
maturity dates of the assets of SEDCO shall correspond
with those of its liabilities or shall be earlier than
those of the latter.
5.   SEDCO will charge no less than the prime lending rate with
a minimum interest rate of 11% p.a.



- 55 -
ANNEX 7
6.   Overdue payments will attract special charges as shall
be determined by the Board from time to time.
7.   An Income Statement, balance sheet and a summary of
operations on accounts shall be prepared and submitted
to the Baord quarterly.
D.   CREDIT SUPERVISION POLICY
1.   SEDCO shall take such action as is necessary to ensure
the proper use of the funds loaned and supervise the
implementation of the projects it finances in light of
its programming.
2.   SEDCO shall forumulate and regularly implement programs
for the supervision and follow-up of projects and
enterprises that have received its financial assistance.
3.   SEDCO shall supervise credit operations from the time
a loan is made and shall monitor the implementation
of the projects it finances throughout the loan
amortization period. SEDCO shall retain the right to
call in an existing obligation if an enterprise fails
to meet the conditions and commitments agreed upon.
Collection of its portfolio outstanding in a timely
fashion will be given the highest priority by the
management and staff of SEDCO. Loans will be re-
scheduled only in cases where it is adjudged that re-
scheduling is clearly necessary for the firm and will
substantially assist the eventual collection of the loan.
4.   In order to ensure that the best possible use is made
of its resources, SEDCO, in addition to monitoring the
performance and implementation of projects it lends to,
may request modifications and improvements in their
accounting systems, inspect their operations and review
their accounts, and may call for any information it needs
in order to determine the status of such operations and
their financial position.
5.   The management of SEDCO shall cause to be presented to
the Board of Directors a statement of all loans dis-
bursed monthly for the Board's approval.
E.   TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE POLICIES
1.   Specifically SEDCO shall undertake technical assistance
programs to provide enterprises with the know-how and
techniques that will enable enterprises to (a) develop



- 56 -
ANNEX 7
effective systems of raw materials procurement and marketing,
financial management and accounting control; (b) adopt more
efficient production and management methods; and (c) develop
maintenance programs and effect simple repairs of machinery
and equipment.
2.   SEDCO shall complement its lending functions with adequate
management and technical assistance for the purpose of im-
proving efficiency in the Small Business Sector.
3.   In its technical assistance programs SEDCO shall seek
support from other bodies such as universities, State
enterprises, outside consultants, private sector organi-
zations, foreign or Jamaican experts and trade associations.
F.   BULK PURCHASING AND MARKETING POLICIES
1.   SEDCO shall initiate directly or indirectly purchasing and
marketing policies designed to establish, encourage, develop
and operate Bulk Purchasing and Marketing Subsidiaries.
The identification of sources of raw materials, purchase
and resale of the same and the purchasing, warehousing and
marketing of financed or manufactured goods on behalf of
small business enterprises shall constitute the main
functions of the subsidiaries.
2.   In the discharge of the above functions, SEDCO shall operate
or seek to operate directly or indirectly a Purchasing and
Marketing Agency for the procurement of raw materials for
resale and the collection, warehousing and marketing of
finished goods on behalf of small businesses.
The provision of funds for such enterprises will be provided
initially by way of budgetary allocation from the Government
of Jamaica and or by bequests from international agencies.
3.   The bulk purchasing and marketing subsidiaries shall be
operated on strict commercial lines, self perpetuating
and economically viable.
4.   Direction and control of subsidiaries so established shall
be the concern of the management appointed by the Board of
SEDCO in conformity with the Companies Law and other rules
and regulations applicable to companies operating within
Jamaica.



ANNEX 7
5.   The purchasing, marketing, financial accounting and admin-
istrative policies of the subsidiaries shall be subject to
approval of the Board of SEDCO, and the operational activities
shall be ratified by the Board of SEDCO.
6.   The Management of the Subsidiaries shall submit monthly to the
Board of SEDCO a technical and financial statement on their
operations.
7.   Auditing of the accounts of the subsidiaries shall be under-
taken, annually, by external auditors appointed by the
management of the subsidiary and presented to the Board of
SEDCO within three months of the close of the financial year
preceding.
G.   MANAGEMENT POLICIES
1.   The Management of SEDCO shall formulate management procedures
and guidelines with a view to applying maximum efficiency in
the provision of its operations and services.
2.   Operating costs shall be kept to the minimum necessary in the
light of the range of SEDCO's activities and the volume and
quality of its operations.
3.   SEDCO shall take such measures as are necessary to exercise
control over:
(a) the observance of operational and legal guidelines
and procedures;
(b) the efficiency of such procedures and the reliability
and propriety of accounts;
(c) the management of its assets and the utilization of its
funds;
(d) maintenance of adequate control of its payroll.
The Management shall ensure a continuing evaluation of the
effectiveness and reliability of the internal auditing
procedures of SEDCO and provide for timely audits to protect
SEDCO's assets.
4.   SEDCO shall engage independent external auditors of established
status to make a periodic audit of its books and accounts. The
Annual Audit shall be made available for public scrutiny.



- 58 -
ANNEX 7
5.   The Corporation shall maintain an adequate system of staff
recruitment, personnel incentives, training and overall
personnel development policies in keeping with its needs.
6.   SEDCO shall establish a decentralized administration through
Regional offices, and Regional Advisory Councils in each
designated region.
OTHER
1.   From time to time, the management of SEDCO shall issue
specific guidelines and/or manuals to interpret and
implement the Declaration of Policies. In cases where
there may be an apparent conflict between the Declaration
and the guidelines, the Board shall review the situation
and ensure that all conflicts are resolved.

Premier Investment Corporation
SMALL BUSINESSMEN'S FINANCING SCHEME
GENERAL
1.   Under a scheme established by the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ), the commercial
banks are encouraged by a guarantee provided by the Premier Investment
Corporation (a subsidiary of BOJ) to make intermediate term loans to
small business enterprises.
2.   This scheme has now been amended and expanded due to participation by
the World Bank through a revolving line of credit. The expansion of the
scheme now makes it possible for long term loans to be made. This scheme
will replace the previous scheme upon its approval by Bank of Jamaica's
Board.
3.   Each loan application is required to be made on the prescribed form,
a specimen of which is attached as appendix (1).
PURPOSE OF LOAN
4.   (a)  Loans may be made for the following purposes only:
(i) the purchase, installation, renovation, improvement
or modernization of equipment of a kind usually
affixed to real or immovable property;
(ii)  the purchase, renovation, improvement or modernization
of equipment of a kind not usually affixed to real or
immovable property;
(iii)  the renovation, improvement or modernization of premises
or the purchase, construction, alteration or extension
of premises;
(iv) Working capital.
(b)  With respect to paragraphs (a) (i), (iii) and (iv), subject to
the terms and conditions applicable to the loan class being met,
loans may be granted prior to the actual start of business
operations.
Note:     In the case of loans where the applicant is required, among other
things, to be the tenant of the premises under a lease, a right
of tenancy could only apply to a tenant in possession of premises
which are already in existence. Not until this situation exists
can an applicant be considered to have "acquired" premises. An
agreement to rent premises for future use, even though supported
by a post-dated lease, does not for purposes of the scheme
constitute acquisition.



- 64 -                         Annex 9
QUALIFICATIONS OF THE BORROWER
5.   (a)  The borrower, in addition to meeting the specific requirements
in respect of each class of loan (details of which will be found
under the heading for each loan class) must be the proprietor of
a business enterprise in respect of which the estimated net
fixed assets are not more than Jamaican equivalent of US$100,000.
This limit will be adjusted from time to time by Premier Invest-
ment Corporation in consultation with the World Bank to reflect
the cost escalations in Jamaica.
(b) The Age of Majority recognized for purposes of this scheme is
that stipulated in current laws of Jamaica concerned.
DEFINITION OF PROPRIETOR
6.   The proprietor is the person, corporation or partnership by whom the
enterprise is carried on whether as a sole proprietor or in association
with another person, corporation or partnership having a proprietary
interest therein. This does not include a "holding" company.
DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE
7.   "Business enterprise" means an enterprise carried on in Jamaica for gain
or profit where the principal business carried on therein comes within
any of the following classes:
(a) Mnufacturing;
(b) Service Business;
(c) Construction;
(d)  Agroindustries;
(e) Transportation;
8.   Specifically excluded from the definition are:
(a) Accounting, auditing, medical, dental, legal and other
professions recognized as such;
(b) A business having as its object the furtherance of a charitable
or religious purpose;
(c) Finance, insurance and real estate business;
(d) Holding companies;
(e) Wholesale trade;
(f) Retail trade.



- 65 -                        Annex 9
WHO MAY BORROW
9.   A proprietor, as defined herein, who is:
(a) an owner of the premises or land to which the equipment described
in the application is affixed or on which such equipment is placed
or is to be placed; or
(b) a tenant, under a lease whereby the tenant has a right to tenancy
for a term of 5 years certain with an option to renew, where the
loan is to finance improvements or attachments to leasehold
property. In cases where the loan is for working capital or for
the purchase of movable equipment, the lease would not be
obligatory.
TERM AND CONDITIONS OF LOANS
10. The maximum term available with respect to the various qategories of
loans will be as follows:-
Movable Equipment - New, 3 years; Used, 2 years with quarterly instalments.
Fixed Equipment   - New, maximum 10 years; Used, maximum 4 years with
quarterly instalments.
Working Capital   - Maximum 5 years with quarterly instalments.
A moratorium of principal repayment up to 2 years before the first payment
is due if allowable, if appropriate, in all categories.
Long term debt/equity ratio:  The ratio of any project should not normally
exceed 3:1 after receiving the loan.
SECURITY
11. Security for loans made under the scheme is to be taken at the time the
loan is made by way of:
For Fixed Equipment Loans
(a) A first charge on the equipment purchased.
(b) Where the first charge on the equipment will not be sufficient
security due to the fact that upon any attempt to realize on
the security, the equipment would be considered to form part
of the real or immovable property, additional security shall
be taken in form required for premises loans.



- 66 -                        Annex 9
(c) Where in the opinion of the Manager the foregoing security does
not adequately secure the loan such other additional security
may be taken at the time the loan is made as the Manager considers
appropriate in the circumstances, having regard to the net worth
of the borrower, the kind of business enterprise carried on, and
any special circumstances such as the nature of the equipment
purchased, including its rate of depreciation and the use to which
it will be put. Such other security may include:
(i) An assignment of the rights and interest of a purchaser
(not vendor) under an agreement for sale or under a
conditional sales contract or any other personal or
movable property of the proprietor; or
(ii) Security by way of stocks, bonds, life insurance (see
note 1) endorsements and/or guarantee (see note 2)
which may be supported by a mortgage, hypothecation or
assignment of the kind described in sub-paragraph (1).
NOTE 1    While fire insurance and term life assurance may be taken in support
of other security, loans may not be made solely on the basis of such
insurance since neither fire insurance nor term life insurance can
be considered security for the repayment of a loan.
NOTE 2    Where the applicant is a partnership or business operating under a
trade name, the personal guarantee and/or endorsement of any member
of the applicant partnership is NOT to be taken as other security.
A third party guarantee and/or endorsement is acceptable as prescribed
security only when the guarantor and/or endorser is not a partner in
the applicant partnership or where the applicant business is a
limited or incorporated company.
For Movable Equipment Loans
(a) A first charge on the equipment purchased.
For Premises Loans
(a) A land mortgage on the land and premises owned by a proprietor
and used in connection with the business enterprise, which are
to be improved or renovated, or in respect of which equipment
purchased with the loan proceeds is to be affixed.
For Working Capital Loans
(a) The application should be supported by cash flows and other
statements indicating the viability or otherwise of the business.
(b) Loans may be granted on an unsecured basis; however, the Manager
should endeavour to obtain any security that is available,
for example:-



- 67 -                        Annex 9
(i) An assignment of the rights and interest of a purchaser
(not vendor) under an agreement for sale or under a
conditional sales contract or any other personal or
movable property of the proprietor; or
(ii) Security by way of stocks, bonds, life insurance, endorse-
ments and/or guarantees which may be supported by a
mortgage, hypothecation or assignment of the kind described
in sub-paragraph (i) above.
LEGAL FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS
12. All expenses, including legal fees and disbursements incurred in
connection with providing security and renewals thereof, are for the
borrower's account and his promise to pay such amounts is contained
in the Application Form.
ADDITIONAL SECURITY
13. At any time after the loan has been made, additional security which in
the opinion of the Manager is necessary or desirable may be taken.
14. Security in any form which is considered appropriate may be taken, in-
cluding any security which could have been taken at the time the loan
was made.
AMOUNT OF LOAN - MAXIMUM
15. The maximum loan which may be granted is the Jamaican equivalent of
US$100,000. This limit will be adjusted from time to time by Premier
Investment Corporation in consultation with the World Bank.
16. As one of the main objectives of this scheme is to encourage commercial
banks to provide term loans to small enterprises and thus promote the
overall involvement of the banks with the SSE sector intermediaries
would be required to participate in the financing of projects as follows:
(a)  Existing enterprises                           Project costs
(%)
BOJ - World Bank                                   65
Intermediaries                                     25
Enterprises                                        10
100
(b) New enterprises
BOJ - World Bank                                   50
Intermediaries                                     25
Enterprises                                        25
100



- 68-                           Annex 9
PROCUREMENTS
The participating banks would ensure that the proceeds of its loan
are used with due attention to economy and efficiency, in line with
the detailed procedures to be issued by Premier Investment Corporation.
Under the World Bank credit line, goods and services could only be
procured from its member countries and Switzerland.
DISBURSEMENT OF LOAN FUNDS
17.  The document on which loans will be dispursed is the loan proposal
document. This document will be prepared either by the applicant's
commercial bank or upon request by the applicant by the project unit of
the JIDC. Where the proposal is first prepared by the JIDC it will then
be passed to the applicants commercial bank for consideration and
evaluation. Loans approvals must confirm substantially to the guide-
lines set out in the project appraisal manual prepared and circulated by
Premier Investment Corporation.
RECEIPT REQUIREMENTS
18.  Receipts or paid cheques are required as evidence that the borrower has
paid to the seller of equipment or to the contractor in respect of a
contract for improvements to the premises, the full purchase or contract
price thereof and the borrower, in the Application Form promises to
furnish such receipts. At the time a claim under the guarantee is made
the bank will be required to produce receipts showing that the proceeds
of the loan were used for the purpose for which they were obtained.
19.  Receipts should have sufficient information on them to relate them to the
purchase or project in question and care should be taken to ensure that
they are genuine. It is preferable to open a current account for the
proceeds of the loan and scrutinize the application. Where cheques are
used as receipts, the purpose for which they originate should be indicated
thereon and also a notation in the handwriting of vendor clearly indicating
what they cover.
20.  The receipts or cancelled cheques may be retained with non-negotiable
collateral security but may be filed elsewhere provided they will be
readily available should a claim become necessary under the guarantee.
When the loan is repaid in full, return the receipts to the borrower.
REVISION OF TERMS
What if borrowers wish to accelerate repayments?
21.  In any case where the terms of repayment are being revised the approval
of the Premier Investment Corporation is required. Re-scheduling of
loans would be considered by Premier Investment Corporation only on an
exceptional basis.



-69 -                         Annex 9
DEFAULT PROCEDURE
22.  Where the borrower is in default in respect of any payment, the entire
amount of the principal balance outstanding on the loan shall, at the
option of the bank, thereupon become due and payable. This option is
to be exercised by forwarding to the borrower advice in writing, if
necessary by registered mail, to the effect that his loan is being
declared due and payable.
23.  Where the borrower is in default and the principal balance outstanding
becomes due and payable, either in accordance with the foregoing para-
graphs or otherwise, the Premier Investment Corporation should be
notified and at the same time provided with the recommendation of the
Manager as to the action to be taken to:
(a) Effect collection of the balance owing on the loan;
(b) Obtain additional security;
(c) Dispose of or realize on any security held in respect of the loan; or
(d) Effect any compromise or grant any concession to any person other
than the borrower.
CLAIMS
24.  It is expected that all reasonable effort will be made to collect loans
before claims are submitted, in order that there will be no doubt as to
whether a loss has been established. This includes realizing on all the
security held in respect of the loan.
25.  Subject to the foregoing a claim for loss may be submitted to the
Premier Investment Corporation any time after 90 days from the date
the loan became due and payable in full.
26.  The claim may consist of:
(a) The unpaid principal amount of the loan;
(b) The uncollected earned interest outstanding on the loan at the
time the claim is approved for payment by the Corporation;
(c) Uncollected premiums for insurance;
(d) Uncollected taxed or taxable costs and any disbursements for
or incidental to legal or other proceedings;
(e) Legal fees, costs and disbursements actually incurred by the
commercial bank whether with or without litigation in
collecting or endeavouring to collect outstanding loans or
in protecting the interest of the Corporation.



- 70 -                         Annex 9
27. Claims are to be submited through the Head Office of the commercial bank.
RECOVERIES
28. After a claim has been paid by the Corporation, the bank, acting on
behalf of the Corporation is required to take such steps as may be
considered necessary to collect the principal and interest owing by
the borrower and to realize upon any security provided.
29. All expenses incurred by the bank in this connection are recoverable
from the Corporation. The Corporation requires evidence of the payment
of these expenses and it is therefore important to obtain proper receipts
for all expenses incurred. These may be debited to Charge Account, pend-
ing receipt of payment.
30. Any amounts recovered should be remitted to the Corporation and any claims
for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the bank on behalf of the
Corporation, should be made at the same time.
MISREPRESENTATION AND MISUSE OF LOAN PROCEEDS
31. If it is discovered that an application for a business improvement loan
contains a false material statement or that a borrower has used or is
using the proceeds of the loan for a purpose other than the purpose speci-
fied in the application, immediately report the circumstances to the Head
Office, but take no action without the prior approval of the Head Office.
It cannot be exphasized too strongly the importance of obtaining proper
receipts, which in the final analysis, is the main control on the use of
the loan proceeds. Consequently, a clear understanding with the borrower
regarding the production of adequate receipts is essential before the loan
is made.
32. In due course when the circumstances are reported by the Head Office to
the Corporation, additional action may be required to be taken on behalf
of the Corporation.
REPORTING PROCEDURES
33. Each commercial bank shall submit a copy for the monthly report in a
prescribed format by the bank for each branch, completed as to the recap
of loans together with loans made since last report. In connection with
loans made since last report, as itemized on the return, each commercial
bank will attach to this monthly return copies of individual application
forms requesting the accounts itemized.
34. All returns and supporting copies of individual applications for loans
granted during the month are to be submitted to Premier Investment
Corporation Limited by the Head Office of the respective bank.
GUARANTEE
35. Premier Investment Corporation Limited may guarantee to the extent of
US$50,000 equivalent, or 50% of the individual project loan whichever is
smaller for a one time fee of 2% of the amount guaranteed.

Corporation Limited by the Head Office of the respective bank.
GUARANTEE
35. Premier Investment Corporation Limited may guarantee to the extent of
50% of the individual project loan for a one time fee of 2% of the
amount guaranteed.

ANNEX 11
JAMAICA
PREMIER INVESTMENT CORPORATION
Guidelines for Project Appraisal
1)   INTRODUCTION
Small-scale enterprises have in the past found difficulty in
procuring financing from financial institutions for a number
of reasons. Chief among these are the high failure of small
businesses and the inability or reluctance of the proprietors
to provide data which financial institutions may analyse to
determine the credit risk involved.
In order to assist small businessmen to overcome these
problems, a scheme was established by the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ)
whereby commercial banks have been encouraged through a
guarantee provided to the banks by Premier Investment
Corporation Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of BOJ, to
make intermediate and short-term loans to small business
enterprises.
2)   WORLD BANK PARTICIPATION
The Scheme has now been expanded with the provision of
a revolving line of Credit from the World Bank and other
sources. This line of Credit will be used to finance the
foreign exchange content of the proposed projects. It has
been estimated that foreign exchange content will not be in
excess of 65% of the total cost of the project. The foreign
exchange content will be financed one hundred per cent.
3)   COMMERCIAL BANK PARTICIPATION
The participating commercial banks will receive all
applications for loans which will be approved on the follow-
ing basis:
i)   projects comprising loans up to US$25,000 equivalent
will be processed and approved by the commercial banks
and passed on to Premier Investment Corporation for
review on a no objection basis.
ii)   applications for loans in excess of US$25,000 equivalent
but under US$80,000 equivalent will be processed by
the commercial banks and forwarded to Premier Investment
Corporation with a recommendation for final approval.
iii)   applications involving loans in excess of US$80,000
equivalent will be passed by Premier Investment
Corporation to the World Bank for final authorization.



- 74~ -ANNEX 11
iv)   the balance of 35% will be contributed by the
commercial bank and the applicant.
v)   the banks are to ensure that the long term debt/equity
ratio of any enterprise being financed may not normally
exceed 3:1 after the loan has been approved. Long term
debt is defined as a debt with term exceeding one year.
4)   CATEGORIES OF INDUSTRY WHICH MAY BORROW
The following classes of business will be eligible to
borrow under the Scheme with World Bank participation:
a)   projects in the priority section presently consisting
of:-
i) garments
ii)  food processing
iii)  woodwork
iv)  footwear
v) light metals
vi)  building materials
vii)  toys
viii)  construction
xi)  and projects in other categories which would be
considered on a case by case basis.
Specifically excluded from the list are:
i) accounting, auditing, medical, dental, legal and other
professions recognized as such;
ii)  a business having as its object the furtherance of a
charitable or religious purpose;
iii)  finance, insurance and real estate business; or
iv)  holding companies
v) communication
vi)  wholesale trade
vii)  retail trade
viii)  transportation
b)   the borrower, in addition to meeting the specific require-
ments in respect of each class of loan must be the pro-
prietor of a business enterprise in respect of which net
fixed assets (excluding land and building) does not ex-
ceed Jamaica equivalent of US$100,000.
c)   The Age Majority recognized for purpose of this Scheme is
that stipulated in current laws of Jamaica concerned.



-75 -                         ANNEX 11
5)   PURPOSES FOR WHICH LOAN FUNDS MAY BE USED
a)   Loans may be made for the following purposes:
i)  purchase, installation, renovation, improvement or
modernization of equipment of a kind usually affixed
to real or immovable property;
ii) the purchase, renovation, improvement or modernization
of equipment of a kind not usually affixed to real or
immovable property;
iii) the renovation, improvement or modernization of
premises or the purchase, construction, alteration or
extension of premises;
iv) working capital
b)   with respect to paragraph (a) i); iii) and iv) subject to
the terms and conditions applicable to the loan class being
met, loans may be granted prior to the actual start of
business operations.
NOTE:     In the case of loans where the applicant is required, among
other things to be the tenant of the premises under a lease,
a right to tenancy could only apply to a tenant in posses-
sion of premises which are already in existence. Not until
this situation exists can an applicant be considered to
have "acquired" premises. An agreement to rent premises
for future use, even though supported by a post-dated lease,
does not for purposes of the Scheme constitute acquisition.
6)   CRITERIA TO BE MET BY PARTICIPATING BANKS
The criteria for participating banks under the Small-Scale
Enterprise Development Project consist of compliance with the
following requirements in addition to the Central Bank's normal
criteria for credit availment:
i)  minimum paid in capital
ii) sound and efficient management and an adequate number of
qualified staff to carry out the institution's normal
business
iii) personnel's capability for satisfactorily appraising the
technical, marketing and financial capability of small-
scale enterprise development projects together with
satisfactory systems and procedures for regularly follow-
ing up on the progress of project implementation and
operation.



- 76 -                         ANNEX 11
7)   PREPARATION OF LOAN PROPOSALS
Premier Investment Corporation will design a loan proposal
form for considering proposals for financial assistance from
borrowers to reduce the time spent by bank's personnel in ex-
plaining the minimum information relating to proposed projects.
This proposal will include information relating to the follow-
ing broad areas:
i) a general description of the project
ii) the market for the borrower's products, competition
and distribution arrangements
iii) a list of major capital assets to be acquired, their
cost and suitability for the project
iv) an estimate of development expenses
v) an estimate of total capital requirements including a
margin for contingencies/cost over-runs
vi) an estimate of working capital requirements
vii) the proposed financial structure of the borrower and
related financial arrangements
viii) estimated draw-down of funds
ix) projected financial statements, including balance sheets,
profits and loss accounts, and cash flows for the period
of the loan, and details of assumptions used in their
preparation
x) a list of key personnel and their experiences in the
line of business
xi) security to be offered
8)   EVALUATION OF PROJECTS
a)   General Evaluation
The participating commercial banks will carry out a thorough
investigation of the background of potential borrowers and their
existing operations, covering the following broad areas, before
undertaking a detailed analysis of projects to be financed under
the Scheme.



- 77 -                         ANNEX 11
i)  line of business
ii) ownership
iii) management and directors
iv) business history
v)  banking and other financial relationship
vi) products
vii) production facilities
viii) suppliers and trade reputation
ix) distribution system and selling terms
x)  affiliated companies and related business connections
xi) financial statements for the last two years
b)   Economic Evaluation
Participating banks will be required to carry out
internal financial rate of return (IERR) calculations
for all subloans. For all projects receiving sub-loans
above US$80,000 equivalent, Premier Investment Corporation
will calculate simplified internal economic rate of
returns (IERR) calculations (in line with the attached
"Guidelines" for calculation of economic rates of
returns). In addition to demonstrating their financial
viability, projects below US$80,000 equivalent will
have to:
i)  be labor intensive (normally the investment cost per
job would not exceed US$10,000 equivalent)
ii) produce goods whose ex-factory prices will be reasonable
compared with c.i.f. prices for comparable imported goods.
In cases where c.i.f. prices for comparable imported goods
are 20% below ex-factory prices, an IERR will have to be
calculated by Premier Investment Corporation to determine
whether sub-loan financing can be justified. For goods
which have not been previously imported, Premier Invest-
ment Corporation in consultation with the Trade Adminis-
trator will establish their reasonable c.i.f prices.
Premier Investment Corporation would review sub-loan
request submitted by the banks in light of these criteria.
Loans below US$25,000 would be submitted to Premier In-
vestment Corporation in a short form that shows project
eligibility.
9)   LOAN AGREEMENT
Commercial banks will conduct negotiations with each borrower
after the detailed credit analysis is completed, with a view to
agreeing on the relative rights and responsibilities of the
commercial banks and the borrower which will be reflected in a
loan agreement tailored to meet the particular need of the borrower.
The standard loan agreement should cover the following broad areas:



- 78-                          ANNEX 11
i)  principal loan terms
ii)  repayment provisions
iii) security to be taken and supporting agreements
iv)  affirmative and negative covenants
v)  conditions precedent to disbursement
vi)  events, operation and effect of default
vii) required documentation
viii) miscellaneous conditions
10) QUARTERLY FOLLOW-UP
Commercial banks will obtain and review the following
information from customers under the Scheme, on a quarterly
basis, to enable it to review progress on an on-going basis:
i)  an unaudited balance sheet and profit and loss
account and related cash-flow statement
ii)  a statement of inventory, goods in process and
finished goods at cost
iii) a statement of accounts receivable suitably aged
11) ANNUAL REVIEW
A formal review of outstanding loans and other facilities
under the Scheme will be carried out at least once a year, and
preferably immediately after receipt of interim or audited
annual financial statements from borrowers. The review has
two main objectives:
i)  to ascertain that the borrower has complied with
all the terms of the loan agreement, both financial
and non-financial; and
ii)  to determine whether the progress of the project,
combined with Premier Investment Corporation's know-
ledge of the borrower and its industry, indicates
future development of which Premier Investment
Corporation should be aware.
12) COORDINATING CONMITTEE FUNCTIONS
The entire project will be coordinated and supervised by
a committee formed of representatives from the Bank of Jamaica,
Jamaica Export Credit Insurance Corporation, Jamaica Industrial
Development Corporation, Ministry of Industry, Jamaica Export
Trading Company, Trade Administrator's Department and partici-
pating commercial banks. The chairman of the committee will
be the General Manager of Premier Investment Corporation.

JAMAICA
SMALL-SCALE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Subprogram I--Modern Small-Scale Enterprises
Draft Terms of Reference for the Project Coordinating Committee (PCC)
1.        The institutions directly involved in implementing the Subprogram I
of the proposed Small-Scale Enterprise Development Project are the Premier
Investment Corporation (PIC), Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation (JIDC)
and participating financial intermediaries. In addition, the following four
institutions and government agencies are involved in related sector activities:
Jamaica Export Credit Insurance Corporation (JECIC), Jamaica Export Trading
Company (JETCO), the Trade Administrator, the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Although PIC's role as project developer
and administrator is substantial, there is a need for overall coordination
of the program and all the institutions involved, in order to use the available
expertise in the most efficient way.
2.        Hitherto lending to SSE's has been conducted by the various insti-
tutions with differing project selection criteria, performance criteria and
credit standards. Technical assistance has been randomly provided. The
result has been fragmented lending programs and the absence of clearly defined
lending priorities.
3.        The establishment of a Project Coordination Committee is designed
to coordinate and expedite the implementation of the project. The committee
will therefore be composed of members of the institutions directly and
indirectly involved in the project: PIC, JIDC, JETCO, the Trade Administrator,
the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and participating commercial banks. The
committee will be chaired by the general manager of PIC. PCC will meet at
least once every two months to review the progress of the program and
resolve any operating, administrative or technical problems which may occur.
In addition PCC will have the specific responsibilities explained below.
Implementation of GOJ's SSE Sector Policies
4.        PCC will consider proposals and make recommendations to PIC and the
agencies concerned for specific sector studies, identification of growth areas
or export potential, the institution of accounting systems, training of staff
and employment of consultants. PIC will be able to use the unallocated
portion of the Bank's loan to meet any shortfall under category 3 of the
Loan Agreement, subject to the approval of the Bank. PCC must also ensure
that subborrowers are able to obtain import licenses for pojects being
financed.



- 81 -
Coordination of Credit Policies
5.        PIC will have develop a project appraisal manual and subloan pro-
cessing procedures in collaboration with JIDC and participating banks. The
committee must ensure that credit appraisal criteria and procedures are
appropriate and that high standards are maintained. If, during implementation
of the project, it becomes apparent that certain project selection criteria
need to be modified, or that the Small Businessmen's Financing Scheme needs
further amending, such matters must be brought to the PCC, which will
recommend the appropriate changes.
Coordination of Technical Assistance
6.        It is PCC's responsibility to coordinate through PIC the technical
assistance available within the existing institutions, particularly JIDC and
SBDC. PCC must ensure that these resources are focused on priority areas and
directly related to the project. Similarly, if the various technical assis-
tance units are unable to provide, or disagree upon, the type of technical
assistance needed, the issue must be resolved through PCC.
