{"cdata!": "The principal objectives of the Small\n            Scale Enterprise Development Project are to promote the\n            development of small-scale enterprises (SSEs) by providing\n            medium-and long-term credits to SSEs for their investment\n            and working capital needs and to strengthen the institutions\n            providing financial and technical services to them. Credits\n            will be made available under the project to larger SSEs\n            (enterprises with net fixed assets of up to US$100,000,\n            excluding real property) through the commercial banking\n            system and to the very small SSEs (enterprises with net\n            fixed assets of up to US$20,000 excluding real property)\n            through a new institution, the Small Enterprise Development\n            Corporation (SEDCO), designed to serve such enterprises. It\n            is anticipated that the project would provide about 100\n            credits to large SSEs, averaging about US$69,000 each and\n            about 300 credits to very small SSEs, averaging about\n            US$13,000 each."}, "docdt": "1978-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
