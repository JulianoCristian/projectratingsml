It represents the least-cost alternative to\n            supplying new customers and rehabilitating obsolete\n            distribution and subtransmission facilities. The project\n            would include 38 specific subprojects which would be\n            executed during 1980-83 and the routine distribution\n            expansion required to connect new consumers in 1981-82. In\n            addition, the project would include technical services to\n            strengthen IRHE's planning and design of distribution\n            and subtransmission works. Specifically, the project would\n            consist of: (a) rehabilitation and construction of about 535\n            circuit km of lines; (b) installation of about 135 MVA of\n            transformers in existing substations and in new substations\n            to be constructed; (c) installation of accessory\n            subtransmission equipment; (d) construction of about 100\n            circuit km of lines and 260 km of distribution networks; (e)\n            installation of about 3,300 distribution transformers with a\n            total capacity of about 100 MVA; (f) installation of\n            accessory distribution equipment; and (g) consulting services."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
