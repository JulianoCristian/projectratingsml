The Philippines Health\n            Development Project (PHDP) was the Bank's first\n            comprehensive effort to support the Department of Health\n            (DOH) in the Philippines, covering the key areas of disease\n            control, health services delivery at the field level and\n            capacity building of the DOH. After two population projects\n            that performed poorly, PHDP was designed with full\n            government ownership and a clear mandate for the DOH. Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory during the preparation\n            phase and the borrower\u0092s performance and participation in\n            project preparation was excellent. Project implementation\n            was less satisfactory, however overall outcome of the\n            project may be rated as satisfactory since most of the\n            objectives were reached at least to some degree. The major\n            lesson to be learned from this project is the need to be\n            more aware of the political milieu, including monitoring of\n            possible legislative actions and other developing scenarios,\n            while planning and implementing projects. There should be\n            strong linkages between the various components of projects.\n            Institutional development components should include a good\n            analysis of existing constraints, well specified plans to\n            achieve objectives and clear monitoring indicators.\n            Streamlining of drugs and equipment procurement and\n            distribution, including possible decentralization of\n            procurement, particularly of drugs and medical supplies,\n            must be assured before any major public health commitment is\n            made. Vehicles are often not essential to project success\n            and their purchase should be minimized in future projects,\n            except where the need can be specifically documented. The\n            Bank should budget adequate resources for supervision. While\n            multiple task missions may be cost-effective, particular\n            care should be taken to ensure that all tasks, in\n            particular, project supervision tasks, receive due\n            attention. Several donors concurrently support governments\n            for activities to achieve certain outcomes and such efforts\n            in the future should bring together major stakeholders in\n            the planning and design stage to agree on collaborative implementation."}, "docdt": "1998-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
