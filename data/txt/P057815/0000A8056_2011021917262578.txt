                         between 2004 and mid-2006, but has picked up after project restructuring in March 2006. Project development objectives are being met as explained. Monitoring of performance
                         indicators based on survey of 2010 businesses shows overall improvement. The closing date of the project has been extended to 29 June 2012 in order to ensure effective
                         implementation and completion of the Tax Block and the Document Management System, the two main outstanding activities. Most other project activities have been implemented
                         satisfactorily. As part of the project extension, an Agreed Action Plan was elaborated. The mission reviewed progress towards the action plan benchmarks and found the progress
                         satisfactory. E-filing is available for all taxpayers and most legal entities file electronically. Risk-based audit selection, a key element of voluntary compliance, has been successfully
                         implemented. As a result, the number of audits has reduced and their effectiveness improved. The use of the call center has increased from 10,000 users in April 2008 to 30,600 in
                         April 2009 and 42,800 in July 2010. Based on our recommendation, the Large Taxpayer Office has been centralized. Voluntary compliance has improved as a result of
                         implementation of VAT invoice matching system, as well as improved effectiveness due to risk-based audit selection.
                         The procurement of the Tax Block and he Document Management System, which was delayed earlier, has been completed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         One concern is the high level of unpaid refunds. This will be closely monitored. This has been somewhat addressed by issuing T-bills in the amount of UAH 16.4 billion.
                         The benchmarks set as a condition for the project extension are being closely monitored.
