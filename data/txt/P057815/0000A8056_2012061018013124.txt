                         Implementation Status Overview
                         STSMP is a 10-year 2-phase APL aimed at modernizing the STS, improving voluntary compliance, efficiency, effectiveness,transparency, and fairness. Implementation was slow
                         between 2004 and mid-2006, but has picked up in the last few years. The closing date of the project has been extended to 29 June 2012 in order to ensure effective implementation
                         and completion of the Tax Block and the Document Management System, the two main outstanding activities. Most other project activities have been implemented satisfactorily. All

                         to be completed before the end date.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The recent developments in tax administration reforms have been considerable. The number of both planned and unplanned audits decreased in 2011. The automatic VAT refund
                         system was introduced in spring 2011. It has expanded to cover 20% of taxpayers and over 50% of the amounts refunded.

                         A decision was made in February 2012 to centralize the Large Taxpayer Office. However, the continued practice of setting up revenue targets impedes the full utilization of the
                         available, appropriate tools. While revenue targets are related to both the slowly recovering post-crisis economy and the tight fiscal situation, the continuation of such an approach
                         will not contribute to long-term improvements in the business climate. Further implementation of the Tax Block and Document Management Systems are challenging tasks requiring
                         considerable change management.. The nationwide rollout and full scale implementation of IT solutions developed under the project require considerable changes in organizational

                         through the various instruments that are available, including technical assistance and capacity development.
