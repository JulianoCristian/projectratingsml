follows: Project\n            outcome is unsatisfactory; sustainability is unlikely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower satisfactory is\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned consisted of the following:\n            The Project implementation period has shown that Bolivia is\n            much more volatile a country, politically and economically,\n            than the Project had assumed back in 1998. While in 1998 it\n            was certainly difficult to imagine the rapid deterioration\n            of the political and economic environment, the Project\n            experience provides valuable lessons for future operations\n            in similar conditions: 1) Notwithstanding the\n            government's commitment to reform, the strength of\n            political opposition should be considered carefully. Greater\n            attention should be given to the potential political\n            opposition, reflecting this possibility appropriately in the\n            project risks and preparing broader mitigation measures. 2)\n            It is important to pay greater attention to the social\n            situation in the country and its relation to the supported\n            reforms, specifically, in projects aimed at increased\n            private sector participation. While capitalization (and\n            privatization) undoubtedly resulted in positive objective\n            results of improved coverage and, in many cases, reduced\n            tariffs, popular discontent reflected other issues. The\n            major weaknesses included, among other, lack of explicit\n            pro-poor focus, deficient control and follow up by the\n            Government, and unrealistic expectations of the population\n            (overselling of privatization benefits). This exposes\n            limitations of a \"typical\" public information\n            campaign as the main mitigation tool, viewed largely as just\n            provision of information. Efforts could include, for\n            example, negotiating greater social responsibilities with\n            private companies and other type of public private\n            partnerships, more structured expansion programs for rural\n            and marginal urban areas, involving the public in the\n            decision-making process, and improving the social safety\n            net. 3) Projects should be simpler and ensure greater\n            flexibility in funds allocation. The Project suffered from\n            an excessive number of components and sub-components and an\n            overly detailed initial allocation of funds to components\n            and beneficiaries, which slowed implementation. These are,\n            again, especially binding constraints in an economy\n            characterized by substantial economic and political\n            instability. 4) The objectives and performance indicators of\n            a TA operation should be realistic. The Project demonstrated\n            a number of important achievements thanks to the technical\n            assistance provided. However, clearly a TA operation cannot\n            be the main vehicle for the reform. The outcomes of the\n            operation are the most significant in the areas where\n            Government commitment was the strongest.  5) Finally, an\n            issue brought up in the dialogue with the stakeholders and,\n            perhaps, deserving attention is access to the studies\n            financed by this project."}, "docdt": "2005-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
