and Privatization\n            Technical Assistance Project for Bolivia aims to support\n            government reform designed to strengthen the financial\n            sector, enhance the legal and regulatory framework for\n            infrastructure and business, and promote improved provision\n            of goods and services. There are four components. The first\n            component, financial sector regulation, has banking and\n            non-banking subcomponents: It provides technical assistance\n            to help draft laws and regulations establishing a deposit\n            guarantee fund, and improving transparency and governance of\n            financial institutions. It helps attract foreign capital by\n            managing risk; creates a coordinating body to issue norms\n            governing the sector; and improves the insurance industry\n            and regulatory oversight. It also improves capital markets,\n            improving pension fund operation, and builds the capacity of\n            regulatory authorities. The second component helps draft or\n            amend competition law, SIRESE (cross-sectoral) law, and\n            administrative procedures law. This component pays for legal\n            and technical experts to draft transport law and concessions\n            regulations, to improve the regulatory framework for the\n            hydrocarbon industry, and to develop regulations concerning\n            communications system services. It also builds capacity to\n            open long distance and local service sectors to competition.\n            The third component funds public enterprise divestiture and\n            reforms the public services cooperative. The fourth\n            component funds a public information campaign."}, "docdt": "1998-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
