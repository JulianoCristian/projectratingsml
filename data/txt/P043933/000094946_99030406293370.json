Extreme pressures on the surface\n            waters caused by a significant urbanization and\n            industrialization in the region, call for an assessment of\n            wastewater discharges control. Issues on industrial\n            wastewater, agricultural water usage, water quality impacts,\n            and pollution control, will be revisited further in later\n            phases of the project. Even though the project is well\n            formulated and meets sustainable prospects, with potential\n            environmental benefits, it does allow for mitigation\n            measures in pollution control, wastewater management, water\n            discharges, and agricultural water pollution. Mitigation\n            measures include: 1) management and operations training for\n            staff in the utility companies in a wide range of\n            disciplines; and, 2) monitoring the technical assistance\n            program, providing both equipment and training for cities\n            and provincial areas. Regarding the social impacts, where\n            resettlement and compensation issues are envisaged, will be\n            covered separately in the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)."}, "docdt": "1998-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
