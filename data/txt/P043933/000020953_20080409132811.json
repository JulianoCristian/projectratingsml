Some\n            lessons learned included: a practical approach to balance\n            the Bank's priority for institutional development with\n            the Government's priority for expanding wastewater\n            coverage and service levels is necessary. As investment\n            financing becomes less important to China, the Bank's\n            future focus should shift to value addition, through\n            programs to transfer knowledge of management systems and\n            procedures. The objectives and priorities of Sichuan\n            Province (SP) were different from those of the Bank. SP gave\n            priority to honoring the agreements made with the central\n            government to expand municipal wastewater treatment to\n            reduce pollution discharges to the river system.
