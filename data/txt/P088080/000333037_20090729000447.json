Housing and Urban\n            Technical Assistance Loan (HUTAL) Project for Mexico were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the HUTAL experience suggests that\n            technical assistance lending may actually set policy\n            dialogue back by focusing Bank and client time on\n            bureaucratic procedural issues and, in the case of HUTAL, by\n            a de facto relinquishing of policy dialogue to other\n            institutions like Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)\n            which are supporting specific investment programs (HABITAT).\n            Recently the Mexico country department has been engaging in\n            sector policy dialogue through non-reimbursable technical\n            assistance, grant funded Economic Sector Work (ESW),\n            stepped-up fee-for service work, and memos-of understanding,\n            in addition to preparation and supervision of Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL). Time will tell how these instruments work\n            to sustain productive policy dialogues. One tool the Bank\n            could consider will be increased South-South or South-North\n            exchanges to bring the Bank's global knowledge to bear\n            in client countries. Traditionally Technical Assistance\n            Lending (TAL) offers a means of supporting nascent and weak\n            institutions and of preparing for investment operations. In\n            a Middle Income Country (MIC), however, the costs of setting\n            up and operating public institutions are covered by existing\n            government revenue. Fostering policy dialogue through\n            technical assistance operations may certainly be desirable,\n            but may not be compatible with the procedures and\n            requirements (of both Bank and Borrower) related to lending.\n            Future TAL operations are advised to rethink their approach\n            to MIC. Studies should be financed only when terms of\n            reference have already been agreed on and implementing\n            agencies have been evaluated positively."}, "docdt": "2009-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
