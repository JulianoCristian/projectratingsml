REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA FOR A PORTS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit of $9.2 million to Papua New Guinea to be relent to the
Papua New Guinea Harbours Board (PNGHB) for a term of twenty-five years,
including four years of grace, at an interest rate of 7¼ percent per year.
The project would improve three major ports and construct one new port.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        New Guinea, a U.N. Trust Territory, and Papua, an Australian
dependency, are administered by Australia under an Administrator as one
political and economic unit, now called Papua New Guinea. Until the end
of last year it was known as the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. The
National Identity Ordinance, which went into effect in December 1971,
officially changed the name of the country so that, with self-government
imminent, the many and diverse tribes which make up the indigenous population
might begin to think in national rather than tribal terms.
3.        Australia is firmly committed to Papua New Guinea 's eventual inde-
pendence, and has accepted the 1971 recommendations by the Select Committee
on Constitutional Development of the last House of Assembly to prepare the
country for full internal self-government in the period 1972 - 1976, the
life of the newly elected House of Assembly. The political representation
of the indigenes has been progressively expanded and the new House of
Assembly has only four members appointed by the Administrator as compared
to 100 members elected by the people. The previous practice of reserving
certain seats for EBropeans (i.e. expatriates) was abandoned in 1968. The
new House of Assembly has the power to elect Ministers who will have consid-
erable administrative and financial authority. The elected Ministers will
serve as the Administratorts Executive Council until such time as the country
becomes self-governing.
4.        The recent elections to the Assembly revealed an encouraging increase
in active political participation on the part of the indigenes. Two major
parties emerged, the United and the Pangu Party, which are likely to function
as Government and Opposition respectively in the new House. However, the
process of nation-building still has a long way to go, owing to considerable
disparities of economic and cultural background as well as the population's
geographical and ethnic fragmentation. The Australian Government is therefore
stepping up its efforts to increase indigenous participation in politics,
administration and the monetized economy so that when independence comes the
risks of internal strife and economic distruption will be minimized.
5.        The Bank Group's association with Papua New Guinea began with a
general survey mission in 1963. The mission's report provided the framework
for the country's first five year development program (FY 1969-73), and a
second economic mission. in 1967 set the strategy for Bank Group lending. As
explained in Part II below, the Bank is now helping to draw up the second
five year development program.



- 2 -
6.        The Bank has made three loans to Papua New Guinea for a total of
$34.7 million and the Association three development credits amounting to
$11.0 million.  Of the combined total of $45.7 million, slightly more than
-half helped to finance a single hydroelectric power project, which was
urgently needed to provide power for one of the most rapidly developing
areas of the country. A combined Bank loan and IDA credit of $9.0 million
helped finance a highway project and the balance of Bank Group lending was
divided between agricultural and telecommunications projects. These projects
were selected for their high economic priority in helping to open up the
country and bring the local people into the cash economy. The IFC has made
no investments in Papua New Guinea, but it is exploring the possibility of
doing so. A statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to the country is attached
as Annex I. The Asian Development Bank has recently made a first loan of
$4.5 million to the Papua New Guinea Development Bank to finance the foreign
exchange costs of approved projects.
7.        All the projects financed by the Bank Group are progressing satis-
factorily, although disbursements are somewhat slower than expected due, in
part, to the administrative arrangements within Papua New Guinea. Ags
borrowers become more accustomed to Bank Group procedures, disbursements are
expected to keep more in line with forecasts.
8.        The Bank Group's planned future operations in Papua New Guinea
include continued lending for physical infrastructure, principally highways
and telecommunications, which are of considerable importance in view of the
present lack of adequate communication between the various regions of the
country. Bank Group lending also envisages a larger share for agriculture
and education, in support of the Government's efforts to increase the indigenous
pop-ulationts participation in the economic development of the country.
9.        The proposed IDA credit would be guaranteed by the Commonwealth of
Australia as, under the Papua New Guinea Act, aIl public loans incurred by
the Administration of Papua New Guinea are automatically guaranteed by Australia.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
10.       A report "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the Territory
of Papua New Guinea" (EAP-8a) was circulated to the Executive Directors on
September 9, 1969. Country data are at Annex II. Recent developments are
discussed below. A regular economic mission will arrive in Papua New Guinea
in late April and its report will be distributed later this year.
11.       Papua New Guinea as a whole is still at an early stage of economic
development. The per capita income of the indigenous population is around
US$150. Most indigenes live on subsistence agriculture which, however, provides
them with a simplebut relatively adequate living. Only about 30 percent of the
indigenous work force is integrated in the monetized sector of the economy. The
non-monetized sector still contributes hO percent of GDP.
12.       Until recently, the country's monetized economy was heavily dependent
on the production and export of a few agricultural commodities, notably copra,
coffee, and rubber.  However, efforts to diversify agriculture have been success-
ful, and tea and palm oil production and exports have expanded. Large scale



- 3-
exploitation of the country's timber resources has also started. The
small but rapidly growing manufacturing sector has so far mainly been
processing primary products for export. The Territory has traditionally
had large balance of payments and budget deficits which have been financed
almost entirely by Australian grants.
13.       A major event in Papua New Guinea's economic development was the
discovery of large copper ore deposits on Bougainville Island, where
commercial mining by the Bougainville Copper Company is scheduled to begin
by mid-1972. Projected annual extraction is 30 million tons of ore yielding
about 200,000 tons of copper as well as some silver and gold. The gross value
of the output is expected to reach US$240 million per annum during the next
ten years, declining somewhat thereafter. The original assumptions for
Bougainville predicted a direct contribution to the GDP in the order of US$150
million in FY 1973 1/ rising to about US$200 million by FY 1975. The net
balance of payments benefit would, however, only amount to between US$70 and
US$95 million because of increased imports, transfers by expatriate personnel
and interest and dividend payments abroad. Government revenue derived from
the project was estimated to rise from about US$30 million in FY 1975 to US$60
million annually in later years when the Bougainville Copper Company becomes
liable to company taxation, whereas Government expenditures required for
project infrastructure and related purposes would add up to over US$70 million
during the next few years. To ensure some indigenous participation in the
project, the Administration has acquired a 20 percent equity interest in the
Bougainville Copper Company to be held in trust for the indigenous population
until independence. Nonetheless, the Bougainville project has largely the
features of an enclave project with only limited direct developmental benefits
to the host economy. Despite the benefits of the project, which may be lower
than originally estimated due to recent Japanese requests to cut down by 20
percent on their long-term copper ore supply contracts and the sharp decline
in international copper prices, Papua New Guinea will nevertheless continue to
be heavily dependent on outside financial assistance to bring about the trans-
formation of the country's fragmented traditional society into a modern economy.
14.       For the past few years, the Papus New Guinea economy had been performing
well. After a 33 percent growth in the monetized sector GDP in FY 1970, another
25-30 percent increase is estimated in FY 1971.  The largest single growth factor
has been private capital formation which rose from US$66 million in FY 1969 to
US$160 million in FY 1970 and is estimated to have reached US$300 million in
FT 1971. About two-thirds of the increase is explained by Bougainville Copper,
but other private capital expenditures, mainly foreign, have also increased
substantially. Papua New Guinea's non-mining merchandise exports rose by 20
percent to US$123 million in FY 1971 despite a decline in prices for major tree
crop commodities. Among the indigeneous population, income from cash cropping
and salaries rose significantly. Figures for Fl 1972 are not yet available.
However, the growth outlook for the current year is less bright and even a
decline in GDP is expected, with the investment impact of Bougainville on
national income decreasing sharply, and as a result of the recent slump in
prices for copra, cocoa, palm oil and rubber.

- 4 -
15.       The Administration is now preparing the Second Five Year Development
Program (FY's 1974-78) which will be crucial for the future development of
Papua New Guinea because the period of the program is likely to coincide-with
the country's attainment of internal self-government and possibly independence.
The Australian Government therefore requested UNDP to finance a four-man team
of international experts on development to assist in the preparation of the
program. In accordance with Australia's wishes, UNDP has designated the Bank
as the Executing Agency for the project. The team is now in Papua New Guinea
and its recommendations will be available by mid-1972.
16.       The approach of self-government has hastened the need for development,
particularly of the human resources of Papua New Guinea. flliteracy is still
over 75 percent and there is a desperate lack of trained local manpower. The
main task for the Second Development Program will therefore be to build up the
indigenous monetized economy.  In this context, the Administration intends to
put considerable emphasis on agricultural smallholder development and on educa-
tion, especially secondary and technical education. The process of "localization"
of the public service is also being accelerated, partly through crash training
programs, and greater efforts are being made to involve the indigenes in the
economic development of the private sector.
17.       Another essential task is the establishment of an adequate infra-
structure. Papua New Guinea's uniquely rugged terrain, its insular character
and its ethnic fragmentation make it particularly important to develop tranis-
portation and communication. Papua New Guinea's long-term power program is
under way and will ensure adequste power supply in the main commercial and
industrial centers.
18.       The domestic resources to carry out these tasks are limited.  A very
high, although recently declining proportion of gross capital formation is
financed directly or indirectly through transfers from abroad, especially in
the form of grant aid from Australia and direct Australian Goverrment expenditures
in Papua New Guinea. Private domestic savings have been increasing relatively
fast, but their impact on the economy has been diminished by expatriate transfers.
Net private capital inflow has consistently provided the bulk of private sector
capital formation.
19.       Australian assistance in Papua New Guinea in FY 1971, including grants,
loans to the Administration and direct inon-military Australian Commonwealth
expenditures in Papua New Guinea, amounted to US$145 million, or almost 70 percent
of total official Australian extemal aid. Australian assistance to Papua New
Guinea in FY 1972 was budgeted at US$156 miflion or 7 percent highEr than in
FY 1971, most of it to cover general salary increases for expatriates in the
Papua New Gainea Public Service.
20.       Because Papua New Guinea is part of the Australian currency area, the
balance of payments statistics,especially on capital account,are incomplete.
The Territory has no external reserves of its own. The total external gap for
the first Five-Year Development Program (FY's 1969-73) was forecast to be in
the order of US$640 million or US$130 million a year. The Second Five-Year
Develonment Proeram is likels to call for a considerably higher inflow of



external resources than the First Program, despite the increase in foreign
exchange earnings derived from Bougainville, because of the envisaged
acceleration in the development efforts in virtually all economic sectors.
Although Australia is committed to continue its assistance at the past level
and has also recently allowed Papua New Guinea to borrow in the Australian
market, Papua New Guinea is trying to diversify its sources of foreign finance
and gradually reduce its dependence on Australian aid. It has recently joined
the Asian Development Bank.
21.       The Bank Group's assistance to Papua New Guinea is designed to
supplement, not to substitute for, Australian aLd. Notwithstanding increasing
domestic revenues, as discussed above Australian grants still finance
almost half of Papua New Guinea's budget and about the same proportion of its
external deficit. There will remain a substantial resource gap for many years
if the essential needs of the economy are to be met, but the country cannot be
expected to service large amounts of conventional debt on its own. Its capability
for resource mobilization is severely limited by the low productivity and income
of the indigenes and by the fact that a large part of the economy is still outside
the monetized sector (about 40 percent). The gross saving rate of only 9 percent
is a reflection of these circumstances. On the other hand, demand for resources
to overcome the backward state of the economy is heavy and investment at about
30 percent of GNP during FY 1966-70 leaves the resource gap at the unusually
high level of more than 20 percent of GNP. In the face of such a large resource
deficit, the diversion of domestic or foreign resources from investment to debt
service is necessarily a considerable burden on the economy and an obstacle to
its development. Hence the case for part of external assistance to Papua New
Guinea on concessional terms including some Bank Group financing by IDA.   The
case is supported by the effective effort being made to bring the economy forward
from its primitive state. This effort is rationally planned with indigenous as
well as Australian and other outside participation.  Moreover, the capability
of the indigenous population in economic management is being steadily improved
through both experience and training.
PART III - THE PROJECT
The Transport Sector
22.       Until about the mid 1940's communications were limited to coastal
shipping and local road transport adjacent to the principal ports. After the
Second World War numerous small airports and airstrips were built to facilitate
contact between the coastal towns and the interior. As there are very few roads
and no railway, air transport is still the most important mode of transport for
passenger traffic, and, until the 1966 opening of the Iae-Highlands Highway,
was also the most important inland freight carrier.
23.       Apart from the Lae-Highlands Highway, which li"±ks the major port of
Lae with an economically active and growing region, the road system is rudimentary.
In 1970 the Bank Group provided US$9.0 million for improvements of the Lae-Highlands
Highway and for detailed engineering of a new access road from the port of Madang
to the Western Highlands. A road connecting Lee and Madang is among other roads
provisionally planned.



-6 -
2h.       Papua New Guinea has-some 35 public ports, jetties and landing
stages, tbe main ports being Port Moresby, Lae, Madang and Alotau-Samorai
on the island of New Guinea, Rabaul on New Britain and Kieta on Bougainville.
-These six ports handle 95 percent of the country's foreign trade, as well as
coastal traffic between all ports. The continuing and growing importance of
coastal traffic has resiSted in competition for berth space with overseas
shipping and congestion of storage sheds at the ports. The Harbours Board
is encouraging the use of containers and other unitized cargo-hamndling methods
to increase efficiency in the ports.
25.       Based on recommendations of a UNDP-financed and Bank supervised
transport study in 1968/69, a Department of Transportation was created in
1970, with responsibility for internal transportation, except air transport,
which remains urnder the Commonwealth Department of Civil-Aviatlon, and the
liceising of coastal shipping, which is under the PNG Department of Trade
and Industry. The Department of Transportation develops transport policy,
defines investment needs, and prepares projects for submission to the PNG
Administration. Highways are constructed and maintained by the Public Works
Department while the Papua New Guinea Harbours Board, a statutory body
responsible to tha Minister of Transport, operates and maintains all major
public ports. Minor ports are controlled directly.by the Departinent of
Transportation.
26.       Because of the very limited road network and the absence of a railway,
transport coordination has not presented a probl'em. But as the road network
increases, intermodal coordination between road traffic and coastal shipping
will become more imiportant. The Department of Transportation will be respon-
sible for formulating this policy.
The Papua New Guinea larbours Board
27.       The Harbours Board will be responsible for carrying out the project.
Established by ordiLnance in 1963, it has a Chairman and 3ix mEnbers, appointed
by the Minister of Transport on the recommendation of the Administrator. The
Board has considerable autononmy in day-to-day matters. It is subject to policy
directives given by the Administrator or the Ministry of Transport, but in
practice operates with a good deal of independence. The Harbours Board will
be required to consult with the Association on the appointment of the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer.
28.       The Administrator may declare certain ports to be subject to the
Harbours Board's control. 'Nine ports have so far'been designated, and some
others are expected to be added.  The value of the assets presently under the
control of the Harbours Board represents the Administration's equity in the
Board, about A$8.1 million.
29.       The Harbours Board's charges are low by international standards
and have remained practically unchanged since 1958. Increasing operating
expenses have depressed the Harbours Board's financial surplus below that
required to perruiit the Board to finance a significant part of its development
and meet other financial obligations.  The Board has agreed to raise dues on



- 7 -
shipping by July 1972 and rates for cargo handling by July 1973 substantially
to the level recommended in a recent report by consultants. The Board has
undertaken to introduce by 1976 dues and rates which reflect the costs of
services and which will ensure that a reasonable portion of the economic
benefits resulting from port investments accrue to the economy of Papua New
Guinea. These measures will make the Harbours Board financially viable and
enable it to pay a dividend on the Government's equity.
Description of the Project
30.       The 1968/69 UNDP-financed transport study recommended that master
plans be developed for all ports under the jurisdiction of the Harbours Board.
Plans, together with feasibility studies, have been completed for all the ports
in the proposed project; a tariff study has also been completed for all ports
which handle foreign cargo.
31.       The project consists of improvements to Port Moresby, Iae and Kieta
and construction of a small new porw at Alotau. Total cost is estimated to be
US$.1.1 million including an estimated US$`9.2 million off-shore cost; this is
high because practically no construction materials are available in. the country.
The works would cover most of the srzbours Board's investment program for the
period FY 1972-75. An exception would be expansion of Madang port, the justi-
fication of which depends on whether the road giving alternative access from
Madang to the Central Highlands is built. The economic feasibility of this
road is currently being investigated and if constructed is expected. to divert
roughly 100,000 tons of traffic per year from Iae to Madang.
32.       The project consists of the following main items:
(i) At Port Moresby, land reclamation, a storage shed and a
stacking area for a total cost of US$0.75 million. Port
Moresby serves the Central District of New Guinea and exports
mainly rubber and copra. Gnmieral cargo traffic has been
increased through the incre-a,e of unitized cargo handling.
The additional open and covered storage space is needed to
solve present and expected storage problems.
(ii) In Lae, a deep-water berth designed to accommodate container
traffic would be constructed as an extension of an existing
wharf, for a total cost of US$4.8 million. As a result of
the construction of the Lae-Highlands Highway, traffic through
the port has been increaning at an average of 17 percent
annually for the last three years and a three-shift operation
has been introduced to decrease ship delays. As previously
explained, expansion in excess of the proposed works depends
on consuruction of a road from Madang to the Highlands.
(iii)  Coaster berth facilities costing US$0.9 million will be added
at the port of Kieta, to free the existing deep-water berth
for overseas shipping and avoid current delays.



- 8 -
(iv)  The administrative center of the Milne Bay District was moved
from Samarai to Alotau in 1968 and the existing port at Samarai
is old and unsafe for heavier loads, causing overseas lines to
bypass the port. A small new port at Alotau, to,cost US$1.3
million, will serVe the Milne Bay District better.
(v) The Association would also finance US$600,000 worth of
cargo-handling. equipment and would provide about US$110,000
for training and management consultant services as well as
the cost of engineering consultants., A more detailed break-down
of project costs is given in Annex III.
Procurement and Disbursement
33.       Contracts for construction equipment, materials, and supplies required
for the project wiLl be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with'Bank Group guidelines and subject to Association approval.
34.       Disbursement will cover 82 percent of civil engineering works, repre-
senting the off-shore coist component, all off-shore costs of coasultant services,
and cei.f. cost of imported equipment. Papua,New Guinea does 'not give preferred
import terms to any cowntry. The Harbours Board would finance the local cost
of US$1.9 million from internally generated resources. Engineering and soil
surveys started in November 1971, on which an estimated US$250,000 has already
been spent, would be covered by the proposed credit.
Economic Evalua tion
35.       The project under consideration is designed to increase capacity and
improve cargo-handling rates. The principal benefits would be reduction in
shipts waiting time and service time, and'lower cargo-handling costs,   Based
on these benefits, the internal rates of return for the four,ports. in the
project range from 23 percent. for Iae to 50 percent for Port" iM-resby, with an
overall return for the project,of 27 percent. These rather high economic returns
arise because the project is somewhat overdue and relatively  sna1l investments
will permit increa'sed use of existing bapacity through unitize`d cargo-handling
methods. A sensitivity snalysis 'indicated that ca'pital'cos't'overruns would have
the greatest impact on profitability; a 15 percent increase in 'capital would
lower the economic return to 23 percent. Traffic forecasts for the project
ports are considered to be conservative, so the economic rates of return were
not tested for sensitivity to changes in traffic volume. A 50 percent reduction
in savings in cargo handling costs, to allow for the fact that the full financial'
costs of labor do not represent economic costs, only reduces the return to
24 percent.
PART IV - LE3AL TINTSTRUMNTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Administration
of Papua New Guinea and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between
the Association alnd PNGHB, the Recommendation of the Committee required by
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of tne Association and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed

separately.   Necessary modifications have been made to the General Conditions
applicable to Development Credit Agreements to take account of the fact that
the Borrower is not a member.   A draft lettetr from the Commonwealth giving,
inter alia, certain assurances on the status of the Credit is also being
distributed.
37.       The execution and delivery of the Project Agreement and a subsidiary
loan agreement between the Adminiatration and PNGHB are conditions of effect-
iveness.
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - REC MMENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
