The additional open and covered\n            storage space is needed to solve present and expected\n            storage problems; (ii) in Lae, a deep-water berth designed\n            to accommodate container traffic would be constructed as an\n            extension of an existing wharf. As a result of the\n            construction of the Lae-Highlands Highway, traffic through\n            the port has been increasing at an average of 17 percent\n            annually for the last three years and a three-shift\n            operation has been introduced to decrease ship delays. As\n            previously explained, expansion in excess of the proposed\n            works depends on construction of a road from Madang to the\n            Highlands; (iii) coaster berth of facilitation will be added\n            at the port of Kieta, to free the existing deep-water berth\n            for overseas shipping and avoid current delays; (iv) the\n            existing port at Samarai is old and unsafe for heavier\n            loads, causing overseas lines to bypass the port. A small\n            new port at Alotau, to cost US$1.3 million, will serve the\n            Milne Bay District better; (v) the association would also\n            finance cargo-handling equipment and would provide for\n            training and management consultant services as well as the\n            cost of engineering consultants."}, "docdt": "1972-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
