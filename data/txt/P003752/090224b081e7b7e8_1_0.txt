on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on other public assets satisfac-

in the territory of, the Borrower on goods or services, or on the
importation, manufacture, procurement or supply thereof; to that

Category, to the extent required to meet the estimated shortfall,

cable to such expenditures in order that further withdrawals under

have been made.

curement of any item in any Category is inconsistent with the
procedures set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no expen-
ditures for such item shall be financed out of the proceeds of
the Loan and the Bank may, without in any way restricting or lim-
iting any other right, power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan
