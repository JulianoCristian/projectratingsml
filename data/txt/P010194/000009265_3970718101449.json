which\n            will support the Government's efforts to increase\n            petroleum exploration, consists of:  (i) drilling of six\n            exploratory wells on gas  prospects; (ii) a program of\n            regional seismic surveys and basin studies designed to\n            identify new oil and gas prospects; and (iii) promotion of\n            potentially oil-prone areas to the international oil\n            industry.  The project faces the normal risks associated\n            with any petroleum exploration project. Appropriate measures\n            to reduce these risks have been incorporated in the proposed project."}, "docdt": "1983-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
