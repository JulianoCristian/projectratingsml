Overall Bank performance is\n            rated as satisfactory. Overall Borrower performance is\n            considered as fully satisfactory. The main lessons are the\n            following: Benefits from piloting done over a relatively\n            long implementation period, with the objective of gaining\n            experience in operational methodologies, may be marginal,\n            particularly where Bank supervision and support by project\n            management are adequate. Where a pilot is to be implemented\n            as a first phase, it is important to focus it on activities\n            that would be indispensable under a variety of future\n            conditions. the feasibility study for the full scale project\n            brought out many issues respecting economic feasibility of\n            the ASWSS, the water supply and health situation in rural\n            areas, and the state of Syr Darya River, that had\n            significant implications for project design. Implementation\n            of investments under the pilot, without sufficient\n            consideration of financial issues such as cost recovery, and\n            associated institutional issues, can affect the\n            sustainability of the invesments. Where project components\n            or designs are to be based on existing masterplans or\n            studies, especially where there is a significant time lag,\n            it is important to allow for the possibility of significant\n            modifications to the designs, in view of changing\n            conditions. This would require appropriate increases in\n            terms of both time required and cost estimates."}, "docdt": "2002-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
