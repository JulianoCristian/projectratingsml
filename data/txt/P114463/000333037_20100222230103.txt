                       increased coverage o f the social safety net program.
                    The proposed operation aims to support the Government's efforts
                    to bring about economic recovery, while protecting the
                    vulnerable. It aims to support the Government achieve its
                    development objectives set out in the Strategic Action Plan
                    (SAP). The SAP aims to redefine the role o f the state in the
                    economy to achieve upper-middle income status, ensure more
                    equitable access to services and opportunities, improve service
Program Development delivery, facilitate economic diversification, and support better
Objective(s) and    environmental practices to sustain growth and adapt to global
Contribution to CAS climate change. M u c h o f the plan i s to be implemented through
                    the private sector where possible or public-private partnerships
                    (PPPs) with the aim to minimizing fiscal impact given the weak
                    fiscal position. The proposed operation is also consistent with the
                    Maldives Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY2008- 12 which
                    aims to support government efforts to better manage the economy
                    and public finances. The CAS calls for a possible development
                    policy operation in FY2010. The IMF and the Asian

                                                iv
                 Development Bank are providing support to the Government
                 program to help regain macroeconomic stability.



                 The main risks to the proposed operation include political risk,
                 the macroeconomic framework, vulnerability to external shocks,
                 and limited technical capacity. Democracy in the Maldives is
                 very much in a nascent stage and the Government o f President
                 Nasheed lacks a parliamentary majority, which could
                 significantly constrain the Government's plans going forward.
                 Political risks are likely to be a feature for the entire length o f the
                 proposed program period. Given the size and form o f the
                 Government's fiscal adjustment program there are significant
                 implementation risks that may hamper the country's growth. The
                  strength o f the global economic recovery presents upside and
                 downside risks to the proposed operation. A stronger-than-
                 expected recovery in Europe - the largest tourist source - would
                 help boost tourist arrivals, real GDP growth and government
                 revenues in the Maldives, helping to ease the impact o f the fiscal
Risks and Risk
                 adjustment in 2010. Alternatively, a slow and anemic global
Mitigation
                 recovery would suppress a revival in tourism, GDP growth and
                 FDI, while also making the fiscal adjustment more challenging.
                 A s a small, open, and undiversified economy, the Maldives i s
                 vulnerable to the adverse effects o f external shocks such as an o i l
                 price shock. The focus on government revenues generation
                 measures in the IMF and ADB programs will help mitigate the
                 risk o f external shocks translating into large macroeconomic
                 imbalances. Limited technical capacity i s one o f the leading
                 development constraints in the Maldives. Capacity constraints
                 significantly impact all aspects o f government functions and the
                 authorities in the recent past have sought increased technical
                 assistance (TA) interventions from multi-lateral donors such as
                 the World Bank, IMF and the ADB. Specific TA has not been
                 built into the program, but capacity constraints were reflected in
                 the program design.

medium-term Strategic Action Plan. Both the financing and the policy actions supported by the
operation come at a time when there are initial signs o f an economic recovery and evidence that the
Government's fiscal austerity measures are helping to put the fiscal deficit on a sustainable path. In
this regard, the operation will underpin economic growth by helping to reduce the large
macroeconomic imbalances that occurred in 2009.

2.      The tourism sector-and         the Maldivian economy at large-immediately felt the
impact of the global recession, but some indications o f recovery are now emerging. The
tourism sector in Maldives i s the lifeblood o f the economy accounting for 30 percent o f GDP. The
global crisis resulted in a 9 percent contraction in tourist arrivals through September 2009
compared to 2008. However, recent tourist arrivals data show a pick-up from the trough reached in
July 2009. Following an 11 percent year-on-year increase in arrivals in October, arrivals increased
a further by 7 percent in November. Revised projections now point to a full-year decline o f 3.5
percent in 2009 compared to a 7 percent decline anticipated at the beginning o f the year. GDP i s
estimated to contract by 4 percent in 2009 and the current account deficit i s projected to reach
nearly 30 percent o f GDP.

3.      While the 2009 fiscal deficit i s very high, fiscal austerity measures and the improving
economy are beginning to slowly turn the situation around. The fiscal deficit i s expected to
have reached almost 28 percent o f GDP in 2009, down from earlier estimates o f 33 percent o f GDP.
Fiscal data i s not available beyond September 2009, at which point revenues were down 23 percent
compared to the first nine months o f 2008. However, in step with higher tourist arrivals and higher-
than-expected import duties - as imports have rebounded more strongly than expected-revenues
have picked up. This combined with the Government's recent expenditure reductions-including a
temporary cut o f public sector staffs' salaries o f about 15 percent implemented from October
2009-suggests that the fiscal situation i s gradually improving

4.      The Government i s committed to a reform program that has at its core a sharp fiscal
adjustment. The Government has designed and i s implementing a program that would stabilize the
macroeconomic situation through a significant fiscal adjustment and a scaling-up o f external
financing. The IMF approved a 36-month combined Stand-By Arrangement and External Shocks
Facility o f US$92.5 million (or 700 percent o f quota) on December 4, 2009. The ADB has
approved a US$35 million budget support operation with half being disbursed in 2010 and the other
half planned for mid-2011. This coordinated external financing i s meant to preserve confidence in
the economy, reduce the country risk premium and thereby stimulate economic growth.

5.      This proposed operation i s focused on helping the Government to implement its SAP,
which aims to fundamentally change the role o f the state in the economy. The operation
benefits from strong Government ownership and implementation commitment from the highest
levels o f Government. The focus on public financial management - by addressing key institutional
shortcomings in budget preparation and implementation - aims to enable the Ministry o f Finance
and Treasury to recognize budget overruns early so that they can be addressed in a timely fashion.

                                                  1
The focus on public enterprise reform supports the Government's ambitious public private
partnership program, while underpinning fiscal sustainability. The social protection measures help
cushion the impact o f what will be a significant structural change in the economy. The Bank's
proposed operation is the first o f a two-operation programmatic series and i s being processed under
the IDA Financial Crisis Response Fast-Track Facility. The operation also benefits from an
additional SDR 1 million allocation from IDA'SCrisis Response Window.

6.      This first operation in the proposed two operation series will support the Bank's
already strong program o f engagement with the authorities. The synergies between the social
protection components o f this operation, next proposed operation in the series, and the recently
approved Pension and Social Protection Administration project (PSAP) i s one important example.
The result that is expected to be achieved in this area i s the implementation o f a new integrated
social protection strategy that is well-targeted and fiscally sustainable. The proposed series i s also
helping to bolster technical assistance (TA) and capacity building activities, like the Bank's recent
Governance Diagnostics work, the Government's Public Accounting System project which i s
expected to lead to the development o f a modern public accounting and financial management
information system, the debt management technical assistance program and the public sector
restructuring TA. These TA and capacity building efforts are expected to grow in strength as
implementation o f the Government's reform program progresses.

1 . COUNTRY CONTEXT

             A. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

7.       For much o f the last three decades Maldives has been a development success story. In
the early 1980s it was one o f the world's twenty poorest countries with a population o f 156,000.
Today, with a population o f just over 300,000, it is on i t s way towards achieving middle-income
status with a per capita GDP approaching $2,800. Poverty rates, as measured by the headcount
ratio, have fallen steeply, from 40 percent in 1997 to 28 percent in 2004. Other human development
indicators - including infant mortality, maternal mortality, and educational attainment - have
registered similar improvements. The sustained growth and rising prosperity o f the last three
decades was founded on political stability and a private sector-led tourism industry based upon the
country's extraordinary natural assets. The Maldives consists o f 1,192 small tropical islands that
cross strategic shipping routes and it has a marine environment that i s richly diverse. With more
territorial sea than land, marine resources have played a vital role shaping the contours o f economic
development, with nature-based tourism and fishing being the main drivers o f economic growth.

8.      The political economy o f the Maldives changed significantly post-2004, with the new
Government inheriting unsustainable Government finances in 2008. Political and institutional
reforms initiated in late 2003 resulted in the "Roadmap for Reform Agenda" in early 2006. The
country's first multi-party elections were held in 2008. In the run up to the elections, government
spending increased considerably to reach 63 percent o f GDP in 2008 from 36 percent o f GDP in
2004. The public service wage bill was a primary source o f the increase in recurrent expenditures,
as both the number o f public sector employees and their wages have increased substantially. The
total pay package increased by over 150 percent from 2004 to 2008 and the public service now

represents one-third o f the labor force.' These and other recurrent spending went far beyond the
needs o f the 2004 Tsunami reconstruction efforts.2

9.      The first ever multi-party Presidential elections were held in October 2008, followed
by the first ever multi-party parliamentary elections on May gth 2009. In the Presidential
election, Mohammed Nasheed o f the Maldives Democratic Party (MDP) defeated former President
Gayoom in the second round run-off to become the 4* President o f the Maldives. In the
parliamentary elections, President Nasheed's MDP secured 28 seats in the 77-member assembly
coming second to the main opposition Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party (DRP) o f former President
Gayoom and its coalition allies which secured 35 seats.

10.    The Government was elected on a program o f smaller government and stronger
service delivery. Two core principles o f the current Government's Strategic Action Plan are to
reduce the role o f the state in the economy and to ensure that government expenditures are based on
sustainable revenues. An ambitious privatization and public private partnership (PPP) program i s
underway as i s fiscal consolidation that rests heavily o n public service reform. Both efforts were
originally conceived as ways to promote more efficient service delivery to the people o f Maldives
and to ensure sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction, but are n o w also seen as key
measures to help reduce macroeconomic imbalances.

11.      The global financial crisis exposed the unsustainable level o f fiscal expenditures in
recent years. The government's revenue base i s narrow and volatile; it consists largely o f import
duties, tourism receipts, dividends from state-owned enterprises and resort lease rentals. Both tax
and non-tax revenues are driven mainly by the fortunes o f the tourism sector. The downturn in
tourism with the onset o f the global economic crisis has led to a decline in tourist related revenues
(direct tourism tax revenues have declined sharply) bringing the unsustainable level o f government
expenditures into sharp ~ O C U S . ~

  The average growth rate in the number o f public employees over this period was 6.5 percent implying that that bulk o f
the wage bill increase was due to wage increases.
* In late 2004, the country was hit by the tsunami that devastated many parts o f South Asia. I t displaced 29,000 people
from their homes and caused damage equivalent to 62 percent o f GDP.
  The fiscal deficit including grants was 13.6 percent in 2008 and i s expected to be 26 percent o f GDP in 2009.
Historically, grants have been between 2 and 5 percent o f GDP.

   12.     Fiscal imbalances mirror external imbalances. Accelerating government expenditure
   since 2004 played a role in driving up imports to over 90 percent o f GDP in 2008. The multi-year
   boom in food and fuel prices, and strong demand for resort-related construction materials prior to
   the onset o f the global crisis, also contributed to the exceptional import growth o f recent years. The
   pace o f import growth far outstripped the robust growth in export o f services (especially tourism)
   prior to the crisis. Consequently, large and growing current account deficit resulted, reaching 53
   percent o f GDP in 2008. With the sharp decline in commodity prices in the first half o f 2009 and
   extensive foreign exchange rationing, pressures on the import bill have eased and the deficit is
   expected to fall to 30 percent o f GDP in 2009.

   13.     Financing the current account deficit has become increasingly difficult. Deficits were
   mainly financed through private capital inflows, foreign borrowing by commercial banks and
   official financing (multilateral and bilateral) until mid-2008. But since then, private capital inflows
   have slowed and foreign banks have cut credit facilities to domestic branches during the current
   financial crisis. The Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) has relied on drawing down foreign
   exchange reserves to cover the balance. Gross official reserves were bolstered in mid-March with

                                                                                                                      4
the disbursement o f US$50 million o f a US$lOO million loan from the Indian Government.
However, reserves quickly f e l l back from a peak o f US$267 million. Gross reserves have fluctuated
below 3 months o f imports throughout 2009.

14.    Low and declining foreign exchange reserves r i s k s underminingthe exchange rate peg.
The rufiyaa has been pegged to the U dollar at a rate o f MVR12.8 since 2001. The low reserve
                                         S
cover has meant that the MMA i s rationing foreign exchange in the economy. The real effective
excliange rate has appreciated 12 percent since mid-2008, but remains below levels reached in
2005. Consumer price inflation has been declining in recent months, driven in large part by falling
international commodity prices relative to 2008. The recent depreciation o f the U S dollar against
major international currencies i s also helping to contain real exchange rate appreciation pressures.

15.     Recent IMF analysis o f the real effective exchange rate indicates that the gains o f a
devaluation o r a move to a floating regime would be small and uncertain while the costs
would be substantial. In particular, the typical benefits associated with expenditure switching after
a devaluation would be limited by the extremely small non-tradable sector in the economy. As such,
there are almost no import-substituting sectors in the economy. Moreover, analysis based on
purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates suggests that the currency i s only modestly
overvalued. The core source o f external imbalances i s not the real effective exchange rate (REER),
but the recent fiscal expansion.

16.     Macroeconomic imbalances and the global crisis have also put stress on the banking
system. Expansionary fiscal policy and high budget deficits led to dramatic public sector
credit expansion in 2008 and the first half of 2009. In the absence o f an effective non-bank
sector, much o f the domestic financing requirement falls on the banking sector. This public sector
credit expansion i s crowding out private sector credit and putting the banks' balance sheets at risk.
Foreign exchange rationing i s also exposing banks to dollar liquidity shocks. These stresses are
compounded by the bank's high exposure to tourism, the concentration o f loans to a few borrowers,
and limited financing options (e.g., lines o f credit, parent financing) since the onset o f the global
financial crisis. Consequently, the risk o f growing non-performing loans i s rising. The state-owned
Bank o f Maldives (BML), which accounts for,about 40 percent o f commercial bank assets, saw i t s
non-performing-loans ratio increase significantly last year. More broadly, the net foreign asset
position o f the banking sector has been negative since July 2008, leaving the banks susceptible to a
possible depreciation o f the rufiyaa.

                       B. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

   17.     A return to robust economic growth in 2010 and beyond will depend heavily on a
   rebound in the tourism sector. A stronger-than-expected recovery in Europe - the largest tourist
   sending region - would help boost tourist arrivals, real GDP growth and government revenues. A
   rebound in global growth and an easing o f global credit constraints would also help foreign direct
   investment and stalled resort developments to pick up. GDP i s expected to contract by 4 percent in
   2009 after growing 5.8 percent in 2008 and 7.2 percent in 2007. While foreign exchange rationing
   and a decline in fish catch also contributed to the result, the main driver o f the growth slowdown
   has been a fall in tourist arrivals. Recent tourist arrivals data suggest that the expected rebound in
   the tourist sector in 2010 may materialize, but perhaps not by enough to help generate much more
   than 3 percent real GDP growth.

                                                                           6
18.      Signs o f a rebound in tourism are evident in the latest arrival numbers. Tourist arrivals
data show a pick-up from the bottom reached in July in the second h a l f o f 2009. Following an 11
percent year-on-year increase in arrivals in October, tourist arrivals increased by 7 percent in
November. Revised projections now point to a seasonally adjusted decline o f 3.5 percent in 2009
compared to a 7 percent decline anticipated at the beginning o f the year. The recent depreciation o f
the dollar against the Euro and major Asian currencies has helped boost the competitiveness o f the
sector. The growing share o f Asian tourists seen in the last decade is another factor that may bode
well for prospects for the rest o f this year, as many Asian countries are emerging from the global
financial crisis quicker than other regions.

19.     Traditionally, the fisheries sector has also been an engine o f growth. While a distance
second compared to the tourism sector, the sector does account for about 10 percent o f GDP and is
the only other significant source o f foreign exchange for the e ~ o n o m y .Fish catch levels have been
                                                                               ~
o n a continual decline since 2006. The causes o f the drop in fish-catch are poorly understood, but
may be related to changing ocean currents or fuel price increases. The total volume o f fish exports
(excluding live fish) dropped by 38 percent in the first half o f 2009 relative to 2008 and earning
from fish exports dropped by 43 percent during the period. The current rebound in international
tuna prices will help the fisheries sector outlook.

20.     Financing growing fiscal and external imbalances in recent years has increased the
risk o f debt distress. Deficit financing through unsterilized monetization has made up a growing
share o f total financing, as external options have diminished during the global financial crisis.
Deficit monetization in the form o f government borrowing from the MMA through virtually
unlimited access to the ways and means account made up about 9 percent o f GDP in 2008 and has
accounted for another 10 percent so far this year. Growth in private external debt used to finance
resort construction also grew sharply prior to the onset o f the global financial crisis. Going forward,
the expected large fiscal deficits are assumed to be financed primarily through a combination o f
concessional external funds (including grants) and (to a lesser extent) domestic debt.

21.      The Government's adjustment program, with its focus on fiscal consolidation, aims to
address the root causes o f the current macroeconomic imbalances, preserving the exchange
rate regime at its current level. In essence, Government efforts are aimed at reducing the fiscal
deficit through a reduction o f the wage bill -while protecting social spending - and introducing new
revenue measures to broaden, the tax base. These actions are being supported by a tightening o f
domestic currency liquidity and a halting o f the monetization o f the fiscal deficit. While there are
implementation risks, this well-focused Government program i s adequate to restore macroeconomic
balances, the pre-requisite for putting the economy back on track and restoring growth.

22.      The recent joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis indicates that Maldives i s at a
moderate risk o f public external debt distress (Annex 4). Vulnerabilities related to total public
debt are higher, and addressing them will require timely implementation o f the authorities' strong
fiscal adjustment program. The borrowing space in the short and medium terms has shrunk after the
recent accumulation o f large fiscal and external deficits. The build-up o f private external debt prior
to the onset o f the global financial crisis and o f public domestic debt (mainly owed to the Maldives
Monetary Authority, MMA) in the last two years has intensified the debt burden. Key risks for debt

 The sector employs about 11 percent o f the workforce and fish processing accounts for the bulk o f manufacturing
activity and domestic merchandise exports.

                                                          7
sustainability are large future shocks to exports or fiscal policy slippages. This assessment rests
heavily on the implementation o f the Government's proposed fiscal adjustment. Recent growth in
private external debt increases the risk o f external debt distress. Private external debt adds about 40
percentage points to the external public debt to GDP ratio, putting the total external debt ratio at 77
percent. Much o f this debt i s at maturities o f less than 10 years, at market interest rates and
denominated in U.S. dollars. The stock has accelerated in recent years in line with the boom in
resort construction prior to the global financial crisis. Given the rationing o f foreign exchange in
the economy currently, servicing this debt is becoming increasingly difficult. Implementation o f the
Government's reform program will help to reduce foreign exchange rationing.

                 C. POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT

23.     Returning to positive rates o f economic growth i s a pre-requisite for sustaining the
country's impressive progress in improving human development outcomes. Despite the
challenges o f a dispersed population, the Maldives has achieved notable development progress in
recent decades through a combination o f private sector-led tourism development and improving
public service provision. Annual real GDP growth has averaged over seven percent in the last 25
years, contributing to a sharp reduction in poverty. Poverty rates, as measured by the headcount
ratio, have fallen steeply, from 4Opercent in 1997 to 28 percent in 2004.5

24.     Other human development indicators - infant mortality, maternal mortality, o r
educational attainment - have registered similar improvements. The country i s on track to meet
most o f the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and has already met the MDGs on
eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, reducing child
mortality, improving maternal health, and combating HIV/AIDS , malaria and other diseases6
Efforts to promote gender equality and empower women, as well as ensuring environmental
sustainability and effective climate adaptation will need to be sustained to reach these MDGs.
Moreover, while poverty has declined sharply overall in recent years, vulnerability and inequality
are a concern, as a significant number o f people fell ba'ck into poverty during the recent crisis, and
the disparities between remote islands with small populations and the capital Male region remain
substantial.

25.     The Government i s seeking to consolidate human development gains while also
responding to the current challenges. The SAP seeks to increase the quality o f service provision
to a standard commensurate with the country's income levels. It also aims to address key emerging
issues such as vulnerability, malnutrition, fertility, and youth unemployment which represent
significant implications for other aspects o f social and human development, including education
and economic productivity. The current macroeconomic crisis i s an additional challenge to the
successful implementation o f i t s development plans, but the approach adopted by Government i s
one that seeks to address the short-term challenge o f crisis management while still ensuring that the
core principles o f i t s development plan remain intact.


                      D. THE GOVERNMENT'S CRISIS RESPONSE AND MEDIUM-TERM
                                      DEVELOPMENT PLAN

26.     The Government's measures are designed to regain macroeconomic stability and lay
the foundations for future economic growth. The SAP aims to redefine the role o f the state in
the economy to achieve upper-middle income status, ensure more equitable access to services and
opportunities, improve service delivery, facilitate economic diversification, and support better
environmental practices to sustain growth and adapt to global climate change. M u c h o f the plan is
to be implemented through the private sector where possible or public-private partnerships (PPPs).
Ultimately the SAP seeks to establish an integrated transport network, ensure affordable living

  The GoM reports these poverty rates in the PRSP based on a poverty line of Rf. 15 per day, which i s equivalent to US$ 1.17 using
the nominal exchange rate, or US$3.45 in purchasingpower parity (PPP) terms. Recent poverty rates are not available. However, the
impact of the current global economic crisis could be expected to have increasedthe poverty rates.

costs, provide affordable housing, ensure affordable and quality healthcare and stem the entry o f
narcotics into the country.

27.     A fundamental component o f the Government's SAP i s to engage the private sector in
the provision o f goods and services that are currently being provided by the state. A policy
that includes privatization o f state owned enterprises, setting up joint ventures with the domestic
and international investors, corporatization o f state entities and a program o f public private
partnerships would guide implementation o f the S A P . The Privatization Committee, composed o f
cabinet members, and other Government officials and chaired by the Minister o f C i v i l Aviation, has
been set up to implement the Government's vision. All three IFIs - the World Bank Group, the
Fund and the ADB - are supporting complementary components o f the Government's plan.

28.      The Government's long term development plan i s an ambitious new vision f o r
Maldives. It reflects a commitment to fundamentally changing the economic system o f the country
to one that i s based on private sector led investment and underpinned by good governance and
strong accountability. At the same time, the Government recognizes that the new democratic
political system needs careful nurturing to entrench it and promote i t s growth. The Government's
ability to deliver on these promises has been compromised by the impacts o f the global financial
crisis, the unsustainable fiscal expenditures inherited from the previous administration and the
challenge o f weak capacity across all levels o f Government.

29.      Fully recognizing the severity of the immediate situation, the Government has been
active in the last few months implementing a coherent stabilization program supported by
IMF financing. The main element o f the Government's program i s expenditure reduction. It has
implemented wage cuts for the public service in October 2009 and has cut domestically financed
capital expenditures. Regarding public service reforms, implementation o f the redundancies
planned for 2009 and 20 10 is underway with 1,200 o f the expected 9,000 redundancies taking place
from July to November 2009. Plans for the reduction o f the additional staff are being developed and
discussed with the C i v i l Service Commission. The Government has also increased the electricity
tariff charged by state-owned electricity company (STELCO) by an average o f 35 percent (for Male
residents, with increases for the rest o f the country planned for early 2010). These actions have
taken place in an extremely challenging environment, particularly considering the lack o f a
parliamentary majority for the Government.

30.     Revenue measures also figure prominently in the Government's program. Plans are
underway to introduce a goods and services tax on the tourism sector, which will be additional to
the existing flat-rate bed tax, and to accelerate implementation o f the business profits tax. The
goods and services tax will be applied to the other sectors o f the economy by 201 1. The
Government has also stopped monetizing the deficit. The overriding objective o f these measures i s
to put government revenues on a more stable and reliable basis.

31.    These measures are expected to place the fiscal deficit on a sustainable path. The fiscal
consolidation measures taken by the Government are expected to reduce the fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) from an expected 28 percent o f GDP in 2009 to less than 5 percent o f GDP in
2012. The weight o f the measures will come into effect in 2010 and in 201 1 where the deficit i s
expected to decline to 18.9 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively. Complementary measures are
being taken through a tightening o f monetary policy and measures to strengthen the capital and

                                                  10
liquidity position o f the banking sector. The Government expects that these measures will promote
faster economic growth by providing a stronger macroeconomic policy framework and reducing
external financing constraints. With successful implementation o f this program, the team's
assessment i s that the macroeconomic policy stance o f the Maldives i s adequate (see Annex 2).

32.      The austerity measures are to be complemented with social support measures. In
addition to severance packages that are mandated under the Civil Service Act the government plans
to introduce a retraining program for those that lose their jobs in the public service. They have also
announced plans for student loans and loans for those who wish to start small and medium sized
enterprises. For the poor and vulnerable who will be most affected by the increase in electricity
tariffs the Government will introduce targeted consumer subsidies. Section IV provides additional
detail on these measures.

                                  Box 1. Key Features o f the IMF Program

 The IMF program i s a blended financing arrangement comprising: (a) SDR 49.2 million (or 600 percent o f quota)
 Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) over 36-months, and (b) SDR 8.2 million (100 percent o f quota) Exogenous Shock
 Facility-High Access Component over 24-months. In U S $ terms the (combined) assistance amounts to $92.5 million
 over 3-years. The core o f the policy framework that underlies the program i s a strong fiscal adjustment to contain
 aggregate demand and put public finances back on a sustainable medium-term path. Fiscal measures are
 complemented by monetary tightening and measures to strengthen the banking sector.

 Fiscal measures
         Reduction in civil service wages o f between 10 and 20 percent depending on rank. This adjustment w i l l be
         reversed when domestic Government revenues reach 7 billion rufiyaas, which i s projected for 201 1.
         Civil service staff reductions to total 9,000 by end-2010. O f these, some 3,200 civil servants w i l l be
         transferred to the private sector through the Government's corporatization process.
         Operational spending and non-priority domestically financed capital spending are also to be reduced by 2
         percent o f GDP and 1 percent respectively (prior action).
         Electricity tariffs raised by 40 to 60 percent depending on consumption bracket (prior action) and a
         mechanism for automatic price revision in step with global o i l prices w i l l be implemented.
         Revenue measures include an increase in the airport tax rate o f 29 percent, the expansion o f the business
         profits tax (structural benchmark), introduced o f a 6 percent ad valorem hotel room tax (structural
         benchmark), and the introduction o f a goods and services tax by early 201 1 (structural benchmark).

 Monetary measures
        Monetary policy w i l l support fiscal adjustment efforts by tightening domestic liquidity in order to stem
        reserve losses. Halting the monetization o f the fiscal deficit has been key in this regard. Domestic fmancing
        o f the deficit w i l l be restricted to t-bill placements. An auction system for t-bill placements w i l l be set up
        by end-2009 (structural benchmark).
        The Government debt stock with the MMA has been converted into tradable securities (prior action).
        In August, the MMA started using these securities as collateral to conduct open market operations (OMOs)
        through reverse repos, another attempt at tightening monetary policy.
        Under the program no adjustment to the exchange rate regime i s anticipated as the combination o f strong
        fiscal adjustment and monetary tightening i s expected to relieve pressure on the exchange rate. In the event
        that the proposed measures prove insufficient to curb pressure on the rufiyaa, the authorities would seek
        alternative policy action including a possible adjustment to the exchange rate regime.

 Financial Sector Measures
         Strengthen the financial position o f the Bank o f Maldives. The Government has signaled their intention to
         restructure BML's portfolio, ensure rapid action for recovery o f collateral on defalted debt, and if
         necessary, secure a capital infusion. The Government's preferred option i s to find a strategic partner to
         take over the State's shares.
         The authorities w i l l seek passage o f the Banking Law and the reforms to the M M A Act by end-2010
         (structural benchmark).

1 1 BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

               A. L I N K T O C A S

34.    The Maldives Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was jointly prepared by the Bank
and the IFC and approved by the Board on January 8,2008. The proposed World Bank Group
assistance program seeks to further three strategic development outcomes: (a) a well-managed
economy attracting increased investment; (b) increased quality o f education in support o f a better

                                                             12
skilled workforce; and (c) improved capacity to manage the country's pristine, but fragile, natural
environment.

35.    The CAS rests on three pillars:

           0   Pillar I Economic and fiscal governance, aiming to support the Government's
                        :
               efforts to manage i t s economy and finances better, while strengthening the
               investment climate.
           0           1
               Pillar 1 : Human development and social protection, seeking to strengthen the quality
               o f public services for human development and social protection.
                       1:
               Pillar 1 1 Environmental management, bolstering efforts to strengthen environmental
               management capacity and skills, build a sound knowledge base to better address the
               environmental risks facing the country, mitigate threats to nature based tourism by
               improving environmental infrastructure, and implement a strategy to build climate
               resilience and adapt to the impending risks o f climate change.

36.     These pillars and strategic outcomes were to be supported through IDA credits,
strategic I F C investments and Advisory Services and a flexible program of AAA. IDA
investment loans programmed in the CAS for FY08 and FY09 included the three new IDA
operations proposed in the CAS - mobile phone banking, environmental management and pension
administration - that have now been approved by the Board. For the last three years o f the CAS
period, the strategy proposed a programmatic, policy-based investment model and assumed that the
Bank Group program would be more specifically defined as part o f the CAS Progress Report
process.

37.     Staff have initiated work on the CAS Progress Report which will examine CAS
implementationand results to date, and discuss the future direction of the Bank's program. In
September 2009, an all-day workshop was held with Government officials, including President
Nasheed and key ministers. The meeting included most o f the Bank's regional management team
and senior Bank and I F C staff working o n the Maldives. Key results from the retreat and
subsequent staff consultations with Government indicate that the three original pillars o f the CAS
have remained broadly valid, while the Government would like specific support in the following
areas: i)macroeconomic (especially fiscal) reform with particular emphasis on civil service reforms
and technical assistance to retrain retrenched public servants , i )creating the framework for PPP
                                                                  i
                               i)
and support for transactions, i i improving the social safety net, iv) good governance, specifically
to initiate diagnostic work needed to help develop the Government's Governance and Anti-
Corruption Strategy, v) economic diversification, vi) employment, and vii) climate change. Given
the need for policy reform in the country and the limited resources available for project preparation
and AAA, the preferred approach for IDA i s to use the development policy lending instrument,
while also providing TA in a few key areas.

38.    This proposed operation i s aligned with the CAS - especially Pillar 1 but also the
second pillar with includes social protection. The CAS calls for a possible development policy
operation in FY 10. The policy actions supported by this proposed operation would be focused on
helping the Government to put in place key elements to support economic growth.




                                                 13
               B. COLLABORATION WITH IMF AND OTHER DONORS

39.      The Bank has been working in close coordination with the IMF and the ADB to put
together complementary programs o f support for the Government's reform package. Bank
and Fund staff have carried out regular consultations to align programs o f support. Three joint
missions were undertaken between June and September 2009, with one being a tripartite mission
that included an ADB representative to work on the debt sustainability analysis. An important
component o f the collaboration has been agreeing to a division o f labor that builds on each
institutions' comparative advantages and the past areas o f engagement with the Government. The
teams have also been careful to realize implementation capacity constraints o f the Government.
The ADB and the IMF have taken the lead on various areas o f tax reform, while the Bank i s taking
the lead on aspects o f medium-term expenditure reform, budget implementation and social safety
nets. The ADB i s working closely with the Government on i t s privatization agenda, while the
World Bank and IFC are focused on public-private partnership (PPP) aspects o f the agenda.7

40.     IF1 financing will support the Government's economic growth promotion efforts. The
IMF Board in early December approved a 36-month combined Stand-By Arrangement and External
Shocks Facility o f US$92.5 million (or 700 percent o f quota). The ADB approved a US$35 million
budget support operation half disbursed in 2010 and a roughly equal amount planned for
disbursement in mid-2011. The Bank i s proposing a single tranche DPC o f US$13.7 million this
year, which could be followed by another operation o f similar value next year. The operations are
presented in a programmatic series and include a medium-term framework o f support, given the
protracted nature o f the challenges that the Government i s facing. The coordinated programs o f
support from IFIs will be a critical input for mobilizing additional support for the Government at a
Donors' Forum scheduled for March o f this year.

               C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

41.     This proposed operation complements each o f the ongoing operations under the
current CAS. The proposed operation has as i t s core objective to aid the Government in regaining
sustained growth and poverty reduction. I t does so in a way that helps build institutional capacity
that can facilitate better service delivery, support a stronger investment climate and promote better
social protection. The ongoing operations include an Integrated Human Development Project
(IHDP) o f $15.6 million approved in May 2004, a Mobile Phone Banking Project (MBP) o f US$7.7
million approved in April 2008, an Environmental Management Project (EMP) for US$l3.2 million
approved in May 2008, a post-Tsunami Emergency project o f US$14 million co-financed by the
European Commission' and a Pension and Social Protection Administration Project (PSAP) for
US$3.6 million approved on May 12, 2009. The Bank i s also preparing a US$9.7 million Climate
Change Trust Fund (CCTF) Program to be financed by the European Commission for delivery in
September 2010.

42.   The ongoing IDA program and this proposed operation are complementary to IFC's
work program in the country. Working towards the agreed strategic development outcomes o f
the World Bank Group CAS for FY 08-12, IFC's main focus in the CAS period to date has been in

' Specifically, the Bank is helping the government to establish a PPP framework, while the IFC is helping them
structure PPP transactions.

four key areas - tourism, financial markets, renewable energyhlimate change and infrastructure.
IFC's advisory services program has assisted the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) in
establishing and strengthening prudential guidelines (e.g. in Islamic Banking) and also provided
technical assistance to help set up a Credit Bureau. During the previous CAS period the I F C
committed a total o f U S $47.8 million in both debt and equity, consisting o f four projects in the
financial, tourism, logistics and telecommunications sectors. I F C has more than doubled its
commitments to about US$103 million (or roughly twice that o f IDA) in the first part o f the current
CAS period (2008 to June 2009).

             D. LESSONS LEARNED

43.     This proposed operation i s the first budget support operation that the Bank will
provide to the Government o f Maldives. As such, there i s no direct experience with providing
budget support that the team can draw on for this operation. The Bank's active engagement with the
Maldives over the years has, however, provided many lessons that the team has drawn o n for the
preparation o f this operation. Key among them is that capacity constraints significantly impact all
parts o f government functions. The
operation aims to carefully prioritize         Figure 3. Maldives: A Capacity Constrained Policy

while at the same time unlocking

             E. ANALYTIC UNDERPINNINGS

44.     The design o f the proposed operation has benefitted from a number o f recent analytic
pieces. The public financial management part o f the program has been informed by the joint Bank-
Fund PEFA assessment as well as the recent Debt Management Performance Assessment
(DeMPA). The public enterprise reform elements o f the program have been based on a recent
diagnostic analysis o f public private partnership arrangements in the country. The social protection
aspects build on a Bank publication - Social Protection in the Maldives: Options for Reforming
Pensions and Safety Nets (World Bank April 2006). Recent TA provided to the authorities in the
area o f public service reform informs that component o f the operation. The macroeconomic
analysis in the report draws on recent analytical work used for input into the recent World Bank
Group/Government Country Assistance Strategy retreat (September 2009), 'the Bank's ongoing
macroeconomic monitoring reports and IMF analysis during the course o f recent joint missions and
the preparation o f their proposed Stand-By Arrangement.

IV. THE PROPOSEDDEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT

               A. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES

45.    The proposed development policy credit aims to underpin the Government's efforts to
restore economic growth and protect the vulnerable. There are three main areas o f the
Government's plan that this proposed operation will support:

      a. Public Financial Management: There are several             institutional changes that the
         Government is working o n t o ensure that budget preparation, implementation and
         monitoring processes are improved so as to support the delivery o f credible budgets within a
         sustainable medium-term framework. The proposed operation will focus o n changes t o the
         medium-term expenditure framework, within year monitoring o f budget outturns and
         improving overall budget accountability.

      b. Public Enterprise Reform: A key principle o f the Government's development plan i s to
         reduce the role o f the state in the economy. It i s also seen as a way t o underpin the fiscal
         austerity measures t o help ensure their sustainability. The proposed operation aims to guide
         the drive for PPPs in a way that minimizes future fiscal risks t o the Government and ensures
         that the privatization process i s conducted transparently and communicated effectively to
         relevant stakeholders.

      c. Social Protection: The Government's fiscal measures, especially the increase in STELCO's
         tariff structure, necessitate well targeted safety net programs to cushion the impact o f rising
         prices. Existing safety net programs are ad hoc and overlapping, and the Government
         intends to unify and improve them over time. In the meantime, the Government is
         introducing electricity, water and food subsidies t o protect poor households from the rise in
         utility prices. This and the next proposed operation will support the development o f a new
         eligibility criteria for the recently introduced subsidies, while helping to build the
         foundations for a more harmonized national social protection system.

46.    The Government's reform program warrants rapid financial and analytic response
from the Bank. Even under normal circumstances the Government's development plan would
warrant Bank and other donor support given limited domestic resources. The effect o f the current
global financial crisis has exposed a legacy o f poor fiscal policy that is in urgent need o f
rebalancing in conjunction with significant external financing. The Government has presented a
credible reform plan that aims t o address the current fiscal imbalances and restore growth. The
Bank's financial support i s a key complement to the IMF and ADB financing that is expected this
year and next. Additionally, the proposed areas o f support identified for this operation may help in
harnessing other donor financing during the Maldives Donor's Forum planned for end-March 2010.


               B. DESIGN AND FOCUS OF THE PROPOSED OPERATION

47.    Policy actions supported by this proposed operation are focused on helping the
Government to restore the economic fundamentals for a growth recovery. The focus o n public
financial management by addressing key institutional shortcomings in budget preparation and

                                                    16
implementation aims to enable the Ministry o f Finance and Treasury t o recognize budget overruns
early so that they can be addressed early. The focus o n public enterprise reform supports the
Government's ambitious public private partnership program, while underpinning fiscal
sustainability. The social protection measures help cushion the impact o f what is t o be a significant
structural change in the economy.

48.     The policy actions supported by this proposed operation have been chosen
strategically from the Government's broad reform agenda. The choice o f the policy actions
reflect the enormous challenge o f marshalling the limited Government capacity to undertake
measures that will help regain fiscal sustainability. L i k e several other small-island economies,
capacity o f Government i s not commensurate with typical indicators o f the level o f development. In
this context, the policy actions are focused o n the critically important elements o f the reform
program that are realistically achievable and set the basis for future economic growth. The
proposed programmatic structure o f the operation also supports the Government's effort t o build
reform momentum during i t s early tenure in Government and allows the Bank t o gauge
implementation progress.




                                                  17
                                Box 2. Application o f Good Practice Principles
                                 on Development Policy Lending Operations

        Principle 1: Reinforce ownership

        The proposed operation i s closely aligned with the Government's priorities documented in the SAP,
        with its ambition to implement their development plan through PPPs where possible. The program
        chooses those policy measures that the Government deems essential to the successful
        implementation of their program while complementingother donor assistance.

         Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a
         coordinated accountability framework

        The policy matrix that underpins this proposed operation was developedjointly with the Maldivian
        authorities and was discussed with the ADB and the IMF during i t s development phase to align with
        their programs of support.

         Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to
         country circumstances

         Given the urgent need to reduce macroeconomic imbalances in the economy, the proposed
         operation has been designed under IDA'SFast Track Facility. The timing, design, and scope o f the
         operation are thus customized based on this urgency, but also on the limited capacity of the
         Government. Nevertheless, it i s fblly consistent with the Government's medium-term plans for
         poverty reduction and improved service delivery.

         Principle 4: Streamline critical actions for achieving results

        The proposed operation i s the first in a proposed programmatic series. The prior actions for the first
        operation are limited to 4, while the triggers for the proposed second operation have been limited to
        8. The Government's policy actions number well over 30 when considering the actions under the
        programs of support from the IMF and the ADB. The prior actions and triggers considered here are
        focused on achieving key results under the Government's program and are supported by milestones
        that aim to provide analytic support for sound implementation.

         Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance
         based financial support

        Progress made with implementation of reforms and achievement of outcome goals will be
        monitored through regular macroeconomic updates and discussed frequently with the authorities.
        These activities will provide clear guidance to the Government for when and if the resources
        associated with the second proposed operation would flow to Government.



Public Financial Management

49.     The current fiscal crisis has brought into focus the long-standing weaknesses in
budgetary processes. The current fiscal imbalances are due in part to expenditure policies that
were not based o n a realistic forecast o f Government revenues. The Bank has been working with
the authorities in recent years to help implement a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. A key
result o f this work has been the presentation o f the 2009 budget in a 3-year framework. A key
challenge moving forward would be to instill greater realism into budgets by adopting conventional
GFS standards. Realism has been inhibited by the requirements o f the Public Finance A c t to show

                                                        18
balanced budgets each year. One way authorities achieve this result is to include all expected
privatization receipts and the sale o f state assets as a revenue item.g Implementing expenditure
policies on the basis o f highly uncertain revenue outturns has been one reason for the rise o f
expenditures to unsustainable levels. A joint Bank-Fund Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment was recently completed in October 2009 and a comprehensive
action plan for improvement has been agreed, which will be monitored during the implementation
o f the proposed program.

50.     The first prior action in this component o f the program i s to present the 2010 budget
in a 3-year rolling framework that conforms to Government Finance Statistics 1986. The GFS
presentation will be made in parallel to the existing formulation until a change to the Public Finance
Act can be made. The objective o f this action i s to reduce the over-optimism on fiscal deficit
projections once the fiscal consolidation efforts are undertaken. Re-establishing the Macroeconomic
Coordinating Committee (MECC) ahead o f the presentation o f the 2010 budget and setting a
timetable for regular meetings and outputs will help move the MTEF beyond simply a tool used for
presentational purposes to a more credible policy instrument.

51.     Weak expenditure control and monitoring i s also inhibiting the use o f the MTEF as a
policy tool. The budget preparation process still has a one-year focus. The initial annual budget
allocations are typically in line with medium-term government priorities, but these allocations
change considerably during the year. The final allocations are made based on ad-hoc decisions due
to inadequate (and not up to date) knowledge o f budget outturns and arbitrary developments in the
processing o f project loans and grants, rather than being driven by systematic, medium-term
objectives. The lack o f a transparent budget release and the absence o f reliable and timely reporting
mechanisms, leads to an ad-hoc, non-transparent approach to in-year budget adjustments.

52.     The Bank has been working with Government to produce reliable and timely
reporting mechanisms through implementation of a Public Accounting System (PAS). The
PAS project is expected to lead to the development o f a modern public accounting and financial
management information system that will automate many aspects o f the accounting and budget
management o f government. PAS will facilitate substantial improvements in budget execution,
internal control, cash management, accounting and fiscal reporting. With full implementation i t can
create a basis for improvements in budget planning and in management o f fiscal risks. PAS
implementation reached an important milestone in M a y 2009 when it became operational with
respect to general ledger and payment processing for Male-based agencies. The system has n o w
been fully implemented in Phase I agencies (Ministry o f Finance & Treasury, Customs and
Department o f Inland Revenue).

53.     The second prior action in this component o f the program i s to implement Phase I1 o f
the PAS project in three government agencies. Five key government agencies have been
targeted for Phase two implementation - President's Office, Department o f National Planning, C i v i l
Service Commission, Ministry o f Education, and Addu Atoll o f which the rollout to the former
three was completed in December 2009 and the other two in early 2010. Implementation o f this
prior action will support the requirement under the L a w on Public Finance 2006 (effective in 2009)
to produce financial statements o f the Government, which have not yet been prepared and
9
  The Auditor General's Report o f 2008 on government finances i s highly critical o f the budget presentation that i s
required under the Public Finance Act.

                                                            19
published. To date, the annual budget provides a 'budget to actual' utilization report, which
contains spending estimates but does not consist o f financial statements prepared using acceptable
standards. Triggers for the proposed second operation are to (a) publish the first audited financial
statements o Government for 2009 and (6) issue revised Public Finance regulations (including
            f
procurement regulations) to establish adherence to internationally accepted public sector
accounting standards, enhancing internal control pamework and improving spending eflciency.
The objective o f these measures is to underpin fiscal expenditure discipline in the face o f revenue
shocks to maintain fiscal discipline at both the sectoral and macro level.

54.     Cash and debt management practices add to budget uncertainty. Cash flows are
estimated by the Treasury on an annual basis but not updated periodically. The Treasury makes
cash in- and outflow forecasts for the 12 months o f the budget year based on past seasonal patterns.
I t does not use expenditure planning information from line ministries. The MMA has generally
accommodated cash flow shortages by providing T-bills to the banking system (on behalf o f the
Government) and/or providing access to the Ways and Means account and extending direct short
term loans. The Treasury does not provide any in-year cash f l o w updates to the MMA. Debt
management operations suffer from lack o f capacity to perform basic functions o f debt recording
and reporting, and a lack o f coordination among key agencies, especially the MMA, making debt
service projections that go into the budget highly uncertain.

55.        The third prior action in this component o f the operation i s for the Government to
prepare a forecasting methodology for monthly revenues that can be updated monthly and
presented to the Fiscal Affairs and Economic Policy Division o f the MoFT. The objective o f
t h i s prior action i s to provide policy makers with an updated position o f government revenues and
the outlook to reduce the fiscal impact o f revenue shocks. It also aims to support the Government in
making timely in-year budget adjustments.

56.     Capital expenditure policy i s also a key source o f budget uncertainty. Capital
expenditures are heavily influenced by the Government's Public Sector Investment Program
(PSIP). The annual PSIP is prepared by the M o F T and its composition i s determined on the basis
o f an indicative domestic resource figure as well funds available through external aid. A key
shortcoming o f the PSIP process i s the insufficient regard for future recurrent cost implications o f
new capital projects, which i s in part due to the focus o f the budget process on one-year planning."
The PSIP process also suffers from inadequate analysis o f the economic viability, a rationalization
o f using public resources for the proposed activity, or an investigation o f the opportunity costs o f
choosing a particular project. A trigger for the proposed second operation is to unzjj the PSIP with
the rest o capital and recurrent expenditures on a 3-year basis.
          f

57.     The fourth action in this component o f the program i s to construct a single unified
public sector pay and employment database. One of the key challenges preventing the MoFT
from making within year budget adjustments is the lack o f timely information on expenditure
outturns. A key component o f expenditures i s the. wage bill for public servants. While there i s data
on the number o f public servants employed and their pay packages, there is no one unified and
reconciled database that i s updated regularly. T o address this issue, the fourth prior action is to


 Although
lo             in recent years actual capital expenditures tended to be lower than budgeted due to implementation capacity
constraints.

                                                            20
establish a comprehensive database o f all public sector employees and their total pay packages that
can be updated semi-annually until the human resources module o f the public accounts system is
fully functional. Each month the M o F T will monitor the treasury's disbursement figures for the
salary bill, by base pay and allowances, and compare against the baseline figures o f the database so
that accurate budget out-turns can be measured during the year.

58.     The appointment o f the first independent Auditor General in 2008 was an important
step toward improving governance in Maldives. Until April 2007, the Auditor General's Office
(AGO) reported to the President and the audit reports were not sent to or scrutinized by the
Parliament. An IDF Grant provided by the World Bank in 2006 helped enact the Audit Act o f 2007
which established AGO as the Supreme Audit Institution. Under the new AG, risk based strategic
audits for 2008 were conducted across central government audit entities, some o f which had not
been audited for decades. The nature o f audit was expanded from the detailed transactions-level
compliance audits to include performance audits and the audit reports were posted on AGO website
as soon as they were tabled in the People's Majlis. This received extensive public interest and the
Auditor General held press conferences in providing ex-post oversight over government systems o f
PFM. In spite o f having had considerable impact, much needs to be done to follow up on these
audit findings and enhance the scope and coverage o f the other accountability institutions in
Maldives such as the office o f the Attorney General, Tender Evaluation Board, the Anti-Corruption
Commission and the Prosecutor General's Office.

Public Enterprise Reform

59.      I n his first Presidential address to Parliament, President Nasheed made it clear that
his Government would change the role o f the state in the economy. A fundamental component
o f the Government's Strategic Action Plan would be to engage the private sector in the provision o f
goods and services that had previously been provided by the state. A policy that includes
privatization o f state owned enterprises, setting up joint ventures with the domestic and
international investors, corporatization o f state entities and a program o f public private partnerships
would guide implementation o f the SAP. The Privatization Committee, composed o f cabinet
members and other Government officials and chaired by the Minister o f C i v i l Aviation and
Communication, has been set up to implement the Government's vision.

60.     There are a number of reasons why public enterprise reform, a privatization agenda
and public private partnerships (PPPs) are important for Maldives. These include: (i)            better
public financial discipline, (ii)fiscal benefits in terms o f lump sum receipts, ongoing revenues and
reduced expenditures, (iii)  greater economic efficiency - better labor and capital productivity, (iv)
improved service delivery, and (v) the introduction o f private sector innovation to the operation and
financing o f service delivery. These benefits are not unique to Maldives, but are particularly
relevant in the current context where the recent history o f increasing government expenditures
together with the expansion o f the civil service and lack o f focus on service delivery precipitated
the current fiscal imbalances.

61.      The Government has been quite active in the area o f public enterprise reform. Their
initiatives have been structured on three pillars: (a) cost recovery, (b) privatization, and (c)
corporatization. In the current context, pillar (a) is viewed as a precursor for either (b) or (c). Under
the cost recovery pillar, an important milestone was reached when STELCO implemented a new

                                                  21
electricity tariff schedule beginning November 2009 and launched a fuel surcharge that activates
when the price o f diesel goes above a threshold level. Under the privatization pillar, the
Government is in advanced stages o f privatizing the national airport, it recently sold a 7 percent
stake in Dhiraagu Telecom and will be selling i t s remaining stake to the public via the Maldives
Stock Exchange.' Under the corporatization pillar, the Government signed a management contract
in November 2009 with a provider for management o f the secondary school in Male. TV Maldives
(TVM) and the radio channel Voice o f Maldives (VOM)) have become publicly held companies.

62.    The Bank and the IFC have been working with the Government to effectively
implement its ambitious agenda in this area. While both institutions agree with the principles o f
the Government's plans, they have cautioned the Privatization Committee (PC) members and other
members o f Government against rushing implementation. Political opposition i s building up against
the proposed privatizations, while several stakeholders claim that transparency can be improved.
Government can also do more to enhance i t s communications strategy and to foster stakeholder
debate on the privatization drive. The l i s t o f intended privatizations needs to be prioritized based o n
an opportunity cost assessment and considering investor appetite in the current global context.
Setting clear expectations o n the timing o f privatizations i s also an important component o f the
communications strategy. Bank and I F C teams have also highlighted the importance t o allow
investors sufficient time to carry out due diligence and to allow advisors time to carry out the
necessary dialogue o n the trade-offs to optimize proceeds from the transaction.'*

63.     The Government has an ambitious PPP agenda. There are a number o f areas o f attention
that are required to make PPPs attainable and sustainable. In particular, the lack o f formal PPP
policy and legislative framework i s a considerable gap. A PPP policy document would lay out the
objectives o f the program and the process t o be followed. Beyond this, there i s also the need for a
full-time, dedicated and capacitated PPP Unit for implementing the PPP program. Currently there is
n o such unit in place - and Invest Maldives - the secretariat to the PC, has no dedicated staff for
PPPs, and structuring PPP projects i s not part o f their core mandate. Going further the country
would also need to look at developing guidelines and procedures for analyzing, initiating and
procuring PPP projects.

64.     The Bank has already initiated support to the GoM to develop PPP policy and an
implementation framework, and the current program would aim to further build on this
initiative. Earlier this year the Bank undertook a needs assessment o f the PPP reform program. This
assessment highlighted two main areas o f weakness: (i) institutional framework was not
                                                               the
adequate t o ensure a sustainable and successful program, and (ii)       there was inadequate use o f
professional transaction advisers. The current program would attempt to address the first o f these
weaknesses - in establishing an effective institutional (policy, regulatory and program
management) capability, in close collaboration with the IFC. To facilitate this, an important
milestone for this component o f the program is for the Government to produce a PPP strategic
framework paper and submit the report to the Cabinet for guidance. The I F C has already taken the
lead in addressing the second area o f weakness; in collaboration with the Bank, it has secured
important advisory mandates for the airport and the solid waste management company.

   The Government sale t o UK Cable and Wireless implies that Cable and Wireless n o w owns the majority stake in the
telecom.
12
   The Asian Development Bank has an active program o f support for the Government in the area o f privatizations. The
Bank's role has been focused more on the PPP agenda, which i s the focus o f this operation.

Social Protection

65.     Maldives has several social safety net programs, but they are small and fragmented.
Current programs include: (a) the Absolute Poverty Benefit (ABS) scheme introduced in 2003
under which Rf.1000 a month (initially Rf. 500) was provided for highly vulnerable individuals; (b)
a universal (pension-tested) old age allowance o f Rf. 2000 for those aged 65 years and above
introduced in early 2009; (c) a blind allowance o f Rf. 1500 for the legally blind; (d) health
insurance (Madhana) coverage for local medical care for public employees, persons receiving the
ABS and people who are 65 years and older; and (e) several small programs o f assistance for poor
students, persons with disabilities, and health care. However, the coverage o f these programs is
quite limited. The safety net system has very l o w coverage and funding relative to the level o f
income o f the Maldives. In 2004, only 0.3 percent o f the population and 1.6 percent o f the poor
were covered by recurrent transfers; and total safety net spending (outside o f the tsunami benefit)
was 0.2% o f GDP (World Bank 2006). This share has increased dramatically in 2009 with the
introduction o f the old age allowance, which currently covers about 13,500 persons aged 65 and
above.

66.     As a result, the key objective o f protecting the poor i s not being met. Analysis o f the
VPA 2004 household survey data reveals that there are high inclusion and exclusion errors. Without
reforms in targeting efficiency, the current safety net programs are inadequate to alleviate poverty.
In addition, these multiple programs rely on different eligibility criteria even when ostensibly
targeted to the same population. Several o f the criteria used are subjective and information required
to determine eligibility i s unverifiable.

67.      The pension system in the Maldives covers only public sector employees through a
significant subsidy at a high cost to the Government. I t s public sector pension system pays out
after 20 years o f uninterrupted government service and there i s no requirement to retire. Employees
can continue to work for another 20 years and earn another pension. Yet the civil service pension
scheme is not designed to produce a reasonable level o f retirement income. C i v i l servants receive a
pension equivalent to 50 percent o f basic salary after every 20 years o f service and regardless o f
age. In May 2009, the World Bank approved a US$3.8 million credit to assist the Government to
revitalize its pension system under a new implementing authority with the aim o f making the
existing system more financially sustainable and to expand coverage to the rest o f the workforce
over time.

68.     The Government has been clear that improvements in existing social protection
programs and the development of new programs must accompany the fiscal austerity
measures. Both the privatization policy and the removal o f corporate subsidies would tend to
increase the cost o f essential services. The State Electricity Company Limited (STELCO) and the
associated entities which manage power houses in the islands, have provided subsidized electricity
to residential, business, and government customers for many years. The subsidy was paid directly to
STELCO'by the MoFT, and hence was poorly targeted. STELCO's new electricity tariff schedule
beginning November 2009 has the effect o f increasing electricity prices by 35 percent o n average.
The pricing revision also incorporated a fuel surcharge that activates when the price o f diesel goes
above a threshold level. The new tariff schedule differentiates tariffs more substantially across the
types and levels o f electricity usage. In order to provide assistance to the poor who are likely to be
most affected by this reform the Government has initiated an interim subsidy (see below). This

                                                  23
electricity subsidy was introduced in Male in early December 2009 and will be rolled out to the rest
o f the country once the new tariffs are applied nationally.

69.     The milestone for this component o f the program aims to support the Government's
effort to improve the poverty impact o f these proposed subsidies. I t s primary aim i s to support
the development o f a well-designed interim mechanism for targeting poor households that is
fiscally sustainable and consistent with a permanent targeting system. The Government o f Maldives
is currently engaged in identifying households eligible for the proposed subsidies to cushion the
impact o f rising tariffs. A Steering Committee and Working Group has been formed with
representatives from various Ministries t o oversee the design and implementation o f this interim
targeting strategy. At present, the proposed interim targeting tool for these subsidies relies o n self-
reported economic status, mainly per capita daily income. However, self-reported income i s
typically prone t o measurement error and misreporting and is difficult t o verify. The Working
Group is currently exploring alternative methods that could disburse assistance quickly to the poor.
In this regard it is essential t o prepare a PSIA study that assesses the targeting performance o f the
interim support program. It i s also necessary t o determine if the fiscal costs o f the new program are
lower than the old subsidy.

70.      The milestones and the suggested triggers for the next proposed operation aim to
support the Government's eventual transition to an integrated social protection system. While
the subsidies currently proposed are a rapid response t o the current crisis, the Government i s also
concerned about developing a long-term social protection strategy for the Maldives. The
Government has a long term vision o f moving towards an integrated social protection system based
on the rationalization o f the existing programs and the currently proposed subsidies. This integrated
system would rest o n common systems for beneficiary identification (building o n the National
Registry) and a common platform for program delivery. The Government has already started to take
steps in this direction (e.g., there are plans t o discontinue the ABS with the introduction o f the
utility subsidies). However, much needs t o be done to establish the building blocks o f this system
and the targeting mechanism for the proposed subsidies would need t o be consistent both with the
broader fiscal strategy o f the Government and this long term vision. This permanent targeting
mechanism could build o n the interim targeting system currently being developed or it can take an
entirely different form, such as geographic targeting (e.g., based o n poverty mapping), community-
based targeting, or proxy-means testing.

71.     Any effort to unify the current spate of social safety net programs, to ensure that they
better target the poor and vulnerable, and make sure that fiscal costs are limited, must be
underpinned with sound analysis. However, the information currently available for such analysis
i s somewhat outdated (2004 VPA, 2002/03 HIES and 2006 Census). By early 2010, the self-
reported data will be available for some preliminary analysis and the newest round o f the
Household Income and Expenditure Survey will also become available by the end o f 2010 for more
rigorous analysis. In this context, there are two proposed triggers for the next operation. The first i s
to complete an assessment o f the targeting performance and fiscal implications o f the interim
electricity and water subsidies. The second i s to develop a common database for monitoring
beneficiaries o f the social protection programs. In parallel, the Government aims to develop the
strategic proposal for a unified social protection system.

increases will form part o f the PSIA. The Government has been aware o f the urgency o f letting
electricity tariffs reflect international fuel price changes, while simultaneously considering the
effects o f tariff and subsidy changes on poverty and fiscal performance. Prior to the current change
in the tariff schedule electricity subsidies were based on consumer usage only. Preliminary benefit-
incidence analysis indicates that the old subsidies were not pro-poor, since although the level o f
household electricity usage i s positively correlated to the level o f i t s consumption expenditures, the

                                                                      25

73.      Preliminary analysis indicates that the eectricily subsidy under the new electricity
tariff schedule i s an improvement on the old subsidy, but there i s room to improve its
targeting o f the poor. STELGO's new tariff
schedule to residents in Male' coincided with

design that gives different prices according to
the levels o f consumption but r-tlodified i t by

kWh per month) at below cost. A benefit

o f the smallest under the new schedule,
despite some improvements (see right-hand
figure).

71.      A large proportion o f the beneficiaries o f electricity subsidy are non-poor, w h i l e a
substantial number o f poor households does not receive any subsidy. 'I-heshare o f the non-poor
tvfiv are receiving a subsidy aniong total beneficiaries (i,e., leakage rate) i s estimated to be about 90

                                                           26
             a.    A change o f tariffs cannot influence the distribution o f subsidy to poor households
                  that do not have direct access to electricity.

             b. Despite large increases, tariffs are still lower than the marginal cost at almost all
                  consumption levels around which most observations are empirically distributed
                  (which allows most large consumers t o continue t o enjoy subsidies).

             c. The new tariff schedule has given the smallest marginal increase for the middle
                consumption range o f 201-300 kWh, not the lowest consumption (or lifeline tariff)
                  band.

             d. Since the correlation between total household electricity consumption and per capita
                  household income is empirically not strong, the existing tariff design that hinges on
                  has inherent limitations for targeting.

75.     The poor targeting performance o f the new tariff structure supports the GoM's effort
to tackle the problem o f rising prices more directly through either a targeted consumer
subsidy program o r a unified social protection measure. The GoM started the targeted subsidy
program for electricity and water t o the poor in order to address the problem o f rising prices more
directly. Although the details o f the program are s t i l l being developed, a full picture o f the
program, as well as self-report data, will become available by early 2010 for the assessment o f the
targeting performance o f the program and i t s fiscal implications. It i s essential to think through
h o w best data and methods should be combined t o complete the PSIAs in order t o understand the
more comprehensive impact o f the electricity tariff reform o n the poor, which takes into account the
performance o f targeted subsidy program.

76.    To better complement the limitations o f the existing tariff design, the GoM should
instead consider a protection measure that works independent o f the utility tariff schedules.
Preliminary analyses suggest that linking the design and implementation o f a new protection
measure to the existing tariff structures (such as the targeted subsidy program) automatically builds
the constraints o f the tariff designs (e.g., coverage) into the new protection measure. The proposed
long-term transition t o a unified social rotection measure (such as national cash transfer) is
desirable from this point o f view, as wellP) Bank staff will work with the authorities prior to the
second operation t o help make the transition t o a unified social protection measure effective.




 l3 the medium or long run, the poverty monitoring capacity o f the government needs strengthening. The Maldives
   In
currently does not have an official poverty line derived from rigorous methods. This becomes an issue when the
government intends to provide targeted subsidies to poor households whose consumption levels are below a threshold.
Further, the Government poverty measurement has been relying on nominal data, which do not take into account price
differentials across regions (and over time). However, price levels may vary significantly across regions. To the extent
that those differentials exist, making poverty comparisons across different locations could bring complications.
Therefore, it i s desirable to derive an official poverty line using updated and large-scale household expenditure data. In
the medium and long run, the targeted subsidy or transfer programs should be redesigned based on the new poverty line
and targeting mechanism so the same standard i s applied across different locations and time periods.

               B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTSI4

77.     The focus o f this operation i s on promoting fiscal sustainability and setting the stage
for stronger economic growth. As such, it has no direct environmental impact. There is a risk
that the Government's proposed reduction in the public service may further constrain the ability o f
G o M to address the mounting environmental challenges. Mitigating this risk, however, is the IDA
funded Maldives Environmental Management Project that seeks to build capacity, knowledge and
human capital for better environmental management. This would somewhat buffer the sector from
any loss o f staff.

78.    The environment i s the main economic asset o f the country. Sustained economic growth
and poverty reduction rests primarily o n sound environmental stewardship and governance. The
economic and development progress in the Maldives has been exclusively fueled and sustained by
the country's immense marine resource^.*^ Nature-based tourism i s the primary industry
accounting for the bulk o f growth, followed by fishing and fish processing. Apart from their tourist
appeal, the country's marine resources are also an important livelihood asset, particularly in the
remote islands and atolls where they sustain a vibrant fishing industry. Fishing employs about 30
percent o f the work force, is the second largest foreign exchange earner after tourism and i s the
primary source o f animal protein in the Maldivian diet. It i s n o surprise that with such a narrow
economic base, environmental risks translate directly into measurable economic risks to the two
key growth sectors o f the economy.

79.        Environmental concerns are growing. Despite the significance o f i t s marine assets in
fueling prosperity, there i s growing evidence o f unsustainable pressures o n the natural resource
base. An unspoiled marine environment is the major draw card for tourists, hence resorts are
generally well managed, while other inhabited islands suffer from problems o f solid waste and the
f l o w o f raw sewage into relatively stagnant lagoons. O f particular concern is the growing volume o f
waste in areas visited by tourists, with the appearance o f debris o n dive sites, sand-banks and
beaches. Waste disposal is likely to become even more challenging in the future as population
densities rise and prosperity grows. Other threats t o r e e f ecology include intrusive and poorly
planned construction activities that damage or weaken valuable corals, damage caused by divers
and dive boat anchors and the illegal collection o f marine flora.

80.      Climate change poses an additional long term environmental risk to the country.
Geography has rendered the Maldives especially vulnerable to climate change. Being land scarce
and l o w lying (over 80 percent o f the country is less than 1 meter above sea level), the Maldives is
exposed to the risk o f intensifying weather events including damage caused by inundation, high
winds, flooding, erosion and damage to infrastructure from storm surges. Sea level rise poses an
existential threat in the worst case scenarios. The proposed Climate Change Trust Fund (CCTF)
Program will help design and implement pilot activities in the areas o f sewage and solid waste
management, coastal protection and biodiversity conservation, and promote low-carbon
development.

  Information for this assessment i s drawn from project documents o f the World Bank and the Maldives NAPA.
Complementing these i s a substantial gray literature focused on marine aspects of the environment.
15
  Being a country with more territorial sea than land, marine resources have played a vital role shaping the contours of
economic development.

             C. IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING

81.   The Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT) will carry out the implementation,
monitoring, and evaluation o f the proposed program. The Economic Policy Planning Section
(EPPS) o f the M o F T will be the point o f contact and coordinating agency for this operation. The
outcome indicators will be monitored quarterly in close collaboration with the IMF and the EPPS.

82.    The proposed program sets out a number o f qualitative and quantitative benchmarks
and targets for 2010 and 2011. The Bank team will monitor and follow up on progress, carry out
regular consultations with the relevant ministries and assess implementation o f policy measures.
The follow-up and monitoring will consist o f quarterly macroeconomic assessments. The Bank
team will also report on implementation progress through specific policy notes and track official
documents (memoranda, gazette) to support the verification o f effective policy decisions that are
considered under the proposed program.

83.     Implementation effectiveness o f the Government's reform program will also depend
on consultations and participation o f key stakeholders. In this regard, the Government has been
active to date making sure that key decisions are explained to the public as well as key stakeholders
through various press statements and public circulars. Bank staff have also engaged in consultations
with stakeholders, for example, having an open discussion with members o f parliament regarding
the seriousness o f the macroeconomic situation and the consequences o f no reform. Consultations
and coordination with key stakeholders will continue to be part o f the reform program
implementation.

             D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS, DISBURSEMENTSAND AUDITING

84.     An IMF Safeguards Assessment o f the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) i s
currently in progress. Review o f the audit reports and other available documents reveal that there
are issues with the current external audit o f the MMA as conducted by the Auditor General's
Office, which would need to be bolstered. There may be a need (i) appoint an international firm
                                                                     to
to perform MMA's audit in accordance with international standards on auditing, (ii) strengthen
                                                                                       to
MMA financial reporting practices, and (iii)  develop the internal audit function. These actions will
be agreed after the completion o f the IMF safeguard assessment.

85.                                                                      S
        The Bank will disburse the credit proceeds in a dedicated U Dollars deposit account
o f GoM account with the Central Bank o f Maldives (Maldives Monetary Authority- M M A )
based on which M M A will credit the rufiyaa equivalent in GOM's Rufiyaa account, to be
used f o r expenditures against approved budget. The Ministry o f Finance and Treasury controls
and operates this account, which i s part o f the Government o f Maldives's general foreign exchange
reserves. The Government will be required to provide a confirmation to the Bank that the proceeds
o f the credit have been received in the designated deposit account with MMA and that an
equivalent amount in local currency has also been credited to an account o f the Government
available to finance budgeted expenditures. The Bank will require an audit o f the special deposit




                                                29
account16, in accordance with international auditing standards from an auditor, who i s independent
and acceptable t o the Bank.

86.    Disbursement o f the credit proceeds would not be linked to specific purchases.
However, G o M would not use the credit proceeds to pay for expenditures included in the Bank's
standard negative list. If any portion o f the Credit is used to finance ineligible expenditures as so
defined in the Agreement, the Bank shall require the G o M t o refund the amount.

87.     Legal and Disbursement Arrangements. The financing terms and conditions for the IDA
credit will be reflected through a legal agreement between G o M and IDA.

88.     The credit proceeds will be provided in a single tranche disbursement The Bank
support under the proposed credit will be based o n prior actions already met. These prior actions are
listed in the legal agreement and evidence of their status was agreed at negotiations.

                E. RISK AND RISK MITIGATION

89.   The main risks include political risk, risks to the macroeconomic framework,
vulnerability to external shocks, and limited technical capacity.

          Political risk. Democracy in the Maldives is very much in a nascent stage. The Government
          o f President Nasheed lacks a parliamentary majority which could significantly constrain the
          Government's plans going forward. Legislation pertaining to various new tax measures such
          as the Business Profits Tax and the ad-valorem tourism tax could run into delays in
          approval. Political risks are likely to be a feature for the entire length o f the proposed
          program period and could undermine the Government's fiscal consolidation efforts.

      0   Macroeconomic framework. The scale o f the fiscal adjustment under the IMF's
          stabilization program would be difficult in most circumstances, and pose significant
          implementation risks. In the case o f the Maldives, the new constitution (2008) enshrines the
          independence o f the C i v i l Service Commission (CSC) to change the wage levels o f the c i v i l
          service, which necessitates close cooperation between the Ministry o f Finance and the CSC
          to implement the cuts t o the total wage bill.I7 Without close cooperation there i s a risk that
          the wage cuts announced in October are not sustained. Evidence o f this risk was realized in
          late December when the CSC unilaterally ordered the reversal o f the October wage cuts to
          begin o n January 1, 2010. The reversal o f wage cuts would undermine fiscal sustainability
          and put at risk the continuation o f the IMF program. The M o F T and the President's office
          have issued a Press Statement indicating that the pay package cuts will be maintained until
          domestic revenues reach 7 billion rufiyaa (IMF projections show this level being reached in
          2011)' as per the CSC's circular o f October 2009. While the risk o f reversal remains, the

16
   T h e scope o f the audit would cover (a) the accuracy of the summary of the transactions of the dedicated account,
including the accuracy of the exchange rate conversions; (b) verification that the dedicated account was used only for
the purposes o f the operation; and (c) verification that all payments out of the dedicated account was used for specified
purposes. The audit will be submitted within six months after the funds in the dedicated account have been f i l l y used.
l7The Civil Service Act o f 2008 empowers the independent Civil Services Commission (CSC) with the task of
determining civil service positions and pay. As such, the MoFT and the President's office cannot unilaterally implement
public service pay and employment cuts.

                                                           30
    Government is committed to maintain the wage cuts. Evidence o f this commitment came
    when they issued civil service pay checks at the reduced rates in January. The Bank will
    liaise closely with the IMF team on the quarterly reviews o f their program to gauge progress
    in this area. The Bank will not proceed to the second proposed operation should
    macroeconomic imbalances not improve through lack o f Government reform effort.

    Vulnerability to external shocks. As a small, open, and undiversified economy, the
    Maldives i s vulnerable to the adverse effects o f external shocks (e.g. an o i l price shock).
    These could have a major impact on debt sustainability, for example. Strengthening the
    policy framework will be essential to mitigating the risk o f external shocks. The strength o f
    the global economic recovery presents upside and downside risks to the proposed operation.
    A stronger-than-expected recovery in Europe - the largest tourist source - would help boost
                                                                                                       '
    tourist arrivals, real GDP growth and government revenues, helping to ease the fiscal
    adjustment in 2010. Strong global growth and an easing o f global credit constraints would
    also help foreign direct investment and stalled resort developments pick up. Alternatively, a
    slow and anemic global recovery would suppress a revival in tourism, GDP growth and
    FDI, making the fiscal adjustment more difficult. A lower than anticipated rebound in
    tourism and economic growth could lead to increased pressure o n the exchange rate and
    exacerbate the already acute external financing gap, which may have to be remedied by a
    devaluation o f the currency. O n the domestic side, the size o f the fiscal adjustment that the
    government is undertaking presents significant implementation risks, particularly that wage
    cuts and redundancies are reversed during the course o f the program before fiscal
    sustainability i s restored.

0   Limited technical capacity. Limited technical capacity i s one o f the leading development
    constraints in the Maldives. Capacity constraints significantly impact all parts o f
    government functions and GoM in the recent past has sought increased interventions from
    multi-lateral donors such as the World Bank, IMF and the ADB. Specific TA policies have
    not been built into the program, but capacity constraints have been reflected in the program
    design.

           Recent Economic Developments and Near-Term Outlook

           Maldives i s faring large external and fiscal imbalances. Following a period o f dramatic fiscal
           expansion. the economy was severely hit by the global financial crisis, which has pushed the
           economy into recession, caused a significant fall in fiscal revenue, and led to a sharp deterioration
           in the external position.

           *      After growth of 5% percent i n 2008, real GDP i s expected to shiirik by about 4 percent in
                  2009, driven b> the decline in tourism and a rerrcnchnient ofthe construction sector.
                  Inflation has been falling on the back of lower import prices, hut aa commodity prices
                  recowr, it i s expected to bounce back i n the second half o f this year to reach about
                  6% percent year-on-year by end-2009.

                  Government cxpcnditute almost doubled as a share of GUP between 2004 and 2008. and.
                  without adjustment, would reach 69 percent of(jD1' by end-%09. A ke) driver has k e n tlic
                  uage hill. The global crisis has intensified the liscal imbalances: re\ enue has bccn shrinking
                  on account of slnuer imports and lower tourism intlows and tourisin-related investment. A s
                  a result. the fiscal deficit rose to 13% percent of CiDP in 2008 and. without corrective xtion.
                  could reach 33 percent o f CiDP in 2009. while puhlic debt i s piojected to rise lo 02 perccnt

       *          Aftcr widening to 51 percent of GDP in 2008. the current account dcficit i s cxpccted to

Economic Policies

Going fonvard, the authorities are committed to a very significant adjustment program,
aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit to stem aggregate demand pressures, restore stability and
medium-term fiscal sustainability: absorbing excess rufiyaa liquidity and shoring up reserves to
prudent levels: and strengthening the banking sector.

        Fiscal policy. The core ofthe program i s a large fiscal adjustment to bring public debt back
        to sustainable levels. The adjustment coniprises: (i) significant reduction i n the wage bill
                                                              a
        (to unwind part o f the large recent increases) through cuts i n remuneration and staffing
        levels: (ii)reductions in other operational expenses and non-priority capiial expenditure: ilnd
       (iii)
           revenue measures. including the introduction o f an ad valorem tax on tourism, a
       business profits tax and a goods and services tax. As a result. the fiscal deficit i s expected to
       decline to about 17% percent o f GDP in 2010 and 4% percent o f GDP in 201 I.' b e
       authorities havc already initiated steps towards fiscal adjustment.

                                                                 fiscal
       Monetary policy. Monetary tightening will con~plen~ent ad,justment and help reduce
       pressures on resen es. Key steps in this regard haw h e n the cessation o f deficit
       monetization. the conversion o f the government's debt stock with the M M A into nugotiable
       securitics, and the recent introduction of open market operations.

       Exchange rate policy. The !hod oxchange rate regime has served Maldives \sell by
       providing an effective nominal anchor. The current level o f the peg is consistent with
       medium-term fundamciitals if the policy adjustment i s implemcntcd as envisaged. Thu
       program aims to preserve the viability ofthe current exchange rate peg through a
       conibination o f fiscal adjustnicnt, monetary tightoning, and external financing.

       Finaricial sector policies. The authorities are committcd to strengthening the firiaiicial
       regulation and supervision framework, including through passage oftlie Ihnking 1,aw and
       the reforms to the MMA Act. They have also passcd new regulations on adequate loan
       classification and provisioning, as well as on foreign currency position.

'The policy program is ambitious, and subject to considerablerisks. The key risk i s delayed or
insufficient implementation o f the entisagcd fiscal adjustment, uhich could entail significant
revisions to the piogram. Also, the global economic environment entails upside and downside rishs

ANNEX 5. JOINT BANK-FUND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Based on the low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA), Maldives' is rated to
be at a moderate risk o debt distress. Vulnerabilitiesfor total public debt are higher, and
                         f
addressing them w i l l require timely implementation o the authorities' strong fiscal adjustment
                                                       f
program. The borrowing space in the short and medium terms has shrunk after the recent
accumulation o large fiscal and external deficits. The build-up ofprivate external debt prior to
               f
           f
the onset o the global financial crisis and ofpublic domestic debt (mainly owed to the Maldives
Monetary Authority, M M ) in the last two years has intensiJied the debt burden. Key risks for
debt sustainability are large future shocks to exports or fiscal policy slippages. Satisfactory
implementation o the fiscal adjustment proposed under the program would lead to a sustained
                  f
downward path in the public and external debt stocks.I8

 1.     The total debt to GDP ratio has increased fast since 2004, and reached almost
110 percent o f GDP in 200819. Each major category o f debt has shown strong growth rates
following the 2004 tsunami. Growth in private external debt, used to finance a rapidly expanding
tourism sector, has been particularly fast. An increasing fiscal deficit in the last two years has
also led to a build up o f public debt, much o f it domestic. With external financing sources limited
for much o f 2009 and a fiscal deficit running close to 30 percent o f GDP, a further build-up o f
domestic debt has been observed so far this year, which largely explains the projected increase in
the total debt-to-GDP ratio to about 129 percent in 2009.

2.     Public external debt rose rapidly after the 2004 tsunami, as donor funds flowed into
the country for reconstruction needs. It reached US$472 million (37% percent o f GDP) in 2008.

18
   Maldives' policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA), averaged 3.53 over the past three years (2006-2008), placing it as a "medium performer." The
relevant indicative thresholds for this category are: 40 percent for the N P V o f debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the
N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the N P V o f debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt service-to-
exports ratio, and 30 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and
publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt.

   In this section, total debt refers to total PPG debt (external and domestic) and private external debt.

About 70 percent (or one third o f the total debt stock) i s from multilateral and bilateral creditors.
This fact, and the assumption that new borrowing is expected to be contracted from multilateral
and bilateral creditors throughout the projection period, motivates the use o f the low-income
country (LIC) framework for the DSA.20

                                              ASSUMPTIONS

3.      Maldives i s facing severe fiscal and external imbalances. For the first three years after
the 2004 tsunami disaster, the authorities pursued a growth strategy based o n infrastructure
spending and expansion o f tourism, financed by both official grants and loans and private sector
foreign borrowing. However, the global economic downturn has had a significant negative
impact on export and tourism receipts, as well as government revenue. Moreover, private sector
financing has contracted sharply. Combined with excessive government spending, this has led to
a growing fiscal deficit, much o f which has been monetized by the central bank. To address these
challenges, the Government o f Maldives has adopted a package o f economic policy measures as
described in their Memorandum o f Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). The D S A that
follows builds on the program baseline scenario (Box 1).




*'T h i s i s the fvst DSA for Maldives that uses the LIC fiamework. Previous DSAs were conducted using the
template designed for Middle-Income Countries (MICs). Thus, no debt distress rating was previously assigned.
Although a comparison of ratings i s therefore not possible, a qualitative comparison with the last DSA (IMF
Country Report No. 09/97) suggests that the risk o f debt distress has increased.

     :
Box 1 Main Assumptions for the Debt SustainabilityAnalysis (2009-
                             2029)
  Real GDP growth in 2009-14 i s projected to average 2% percent a year compared with an
  average o f 7% percent over the previous five years. Negative growth in 2009, projected at
  -4 percent, i s mainly due t o reduced activity in the tourism sector, which has been
  adversely affected by global economic downturn. Growth i s expected to recover thereafter
  to around 4% percent, as global and domestic conditions improve, but t o remain below the
  recent historical average. This assumes that resort development takes place at a more
  sustainable pace than that observed since the tsunami, and that supply constraints will
  hold back the fisheries sector.

  Inflation (which drives the GDP deflator) i s projected to average 4% percent a year in
  2009-14, compared with an average o f 6% percent over the previous five years, thanks to
  a moderation o f global prices and the fiscal adjustment effort. Inflation i s expected t o stay
  at 3 percent thereafter, in line with trading partners' rates, reflecting continued fiscal
  consolidation and a tighter monetary policy.

  Interest rates on public debt are assumed t o increase t o 4% percent by 201 1 (compared
  with an average o f 3% percent over the previous five years), reflecting a tighter domestic
  liquidity. They are assumed t o decline thereafter.

  The external current account deficit (including grants) in 2009-14 i s projected to
  average 15% percent o f GDP a year and decline to 5 percent by 2019 reflecting a
  significant fiscal retrenchment, compared to 5 1!4 percent in 2008. Thereafter, it would
  remain at below i t s pre-tsunami level (2003).

  The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) is projected at 28% percent o f GDP in 2009,
  as the full impact o f the adjustment effort will only be felt in 2010. The deficit i s expected
  to decline to an average o f 5% percent o f GDP in 2010-14, owing to a strong fiscal          .
  consolidation. The budget is expected to remain in balance thereafter. As a result, the
  volume o f domestic borrowing will decline, although i t s cost may rise somewhat as the
  stock o f outstanding obligations from the Government to the MMA are securitized at a
  slightly higher average market rate than the penal rate charged by the MMA on the
  Government's overdraft account. Public external debt i s assumed t o be contracted mainly
  on concessional terms until the end o f the projection period.

  Government expenditures are expected t o decline from 63 percent o f GDP in 2008 to
  45 percent by 2014, mainly reflecting civil service reforms. The Government's revenue
  measures-airport tax, ad valorem bed tax, business profits tax, and the general sales
  tax-are expected to yield about 15 percent o f 2009 GDP once their full impact is felt.
  These new taxes will partly offset steep falls in import duties, lease payments, and profits
  transfers from SOEs, stemming, respectively, from the fall in public expenditure, a
  moderation in future lease payments from resorts, and privatization.

                                               DEBT
                                  VIII. EXTERNAL  SUSTAINABILITY'~

Baseline Scenario

4.      Maldives' external debt has increased rapidly since the Tsunami, reflecting an
increase in both public external financing and private foreign-financed investment. As o f end-
2008, PPG debt represented 49 percent o f total external debt. The external debt path is expected
to worsen in the near term, as the Maldivian authorities seek external assistance to tide over the
difficult economic situation. In particular, this includes financial assistance from the Indian
government totaling US$200                and borrowing from IFIs (IMF, World Bank, and Asian
Development Bank) projected at US$146 million. The authorities are also expecting additional
non-concessional external borrowing through end-20 10.23 This borrowing explains the hump in
the path o f external debt service in 2010-1 1. The external-debt-to-GDP ratio, however, i s
projected to decline from 2010 onwards.

5.      With one minor and temporary exception, all external debt indicators remain below
the debt burden thresholds under the baseline scenario. The P V o f external public debt-to-
GDP ratio is projected to be slightly above the 40 percent threshold this year, but trend down
thereafter as expected program implementation helps reduce the current account deficit to
sustainable levels. This marginal and temporary breach o f the threshold i s due in large part to the
extraordinary fiscal and current account imbalances o f the past two years, which the Fund-
supported program aims to address. The program also places a ceiling on non-concessional
public external borrowing going forward. All other public external debt burden indicators remain
well below thresholds throughout the projection period. While there is a hump in debt service
payments over the next two years as a result o f a repayment o f a large loan from the Indian
government, both debt service ratios remain well within the thresholds.




21 External debt sustainability analysis i s focused on PPG external debt, to which thresholds are applicable. Private
external debt i s not considered for the purpose o f I D A grant allocations.

22 A credit o f US$lOO million was made available to the government o f Maldives by the government o f India in
early 2009, and repayments o f US$50 million in two tranches are expected to be made in 2010 and 201 1,
respectively. Also, the Male branch o f the State Bank o f India (SBI) i s expecting to contract a US$lOO million two-
year non-concessionalloan (subject to fifty percent rollover) fiom i t s parent by end 2009 and early 2010, and on-
lend it to the government o f Maldives in exchange for foreign currency-denominateddomestic bonds.
23 Such borrowing includes a foreign exchange swap with the Central Bank o f Sri Lanka for at least US$25 million
to boost international reserves, as well as the following infiastructure and development projects: (i) construction
                                                                                                       the
o f ten harbors, which has been favorably assessed by the Board o f the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and i s
being financed as follows-Saudi Fund ($15 million), the IDB ($15 million), and OFID ($10 million); (ii)       an
                                                                                         n
infiastructure development project (housing, sewerage, electricity, and desalination) i tsunami affected areas
funded by Abu Dhabi ($15 million); and (iii)    reclamation projects and supply o f equipment to be financed by loans
under negotiation. The terms o f such financing vary, but are generally very favorable in relation to terms that
Maldives may have received had it sought to borrow on international or domestic financial markets.
                                                        46


Stress Tests and Alternative Scenarios

6.      Stress tests indicate vulnerability to exogenous export shocks. The PV o f debt-to-GDP
ratio, debt-to-exports ratio and debt service-to-exports ratios breach the thresholds under the
most extreme standard stress test. For the former, the most extreme stress test i s the combination
shock-a one standard deviation shock to growth, exports, GDP deflator and non-debt flows-
while in the latter two cases the most extreme shock i s the export shock-an export value growth
at historical average minus one standard deviation in 2010-1 1 relative to the 2008 baseline. This
highlights the vulnerability o f the economy t o the variability o f tourism receipts.

7.      The historical scenario indicates unsustainable debt dynamics. When key
macroeconomic variables are set to their historical averages all stock debt burden indicators
breach respective thresholds, while the debt service burden indicators show an increasing trend
after 2014. The key factor driving this scenario is the non-interest current account deficit, which
averaged 20 percent o f GDP over the 10-year period to 2008. This 10-year average contains
three rather extreme events that drove the current account deficit to unprecedented highs: the
2004 tsunami, the extraordinary run-up in food and fuel prices in 2007 and 2008, and the rising
fiscal deficit o f the past few years. T o the extent that the magnitudes o f these events can be
considered unique, the historical scenario may overestimate potential risks o f debt distress.
Nevertheless, the simulations illustrate that without significant fiscal consolidation the debt path
would become unsustainable.

8.      Private external debt may increase the risks to debt sustainability. Private external
debt accounts for over one half o f the external debt-to-GDP ratio. M u c h o f this debt i s at
maturities o f less than 10 years, at market interest rates, and denominated in U.S. dollars. T o the
extent that private external debt may increase liquidity and re-financing risks for the country as a
whole, or entail contingent liabilities for the sovereign, the risks to debt sustainability could be
higher than an analysis o f external PPG data alone may suggest. Moreover, private external debt
may be underestimated in Maldives: non-FDI external inflows to the non-financial private
sector-which comprise mainly financing for privatization and tourism projects, and which sum
to about 60 percent o f GDP over 2009-201 2-are treated as non-debt creating in both observed
                                                                               24
data and projections. Part o f these flows, however, could be debt creating.

9.     I n the staff's view, the risk of public external debt distress for Maldives i s moderate.
With one exception, n o external debt burden indicator breaches the thresholds in the baseline
scenario. Staff judges the marginal and temporary breach in the external debt-to-GDP ratio to be
a function o f the severe fiscal and current account imbalances over the past t w o years that the
program aims to address.25The steady decline in external debt burden indicators under the


24The authorities do not have adequate information to disaggregate these flows into FDI and arm's length borrowing.
                               n
Accordingly, the FDI account i the balance o f payments may also be underestimated.
25 Recent experience has demonstrated flexibility in rating o f external debt distress (SM/09/216), including in
Mongolia (2009), Madagascar (2008), M a l i (2008) and i Bhutan (2007). In the case o f Bhutan, the incorporation o f
                                                         n
two new largely debt financed hydropower projects in the baseline scenario caused some external debt indicators to
                                                            47


program indicates that the risk o f debt distress declines significantly with the proposed fiscal
adjustment. However, stress tests illustrate that the debt path i s particularly vulnerable to export
shocks and decline in non-debt creating inflows, while the historical scenario shows
unsustainable debt dynamics.

                                      IX. PUBLICDEBT
                                                   SUSTAINABILITY

Baseline Scenario

10.    The stock of Maldives' nominal public debt has increased rapidly since the 2004
tsunami, from 55 percent o f GDP in 2004 to around 69 percent in 2008, and is expected to reach
94 percent o f GDP (including IMF loans and some transactions o f financial entities) in 2009.26
This sharp increase has been driven by an expansionary fiscal policy combined with a dramatic
shortfall in fiscal revenue. M u c h o f the fiscal deficit over the next two years has been financed
domestically, through MMA credit to the Government (which in 2008 represented 75 percent o f
the central government's domestic debt and 55 percent o f the total public domestic debt stock)

11.    The PV o f the public debt-to-GDP ratio i s projected to fall sharply under the
baseline scenario, from 91 percent in 2009 to 17 percent by 2029, owing to strong fiscal


breach their thresholds in both the baseline and the alternative scenarios/stress tests. However, o n account o f several
country-specific mitigating factors a moderate risk o f debt distress rating was retained. Other recent cases o f flexible
treatment o n ratings include Mongolia (2009).
26 Public debt refers here t o the debt o f the non-financial public sector, comprising the central government and state-
owned enterprises, as w e l l as publicly guaranteed debt. In line w i t h inclusion o f IMF debt contracted by the central
banks, it also includes a currency swap between the MMA and the central bank o f S r i Lanka for $25 m i l l i o n
currently being negotiated. The central government accounted in 2008 for 79 percent o f the total public debt. The
present value o f total public debt in 2008 was 67 percent o f GDP.

adjustment efforts on both the revenue and expenditure sides (Table 2a). The PV o f the public
debt-to-revenue (including grants) ratio would decline from a projected 252 percent in 2009 to
39 percent by 2029. The public debt service-to-revenue (including grants) ratio would increase to
28 percent by 2010 before shifting to a downward trajectory later in the projection period (Figure
2 and Table 2a). N e w public borrowing from all sources in the context o f the program, including
Fund financing, has been considered, and risks to debt sustainability appear manageable in the
context o f the programmed fiscal adjustment.

Stress Tests and Alternative Scenarios

12.      Maldives' high level o f public debt makes its sustainability vulnerable to exogenous
shocks o r fiscal policy slippages. The stress tests indicate that the debt path i s particularly
vulnerable to shocks to the primary balance and long t e r m growth. If the primary deficit remains
fixed at the elevated level o f 26% percent o f GDP (as in 2009), the debt ratio would continue to
expand and would reach 416 percent o f GDP by 2029. This, o f course, illustrates that the current
fiscal stance i s not sustainable. I t also points to the risks arising from insufficient or delayed
implementation o f the fiscal adjustment measures envisaged in the program. Sensitivity tests also
show that the public debt path is susceptible to shocks to long-term real GDP growth, with a one
standard deviation permanent shock to growth leading to a PV public debt ratio o f 124 percent o f
GDP in 2029, compared with a baseline projection o f 17 percent.

                                          X. CONCLUSION

 13.    Maldives faces a moderate risk o f external PPG debt distress. With the exception o f a
one-time breach in the P V o f debt-to-GDP threshold in 2009, no thresholds are breached under
the baseline scenario, but the analysis indicates the country's vulnerability to shocks to the
tourism sector (which are also shocks to growth), non-debt creating inflows and the primary
balance. This suggests the need to diversify, to the extent possible within the country's
geographical constraints, the structure o f the economy. Maldives also faces considerable risks to
debt sustainability based on its overall public debt level. This underscores the need for strong
fiscal adjustment: should the authorities fall short on their fiscal consolidation efforts, the risk o f
the public and external debt ratio moving on to an unsustainable trajectory would significantly
increase.
