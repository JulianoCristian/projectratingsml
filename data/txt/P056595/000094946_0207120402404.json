Both World Bank and\n            Borrowewr performances are assessed as satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include the following: 1) The establishment of the\n            project management unit (PMU) and the Project Steering\n            Committee (PSC) proved to be successful but the replication\n            of this model for future operations should be advocated and\n            adopted only in the absence of public sector reforms which\n            would allow similar PMU functions to operate within the\n            established ministries' organizational structure. 2)\n            With streamlined procurement and payment procedures, the\n            Government was able to reduce the turn-around time for the\n            award on contracts by roughly 50 percent with similar\n            improvements in efficiencies for payments to contractors and\n            consultants realized. 3) The financial and technical\n            quarterly audits undertaken by a private audit firm assisted\n            the PMU greatly in ensuring that the streamlined procurement\n            and payment procedures did not sacrifice proper oversight of\n            the expenditure of public funds. 4) Improved public\n            relations efforts were made by the PMU to inform the public\n            of the progress of the project. This should be adopted for\n            all Govenrment projects but most certainly for all future\n            IDA financed projects."}, "docdt": "2002-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
