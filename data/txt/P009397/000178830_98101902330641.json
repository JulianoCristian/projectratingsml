Its main objectives are: (a)\n            to expand and strengthen the primary health care and family\n            planning service delivery system; (b) to expand and improve\n            the quality of training for health and family planning field\n            staff; (c) to continue and expand, on a limited basis,\n            selected information, education and motivation activities\n            initiated under the first project; and (d) to improve the\n            program's management, monitoring and evaluation, and\n            research capacity. In order to minimize the risks of delay\n            in project implementation and to strengthen the population\n            control/family planning program, the Government is taking\n            special measures designed to decentralize the program's\n            management and organization, to streamline its\n            administrative, financial and recruitment procedures and to\n            strengthen the effectiveness of the program's field\n            organization and field workers."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
