the quality, reliability, and\n            sustainability of water services for the cities of Maputo,\n            Beira, Quelimane, Nampula, and Pemba through promoting\n            greater private sector participation in the provision of\n            water services. Specifically the project seeks to: a)\n            commence institutional and regulatory reform within the\n            urban water sector with the introduction of commercial\n            principles in the operation and management of water services\n            through the use of a private sector operator; b) accelerate\n            capacity building and human resource development for the\n            sector through training and demonstration effects within the\n            context of the private operator contract; and c) provide an\n            institutional framework that improves the quality and\n            sustainability of user services and acts as an operational\n            model for water services, as these begin to be decentralized\n            to municipal based management. The project consists of three\n            components. 1) Private sector management of water supply\n            systems for five cities will support the lease contracts and\n            management contracts for water supply systems of Maputo,\n            Beira, Quelimane, Nampula, and Pemba. 2) Water supply works\n            will support water supply works, design, and supervision. 3)\n            Urban water supply policy and strategy will finance\n            consulting services, technical assistance, and purchase of\n            equipment for Council for the Regulation of Water Supply."}, "docdt": "1999-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
