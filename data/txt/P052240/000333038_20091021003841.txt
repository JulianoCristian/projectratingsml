F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The objective of the Project was to improve the quality, reliability and sustainability of
water services for the cities of Maputo, Beira, Quelimane, Nampula, and Pemba (target
cities) through promoting greater private sector participation in the provision of these
services. More specifically, the Project sought to:



                                                vi
        Commence institutional and regulatory reform within the urban water sector with
        the introduction of commercial principles in the operation and management of
        water services through the use of a private sector operator;
        Accelerate capacity building and human resource development for the sector
        through training and demonstration effects within the context of the private
        operator contract;
        Provide an institutional framework that improves the quality and sustainability of
        users services and acts as an operational model for water services, as these begin
        to be decentralized to municipal based management.

  Key Indicators:

        Mandated tariff policy set out in law that water pricing will be based on principles
        of cost recovery;
        Creation of autonomous publicly owned asset holding company, Fundo de
        Investimento e Patrimonio do Abastecimento de Agua (FIPAG) to manage the
        contracts in its five target cities and the new assets created under the Project with
        output performance;
        Greater participation by municipalities though their role in the Stakeholders
        Forum and through their direct assistance in the selection of the Board of FIPAG;
        Creation of a water regulatory agency, CRA for urban water provision.

1.1    Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Background: Mozambique has sustained rapid economic growth since
achieving peace in 1992, transforming itself to a market economy. However, it remains
one of the world's poorest countries with a GDP per capita of US$210. In 1998, the first
annual household survey showed that, while conditions had improved, 69% of
Mozambicans still lived below the poverty line. As part of a strategy to maintain high
levels of growth and reduce poverty, the Government of Mozambique (GOM) formulated
a Five-Year Program (2000-2004) and prepared an Action Plan for the reduction of
Absolute Poverty (PARPA) in the framework of its interim Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP). The PARPA's strategy emphasized economic growth, public investment in
human capital and productive infrastructure, and institutional reform.

2.      Sector background: In August 1995, GOM adopted a comprehensive sector
strategy document entitled the National Water Policy (NWP). It called for: increased
beneficiary participation, recognition of water as an economic as well as a social good;
decentralized autonomous and financially self sustaining provision of water supply and
sanitation services, integrated water resources management taking environmental impacts
into account; multi-objective investment planning; a greater focus on capacity building;
and an increased role for the private sector.
        

3.     To implement these polices GOM prepared and approved a National Water
Development Program (NWDP), which was supported by two International Development
Association (IDA) Credits. The National Water Development I Project (NWDPI, Cr.
3039-MOZ), co-financed by the Nordic Development Fund (NDF), became effective in
June 1998 and closed in October 2005. It focused on water resources management, rural
water supply, and institutional reform. The Second National Water Development Project
(NWDPII) became effective in March 2000 and closed in March 2009. The total cost of
the Project was estimated at US$115 million and financing included a US$75 million
equivalent IDA Credit, US$10 million grant from the Government of the Netherlands and
US$20 million credit from the African Development Bank (AfDB). A supplemental IDA
Credit of US$15 million was approved in 2004. This Project focused on the improvement
of urban water supply, specifically in five major cities, and provided policy and
regulatory support.
        

4.      Rationale for Bank assistance: Strong government ownership and a clear focus
on the appropriate institutional and legal setting proved conducive to trigger effective
cooperation by the donor community in implementation of the NWP. The Bank, through
IDA, had been particularly active in the development of the water sector in Mozambique
since the mid 1990s and had been a keen supporter of GOM's NWP. It was also the lead
donor in NWDPI. Within the donor community, the Bank Group had at that time already
accumulated substantial experience with a range of early Private Sector Participation
(PSP) efforts in the sector, within the region, and globally. Therefore the Bank could add
value by facilitating the GOM's approach which was based on "buying in" needed

                                            1
experience to jump start the sector after the civil war. The Project was designed to
support several key Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives. It would promote
sustainable economic growth through better quality water supply for major urban areas,
and higher efficiency of service provision and introduction of cost-recovery principles. It
would contribute to capacity building and development of human resources primarily
through the promotion of private sector-led service delivery. It would also strengthen the
development partnerships between GOM, the donors, municipalities and the private
sector.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
    approved)

5.       PDO: According to Section A of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Project
Development Objective, the main objective of the Project was to improve the quality,
reliability and sustainability of water services for the cities of Maputo, Beira, Quelimane,
Nampula, and Pemba (target cities) through promoting greater private sector participation
in the provision of these services. More specifically, the Project sought to:

     Commence institutional and regulatory reform within the urban water sector
     with the introduction of commercial principles in the operation and management
     of water services through the use of a private sector operator;
     Accelerate capacity building and human resource development for the sector
     through training and demonstration effects within the context of the private
     operator contract;
     Provide an institutional framework that improves the quality and
     sustainability of user services and acts as an operational model for water
     services, as these begin to be decentralized to municipal based management.

6.    The improvement of service coverage level was also included in the PDO in both
Annex 1 of the PAD, Project Design Summary and in the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) Schedule 2, Description of the Project.

7.    Key performance Indicators: The following were defined in the PAD as
Outcome/Impact Indicators:
    Mandated tariff policy that water pricing will be based on principles of full cost
      recovery.
    Work towards the establishment of autonomous publicly owned water companies
      in the 5 targeted cities that are run on commercial principles of cost recovery and
      that are managed and run by private sector operators.
    Assist in the devolution of the responsibility to provide water supply to the
      Local Authorities as municipalities take an increasing role in direction and
      ownership of the new water companies.
    Creation of a water sector regulatory agency for urban water service provision.

8.     The following were defined in the PAD as Output Indicators.
        Chief Executive Officer of FIPAG in place by Project effectiveness, and
          Technical Assistance (TA) contract operational by January 2000.

                                             2
           Board appointed by March 2000 and staff in place and fully operational by
           December 2000.
           Lease and management contracts signed.
           Contract adjustment and re-negotiations are successfully completed

           Abastecimento de Água (FIPAG): recovery of O&M and depreciation by
           2004; full cost recovery by 2005.
           Improvements in key service levels, including the reliability of service and
           % of microbiological water quality samples.
           In the target cities, increase of the population with improved access to
           safe reliable water supplies from the current level of 0.8 million to 1.1
           million by 2004.
           Network renewal and extension takes place in line with programmed targets.
           Environmental Management Plan implemented.
           Policies and strategies incorporate lessons learned in the lease and
           management contracts and are supported by stakeholders.
           Strategies for four cities with management contracts developed by Dec.
           2003, for remaining eight medium size cities by Dec. 2004.

9.      It is noted that the DCA did not reflect the key indicators above, but included as
Schedule 6 a set of detailed performance indicators as defined in Annex 2, Section 4 of
the PAD. A baseline for key indicators was not defined at appraisal with exception of the
population with improved access to safe reliable water supplies and the indicator for
service coverage.

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
        Indicators, and reasons/justification

10.      The PDO and the key indicators were not revised during Project implementation.
However, during the mid-term review of the Project the Bank and the implementing
agencies agreed on modification and simplification of the detailed indicators. The agreed
list of revised indicators was then incorporated as new Schedule 6 in the amendment of
the DCA on April 15, 2004.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

11.     The Project intended to directly benefit an estimated 1.1 million people,
representing about 47% of the consumers in the five cities. Of those already served by
house, yard or standpipe connections (about 800,000 people, or about 35% of all potential
consumers), most received only limited, interrupted supplies of poor quality water at low
pressure. The Project aimed to bring services close to continuous water supply and meet
national standards of pressure and microbiological quality. Customers with existing
connections would have to pay higher water tariffs, but for the new customers, mostly the
poor, the cost of water would be much lower with formal water connections, compared to
what they pay for alternative services, such as the water vendors. Besides, the poor would
no longer have to walk long distances to fetch water. Improved water services would also
remove constraints on operations by commercial and industrial enterprises and promote

                                            3
confidence and increased investments.

1.5      Original Components (as approved)

12.   The Project, estimated at a total cost of US$114.8 million, consisted of three
components summarized as follows:

13.   Component A: Private Sector Management of water supply systems for five cities
(US$42.7 million; 37.2%), with the following sub-components:

            A 15-year lease contract with a private operator for the greater Maputo area
            Five-year management contracts with a private operator for the cities
            Beira, Quelimane, Nampula and Pemba (US$6.9 million)
            Delegated works, undertaken by the Private Operator (PO) in lease and
            management contracts (US$17.6 million)
            Services in lease and management contracts (US$2.76 million)
            Management of components A and B by FIPAG (US$14.6 million)
            Human resources development of FIPAG Headquarter (HQ) staff and staff of
            the 4 cities under the management contract (US$0.9 million)

14.      Component B: Capital works and services (US$64.4 million, 56.1%) in the five
cities, with the following sub-components:

         Water supply works (US$58.9 million)
         Design and supervision (US$5.5 million)

15.     Component C: Urban Water Supply Policy and Strategy (US$5.1 million, 4.4%),
with the following sub-components:

         Equipment for CRA (US$0.4 million)
         Consulting services and TA for CRA, regulatory studies, urban water supply
         strategy, urban water and sanitation pilot and management of component C
         (US$4.7 million)

16.     It is noted that the Project cost tables A2.1 and A2.2 of the PAD include a line
item "interest during construction" (US$2.65 million, 2.3%) which was not allocated to
any of the above components.

1.6      Revised Components

17.    The components were not revised during Project implementation. However, since
the implementing agency for component C changed from DNA to CRA at the time the
supplemental financing was approved, as detailed in section 1.7, the activity related to
urban water and sanitation pilot and management led by DNA was dropped. Instead, a
number of other activities and studies were added to be implemented by CRA under this
component, as detailed in section 3.2.




                                           4
1.7    Other significant changes

18.     On 7/20/2004 IDA approved a supplemental credit of SDR 10.2 million
(US$15.90 million) to cover cost increases due to under pricing of the original bid and
other unforeseen circumstances. The approval was preceded by an ownership change in
the operating company and re-negotiation of the lease and management contracts (see 2.1
and 2.2 below). At the same time the on-lending rate for the IDA Credit from GOM to
FIPAG was reduced from 6% p.a. to 2% p.a. calculated on the US$ amount of FIPAG's
borrowing. This was much closer to a market based interest rate as LIBOR had dropped
to 1.4% p.a. in April 2004 and was 2.4% p.a. in July 2004, with the average LIBOR for
2004 at 1.5% p.a. In addition, the role of the regulator CRA as a second implementing
agency was confirmed by creation of a special account under its name. At the time of the
supplemental the Project was extended by two years, to September 30, 2007. In March
2007, the Bank agreed to finance 100% of taxes to expedite the implementation of
contracts for which the payment of Value Added Tax (VAT) had become a major issue
and also extended the closing date by six months until March 2008 because of weather
related construction delays. The Periodic Review (PR) of the lease contract, which
occurs every four years, covers the revision of the operator's tariff, indexation and
adjustment formula, and changes in performance standards. Leading up to the 2008
Review, the GOM requested that the credit be extended to support TA resources that may
be necessary to support these negotiations with the PO. Overall, the Project was extended
three times for a total of three and a half years.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.     The Project's overall Quality at Entry is rated "satisfactory", based on the
consistency of objectives with GOM's and the Bank's CAS priorities, the quality of
design, and the assumptions about relevant external factors. The Project was not subject
to a Quality at Entry review as such reviews had not been introduced on a regular basis at
the Bank at the time of project initiation. The Project was well prepared, took lessons of
similar projects in other countries into account (as it was the first one of its kind in
Mozambique), incorporated design elements specific to Mozambique, and tried to
identify and mitigate potential risks to the extent possible. At project preparation, GOM
was well aware that the country as a whole had limited capacity to dramatically improve
service delivery after the civil war, and it was clear that the municipalities were not ready
to take on this responsibility. The key project concept was therefore the involvement of a
professional PO to assist with its experience and expertise to improve the service
provision of FIPAG through carrying out system upgrading, and simultaneously building
operational capability of the operating companies in the cities to provide water supply
services. The selection of the options for private sector involvement (lease for Maputo
and management contracts in the four Northern cities), the choice of the five cities, and
the focus of investments appear appropriate in hindsight despite the implementation
hurdles later faced by the Project.

20.    Given the importance of the PO, the procurement process for its selection was
concluded prior to project start. An initial procurement plan was prepared during project


                                             5
appraisal, and it was defined in more detail and finalized during project implementation.
Plan for the delegated works was part of the PO's task, and the plan for non-delegated
works was prepared by FIPAG in coordination with the PO. This approach intended to
ensure an optimal rehabilitation and maintenance strategy for the poorly maintained
water supply schemes and therefore appropriate under the circumstances. IDA financed
the capital works in the four secondary cities only, while parallel funding was provided
by African Development Bank (AfDB) for the capital works in Maputo. There were
substantial implementation delays in the Maputo's capital works and this has negatively
affected the performance of the PO with respect to the lease contract and key output
indicators for the water supply services in Maputo given the size and high profile of
Maputo within the FIPAG portfolio.
        

21.     The key event that seriously impacted the Project in the early stages was the
withdrawal of the original consortium leader, SAUR International S.A. (SAUR), the
largest equity holder of the operating company, Águas de Moçambique (AdeM). This
event, which caused approximately two years of implementation delay, could not have
been foreseen during project design as it was the result of; (i) the damage caused by
heavy flooding right after the Project start in February 2000; (ii) a substantial shift in
SAUR's corporate strategy with respect to involvements in developing countries; and (iii)
underbidding of the consortium. Technical studies for the appraisal had been prepared
with limited information and restricted site access due to the security situation, and
doubts were raised about the investment proposal's sustainability. However, an
independent engineer's review concluded that the proposal was sound and realistic.
Furthermore, SAUR had run a successful operating contract for five years in Matola, a
large municipality adjacent to Maputo. This provided confidence that the company had
appropriate experience in operating a water supply system under the prevailing
circumstances in Mozambique, and that it would bid accordingly.

2.2        Implementation

22.      Contract re-negotiation: Following a disastrous year 2000 as a consequence of
the heavy flooding in February/March, operational mishaps and the underbidding of its
contractual services, the Mozambican operating company AdeM submitted on February
21, 2001, about 18 months after beginning operations, a request for an interim review of
the operator tariff and the tariff indexing formula in the Maputo lease contract. An
independent auditor appointed by FIPAG and agreed to by AdeM, concluded that the
criteria for a material change of circumstance had not been met as many of the changes in
circumstances cited by AdeM were not outside of its control. However, as spelled out in
the contract, CRA instructed the parties to undertake an interim review, judging that the
restoration of financial equilibrium was in the interest of the customers. In July, FIPAG
and AdeM/SAUR started negotiations which led to an understanding that the price basis
of the original bid was no longer valid and the tariff and remuneration formulas of the
contracts could be modified. However, SAUR then suspended negotiations two months
later and in October 2001 informed GOM that they were pulling out of AdeM. SAUR
terminated its involvement in the lease and management contracts as of December 14,
2001, and offered its share to the second shareholder, Águas de Portugal (AdeP), for a
nominal value of  1.0.


                                            6
23.      The possibility of re-bidding was discussed but its chance of success was
considered low. Therefore, FIPAG signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with
AdeP under which AdeM continued to operate based on the original lease and
management contracts while contractual modifications were negotiated. The MoU was
initially designed to last for 15 months but remained valid much longer since the revised
lease and management contracts were not signed until end-October/mid-November 2003
and became effective only in June 2004. While IDA gave a no-objection to the ownership
change in AdeM, it did not recognize the MoU with respect to the legal agreements and
disbursements. Even though the Project's PDO was only rated unsatisfactory once, right
after SAUR's retreat, its implementation performance was rated unsatisfactory four times
until mid-2003 when re-negotiations had sufficiently advanced. The key event described
above led to a delay of about four years in project implementation. Very little was
achieved in the first two years due to the start-up difficulties with SAUR. Subsequently,
during the drawn-out contract re-negotiations the PO was not operating with adequate
capacity and effort as AdeP was not prepared to fully engage in the operation until the
new contracts were signed. Furthermore, the attention of FIPAG was focused almost
entirely on the re-negotiations.

24.     The changes in the contractual agreements resulted in a higher operator tariff for
the Maputo lease and significant project cost increases. The unit rates for delegated
works, the oversight costs for the PO (including program management, procurement, and
site supervision) and fees relating to the management contract for the four cities (which
after re-negotiations became four separate contracts) were raised. This amounted to about
US$8.5 million. In order to make up for the implementation delays, the operating cost
deficit of FIPAG in the four secondary cities needed to be covered for an additional two
years, amounting to about US$7.15 million. As a response IDA approved a supplemental
credit of SDR 10.2 million (US$15.0 million equivalent) on 2/26/2004 which became
effective on 7/20/2004.
        
25.    A Periodic Review (PR) of the critical aspects of the contract, including the
operator's rate, the indexation and adjustment formula, and future performance standards
has been undertaken every four years. The PR was successfully concluded in May 2008
and the agreements reached by the two parties will apply to the contract from 2008 to
2011.
        
26.     Payment of rental fees by PO to FIPAG: Delayed rental fee payments by AdeM to
FIPAG for the Maputo lease was a persistent issue until two years before project closure.
While the small fixed fee (about US$35,000 per month) has by and large been regularly
transferred, AdeM started reneging on payments of the much larger variable fee after
signature of the MoU in December 2001. The issue was flagged at the time of the mid-
term review in September 2003 and by September 2004 arrears of about US$2 million
had been accumulated. Following the review mission in April 2005, this was raised as a
key issue in every aide-memoire but not resolved. A comprehensive assessment was
carried out for the April 2006 review mission that determined the total amount of arrears
including interest from 1999 to December 2005 at US$5.6 million, of which US$2
million up to 2002 was certified by an independent consultant. A settlement was
envisaged encompassing the preparation and implementation of a payment schedule and
the introduction of an escrow account or alternative mechanism to regularize future


                                            7
payments. Over the subsequent 12 months major progress was achieved as AdeM paid
off all arrears from 1999 to September 2006. However, transfers of the variable lease fee
remained erratic and by November 2007 new arrears of US$1.7 million had built up. As a
consequence of persisting payment delays, FIPAG called for the first time on the
contractual performance guarantee in late December 2007. Ever since the financial
security in the amount of US$400,000 was accessed by FIPAG in December 2007, AdeM
has been making its fixed and variable rental fee payments to FIPAG in full and in a
timely manner. Adoption of such timely payment mechanism has positively affected
FIPAG's financial sustainability, as these rental fees from the Maputo operation are still
the major source of revenue for FIPAG, accounting for about 25% of its total revenues.

27.    There appears no justification for the long history of arrears and erratic transfers
that have plagued the Maputo lease. Alleged cash flow shortages of the operator caused
by government entities have sometimes been used as an explanation. Delays did occur in
FIPAG's reimbursements to AdeM for delegated works but these peaked at US$600,000
and have since been mostly cleared up. Some public institutions have also been
delinquent in their tariff payments to the PO but these arrears have been minor. With
regards to the unpaid water bills from the five eligible public institutions which have been
accumulating for AdeM, the outstanding arrears from January 2006 to September 2007 in
the amount of Mt 13 million (US$565,000) have been cleared through payment of 75%
of these bills by the Government. It might therefore appear that the PO used the non-
payment of the lease fee as an interest-free loan with flexible repayment terms, instead of
adhering to the contractually fixed payment schedule.
        
28.    Payment of counterpart funds/VAT: The counterpart funds expected to be
contributed by GOM, nearly exclusively for Components A and B, amounted to US$7.55
million according to PAD projections. Of this, US$4.9 million was estimated to be
necessary for Component B of which a large part pertained to works in Maputo financed
by the AfDB, and US$0.7 million for different sub-components of Component A. In the
DCA, the Bank required the Government contributions of US$2 million which
corresponded to counterpart funding for operating costs of the four secondary cities.
These funds were deposited as scheduled in an account in the name of FIPAG.
        

29.    A specific issue emerged with the introduction of the VAT at a rate of 17% in
April 2000 i.e after the Project was approved. This tax led to a higher financing
requirement for the Project, but taxes were at that time not eligible for financing under
IDA rules. Dedicated GOM counterpart funds were not sufficient since they had been
estimated for project costs without VAT. This issue did not really affect project
implementation until 2004/05 when large contracts started and significant amounts of
VAT were required to be paid. FIPAG, as the contracting party could neither revert to
IDA nor to the government to pay for these VAT expenses. Therefore, bottlenecks in
payments to contractors for the VAT portion of their invoices started to emerge in early
2005. Between then and March 2007, amounts due to contractors rose dramatically to
US$2.7 million for contracts under the IDA Credit and Dutch grant, and US$4 million for
contracts financed by the AfDB, mainly due to the VAT issue. This resulted in a number
of claims for late payment which further aggravated the situation. As a consequence,
GOM requested and IDA approved in March 2007 the disbursement against taxes out of


                                             8
the Credit. This modification of the DCA was consistent with the Country Financing
Parameters for Mozambique, approved August 25, 2004 which confirmed that taxes and
duties were eligible for IDA financing. In addition, GOM made a special effort on its part
to resolve the situation by tripling transfers to FIPAG in 2007 to US$2.7 million and
budgeting an allocation of US$3.9 million for 2008. From April 2007 onwards the
payment arrears to contractors were thus significantly reduced and by November 2007,
all outstanding issues related to counterpart funding for the IDA funded components were
resolved. Subsequently, by year 2009 the counterpart funding issues for AfDB funded
components were also resolved. While this issue did not have a significant impact on
overall project implementation, it unnecessarily slowed down the Project's progress at a
time when the PO contracts had been re-negotiated and the Project was on track again.

30.     Private Operator Performance: Following contract re-negotiations, AdeM
improved its operational performance considerably from late 2004. Progress took place in
the implementation of delegated and non-delegated works, water quality had generally
been lifted to World Health Organization (WHO) standards, water mains and distribution
systems were rehabilitated and/or upgraded, connections were renewed, a limited number
of new connections were installed, and billing and collection systems improved. As a
result sufficient and reliable water supplies were assured except in Maputo where the
AfDB-financed increase in storage capacity encountered delays. While some cities
including Nampula and Quelimane experienced significant progress and service
improvements, other areas like Maputo experienced less progress than expected. The
extent of water testing was not always adequate as it varied depending on the equipment
available, and some of the tests for less common pollutants were never initiated. AdeM
lagged behind in bulk and retail metering and the share of unaccounted-for water has
increased in all cities. The latter issue is a combination of technical and commercial
factors. A large part of the networks still consists of old pipes which suffer high water
losses through leakage when they are put under constant high pressure. Tardy retail meter
installation, lack of bulk meters, tampering and destruction/theft of meters, and negligent
reading practices, combined with billing or collection problems have contributed to large
commercial losses.

31.     Apart from these operational issues, the cooperation of AdeM with FIPAG has
not been smooth and effective in some areas. The PO's reporting has been irregular, and
customer relationships have not always been managed well. The operator's lack of
experience with Bank procurement procedures led FIPAG to eventually take back the
procurement responsibility. The implementation of delegated works in the four secondary
cities encountered delays when it became clear that their costs had been underestimated.
The delay had a negative effect on the unaccounted-for-water which the delegated works
were designed to reduce.

32.     Management of operations in the four cities also proved difficult at times as
authority in FIPAG's personnel matters was not always very clear. Under the
management contract(s) the PO selected and recommended the area Directors (FIPAG's
employees) and trained them in Portugal. Towards the end of the contract the
responsibilities under the management contracts were re-defined, with FIPAG personnel
assuming the task of day-to-day operations while the PO focused on important
unresolved issues such as metering and water leakage. The AdeM Management Contract

for the 4 cities ended on March 31, 2008 after about 9 years. At the time of project
closure, FIPAG was managing the systems on a temporary basis with specific short-term
TA for various specialized activities while advancing the contracting for new lease
operators for the four cities. The four cities will continue to be supported under a
repeater project to NWDP II entitled Water Services and Institutional Support Project
(WASIS).

33.     In the Maputo lease contract the responsibilities of the PO are clearer but the flow
of information to FIPAG was at times insufficient and constant arrears in payment of the
lease fees represented a serious threat to FIPAG's financial viability, particularly between
2004 and 2007. As referred to above, the PR with the PO was successfully concluded in
May 2008 and the lease contract will continue up to the next PR in April 2011. Further, it
was decided that for the mutual benefit of all parties, the extension of the Lease Contract
beyond its original 15 years will be considered before the next PR, depending on the
performance of the PO.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

34.     The M&E framework was clearly set out in the PAD (section C.5 and Annex 1).
The framework was adequate and was used effectively by the Borrower, its agencies and
the Bank to follow implementation progress and achievements, and to address emerging
issues. Key elements in this framework were FIPAG and CRA reports and audits and the
monitoring of key performance indicators both under the lease and the management
contracts. Another important element was the Stakeholder Forum that met annually with
FIPAG as intended. It served as a mechanism for coordination with key central and local
government entities and assumed in addition to M&E also the function of an important
platform to discuss and decide on implementation of GOM's water sector policy, in
particular decentralization aspects. An additional significant M&E instrument consisted
of annual independent technical audits of the PO performance commissioned by FIPAG.
M&E deviated only in one respect from the initial design. As it became clear that
Component C was in essence geared towards regulatory activities, the main responsibility
for monitoring progress of that component was shifted from DNA to CRA. This did not
require any formal revisions of project scope as it only entailed a change in emphasis and
since CRA had been entrusted an important role in implementation of Component C from
the beginning. Finally, it included periodic beneficiary assessments by CRA in peri-
urban areas to monitor consumer satisfaction and prices not only for those connected to
AdeM, but for those not connected.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

35.     The NWDP II is an Environmental Assessment (EA) Category B project since
there were expected to be minor environmental impacts on construction, some land
acquisition, and/ or compensation for losses and damages to the property. These
safeguard concerns were managed through the implementation of FIPAG's
Environmental Management System (EMS) and the Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) prepared for the Project. FIPAG, over the course of the Project, has developed a
strong capacity, and has a demonstrated commitment and track record for employing
these instruments to avoid or minimize adverse safeguards issues. As a key example, the


                                            10
Bank's senior social scientist assigned to the Project undertook a final review of the
implementation of the RAPs for Domela (Quelimane) and Mutua (Beria) villages in
March 2008. The review confirmed that the RAPs have been implemented in a highly
satisfactory and a satisfactory manner, respectively for the two villages. Clearance for
completion of the RAP in good standing was given.

36.    The two main implementing agencies developed and maintained accounting and
financial management systems which have the capacity of recording all transactions and
balances correctly. These systems were used for preparing regular financial statements
and safeguarding the entities' assets. The auditing arrangements were also carried out in
accordance with Bank requirements. The implementing agencies maintained acceptable
financial management arrangements for the Project including the Project's system
accounting, reporting, auditing and internal controls. Financial management issues that
emerged during supervision missions, audit reports, and management letters were
discussed with the agencies and resolved satisfactorily.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

37.    Over the project implementation period, FIPAG and CRA have evolved into fully
functional and adequately-staffed sector institutions with clearly defined roles and
responsibilities. They are thus well-equipped to continue fulfilling these functions after
completion of the Project but they are also slated to assume growing responsibilities as
the delegated management framework in the urban water sector is expanding. The
Maputo operation is designed to continue for another four years under the original lease
contract, and should, barring adverse factors, be subsequently extended under a new
contractual arrangement. Financing for additional investments, particularly in supply
capacity and network expansion for Maputo, has been secured from the EU, EIB, FMO,
AFD and GOM under the Maputo Water Supply Project. GPOBA financing is also
expected to provide 10,000 low-income connections in Maputo.

38.     The operations in the four secondary cities are currently in the process of being
tendered to private operators under lease arrangements, with modifications to the existing
one in Maputo. The Bank will provide further support to these operations as well as to
CRA through financing of investments and technical assistance under the repeater project
WASIS. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is also funding works in three of the
cities. The cities are also benefiting from the provision of 30,000 connections to low -
income consumers funded by GPOBA. Four additional cities in the Northern region,
whose investments will be supported by AfDB, MCC, and GOM have been transferred to
be under the responsibility of FIPAG.
        
39.    Overall, NWDP II has also been instrumental in the implementation of GOM's
urban water supply policy which is now fully based on the concept of the delegated
management framework. FIPAG's centralized asset management functions are involved
in decision making locally through the Stakeholder Forum and on-site coordination
mechanisms. FIPAG's planning and business development unit has qualified staff who
own and operate its financial model, uses it as a strategic business tool to assess the
impact of taking on new cities, and makes recommendation to its management and the
Government. When the proposal emerged that FIPAG would be given the mandate to


                                           11
take over the water supply operations of four additional cities in the Northern part of the
country, FIPAG carefully analyzed the financial and operational impact of such a
proposal, and requested the Government to inject US$2 million in operating subsidies
specifically targeted to support these four cities. This was granted by the Government to
ensure that FIPAG's financial sustainability and its capacity to repay its debts would not
be compromised with increasing responsibilities.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

40.     The original project objectives remain consistent with current country, sectoral and
global priorities, and Bank assistance strategies. Provision of potable and reliable water
supply is a critical element of infrastructure expansion in Mozambique. It significantly
affects the well-being of people through its impact on health, education, gender equality,
and productivity. Unreliable water services have also been identified as a key constraint
to the business environment in the 2002 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) for
Mozambique. GOM's action plans for poverty reduction in the past decade - PARPA I
(2001-2005) as well as PARPA II (2005-2009) - include the lack of potable drinking
water as a critical area for improvement. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
objectives support the growth pillars outlined in PARPA II and set an outcome indicator
of "improved access, reliability and quality of water in targeted areas of high
demographic growth" to meet the goals in Pillar 2, specifically equitable access to public
services. The design and implementation of the Project correspond well to these goals, as
the successful outcome of the Project demonstrates.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

41.     Private sector participation was promoted through the 15-year lease contract for
the city of Maputo and a four-year management contract for the cities of Beira,
Quelimane, Nampula, and Pemba, both with AdeM. A key factor in achievement of the
Project's objectives was the successful establishment of a credible institutional
framework including FIPAG as the main contracting party with private sector operators
and the independent regulatory authority CRA. The momentum created by FIPAG and
CRA has meanwhile resulted in expanding the delegated management framework from
the five project cities to 20 cities with assets under FIPAG management slated to increase
almost four-fold from US$115 million to US$500 million.

42.     Water quality has considerably improved with almost 100 percent of
microbiological samples with respect to water quality indicators for meeting WHO
standards for total coloiform and fecal coliform tests meeting target values across the five
cities compared to initial values of 50 percent in 2000. This achievement is all the more
notable as it relates to a much larger water volume and significantly extended operating
hours. The improvements in reliability of service are demonstrated by a dramatic increase
in service hours per day particularly over the last couple of years. In Nampula and Beira,
customers already received water 24 hours per day in 2007-2008, seven days a week up
from previous levels ranging around 10-12 hours a day, while Quelimane and Pemba
have dropped from 24 hours per day in 2007 to 22 and 18 hours respectively in 2008.


                                            12
This is a result of erratic power supplies unrelated to FIPAG's investments. Maputo has
performed less well on this score increasing its daily service from 11 hours in 2000 to 14
hours in 2008. This result is a combination of insufficient treatment and storage capacity
which will be addressed by the Maputo Water Supply Project to be completed in 2012
which should also result in Maputo reaching a 24 hours supply. Other issues such as
inadequate leakage control and widespread theft are being addressed through operational
efficiency measures by AdeM.

43.     The Project also achieved a substantial improvement in service levels. One
measure for this has been the overall increase in water production by 63 percent in the
five cities. The fact that the number of connections rose by only 34 percent during this
period reflects the improvement of service levels not only overall, but also per connection
due to longer and more reliable service. The Project's principal goal was to augment
production capacity essentially through new works and upgrading of treatment plants and
existing primary networks. An increase in total population coverage was therefore not
incorporated in the PDO but was included in the performance indicators (see Section
1.2). The Project substantially raised coverage within and to a limited extent outside the
existing networks due to new connections. But the overall coverage of the urban
population increased only marginally as a result of rapid growth of the urban population.
With existing facilities and networks were upgraded under the Project, more substantial
increases in service coverage of the total population can be achieved through network
expansions. The funding for such expansions is to be provided under the repeater project
WASIS and the Maputo Water Supply Project.

44.    The three beneficiary assessments, conducted by CRA during project
implementation, as well as the feedback from the stakeholders have shown that the
connected customers in peri-urban areas served by FIPAG report that the quality, pressure,
hours and frequency of outages has improved since 2001. At the same time, with one of
the water sources most frequently used by the poor, standpipes, satisfaction with aspects
of management and price declined, reflecting both a lack of attention to these and a
preference among consumers for purchase of water from others with house connections.
As FIPAG improves its performance, more municipalities and local governments are
expressing their interests to have their water supply operations transferred to FIPAG for
improved service delivery in their areas.
        
45.     It can also be said that NWDP II has almost met its financial sustainability objective
as well, as FIPAG is very close to achieving full cost recovery in 2008 as compared to its
cost recovery of 68 percent in 2003. If the tariffs had been increased at the rate of
inflation, FIPAG would have achieved a breakeven point by 2008. On cash terms,
FIPAG has maintained a positive cash position over the past few years, and the
financial projections show that FIPAG will be able to pay its debt service obligations
when they start in two years time, comply with the Project's debt service coverage
covenant, and continue to maintain full cost recovery during the next ten years.
        

46.     Component A-Private Sector Management (US$42.7 million PAD, US$38.5
million actual)-Moderately Satisfactory: While the lease contract did not imply any
costs, the actual costs of the management contract(s) at US$5.5million were nearly
identical to the PAD projection (without contingencies). Implementation of the

                                             13
delegated works (US$14.5 million) were 13 percent lower than the PAD estimates and
demonstrated clearly the challenges of assessing investment needs of an old network
with deficient technical information, leading to numerous plan modifications. The
length of pipe and meter replacements exceeded initial estimates and additional
standpipes were installed, while connection renewals and new connections were lower
than planned, except renewals for Quelimane. Expenses for delegated services at
US$3 million were somewhat higher than planned. Contract management costs of
FIPAG exceeded projections minimally, with more emphasis on technical assistance,
consultancies and FIPAG equipment, and less on working capital and O&M costs for
the four cities due to the Project's implementation delays. Even though works and
services under this component have been by and large satisfactorily implemented, the
rating has taken into account the delays caused by the ownership change and contract
renegotiations (see Sections 2.1 and 2.2) and the mixed PO performance since 2002
(see also Section 2.2). The private operator's' performance improved after the lease
was fully re-negotiated in 2004. Most recently, years 2008 to 2009 show a more
robust improvement. It can not be denied that the presence of the private sector
contract and the provision of clear "rules of the game" as a result contributed greatly
to the increase in investments provided by donors. This is particularly true of the
large EU/EIB investment in Maputo under the Maputo Water Supply Project.

47.     Component B-Capital Works and Services (US$64.4 million PAD, US$89.6
million actual)-Satisfactory: Under this component, major investments were carried
out to secure water supply to the networks. Investments in the four secondary cities
were funded by the IDA Credit and the Dutch grant. The total costs of capital works
in Quelimane remained somewhat below appraisal estimates which is particularly
noteworthy as they included the largest IDA financed work contract of about US$13
million. Works in Beira, Nampula and Pemba were affected by significant cost
overruns compared to the PAD as major rehabilitation needs (water treatment plants,
distribution centers) had to be added or their costs adjusted. In Beira, additional cost
overruns were incurred due to flooding that required de-mining twice in two seasons
and delayed construction of the new intake, transmission mains, and a new
distribution center, as well as refurbishment of the water treatment works. Cost
overruns have in some cases resulted from the need for re-design due to operational
considerations, and there have also been a few cases of low design quality and weak
performance of AdeM's supervision team. Despite these shortcomings, the principal
investments in the four secondary cities have been satisfactorily completed and have
achieved the objective of ensuring water supply for the current networks and for a
major increase in connections in the future. The rating for this component is
principally based on the successful execution of works in the four cities.

48.     Substantial implementation delays and cost increases of 44 percent pertained
to the AfDB financed capital works in Maputo. While rehabilitation of the water
treatment facilities cost less than expected, repair and renewal of the distribution
system was much more expensive than planned. However, despite these capital works
adequate water supply to the existing networks in Maputo is not yet assured (see
"Achievement of Project Development Objectives" above). To reach this goal, a
substantial expansion in water storage capacity is necessary which is envisaged to be
installed under the Maputo Water Supply Project.


                                          14
        
49.      Component C-Urban Water Supply Policy and Strategy (US$5.1 million PAD,
US$5.1 million actual)-Satisfactory: The component, designed to support CRA's
establishment was initially to be implemented by DNA. As the mid-term review
approached, the Component had progressed very little, and it had become clear that, after
full establishment of CRA, it would be appropriate to entrust the principal responsibility
for the component's implementation to that institution. This was subsequently recognized
as part of a broader DCA amendment approved in February 2004 and effective in July
2004 when a special account under CRA's management was created. The component,
initially affected by the overall project implementation delays and by cumbersome
administration arrangements, was then largely implemented as planned. It financed i.e.
equipment for CRA, design and implementation of an action plan for the institution,
beneficiary assessments, an institutional development study, a tariff study, general
technical assistance over 18 months, and training for CRA staff. In addition, the
Component also financed part of the preparatory work for WASIS through a study
focused on institutional, regulatory and financial aspects of water supply in smaller cities,
and through transaction advisers on the bidding process for the future lease contracts in
the four secondary cities.

3.3    Efficiency

50.     Procurement under the Project followed Bank guidelines and most works, goods
and services were competitively tendered. As a result of the fast economic development
over the 15 years after the end of the civil war, and given the vicinity to South Africa,
there is a wide variety of foreign and increasingly local contractors and suppliers, as
well as consultants in Mozambique to ensure cost effectiveness.

51.     The contract re-negotiation with the PO and the ensuing increase by about 30%
of the PO's unit rates for delegated works and the operator tariff for Maputo did not
result from low cost effectiveness of the PO (under changed ownership) but were a
consequence of the initial underbidding of the contract coupled with the need to adapt
designs and operating methods to the actual state of the network as it became known.
The level of unit O&M cost of water production, reflected in the tariffs, appears
reasonable in comparison with other water supply operations under similar
circumstances, but further efficiency gains should be possible through reduction of
unaccounted-for water and expansion of networks.
        
52.     Financial rate of return was not calculated in the PAD. As a result of an increase
in the number of new connections in the four secondary cities during 2007, FIPAG
achieved significant performance improvements, almost reaching full cost recovery.
FIPAG overall has shown steady improvements in its financial performance over the past
years. Its revenues have increased at the rate of 10%-20% annually for the last two years.
However, lack of regular tariff increases over the last two years has caused FIPAG to run
a small deficit, risking FIPAG's debt repayment capacity. The GOM has agreed to
postpone FIPAG's debt service obligations for the payment of IDA and AfDB debt from
2008 to 2010 to allow FIPAG's cash flows to build up and be consolidated. As a result,
FIPAG's debt repayment capacity has been strengthened significantly. The reasons for
this deviation from the more optimistic PAD projections are; (i) the delay in project


                                             15
implementation caused principally by the contractual difficulties and re-negotiations
during the first four years; (ii) slower than projected increases in tariffs in 2007 and 2008
although it had been very regular up to this point; (iii) persisting high rates of
unaccounted-for (i.e. unpaid) water in the four secondary cities; and (iv) irregular
payments and arrears of the Maputo lease fee. By the end of 2009 FIPAG is expected to
achieve a financial break-even point and its net cash flows are expected to turn positive.

53.     The lease contracts for the four cities, supported under the follow-on WASIS
project should enable FIPAG to be relieved of operational short-falls from the four
secondary cites. The improved and more reliable payments of the variable rental fee from
the Maputo lease will also support cash flow. Under the assumption of reliable revenues
from the Maputo lease, a one-time tariff adjustment in 2010, and annual tariff revisions
thereafter, and good performance on the increase in new connections and on bill
collection, FIPAG is likely to achieve medium to long-term financial sustainability.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

54.     Despite considerable implementation issues over the first few years and
notwithstanding the resulting delays, the Project has reached most of its development
objectives. It has also been instrumental in implementing GOM's urban water sector
policy by establishing an overall institutional, regulatory and operating framework for
urban water supply. This has led to the efficient provision of water services under the
delegated management framework not only in the five project cities, but also in additional
cities under the responsibility of FIPAG. While the financial results are somewhat below
those projected at appraisal, they need to be seen in the context of the longer-term
framework which offers good prospects for reaching the desired efficiency at the wider
sector level in the future. For these reasons the overall outcome of the Project is rated
satisfactory.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development (Not Applicable)

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening (covered in 2.1 and 2.5 above)

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (Not Applicable)

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

55.     A case study detailing Mozambique's experience in delegated management
framework for the urban water sector has been prepared using Public Private
Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) grants in 2008, summarizing the evolution of
the sector during the past ten years. A dissemination workshop was held in Maputo in
June 2009, attended by all major stakeholders in the sector. The workshop report is
attached at Annex 6 of this ICR. While there were some challenges raised and discussed
with regards to FIPAG's future expansion and financing plans, the results of the
workshop were generally positive, with the municipalities and the beneficiaries
expressing their satisfaction towards FIPAG and CRA's contribution to improving the

                                             16
water services in the urban centers of Mozambique during the past years.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

56.     The water regulatory framework and the regulatory agency CRA are fully
functional (see Sections 2.5 and 3.2). The risk of unraveling of the relatively advanced
regulatory framework in the sector therefore appears very low. CRA has for the most
part been effective in the maintenance of a mandated tariff policy based on full cost
recovery. Even when the tariff was not increased during the last two years of the Project,
the Government took proper measures to ensure that FIPAG's cost recovery policy was
not compromised. For the purposes of development outcomes, full cost recovery has been
interpreted pragmatically by CRA and the Borrower to mean full recovery primarily of
O&M costs, and recovery of depreciation and capital cost to the extent feasible, given
consumers' ability to pay, operating efficiency, and public good considerations. This was
also accepted by the Bank in the 2004 DCA amendment, appears appropriate under the
Mozambican circumstances, and reflects experiences in other poor countries. Therefore
the development outcomes would not be considered at risk even if the sector continued to
require capital cost support/subsidies for some time.

57.     The devolution of responsibilities to local authorities has been achieved through
appropriate arrangements with FIPAG and not through establishment of publicly owned
water companies in the five cities. The municipalities participate in the annual general
assembly of FIPAG and are represented on the FIPAG administration board. The
municipalities assess FIPAG's performance, participate in the definition of priority areas
for the development of water services in the municipal areas, and advise the Government
on the overall sector development. While there is consensus that water operations should
be run on commercial principles of cost recovery and managed by private operators, the
local governments have recognized the advantages of centralized asset management as
provided by FIPAG. Under this arrangement, the municipalities whose water services are
currently supplied by FIPAG are in general satisfied with the performance of FIPAG and
feel sufficiently included in the decision processes relating to investments and operations
at the local level. As FIPAG improves its performance,, other municipalities are
expressing their interests in transferring their water supply operations to the responsibility
of FIPAG.

58.     Risks to development outcomes could emerge if unexpectedly the main
shareholder and operator of the Maputo lease decided to pull out due to a lack of
agreement on the operator tariff and unit rates for works, or if there are issues with the
selected private operator for the four cities under the lease arrangements proposed in the
bidding documents. These risks appear small as the Maputo lease contract has recently
been successfully re-negotiated for another four years and the lease operator for the four
cities has already been selected. Further, if these risks occurred, they would most likely
be temporary since under an established asset management and proven regulatory
framework, and with essential investments and operational improvements implemented,
there is no reason why suitable contractual options could not be found to attract private
partners.
        


                                             17
59.     FIPAG's financial sustainability appears likely and it should be able to start
servicing its debt as of 2010 (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3).

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality of Entry.
Rating: Satisfactory

60.     The Bank responded effectively to GOM's request for support to the reform of the
urban water sector. Following identification, substantial Bank input was provided over
the course of two years for project preparation. This period covers the preparation of the
National Water Development Project I and II as these were originally prepared as a single
project. The Projects were subsequently divided and were presented to the Board in 1998
and 1999 respectively. The decision to split it off was justified as it allowed a sharper
focus on the specific requirements of private sector involvement and ensured full
attention of the Bank, GOM and participating institutions to the preparatory process. The
Bank undertook considerable efforts during project preparation to help GOM choose an
appropriate overall project design and minimize the potential risks to the operation. The
Bank also assisted GOM in completing the necessary studies, estimating project costs,
defining a new sectoral framework and establishing the needed institutional
infrastructure. Adequate attention was given to technical, financial, economic, fiduciary,
and safeguard issues. Project investment cost estimates, while thorough and
comprehensive, did not go into detailed design issues as these were to be managed by an
experienced private operator in cooperation with FIPAG. Most importantly, the Bank
worked with the GOM throughout the selection process for the private operator which
was concluded by the time of appraisal. It thus ascertained that the lease and management
contracts were in place at the start of the Project and that implementation could begin
without delays after Credit approval and effectiveness. The main implementation issues
faced later on were not predictable at that time (see Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above).

(b) Quality of Supervision.
Rating: Satisfactory

61.    The Bank fielded 18 missions during the Project's nine years of implementation,
with typically a two week mission taking place twice a year. The missions - consisting of
four members on average- reviewed, assessed and monitored operational, management,
technical, financial, fiduciary and safeguard issues, and compliance with legal covenants.
The relationships with the Borrower agencies, specifically Ministério das Obras e
Habitação (MOPH), FIPAG and CRA developed in a positive and constructive way, and
problems were discussed and resolved in a cooperative manner. The Bank also
maintained communication and cooperated with the private operator to the extent
appropriate given its indirect relationship with the company. Supervision reporting was of
high quality and detail, and flagged important issues early and persistently (e.g. initial
contractual problems with SAUR, non-payment of the Maputo lease fees). The mid-term
review undertook a thorough assessment of the Project at the time when the contracts
with the PO had at long last been re-negotiated. Important decisions taken during the
mid-term review and implemented thereafter included (i) revision of the detailed

                                           18
performance indicators; (ii) flexible interpretation of cost recovery; (iii) modification of
on-lending terms to FIPAG; and (iv) creation of a second special account for CRA -
Component C.

62.     There was a high degree of continuity on the Bank team - with only one task
manager and one external engineer on all the supervision missions. Three consecutive
financial analysts with thorough understanding of the sector were instrumental in helping
FIPAG develop and use its financial planning and forecasting model. Procurement and
financial management support were provided in a satisfactory manner through the
regional hub and country office. Safeguard support was excellent in quality and produced
a good result. A resident senior water specialist joined the team during 2007, contributing
valuable experience from Latin America and East Asia and providing continuity for the
repeater project WASIS and other sector-related matters.

63.     Nevertheless, some aspects in the supervision process could in hindsight have
been handled more effectively. The potential effect of the VAT introduction in April
2000 on required counterpart funds could have been recognized by the Bank earlier
during project implementation (see Section 2.2). Tax payments were declared eligible for
IDA disbursements with the modification of the country parameters for Mozambique in
August 2004. However, it was not until March 2007 that the DCA was modified
correspondingly which negatively affected procurement and disbursements. The Bank
might also have taken a more proactive approach on the issue of non-payment of lease
fees by pursuing more forcefully with the Borrower and the implementing agencies the
establishment of an escrow account or other mechanism to secure these payments.

(c) Justification of Rating of Overall Bank Performance.
Rating: Satisfactory

64.     The Bank played an instrumental role in advising GOM on the reform, creation of
the institutional framework, and involvement of private operators in the urban water
sector. It contributed constructively to project preparation and assisted GOM in
adequately anticipating the principal risks foreseeable at that time. Intense supervision
efforts helped the Government address major implementation issues. The Bank's support
thus helped to keep the Project on track so that it was able to meet its development
objectives.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

65.     The Government worked closely with the Bank team on all important aspects of
the Project. Preparation (commenced under NWDP I) addressed the organizational,
management, operational and commercial aspects satisfactorily, and adequately
addressed the technical assistance and training requirements of key sector institutions,
specifically FIPAG and CRA. The lease and management contracts were prepared in
great detail with specialized technical assistance, a private operator (consortium) was
selected through a competitive bidding process, thorough financial and economic
analyses were undertaken, environmental and social impact assessments were carried out

                                            19
and fiduciary aspects were well defined. During implementation, the Government
demonstrated remarkable leadership by steadfastly pursuing and supporting the sector
reform initiated under the Project. It cooperated closely with the Bank, its cofinanciers,
the Dutch Government and the AfDB, and the shareholders of the private operator to
address the major implementation issues that emerged over the couple of years and led to
re-negotiation of the lease and management contracts. The Government's constructive
and forward-looking approach was instrumental in re-vitalizing the Project after the
ownership change in AdeM, enabling the achievement of its development objectives
despite delays. The Bank's project review missions received serious attention and wrap-
up meetings were always taken to the highest level, i.e. the respective Ministers who
demonstrated keen interested in the outcomes.

66.    However, there were also implementation issues on which the Government
performed less satisfactorily. While the government provided counterpart funds at levels
estimated at appraisal, it failed to anticipate - similarly to the Bank - the effect of the
VAT introduction in 2000 on contractors' costs and thus on the corresponding increase in
required counterpart funds (see Section 2.2). The Government did eventually contribute
additional counterpart funds to cover FIPAG's increased payment requirements to
contractors, but only at a late stage. It also took a long time to request an amendment to
the DCA which finally made VAT payments eligible for disbursements under the Credit
as of April 2007. A related issue was the slow contract approval by the National Contract
Committee (CREE). These two issues caused implementation delays and triggered cost
increases due to escalation clauses in the contracts. The Government could also have
played a more pro-active role in assisting the PO with respect to tariff payment arrears
and defaults by qualifying state-owned entities and could have given renewed
consideration to the issue of payment delays of non-qualifying institutions. However, it is
noted that these two issues were not a project specific issue as it cut across all sectors.
The issues were also raised in review meetings of the Bank's portfolio with GOM.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

67.     FIPAG implemented components A and B - in cooperation with AdeM -
satisfactorily and largely in line with initial expectations regarding the components'
content. As outlined above, the substantial delays incurred over the first three years and
the resulting cost overruns on some sub-components were not predictable and largely
beyond the control of FIPAG. During periods of serious operational difficulties of AdeM
under SAUR's leadership, while the contracts with AdeM were being re-negotiated,
FIPAG played a very constructive role and succeeded in keeping the Project moving
ahead against overwhelming odds. After the contracts were re-negotiated and AdeM's
new management under leadership of AdeP was in place, FIPAG cooperated well and
built a close working relationship with the PO that made up significantly for initial
delays. An adequate organizational structure was put in place at FIPAG, local
management and technical personnel was successfully trained, effective operational and
financial systems were introduced, performance indicators agreed at appraisal and
modified after the mid-term review were by and large well monitored, legal covenants
were complied with and reporting was kept up to date. FIPAG also cooperated very well
with the Bank ensuring excellent quality of briefing materials for review missions and
adequate information flow in between.

                                            20
68.     FIPAG's operational and financial results depend to a significant extent on
AdeM's performance. While there have clearly been considerable operational
improvements under private management, AdeM's performance in some areas has at
times been lagging behind expectations (see Sections 2.2 and 3.2). FIPAG addressed
these issues in the four secondary cities from 2006 on by targeting the remaining PO
resources under the management contracts strategically to the weaker areas and taking
direct control over some established aspects of day-to-day operations. In the case of the
Maputo lease, FIPAG's leverage was much smaller and continuous delays of lease fee
payments put substantial strain on its cash flow.
        
69.     CRA established itself as independent regulator and performed the balancing role
between consumers' and operators' interests very skillfully (see Sections 2.5 and 3.2).
Project administrative matters relating to Component C were handled effectively. An
adequate organizational structure was put in place, management and technical personnel
was successfully trained, operational and financial systems were set up, and legal
covenants were complied with. Tariffs were adjusted periodically for the most part in line
with inflation and taking into account operating cost development (evolution of tariff
revisions is summarized in Annex 3), and CRA proved itself independent regulator in
difficult circumstances. Even when the tariff increase could not take place during the last
two years of the project, GOM introduced other measures to ensure the financial
sustainability of the sector, as detailed in section 3.3 and Annex 3.

(c) Justification of Rating of Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

70.     Both the government and the implementing agencies were fully committed to the
Project and the reforms of the urban water sector. They maintained strong support for the
development objectives throughout the Project and played an instrumental role in
overcoming the serious implementation issues in the first three years. While some of
these issues could have been handled more effectively, the Borrower's overall
performance contributed to the Project reaching its objectives and the intended sector
reforms to be implemented.

6.         Lessons Learned

71.     Strong Government commitment can ensure success even under adverse
circumstances: Strong commitment on the part of GOM to sector reform and private
participation ensured the satisfactory outcome of the Project. An institutional framework
was put in place well before the Project's start. This structure provided stability and
prevented the Project from ending in disaster when it faced serious start-up problems.
The commitment to the process also helped overcome the protracted period of contract
re-negotiations, put the Project on a lasting basis, ensured post-completion continuity,
and helped mobilize substantial additional funding to expand the sector framework to
other cities.

72.    Bidding processes for the selection of private operators need to take into
consideration uncertainties about the condition of old networks: The bidding process


                                            21
for the lease and management contracts resulted in retrospect in the need for GOM to
make a difficult choice. The proposal of the consortium headed by SAUR offered a far
lower operator tariff for the Maputo lease and lower unit rates for delegated works and
fees for services than the competing proposal. Despite some doubts about the proposal's
sustainability, an independent engineer's assessment provided no technical justification to
discard the lower bid and select the alternative, i.e. the second-ranked proposal submitted
by a consortium headed by another reputable and experienced international operator,
Lyonnaise des Eaux. In reality, the operator tariff requested for the Maputo lease as well
as the cost estimates (unit rates) for delegated works were unrealistically low and
therefore unsustainable. One of the main problems was the uncertainty regarding
rehabilitation costs and ­ for the Maputo lease ­ the revenue potential because of
insufficient knowledge about the status of the network and its customer base. This
problem was exacerbated by the damages that the flooding caused at the very outset of
the Project particularly in southern Mozambique. In retrospect it might have been more
appropriate to include in the bidding process an initial "transitional" operating period for
network reconnaissance, followed by a negotiation process based on more précis
knowledge the networks and customers. This could have meant a two-step bidding
process. The first step would only have covered the initial transitional period under a
technical/management assistance arrangement, and the second step, open to all interested
and previously pre-qualified bidders, would have been the main bid for the
lease/management contracts.

73.       Private operator performance depends on the adjustment to local conditions:
Before the Project started, the principal participants believed that it would be sufficient to
involve an experienced international operator with good reputation that would offer its
operational experience and methods as a package in order to achieve fast operational
improvements. However, the practical results have shown that such an operator may not
be easily able to adapt its methods to the specific local requirements and may thus not
achieve a satisfactory knowledge transfer. It is therefore very difficult for the contracting
institutions to predict how suitable an operator's approach will be within the local reality.
Under the given circumstances, the departure of the lead partner SAUR and necessary re-
negotiation of the contracts were in part consequence of this adaptation issue, which
caused substantial time loss and implementation delays. As became evident in the
Project, there are a number of practical aspects to the adjustment difficulties outlined
above. Despite the strong bidding team which had a firm grasp of the Project, a well
structured and organized take-over team was not in place at the commencement of private
operations. Missing team coherence thus impeded an efficient transition and leadership
from the international partners' headquarters was not apparent. This was aggravated by
the fact that a number of team members had been hired from outside and were not even
familiar with SAUR's and AdeP's corporate cultures and operations. Moreover, each of
the two main partners delegated its own team to AdeM and these two teams were not
efficiently coordinated. Private operations have also suffered from a rapid turnover of
managers, with four managers so far for the Maputo lease and three for the secondary
cities (since 2004). For these reasons and against initial expectations, the experience
accumulated by SAUR in the Mozambican setting through a previous 5-year operating
contract in Matola was not transferred to contracts under this Project.
74.      In a comparable situation it would be important to ensure that a strong take-over
team be assembled, that the contracting institutions have a chance to assess the team


                                             22
members' qualifications ­ possibly through interviews and trial periods, that the main
international partners demonstrate how the team members are linked to their headquarters
and have access to corporate support and institutional memory, that this team coordinates
closely with the sector institutions from the beginning and that a policy of promoting
Mozambican staffing be designed and put in place early during project implementation. It
might even be justified to require as part of the bidding and selection process that the
take-over team be put through a special training period at the main international partner's
headquarters to familiarize its members fully with the Project, provide them with the
corporate views on the operations, i.e. the link to the bidding team, and create the
necessary team spirit and cohesion before they are sent to the field.

75.     Promotion/development of local water operators: At the outset of the Project, the
use of the international private sector was expected to be an expeditious way forward to
provide improved service levels quickly in post conflict Mozambique that had a serious
capacity shortage. There were few engineers and almost no capacity in financial
management and utility management when the Project was being developed. The idea was
to "buy-in" expertise and overtime build up local management capacity within the utility as
local manpower would reduce costs and improve profits for the private operator. The
expected results have materialized with significant delays. Over the past ten years the
number of expatriates of the PO has been reduced from over ten at the start of the project,
to only three in September 2009. It is expected that the lease contracts in the secondary
towns will provide an opportunity for locally based entrepreneurs to bid in cities that are
smaller and have completely upgraded infrastructure that should reduce operational risks.
        
76.      Cost recovery and sustainability need to be flexibly defined: The original goal at
the time of project preparation/appraisal was to achieve a cost basis and efficiency level
that would allow full cost recovery through user tariffs. In reality this goal turned out to
be over-ambitious for the following reasons (i) despite the proven willingness of
customers to pay a higher tariff per unit when service improves, beneficiary surveys and
continuous contacts through customer relations demonstrated that tariffs much above the
current levels (varying around US$0.50 per m3) would not be accepted. Even if there
were no open resistance, as has happened in other places, full cost recovery tariffs would
likely to lead to significant reductions of volumes consumed per connection and/or per
user. This would prevent FIPAG/PO to attain economies of scale and reduce costs with
the existing networks.
        
77.     The optimal tariff level, determined by the relevant elasticity, is therefore likely to
remain in the near term beneath full cost recovery, and this should be considered
appropriate for the following reasons: (i) Since the Project supported a substantial sector
reform program, tariffs should not be expected to reflect the total costs of the program.
Therefore, the practice applied under the Project appears justified to exclude some of the
soft costs (e.g. technical assistance, training) from the cost recovery goal. (ii) Specifically
in poor countries such as Mozambique, the public-good nature and secondary benefits of
water supply need to be taken into account in tariff setting. (iii) It takes years to fully
rehabilitate and expand war-ravaged networks, and to build up local, and even foreign
operating capacity to best-practice standards. In the medium term, there is a strong
possibility of substantial revenue increases and unit cost decreases through new
connections to the large part of the population that is currently not served through the


                                              23
networks and switch from public standpipes to yard/household connections. Due to
volume effects, this would reduce unit costs so that future tariff increases may not need to
be significant. The repeater project WASIS with its OBA component and the Maputo
Water Supply Project are expected to have that effect.

                       Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic Analysis:

1.      The implementation of NWDP II has led to increased capacity of water supply in
the five target cities, Maputo, Beira, Nampula, Quelimane, and Pemba. This has paved
the path for the follow on project, WASIS (with a total project cost of US$30 million),
which created the networks in the four cities of Beira, Pemba, Nampula, and Quelimane,
to deliver the new production capacity to consumers. Therefore, economic impact of
NWDP II is measured in the context of new households that will benefit from the formal
network of water supply, following the investments under both NWDP II and WASIS.
About 10,000 new connections are being made by the WASIS investments in the four
project towns in the form of yard taps, which will add approximately 53,000 new
consumers to the formal network, assuming an average household size of 5.3.

2.      A cost-benefit analysis using a "with and without project" methodology has been
used to calculate the EIRR and NPV of the two projects. The economic benefits are
derived from the new connections in the areas where households previously dependent on
neighbor's yard tap, standpost, or wells/boreholes are shifting to a formal yard tap
connection. The economic analysis estimates the benefits accruing to the project
beneficiaries, quantified in the form of incremental expenditure on meeting the household
water demand and time savings as a result of lower collection time. The time savings
constitute the largest component of the economic gains even when the collection time is
valued at a highly discounted rate. In addition to the direct benefits, the ability to access
water within the yard provides significant indirect productive and educational
opportunities primarily to women and children.

3.      The incremental economic benefits are projected over a 15 year period to arrive at
the EIRR and NPV based on a 10% (the hurdle rate IDA uses in WSS projects) discount
rate. The economic analysis suggests that the project has a positive economic NPV of
US$51 million and an EIRR of 60%. This implies that the project is beneficial to the
citizens of the four cities of Beira, Nampula, Pemba, and Quelimane in alleviating their
water supply concerns.

Financial Analysis:

4.      At the time of project appraisal, FIPAG's financial projections were made to
assess its financial sustainability. According to the analysis, FIPAG would be able to
generate a positive net income after the third year of operations, with an initial cash
injection of about US$2.5 million during the first years to cover the working capital
requirements for new works and US$2 million to fund liabilities of the former utilities.

5.      After ten years of operation, FIPAG has increased its customer base through a
large number of new connections, improved its collection efficiency, and controlled its
expenses to approach a financial breakeven point. FIPAG is likely to achieve full cost
recovery by end of December 2009. The lack of tariff increase during the past two years
has delayed FIPAG's cost recovery (evolution of the tariffs up to 2007 is summarized in
the table below). If the tariff had been raised according to inflation during the past two
years, FIPAG would have achieved full cost recovery by year 2008. It should be noted
that the two year postponement of the debt repayment to GOM is also helping FIPAG's
financial situation, as GOM had accepted the request from FIPAG to match the benefits
derived from the capital investments made under the project with the timing of debt
repayment.

6.      In terms of the capacity and capability of FIPAG to operate according to
commercial principles, significant progress has been made over the past years as the
strategy and business development unit has been established in FIPAG's HQ, with
qualified personnel operating FIPAG's financial model. FIPAG fully owns its financial
model and uses it effectively as a strategic business tool to make informed decisions
about its plans for future investments and expansion. FIPAG, together with the regulator
CRA, as credible institutions, have to date attracted over half a billion dollars in urban

                                                      29
water investments from donors and financiers including the EU, EIB, AfDB, Netherlands,
and France to expand their operations to 20 municipalities by year 2009.

7.      An updated financial projection analysis has been carried out at project closure
According to the base case scenario FIPAG is expected to generate sufficient cash to
cover its obligations and the related debt service covenant during the next ten years. The
cumulative effect on FIPAG's cash situation is illustrated in the graph below. The key
assumptions made under the base case include;

       Lease Contract in the Northern Cities: The lease contract under preparation in
       Beira, Nampula, Quelimane, and Pemba is expected to start in year 2010. The fee
       has been lowered to provide financial comfort to the bidders during the first two
       years.

       AfDB funded Cities: Nacala, Lichinga, Cuamba, and Angoche whose
       investments are funded under the AfDB loan are included. Operating subsidies in
       the amount of $2 million has been committed by the Government of Mozambique
       to cover the operating deficit for these cities in the initial years until they achieve
       an operational break-even point starting in 2015 according to the projections. The
       loan from the AfDB on-lent to FIPAG in the amount of US$22 million is
       incorporated in the debt repayment schedule.

       Maputo works: The expected delays in the rehabilitation and expansion work
       and the related revenues in Maputo by one year due to the higher than estimated
       bids by the contractors in incorporated.

       Tariff: According to the letter from GOM dated April 27, 2009 the adjustment
       will take into account inflation, affordability, and remaining gap to sustain the
       sector investments, and that in principle GOM agreed to approve the 20% tariff
       increase in November 2009, effective in February 2010. The model assumes this
       commitment by GOM and for the tariff rate to grow with inflation thereafter.

       Debt Repayment: GOM has approved the postponement of FIPAG's repayment
       of IDA and AfDB loans on-lent by GOM by two years, to start in FY10. FIPAG is
       requesting the postponement of the EIB loan repayment for two years as well in
       order to match the revenues from the investments with the debt repayment. Since
       there is sufficient indication from GOM to support this request, this has been
       incorporated in the model.

       Number of new connections: The number of new connections will increase at
       the rate indicated in the GPOBA plan for the first three years, and during the
       remaining period the connection rate will be in accordance with the actual
       capacity of the towns. For Maputo, the number of new connections is in
       accordance with the targets specified in the MOU between AdeM and FIPAG.

       Other Indicators: Unaccounted for water, collection ratio, and real metering rate
       for Maputo in the model are also in accordance with the targets specified in the

                                             30
MOU between AdeM and FIPAG. For other cities, these ratios are based on
historical performance.

                      Annex 5. Beneficiary Assessment Results

1.     Three beneficiary assessments have been carried out by CRA in an effort to
monitor how water services and prices evolved not only for the center urban connected
population, but also for the poorer unconnected peri-urban residents. The outcomes of the
most recent assessment, which focused on peri-urban areas in Maputo in 2006, and
compared the situation to 2001, are summarized below.

Key Conclusions - 2006 Beneficiary Assessment

2.      Coverage: In 2001, AdeM supplied approximately 86% of peri-urban residents
with water either directly (through their own connection) or indirectly (via resale from
yard taps or standpipes). In 2006 this number dropped to 63% partially because of high
urban population growth, a decline in the maintenance and use of public standpipes, and
flourishing small scale independent providers (SSIPs) who provide a good quality service,
albeit at a substantially higher price than AdeM. During this period the proportion of
the peri-urban population reliant on SSIPs doubled as those reliant on standpipes and
AdeM connections decreased proportionally. In peri-urban areas in 2006, there were
more households obtaining water from those with house connections (26%) than there
were people with house connections (23%).

3.      The continued high reliance on re-sold AdeM water means that [a] to some degree
existing consumers in these areas are protected against higher tariffs as they resell,
normally based on estimated not actual consumption billed; [b] the benefits of
improvements in water services affect more than the number formally connected; and [c]
the poorer unconnected population is less protected from price increases than those with
connections, who tend to have better welfare indicators.

4.      Quality: In peri-urban areas, consumer response on satisfaction with the quality
of services from AdeM sources showed a majority believed the level had improved for
indicators related to water (hours, pressure, quality). Not surprisingly, consumers were
less pleased with the price increases, and were relatively split on aspects related to
management such as the waiting time to pay a bill.

5.      Poverty Aspects: As one would expect, poor households are more likely to be
reliant on public standposts whereas only 5% of the lowest quintile and less than 15% of
the next to lowest quintile have their own AdeM connection. However, the most
common source of water for poorer households is a neighbour's tap.

6.      Prices: Higher water prices affect all consumers, not just those with AdeM
connections. Overall, consumers report that water prices between 2001 and 2006 have
increased 340% for AdeM connections, and 233% for those purchasing from neighbors
with AdeM connections. Households with connections have been more insulated against
the price increase as they resell and many pay only according to estimated (not actual)
consumption. Again, high demand (high population growth) is a key driver of these
prices as is evident in the higher cost of water from SSIPs.

7.      Water consumption by households with their own connection is de facto
decreasing, as well as that of households without a connection. The decrease of
consumption vis-à-vis the expansion of the sources of water, could be due to limited
system design in relation to the number of legal and illegal connections, as well as to
constraints brought about by the price of water. The use of alternative sources of water is
increasing, indicating limited capacity to pay, and the use of sources of free water has
remained the same. Given that in general free water sources are not in any way protected
against contamination, it is of interest not to force additional water use reductions by the
poorer strata (quintiles 1 and 2) through price increases.

8.      Public Standpipes: The decline in management aspects of public standpipes is of
concern as although imperfect, they nonetheless represent the second most common
source of water for peri-urban consumers in lower quintiles. Contributing factors to the
decline in public standposts includes: lack of consumer knowledge on management
structures duties or accountabilities which in turn contributes to poor transparency in
management, lack of pressure for accountability from residents, and illegal connections
that undermines standpipe performance.

9.    Willingness and Ability to Pay: In the peripheral neighbourhoods of the cities of
Maputo and Matola the demand for better water supply conditions, particularly for
domestic connections, is increasing among members of the social strata with a medium,
medium-high and high economic level - quintiles 3, 4 and 5.

10.    The limits of capacity to pay for domestic connections are mainly evident among
consumers without a connection of their own, but a small proportion has capacity to pay
for the current average level of consumption. In relation to standpipes, the poor
performance of AdeM standpipes and of the management structures influenced people's
willingness to choose no more than the minimum price.

1
    In 2001 this observation was not disaggregated.

2
 The water supply sources were aggregated so that the results could be compared, thus applying to small private
operators and neighbour's well/borehole. In 2001, small private operators were categorized as "Private borehole with
pump" aggregating HHs that had connections to private boreholes or that were supplied by private standpipes.

3
 All cases are included in the calculation except HH with connections who do not pay for water according to
consumption, where is not possible to calculate the price per cubic metre.

4
 For the two types of connections, the calculation of the price per cubic metre is based on the subgroup of those who
pay according to consumption (see Table 4.5).

RECOMMENDATIONS

12.    Specific recommendations resulting from this consumer assessment include the
following more important ones:


                                                        38
   One of the pillars of the strategy for improving water facility management should be a
   focus on human resources, their professionalization and satisfaction.
   A strategic approach should be designed that guarantees poor people their right to
   low-priced water supplies. The solution may exclude continuing community
   management of the standpipes. Instead of this, existing standpipe operators might be
   replaced by micro-entrepreneurs wishing to take up standpipe management, and who
   have a level of education that can guarantee efficient management. Contracting out
   management through competitive mechanisms could be a way of locating these
   micro-entrepreneurs who, after having been selected, would be submitted to training
   so as to ensure their capacity, both in terms of management and in technical terms.
   Network standpipes might function as micro-enterprises in which young
   entrepreneurs can deal directly with the water company, and within the framework
   promoted by CRA can coordinate with water committees or residents' committees
   with a regulatory function, without interference in standpipe management and
   finances.
   The applicability of payment by month for standpipe water should be re-examined,
   since it can protect vulnerable families and is preferred by the majority, leaving the
   payment per bucket for cases in which families prefer it that way.
   Without an improvement in the management systems and related service quality, it
   will be difficult for AdeM to increase income. Installation of prepaid standpipes in
   various neighbourhoods does not respond to operators or users' interests, and may
   promote an increase in the number of consumers using small private operators.

               Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

     Delegated Management of Urban Water Supply Services in Mozambique,
                                 1999 -2007
            Summary of the Workshop held on 29 June 2009 in Maputo
1.     The workshop was organized by FIPAG and was held at the Centro de
Conferências Joaquim Chissano. It was attended by about 100 persons, including His
Excellency Eng. Felício Zacarias, Minister of Public Works and Housing. The workshop
agenda and the list of participants are attached.

2.      Miguel Alves, General Manager of FIPAG opened the workshop, noting that it
had been ten years since the delegated management framework (DMF) had been
established and that the objective of the workshop was to recount the history and report
results to water sector stakeholders.

Session 1 - Presentations
3.      Manuel Alvarinho, President of CRA, traced the 20-year history of the water
supply sector from 1977 ­ 1997, describing the chaotic situation that existed at the time
of independence, the various efforts the government had made to govern the sector, and
eventually the policy reforms and the adoption of the DMF in the late 1990s. The
objective of these reforms was to enable services to gradually become financially
sustainable through a realistic cost-recovery policy.

4.      José Óscar Monteiro, the team leader of the lawyers in charge of preparing the
various legal instruments that ushered in the DMF, recalled how, before the DMF, the
regulatory function had been mixed with policy supervision. He also noted that
separation and decentralization of functions and powers was not an easy legal exercise,
and that the current generation of stakeholders should recognize the innovative approach
that was adopted by the stakeholders who introduced the reforms.

Session 1 ­ Discussion
5.     During the discussion, in response to a question about the role of small-scale
providers in peri-urban areas and how they will fit into the DMF, it was noted that there
are plans to engage them through partnership agreements with FIPAG and delegated
managers.

6.     Another participant asked why FIPAG had not been made responsible for all the
urban systems from the beginning. It was pointed out that the strategy was to introduce
the DMF gradually, so as to develop the capacity to manage it.

7.     A participant noted that Mozambique's water sector stakeholders have proved to
be very advanced when compared to other countries with similar conditions.

Session 2 - Presentations
8.      Thelma Triche, author of the case study, Delegated Management of Urban Water
Supply Services in Mozambique, 1999 - 2007, presented a summary of the study. After
tracing the history and the initial difficulties with the original contracts with Águas de
Moçambique, she outlined the terms of the revised lease contract with AdeM for services
in Maputo and the revised management contract with AdeM for services in Beira,
Nampula, Quelimane and Pemba. She also described the technical assistance
arrangements FIPAG had put in place for four additional cities, Chokwe, Xai-Xai,
Inhambane and Maxixe in 2004, with the intention of preparing them for delegated
management contracts with private operators. She reported that, while the performance of
AdeM had not been consistently good and the implementation of capital works for which
both FIPAG and AdeM were responsible had been delayed, services had improved by
2007 and a solid foundation had been established for the future sustainability of services.
Among the factors that contributed to the success were the government's firm
commitment to the reform, the stability and credibility of the new sector institutions, the
persistence of the private operator and effective consultation with the stakeholders.

9.      Nelson Beete, President of FIPAG, presented performance data for the services
through 2008, showing that in most cases, performance had continued to improve. He
then went through the list of systems that have been entrusted to FIPAG to date. In
addition to the original five service areas, the list now includes 15 others (Chokwe, Xai-
Xai, Inhambane, Maxixe, Manica, Chimoio, Gondola Tete, Moatize, Lichinga, Cuamba,
Angoche and Nacala). FIPAG is classifying the systems into two groups, those that are
suitable for delegated management and those that require technical assistance to establish
the conditions that would make them attractive for delegated management. FIPAG is now
developing a strategy for supporting the development of the latter group.

Session 2 ­ Discussion

10.    A participant noted that FIPAG and CRA's approach has always been to promote
a sound and open discussion of the issues relevant for the water sector. In that spirit,
while acknowledging that a number of challenges have been confronted and much has
been accomplished, the sector faces serious challenges that need to be acknowledged,
among these: FIPAG will need to mobilize significant investment finance, much of it
from commercial banks ­ will it be able to do so?. The addition of smaller and less viable
service areas to FIPAG's mandate could undermine its financial viability as smaller
systems have higher average costs. Likewise, the strategy of expanding service by
connecting lower-income households will also reduce financial viability. Strategies for
dealing with these challenges need to be developed.

11.     A participant emphasized that there are effective strategies for serving the poor ­
for example through cross-subsidies, the use of pre-paid meters. He also mentioned that
one of the most serious challenges remains the high level of unaccounted water.

12.     A participant asked whether concession contracts would be introduced in the near
future. The response was ­ it is not likely as these involve a higher financial risk for the
operator/concessionaire and the international water companies do not seem to be willing


                                            41
to take those risks in African countries.

13.    A question was raised about the effectiveness of management contracts. In
response, it was suggested out that one of the main problems is to clearly define the long-
term objectives: a management contractor who has no stake in the future may not have
the incentives to improve services, while one who can count on a longer-term
involvement, either through a renewable management contract or conversion to a lease
contract, would be more motivated.

Closure by His Excellency the Minister of Public Works and Housing
14.     The closing session of the workshop was conducted by His Excellency Eng.
Felício Zacarias, Minister of Public Works and Housing who congratulated the efforts of
the team that made the Case Study possible as well as those who directly and/or
indirectly assisted the team to which he started by stating the importance of the case
study for all the stakeholders of the Mozambican Water Sector.

15.     In his own words, the Minister said that the content of the case study represents
the awakening of people´s conscience about what we have done that can enable us to
learn from our past mistakes and allow us to reap benefits from what has gone well and
replicate the experience whenever necessary with the final objective providing a better
service to our population.

16.     At another point during his speech, the Minister said that despite the successes
that have been attained, the lack of water in our country is still a reality, whether in urban
or in rural areas. This situation was inherited from the period prior to the independence in
1975. Several reforms were implemented and each is adjusted to its own period and
lessons.

17.     He acknowledged that the current Delegated Management Framework is a tested
model. Even under difficult circumstances, it has managed to provide consistency and
continuity to the reform process, promote a partnership with the Municipalities, inspiring
the confidence of investors and become subject to national and internationally
recognition.
And, before declaring the workshop officially closed, he thanked all the professionals of
the water sector, the academic community, the business people, the financing partners,
the government itself, local authorities and water consumers (of which we all are) so that
the lessons of this work serve as a reference in our future decisions.

     Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.     This section is the Borrower´s contribution to the ICR and it focuses on the
Project activities financed under the Second National Water Development Project
(NWDP II) through IDA Credit, grant from the Netherlands and loan from the African
Development Bank.

2.     The section summarizes the review of the project performance covering the
various issues which directly or indirectly have influenced, positively or negatively, the
implementation and the level of achievement of the project objectives.

3.      This Annex of the ICR is based on the Project Appraisal Document, project files,
mid-term review, Aide Memoires and consultations with various stakeholders involved in
the design and implementation of the Project.


1. ASSESSMENT OF DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES

1.1. Original Objectives

4.     The overall purpose of the Project was to improve the quality, reliability and
sustainability of water services in the five cities of Maputo, Beira, Quelimane, Nampula
and Pemba based on the private sector participation which should provide these services.

5.    The specific project objectives as stated in the Project Agreement Document
(PAD) and in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) were to:
    Commence institutional and regulatory reform within the urban sector with the
      introduction of commercial principles in the operation and management of water
      services through the participation of a private sector operator;
    Accelerate capacity building and human resources development for the sector
      through training and demonstration effects within the context of the private
      operator contract;
    Provide an institutional framework that improves the quality and sustainability of
      user's services and acts as an operational model for water services, as these begin
      to be decentralized to municipal based management.


1.2. Revised Project Objectives

6.      The project objectives were not revised. Nevertheless, during the Mid Term
Review the Bank and the Implementing Agencies agreed on modification and revision of
detailed indicators to simplify the review and assessment of the performance of the
private operator and the implementing agencies. In general the objectives of the Project
have been achieved


1.3. Original Project Components


                                           43
7.    As set out in the Development Credit Agreement the Project consisted of three
components estimated at total cost of US$114.8 million.

1.3.1. Component A

8.      This component comprise a Private Sector Management of water supply systems
for five cities of Maputo, Beira, Quelimane, Nampula and Pemba which includes a lease
contract for Maputo, a management contract for the remaining four cities, delegated
works for rehabilitation, meter installation and new connections, investment program
management and supervision handled by the Private Operator. Within the Component A
it was included a technical assistance, human resources development and training to
FIPAG. The costs estimated for this component were US$42.7 million, being as follows:
     Five year management contracts with PO for 4 cities : US$6.9 million
     Delegated works carried out by PO: US$17.6 million
     Services in lease and management contracts: US$2.76 million
     Human resources development of FIPAG staff at HQ and under the management
        contract in the four cities: US$0.9 million

1.3.2. Component B

9.     This component refers to water supply works which were not part of the contracts
with the Private Operator. Component B was estimated at US$64.4 million being for:
    Water supply works: US$:58.9 million
    Design and supervision: US$:5.5 million

1.3.3. Component C

10.    This component was to support the urban water supply policy and strategy which
included equipment and technical assistance for the Water Regulatory Council (CRA)
and DNA which included:
     Equipment, consulting services and TA for CRA: US$1.8 million
     Urban water supply strategy for further development of urban water supply and
       sanitation services, including the strategy for the next stage: US$ 2.0 million
     Urban water and sanitation pilot for peri-urban areas: US$ 0.4 million
     Project management for the component: US$ 0.4 million

1.4.   Revised Project Components

11.     No major changes were made to these components during project implementation.
Nonetheless it is noted that on 2004 a supplementary agreement of US$15.0 million has
been approved by IDA to cover cost increases as a result of under pricing of the original
bid, delays on the implementation of delegated works, changes on the PO shareholders
structure, among other circumstances. To accelerate the implementation of the investment
program, the Bank agreed to finance the payment of VAT of the consulting firms, goods
and works. In addition, the closing date for credit has been extended 3.5 years, as a
request of the Government due to delays on the implementation of the investment
program, long period for renegotiations of the revised lease contract for Maputo after the
withdrawal of Saur International from Águas de Moçambique (PO).


                                           44
2.     ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND PROJECT
       IMPLEMENTATION

2.1.   Overall Assessment

12.     The Government of Mozambique (GOM) objectives as stated in the National
Water Policy in 1995 and revised in 2007 are addressing the strategy in which the
Government is committed with the increasing of beneficiary participation, recognition of
water as an economic and social good, and an increasing of the role for the private sector
participation on the provision of a sustainable water supply and sanitation services.
Moreover, the action plans for global poverty reduction PARPA I (2001-2005) and
PARPA II (2005-2009) support the improvement of potable water supply towards the
Government Goals as well as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

13.     The strong commitment of the Government to sector reform and Private Sector
Participation has contributed for a significant improvement on the urban water supply
services. The original project objectives remain aligned with GOM strategies and goals
as well as the World Bank assistance strategies.

2.2.   Achievement of Project Objectives and Outputs

2.2.1. Reliability and Sustainability of Water Services

14.     Over the period of lease and management contracts the water supply services have
been improved in all the five cities. With the commissioning of the works, the
rehabilitation and upgrading of the systems, the production capacity, transmission and
storage of water have been optimized and upgraded contributing for reliability and
sustainability of water services. The population coverage increased due to additional
number of connections and standpipes which rose from 830,000 inhabitants served in
2000 to 1,671,000 in year 2009. Water quality got better complying with WHO standards,
hours of supply increased to the cities of Beira, Quelimane and Nampula with 24 hours
per day, Pemba with 22 hours. Non-revenue water has been reduced in the four Northern
cities while in Maputo less impact has registered. Good results have been achieved on
technical, operational and commercial performance.

15.     All delegated works as well as non delegated works have been completed over the
project period.

16.      The project financial sustainability was conditioned by the performance and the
reliability of services. In the early period of the Project, the lapsed time between the
investment in major infrastructure and the time they become operational did not induced
to the positive timely revenue generation and create the impact on the cash flow. Since
the major infra-structure works were finished in 2006, the functionality of the water
system become more reliable and the borrower were able to increase the customer base
through the new connections conducting to the better revenue base to sustain the service.
The improvements in services have also allowed the adjustment of the water tariff to the
O&M cost recovery level. It is expected that a reasonable increase of the water tariff

                                           45
combined with the continuous improvement of NRW and collection ratios will enable the
borrower to reach the break even of the relevant costs including the debt service.

2.2.2. Institutional and Regulatory Reform

17.    An institutional Delegated Management Framework (DMF) for urban water
supply service was set up in 1998 allowing the transference of operational responsibilities
for water supply service to private sector. It also addresses the separation and clarification
of government functions, the setting of an independent regulator (the CRA) and of asset
holding authorities (the FIPAG). During the project implementation period, FIPAG and
CRA have been established. Contracts for technical and commercial operations of the
water supply service have been signed with Private Operator Águas de Moçambique for
Maputo (lease contract for 15 years) and for Beira, Quelimane, Nampula and Pemba
(management contract for 5 years and then extended for 2 additional years).

18.   CRA has been effective with regard to regulation of the services, tariff setting,
consumer protection and mediation while the National Directorate of Water Affairs
(DNA) has been responsible to set up government policies and strategies.

2.2.3. Capacity Building and Human Resources Development

19.     Financial, human resources and technical assistance have been assigned to CRA
and FIPAG for improvement of operational capacity and strengthening of these
organizations. Training programs have been developed for FIPAG at HQ and FIPAG´s
operational staff in 4 cities. Nevertheless, the Project did not contemplate financial
resources for PO´s staff for the Operator in Maputo. In spite of training programs carried
out, there is still a need for additional training to cover the specific gaps of CRA and
FIPAG.

2.3.     Major Factors Affecting the Project

20.      The major factors which affected the project implementation are as follows:
         Withdrawal of SAUR International as the major shareholder of the consortium
         from the Private Operator (AdeM) causing a delay of 2 years the implementation
         of the lease and management contracts;
         Difficult renegotiation during the first four years of original lease and
         management contracts after the withdrawal of SAUR International and the heavy
         floods which happened at the earlier stage of the contract implementation in 2000;
         Project cost increases of the Private Operator (PO) due to delay on
         implementation of delegated works, program management;
         Low performance of PO during the first years of implementation of lease and
         management contracts caused by long period of negotiations to revise the
         contracts, delays on the implementation of capital works in Maputo and delegated
         works in the remaining four cities;
         Irregular payment of variable rental fee by PO to FIPAG until December 2007;
         Unclear responsibilities under management contracts which led to redefinition of
         the role of PO management of operations being FIPAG managing the four
         systems on a temporary basis with short term technical assistance after the


                                             46
          termination of the Management Contract with AdeM in March 2008, while the
          new POs were not in place;
          Inclusion of procurement, program management and site supervision under the
          responsibilities of the PO proved to be not effective resulted in delays with
          implementation of civil works program;
          Delay on the payment of counterpart funds (VAT) by the Government to
          contractors causing constraints on project implementation of works during initial
          years.
          The World Bank approval of using the credit for payment of all taxes and duties
          related to Project funded by IDA from March 2007 onwards;
          Delay on the procurement process for contracting new operators for provision of
          water services in the four Northern cities of Beira, Quelimane, Nampula and
          Pemba after ending the management contracts with AdeM.

2.4.      Costs and Financing

21.     The IDA credit provided SDR 55.4 million (US$75.0 million equivalent) to be
disbursed in 6 years. The total project cost including Government contribution (US$10.24
million) and parallel financing by AfDB (US$19.6 million) and Netherlands(US$10
million) as presented in the PAD was US$114.84 million. An IDA supplementary credit
of US$15 million was approved in 2004 bringing the total IDA funds available to US$90
million even though an amount of about US$1.96 million remained undisbursed by the
project closing.

22.     The dollar value of the IDA Credit increased by about US$13.9 million due to the
appreciation of the SDR against the US dollar. The IDA credit was almost fully disbursed
at 99.4%. Parallel financing from AfDB and Netherlands have since closed and the
activities financed by these donors were completed.

23.     The actual amount of disbursements from AfDB also increased due to the
appreciation of UA against the USD. With regard to the Government contribution, the
actual amount US$8.5 million less than the appraisal amount of US$10.24 million,
because since April 2007, the IDA started disbursing 100% of all categories, including
taxes as shown in Table 3.1.

3. BANK AND BORROWERS PERFORMANCES

24.     The overall performance of the Bank was considered satisfactory as the main
objectives of the Project have been achieved. From the starting phase till the completion
of the Project the Bank have been working closely in assisting the Government, the
borrowers and the implementing agencies to carry out the reforms of the water sector in
Mozambique. Good communication, consultations and discussions among the Bank and
stakeholders (MOPH, CRA, FIPAG and PO) have been a solution to anticipate and solve
current problems in a positive and constructive manner.

25.     The borrower´s and implementing agencies performance were also rated as
satisfactory. During the project preparation and implementation phase the Government
took an important role to coordinate the relationships with the funding agencies such as
the World Bank, the Dutch Government and African Development Bank as co-financiers,
the sector organizations, namely CRA and FIPAG, as well as the PO. Key issues to make
the Project successful such as the project management, capacity building, requirement for
technical assistance, training to sector organizations among others, have been well
planned and performed. Nonetheless, delays on the disbursements of counterpart funds
have caused cost increases of the contractor´s works which has been solved with an
amendment of the DCA considering the payment of all taxes by the Bank.


4. LESSONS LEARNT

26.    During the project implementation the following lessons and observations have
been identified:
     The strong commitment of the Government made feasible and sustainable the
       process for PSP for provision of urban water supply services;
     The setting up of delegated management framework for PSP provided a clear
       definition and separation of responsibilities among the Government, investment


                                           48
   and asset holding organization and regulator, allowing a good working
   environment among the stakeholders;
   It has been noted the importance of the requisite to start on with an adequate
   baseline information before the operator´s take over the implementation of
   contracts for provision of water services to avoid difficulties on the performance
   of the PO;
   It has been required to assess with detail the key staff assigned to contracts in
   order to have in place an adequate, experienced and qualified staff, preferably
   coming from mother companies to achieve the expected results on the provision
   of water supply services;
   The transference of know-how and promotion of local staff for senior positions
   within the organizations has been an important issue which should be considered
   as part of training and capacity building to make the utilities reliable and
   sustainable;
   The experience to deal with the private sector participation indicated then need for
   promotion of local operators in the provision of water supply services, having in
   mind that there are no experience and adequate expertise in this field of activity
   within the country.
   PO should not be responsible for program management, procurement and site
   supervision.

 Executive Summary from the Project Completion Report of African Development Bank,
                                  February 2009

1.      Project Objectives: The Government of Mozambique (GOM) carried out the
Provincial Towns Water Sector Study in the early nineties, which included Maputo and
12 other towns. GOM adopted the National Water Policy (NWP) in 1995 which laid
down the objectives and policies of the water sector. As a result of the policy, a goal of
ensuring provision of adequate quantity and quality of water and adequate sanitation
services for the whole population of Mozambique was defined. Furthermore, GOM
approved in 1997, a National Water Development Programme (NWDP) which covered
policy and institution building, preparation for privatization of urban water supplies, rural
water supply and sanitation, water resources management and human resources
development.

2.     The project sought to rehabilitate and augment the water supply system of
Maputo, and to implement an integrated health education, sanitation and solid waste
component aimed at improving sanitation, drainage and hygiene behaviour for the peri-
urban populations of Maputo in Hulene, Laulane and Mahotas. This increased the
population served with safe water by at least 225,000 in 2008 and 330,000 in 2027 and
the remaining project life.

3.      Project Description: The project activities as defined at appraisal were as follows:
(i) New filter unit at the treatment works in Umbeluzi; (ii) New trunk main from Matola
to Cimentos to Chamanculo; (iii) New trunk main from Chamanculo to Laulane and
distribution centre at Laulane; (iv) Distribution network covering Hulene, Laulane and
Mahotas; (v) Rehabilitation of Chamanculo to Maxaquene pipeline; (vi) Modification of
Chamanculo distribution centre; (vi) New storage reservoir at Maxaquene and (vii) health
education/Sanitation and solid waste component. By the time the project started,
component (ii) had been executed through other funding, but all others were implemented
as planned.

4.      Implementation: The Project took 8 years to complete after loan approval.
Implementation was initially planned for 4 years starting from January 1999. However
construction was only completed in December 2007. Implementation of the project got
delayed by 58 months. The delays were a result of two consecutive years of heavy rains
causing serious flooding, and the cessation of works by the civil works contractor of the
water component due to late payment of certificates. 387 days of these delays can be
attributed to period between engagement of the Consultant of the Water Supply
component to the approval of the detailed design. The deadline for final disbursement
was extended to 31st December 2008.

5.     The sanitation component was even slower in commencing. It started
procurement in November 2005 and completed in December 2007.




                                             53
6.     Monitoring and Supervisions: The Bank was able to regularly monitor the
progress in implementation through regular supervision missions. These missions were
found to be useful. Most of the expected outputs of the project were met.

7.      Achievements of Project Outputs and Outcomes: The physical implementation of
the water supply component was highly satisfactory. The project achieved all its
objectives as all planned items were implemented except the Matola-Cimentos-
Chamanculo Trunk main which was constructed before the project commenced using
other funding. The area covered by the network is three times the original plan at
appraisal. The Distribution Centre and the trunk Main (Chamanculo-Laulane) are bigger
than planned because of the changes that occurred in the development of the area
between appraisal and implementation of the project.

8.      Similarly, the sanitation aspect was successfully implemented, even though more
could have been achieved had the IA not wasted so much time in the start up. Less than
the targeted population benefitted. The project was successful in educating the
communities in health, hygiene and sanitation practices. As a result of the health
education and support, communities are aware of the importance of personal hygiene,
safe household water storage practices, prevention of HIV/AIDS and protection against
cholera, diarrhoea and malaria. Artisans were trained, latrine workshops established and
300 communal latrines constructed in the four communities, but the continuation of the
building of latrines is not sustained as people complained that they do not have the
financial means to pay for latrines to be built in their households. The project provided
the materials for the squatting slabs and underground holding tanks but expected the
community to contribute labor and in cash for the construction of the walls of the latrines
in compounds.

9.     Loan Utilization: The project utilized UA17.44 million out of UA17.50 million
(or 99.66%) of the loan and UA1.68 million of the UA2.16 million (or 77.78%) of the
TAF grant.

10.     Counterpart Funding: At appraisal, the Government of Mozambique was to
contribute UA4.06 million. However, a total of UA4.21 million which was 4% more than
the pledged amount. In general, all payments demanded from GOM were honored.

11.     Sustainability and Viability: According to a recent survey, there is a high
consumer willingness to pay 0.025MZM per liter (US$0.0012). Only 34% and 15% of
the same population would agree to pay double and four times respectively. The existing
price at public standpipes is 0.0166MZM per liter (US$0.0008 per liter), and 0.025MZM
(US$0.0012) at private standpipes. Up to 68.5% of those without a house connection are
willing to pay up to 2,500 MZM for a connection. The current level is 2,300 MZM

12.     Direct involvement by the communities in the development of the sanitation
project was key to passing on the ownership of the services to the beneficiaries. The
technology is simple to operate and maintain. However, the intention for the community
to continuously engage the artisans to build more private latrines does not seem to be
case, as most people in the communities say they cannot afford the cost of construction.



                                            54
13.     Conclusions and Recommendations: Despite the delays with the project
implementation, the project was successfully executed. The project was found to be
technically sound, economically feasible, socially acceptable and environmentally
friendly. Therefore, the GOM should continue undertaking the measures conducive to the
sustainability of various components of the project.
