Performance by the Bank was\n            satisfactory, while the Borrower's performance was\n            highly satisfactory.  Lessons were learned in the areas of\n            project design and implementation, telecommunications sector\n            reform, postal sector reform, and regulation.  Lessons\n            learned included: a) political commitment and ownership is\n            essential for successful implementation of sector reform; b)\n            the upfront definition of a vision or strategy for sector\n            development is necessary; c) an inclusive and collaborative\n            approach to project preparation and a precise time-table is\n            paramount; d) communication campaign and media relations are\n            essential; e) regulatory agency capacity development is\n            achieved by technical assistance, training, and sustained\n            interaction with the Bank's supervision team; f)\n            indicators should be available and measurable and are\n            essential for monitoring and assessment; g) the promotion of\n            competition was a key factor; h) the adoption of sector\n            legislation and the creation of a regulatory agency prior to\n            competition and private sector participation are conducive\n            to higher sector performance; i) privatization through\n            capital increase and divestiture of shares can lead to\n            success; j) postal sector reform is more difficult than\n            telecommunications sector reform has less scope for\n            performance improvement; k) capacity building activities\n            should target both the regulator and the governmental policy\n            unit; l) definition and enforcement of mechanisms to finance\n            regulatory agencies activities is essential; m) beginning\n            with a single sector mandate may increase the chance to\n            become a performing multi-utility regulator ; n)\n            institutional choices must draw on rigorous cost-benefit\n            analysis; and o) monitoring and evaluation mechanisms should\n            be included in the establishment of new institutions."}, "docdt": "2004-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
