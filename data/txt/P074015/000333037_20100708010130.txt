Indicator 2:

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.       The Protection of Basic Services (PBS) operation was a product of the particular
circumstances in Ethiopia in early 2006. These included: (i) a convergence of views between the
government, the Bank and donors on the critical importance of expanding coverage of basic
services (health, education, water and agriculture); (ii) a process of decentralization, ongoing for
about 10 years, which needed additional impetus to fully take hold; (iii) well-functioning fiscal
and administrative systems allowing funds to be channeled through government systems with a
realistic expectation that they would be used appropriately; and (iv) a political crisis that had
resulted in key donors withdrawing direct budget support at a critical time when the Government
of Ethiopia (GOE) had committed to significantly expand financing for decentralized delivery of
basic services and for improvement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
2.      Against this background, PBS was developed as an instrument that allowed the Bank,
other donors and the GOE to: (i) follow-through on the commitment to scale-up financing and
delivery of basic services, thus protecting the poor from suffering unduly as a result of the
political crisis; (ii) support continued strengthening of local government service delivery
systems; (iii) help with next steps in the decentralization agenda, including placing financial
information in the public domain and giving greater voice to citizens and civil society actors; and
(iv) sustain aid inflows and thus avert a macroeconomic crisis involving deep fiscal cuts, which
would have both inhibited the government's ability to finance further service delivery expansion
out of domestic revenues and stifled longer-term growth.
3.     Basic Services Context: Service Delivery and Outcomes. In the decade preceding PBS,
Ethiopia saw a period of long-term improvement in the indicators for delivery of basic services
and to a lesser extent, in outcomes. The government had been pursuing an ambitious policy of
expanding social services, beginning with the launching of large-scale national Education and
Health Sector Development programs in the mid-1990s. The effort was intensified following the
end of the war with Eritrea in 1998, with a policy decision to redirect military spending to
finance a massive drive to address Ethiopia's very low human development indicators.
4.      The articulation of the MDGs in 2000 triggered an agreement with donors for a further
`scaling up' exercise for the social sectors as well as for investment in basic infrastructure,
agricultural and food security programs. This expansion of basic services, and corresponding
large increases in pro-poor spending, was at the core of Ethiopia's initial Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2002 (the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program or
SDPRP) and the subsequent Plan to Accelerate Sustainable Development to End Poverty
(PASDEP) 2005­2010. The Bank had supported this process with a series of SWAps and policy-
based operations and by 2005, increasingly strong consensus among donors supported Ethiopia's
policy directions, resulting in significantly higher levels of general budget support.
5.      Progress had been impressive in many ways: the share of pro-poor spending rose from 28
percent of the budget in 1999/00 to 57 percent in 2004/05. Education coverage increased
significantly, with primary net enrolment growing from 44 percent in 2000/01 to 69 percent in
2005/06. A large-scale program had been initiated to roll out primary health extension systems,
with a planned cadre of 30,000 community-based mostly female health extension workers
(HEWs). Work was ongoing on major expansion of an extension and training system for small

                                                 1
farmers, and the percentage of the population with access to safe water had risen from 19 percent
in 1995/96 to 36 percent in 2004/05.
6.     The human development improvements however should not hide the fact that Ethiopia
was (and continues to be) below the Sub-Saharan average for several indicators of basic human
welfare. In the 2005 rankings of the UN Human Development Index, Ethiopia ranked in the
lowest third among Sub-Saharan African countries. Moreover, progress had not always been
even; disparities persisted across gender, income groups and regions.
7.     Decentralization and Governance. At the time that PBS was formulated, a profound
process of decentralization had been transpiring in Ethiopia for some time. This started with the
national Constitution of 1995, which gave many powers over sectoral policies and programs to
the regional governments. This devolution of responsibilities was accompanied by transfers of
large shares of the budget to the regional governments as untied block grants, with discretion
over programming these resources but in line with national priorities and policies for the sectors.
8.      It had always been recognized that decentralization would be a long-term process,
requiring many years to complete and to get the different pieces of it "right." A key element of
the process is increasing accountability at the lower levels and providing decentralized services
in a manner that is responsive to citizens' voice. Achieving this in Ethiopia was understood to be
more difficult than in many countries, due to the hierarchical tradition and history of Ethiopian
society (see Annex 9 for more on this).
9.     Just prior to PBS in 2002/03, Ethiopia further delegated responsibility for delivery of
most basic services down to the woreda, or district level. (There are now about 770 woredas.)
This process brought some challenges: woredas in most cases lacked the staffing and finances
needed to manage these new responsibilities; with the advent of untied block grants to the
woreda level, combined with weaknesses in reporting systems, it became difficult to track
consolidated spending across economic or functional uses in real time.
10.     At the same time as woreda decentralization was being rolled out, the GOE had also
embarked on a series of crosscutting programs to improve governance, enhance transparency and
accountability, and enable the participation of citizens. While still partial, this was a remarkable
shift in governance in a country whose historic context was one of hierarchical authority and
highly centralized decision-making. These programs included, in addition to woreda-level
decentralization: (i) setting standards for service delivery by government agencies and
strengthening the civil service with performance management systems; (ii) increased
consultation with different groups in society and holding public debate over policies (in
particular education), a concept new to Ethiopia; (iii) launching efforts to eliminate corruption
and to reform government procurement systems; and (iv) implementing the National Capacity
Building Program designed to build capacity at all levels in the public and private sectors.
11.     Macroeconomic and Fiscal Context. At the time that PBS was being formulated
Ethiopia had a track record of sound macroeconomic management, dating from the late 1990s.
Macroeconomic stability had been a critical underpinning of both the recent acceleration in
economic growth and the increased levels of development assistance that had flowed through the
budget until the development of the political tensions. However, risks to macroeconomic stability
and pressure on both the balance of payments and the government's fiscal balances were posed
by: (i) the costs of large public infrastructure investments with high import content, needed to
support future growth; and (ii) fiscal pressures arising from GOE's fuel price subsidy scheme in
                                                 2
the context of rising oil prices. Uncertainty surrounding donor support with the suspension of
US$399 million out of the US$414 million in direct budget support, which had been budgeted
for the year 2005/06 (see below), further aggravated these underlying macroeconomic pressures.
By December 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had identified a balance of payments
gap of about 5.8% of GDP and a fiscal deficit of about 3.5% of GDP.
12.     Overall, projections made during 2005 indicated that, despite the efforts made by GOE at
the federal and regional levels on both the expenditure and revenue sides, the authorities still
faced the prospect of having to make significant additional cuts in the ongoing planned financing
of basic service delivery at the local level through federal grants.
13.    Political and Development Assistance Context. Despite the progress in expanding pro-
poor services, decentralization and establishing democratic institutions, the elections in 2005
were followed by significant social unrest in some areas and a strong response from the
government that led to scores of deaths in street clashes and the imprisonment of opposition
supporters. This polarized political environment had the potential to adversely impact economic
governance and the larger development agenda of the country. It severely shook the mutual trust
and accountability relationship that the government and its international development partners
were still trying to rebuild following the marked deterioration during the Ethiopian-Eritrean War.
14.     These events led to a threatened wholesale withdrawal of bilateral aid, and in particular to
pressures on the Bank and other donors to suspend further direct budget support to Ethiopia.
Donor partners based their decision to withdraw budget support on the perceived increased risk
related to governance, particularly the risk that unconstrained budget support could be vulnerable
to political capture or diversion from the core priority of basic service delivery. (This concern,
stated in the Project Appraisal Document or PAD, was not shared by the Government, who also
did not share the characterization of the severity of events in the previous section.)
15.     Due to this shift in the political and aid landscape, at the end of 2005 there was a very
real possibility of a void that could precipitate a potentially severe social and macroeconomic
crisis. Ethiopia's development partners, including the Bank, were reluctant to continue direct
budget support or other flexible types of funding without assurances that the increased overall
level of funds--government and donor combined--were being channeled to the lowest tier of
government responsible for basic service delivery, that these funds were being allocated in a fair
and accountable manner without political bias, and that the government was giving space to civil
society groups to engage effectively in the service delivery agenda. But at the same time, there
were concerns that the reduced aid to Ethiopia or suspension of direct budget support could
adversely impact the poor, halt or reverse the gains to date in basic service delivery and disrupt
the ongoing process of decentralization (which was seen as being central to improved
governance and political outcomes in the longer term).
16.     The urgent demand arose from donor agencies, the government and some civil society
elements to define a credible mechanism to address fundamentals, including: (i) earmarked
funding for basic service delivery, which is the mandate of woreda or local governments in
Ethiopia; (ii) requiring the use of government channels, using existing public service providers
and avoiding parallel structures; (iii) clear accountability safeguards, timely reporting and
independent verification; (iv) avoiding any political bias in public fund allocations or service
delivery decisions; and (v) financing at a sufficiently large scale to enable the promised scaling
up of services to be sustained, with rapid disbursements needed by the end of FY2005/06.

                                                 3
17.     In an environment marked by political tension, and a risk of stagnation or reversal of
social outcomes, PBS was designed to sustain the momentum underway to meet the immense
MDG challenges facing Ethiopia. In the Bank the processing of PRSC III (budget support) halted
in December 2005 just before appraisal. In its place the Bank engaged in an urgent dialogue with
the government and key agencies to assess the appetite for an alternative instrument and to
identify what were key concerns from different constituents, including opposition groups. A
primary concern was to try to find a way of providing assistance at a sufficiently large scale, thus
involving not only the Bank but other institutions as well, so that the progress made to date in the
social sectors would not be reversed, with adverse effects on the poor.
18.    At the same time, the devolution of spending responsibilities in Ethiopia in 2002/2003
made it difficult to tie funding to specific sectors or activities using traditional Bank lending
instruments for sector-specific SWAps. Under the new fiscal arrangements, woredas or districts
were provided funds from the regional governments in the form of untied block grants, which
they were (with some constraints) free to spend as they saw fit. But at the same time this degree
of decentralization also presented an opportunity, since if donors could effectively earmark funds
to woredas, they could be certain the funds would be spent on core services (which constitute the
bulk of woreda spending). This became a central element of the PBS design; through a series of
additional tests, the funds were effectively earmarked for transfer to lower levels of government.
19.     The support by PBS for accountability and transparency was seen as critical because the
benefits of shifting service delivery closer to people would be lost if beneficiaries were not in a
position to put demand-side pressure on local governments to perform. This was given
heightened importance by the political crisis, with intensified attention focused on the
responsiveness of the government to citizens and to the fair treatment of different areas of the
country (particularly, for example, through the distribution of resources under the block grants).
20.     The design of PBS ultimately supported the long-term decentralization process in a
broad-based manner, through: (i) strengthening capacity at the woreda level; (ii) support for
crosscutting systems of service delivery; (iii) strengthening expenditure reporting in order to
tracking public spending in meaningfully manner; and (iv) support for accountability and
transparency at the local level (through activities such as posting budgets in public places and
social accountability pilots implemented through civil society organizations).
Rationale for Bank Assistance
21.      The World Bank had a long history of engagement in support of both the expansion of
pro-poor spending on basic services and of the decentralization process in Ethiopia. At the time
of project identification, a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period FY06 to FY08,
in alignment with GOE's PASDEP, was under preparation. However, to allow for a period where
the government, stakeholders, partners and the Bank could develop consensus around a
strengthened governance agenda, the Bank prepared an Interim CAS (ICAS) for FY06/07. The
ICAS recognized that in the absence of direct budget support, aggravated by the temporary
suspension of some other types of international donor financing, the Bank should not abandon its
critical support for the delivery of basic services designed to enable poor people to break multi-
generational poverty traps. The ICAS aimed to preserve the institutional capacity for an eventual
scaling up again when conditions were appropriate.
22.    The Bank sought to help Ethiopia avoid a sharp decline in the provision of critical
services for the poor that would hinder the country's possibility of reaching the MDGs. The case
                                                 4
for further Bank support was made even stronger based on the country's important gains in
recent years in improving human development indicators, reducing isolation in rural areas,
improving the investment climate and fighting against chronic food insecurity in rural areas.
23.     The Bank was also seen as an effective catalyst to bring other donor partners back into a
dialogue with GOE and to help develop an integrated framework that would align current and
future donor financial support, including IDA's. This discussion was to be centered around the
decentralized delivery of basic services at the local level, ensuring in the process that resources
would be allocated in a fair and transparent fashion to benefit the priorities of the poor, and that
citizens' voice in demanding accountability of public service delivery would be enhanced and
strengthened. These became core objectives of the new PBS operation, whose development was
endorsed in December 2005 by the Bank's Regional Operations Committee (ROC).
24.     The Protection of Basic Services program (PBS) was originally envisaged as a
transitional two-year operation included in the ICAS. Once the ICAS conditions for reverting
back to a full IDA CAS and a range of aid instruments (including direct budget support) were
met, the need to continue this transitional operation would be reviewed. In the course of events,
PBS proved an effective and useful instrument. It was embraced by both the government and
donors and with modifications, was carried forward through PBS II as a central part of the
regular external assistance program for Ethiopia, harmonizing support from 10 different donors.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
25.     The development objective of PBS was to protect and promote the delivery of basic
services by sub-national governments while deepening transparency and accountability in service
delivery. Basic services were defined to cover the following sectors: education, health,
agriculture and natural resources (including water). According to the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD), progress toward achieving the PDO was to be measured against the following
five development outcome indicators: (a) sub-national governments' expenditures on basic
services maintained at the same or higher levels; (b) utilization of insecticide-treated bed nets
(ITN) among children under five years of age in malaria-affected areas; (c) proportion of
children under one year of age vaccinated against DPT3 and measles; (d) contraceptive
prevalence rate; and (e) proportion of citizens better informed on public budget processes (as
assessed by a quantitative survey).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators and
    Reasons/Justification
26.     While the PDO was not changed, at the time of approval of IDA's Additional Financing
for PBS (see Section 1.7), the original results framework was revised to include additional
outcome and intermediate indicators and modified to update some baseline and end-of-project
target values. Modifications were also made to allow for progress to be measured, in cases where
followup data sources turned out not to be available during the PBS 1 period (see Annex 2). The
Additional Financing Project Paper (PP) included indicators that were maintained from the
original project, albeit with new targets (m) and/or rephrased (r) as well as new ones (n):1

1
  The ICR notes some minor differences between the PAD/PP and Financing Agreements (FAs) in the wording of indicators.
These differences however did not affect the quality, rigor and effectiveness of the monitoring. The team regularly monitored the
full set of indicators provided in the PAD/PP, which included both outcome and intermediate indicators and of which a subset
had been incorporated in the Financing Agreements. ISR reporting followed the PAD. (See also Section 2.3 and Annex 2.)

                                                               5
(i)    Level of sub-national government expenditures on basic services (m);
(ii)   Citizens have improved access to public budget information at the Federal, regional,
       woreda and sub-woreda levels (r);
(iii) Sound baseline information (to be derived from a quantitative survey) made available,
       showing citizens' understanding of and engagement in public budget processes (r);
(iv) New malaria cases (n);
(v) Percentage of malaria case fatalities among children under one year of age (n);
(vi) Percentage of children vaccinated against DPT3+HePB3+Hib3 and against measles (m);
(vii) Contraceptive acceptor rate of women in the age group 15-49 (m);
(viii) Percentage of pilot woredas (receiving Local Investment Grants or LIG) that have adopted
       and are implementing new national standards and systems in the areas of planning and
       budgeting, procurement, environment screening and resettlement (n); and
(ix) Percentage of yearly LIG sub-component allocations spent by woredas (n).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
27.     The main beneficiaries were: (i) the population of largely rural and poor Ethiopians
receiving the basic services; (ii) schools, health posts and other basic service providers; (iii) the
Federal Ministries, Regional Bureaus and Woreda Offices of Finance and Economic
Development (MOFED, BOFEDs and WOFEDs); (iv) the line ministries in the basic services
sectors, the Ministry of Capacity Building (MCB) and the Office of the Federal Auditor General
(OFAG); and (v) civil society organizations (CSOs) that received funding under Component 4.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
28.    PBS is a GOE program largely implemented through GOE systems and supported by 10
development partners (DPs). The original PBS included the following four components:
29.     Component 1: Sub-National Basic Services (GOE US$2,030.75 million; IDA US$190
million; DFID US$263.3 million). This component aimed at protecting and promoting basic
service delivery by sub-national government through the preservation of the originally budgeted
level of delivery of basic services provided by regional and local governments, comprising: (a)
resources to regions and local authorities based on agreed plans for delivery of basic services and
(b) monitoring of (i) the level and timeliness of funding allocations for basic services to ensure
spending targets under the Additionality criterion were met, (ii) the fair application of
distributional rules, and (iii) actual spending levels on basic services and its distribution, which
would be subject to a continuous audit. Acceptable results from this monitoring were conditions
for disbursement; PBS financing under this component would flow to core basic services which
are mandated to subnational levels (e.g. primary/secondary education, health, water and
sanitation, agriculture extension). Since the financing channel for this Component is the Federal
block grant, PBS financing would be used to support the delivery of basic services largely in
rural woredas which rely significantly on the block grant, and also in urban local government
administrations to the extent that state functions receive block grant financing.
30.    The external financing for this component was combined with the government's own
resources and channeled through the existing federal block grant mechanism, using existing
systems and accounts (rather than creating new or parallel systems) to the sub-national
governments. Since the block grants were constitutionally stipulated not to be earmarked (i.e., a
genuine block of funds), PBS could not ex-ante stipulate how much of the total block grant funds

                                                 6
was to be used for which sector. Rather, PBS stipulated that only expenditures in education,
health, water supply and sanitation and agriculture at sub-national levels were eligible, with a
further stipulation that only recurrent costs in these sectors were eligible expenditures.2
31.     The release of PBS funds for block grants was made contingent on satisfactory
performance by the government on four PBS principles: (i) additionality of budgetary resources
made available to sub-national governments each year through the block grant mechanism, to
ensure that increased PBS funding from donors was truly reflected in an increased flow of funds
to sub-national governments; (ii) fiduciary responsibility to be monitored on the basis of more
extensive and regular reporting on the transfers and use of grant proceeds; (iii) fairness in the
intergovernmental fiscal system to ensure that regions, woredas and urban administrations
received their fare share as prescribed by budget rules and that the process was not influenced by
political considerations (e.g. punishing areas for voting against the ruling party); and (iv)
accountability to ensure transparency in the allocation and use of the financial resources
allocated to basic service delivery as well as to increase citizen participation and access to
information. Compliance with these four principles was to be assessed at the Joint Budget and
Aid Review (JBAR) and Joint Review and Implementation Support (JRIS) missions, and also by
the OFAG through quarterly continuous (or "roving") audits on a sample of woredas. More
broadly, these four principles formed the foundation of the operation and basis for dialogue
between the DPs and the government.
32.     Component 2: Health MDG Performance Facility (IDA US$20 million; CIDA
US$14.25 million; DFID US$26.55 million; DCI (Ireland) US$1 million). This component
would provide predictable financing for those critical inputs for primary health service delivery
that could not be efficiently financed at woreda level through the block-grant mechanism. It
would have a specific focus on controlling malaria, and would serve as the initial entry point for
the Bank's Malaria Control Booster Program. It would support: (a) Commodities via the
procurement on the international market of key inputs for accelerated implementation of the
Health Extension Program (HEP) such as vaccines, contraceptives, long-lasting insecticide
treated mosquito nets, malaria drugs, insecticides and spray pumps, emergency drugs, and other
equipment to be provided free of charge as part of the HEP; (b) Capacity-building activities in
several areas, including in monitoring and evaluation as well as operational research at Federal
Ministry of Health (FMOH) level; (c) Strengthening procurement and logistics, especially in
international procurement, the Central Medical Store and the national distribution system.
33.    Component 3: Financial Transparency and Accountability (IDA US$5 million; DFID
US$2.2 million). This component would deepen transparency by supporting government-
implemented (i.e., supply side) activities at the Regional/City Administrations, and Woreda and
sub-Woreda levels to significantly enhance transparency around public budget procedures
(budget preparation, expenditure and audits); and, foster broad engagement, and strengthened
"voice" and client power of citizens and citizen representative groups on public budget processes
and public service delivery. This component would also finance accountants and Information

2
  The rationale for the restriction of eligible expenditures to recurrent expenditures only was: a recent PER had found that in
social sectors recurrent expenditures were both critical and severely underfinanced; the fiduciary assessment had indicated tight
internal controls by the government on recurrent costs, especially payroll, thereby ensuring adequate fiduciary safeguards on
these large resources; and the recurrent expenditure share in the targeted sectors provided sufficient absorptive capacity for the
relatively large and quick disbursements envisaged. It should also be noted that since the government could provide its own
funds for capital expenditures for sub-national levels, outside the scope of PBS, the recurrent-only stipulation of PBS did not
create a distortion in the recurrent-capital balance of woredas and regions in the targeted sectors.

                                                                7
Technology (IT) experts to be hired by MOFED to enhance its own capacity and its ability to
provide Technical Assistance (TA) to the regions and Woredas. In addition it would finance
urgent capacity strengthening activities for OFAG.
34.    The activities to be financed by this component could be subdivided into two streams: the
core Financial Transparency and Accountability (FTA) stream and a separate stream of Public
Financial Management (PFM) activities (accountants, IT experts, support to OFAG).
35.     Component 4: Social Accountability (DFID US$4.5 million; CIDA US$1.5 million).
This component would, through a Bank-administered Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF), support
capacity-building for, and piloting of, selected large-scale pilot initiatives aimed at strengthening
citizen voice as well as deepening and enhancing accountability of public sector service
providers to citizens. These pilot initiatives would be implemented by CSOs. The component
would also work to build demand-side pressure for accountability in the public budgeting
process and would build capacity of citizens to engage in the public budget process.
36.      A non-governmental entity or Management Agent (MA) would be responsible for the
overall management and implementation of this component, overseeing the CSO-run pilot
initiatives. A tripartite Steering Committee comprising equal numbers of representatives of the
government, CSOs and donors would guide implementation of the activities.
1.6    Revised Components
37.     A new component (1b), Local Investment Grant (LIG), was included in the Board
approved Additional Financing for PBS (see Section 1.7) to provide to selected woreda
governments on a pilot basis significantly increased discretionary resources to make key capital
investments in education, health, water, agriculture and roads. Woredas used block grants mainly
to cover recurrent expenditure obligations (especially salaries for education, health and
agriculture personnel). Capital investment in basic services at the woreda level, however,
represented on average less than 3 percent of the total woreda expenditure in education in 2007,
5 percent in agriculture and 14 percent in health.
38.     This new component was financed solely by IDA (US$20 million) and implemented in
51 woredas in five regions. The initial implementation period for the LIG pilot was two years.
The pilot aimed to: (i) test recently developed national standards like planning and budgeting,
procurement and technical guidance; (ii) better understand constraints of capital investment at
the local level; and (iii) learn from experience in the pilot woredas to help design and roll out the
national LIG. Under the pilot LIG, capital investments for basic services were expected to be
more technically sound, more accountable to local citizens needs and more integrated and
sustainable. Two outcome indicators were accordingly included in the PP.

1.7 Other Significant Changes
39.    Extension to the closing date. The closing date of the original Grant of June 30, 2008
was extended to June 30, 2009, while the closing date of the Additional Financing of June 30,
2009 was extended to December 31, 2009. These extensions were done mainly to ensure
additional time to complete the activities financed by Components 2, 3, 4 and also 1b (LIG)
whose implementation start was delayed. All recipient-executed child trust funds under PBS I
(TF56885 and TF90445 executed by MOFED and TF57683 executed by GTZ), except for
TF56942 associated with Component 2 (executed by FMOH), were closed on or before

                                                 8
December 31, 2009. The original closing date of TF56942, December 31, 2009, was extended to
December 31, 2010 to complete the activities under Component 2.
40.    IDA Additional Financing. During the Mid-Term Review mission in May 2007, the
GOE requested Additional Financing for PBS from IDA and other partners to address the
financing gap largely associated with Component 1 (the bulk of the Additional Financing) and
Component 2 for which available resources were almost disbursed or committed. The IDA
Additional Financing of SDR 137.05 million (US$215 million) became effective in April 2008.
The PDO and the implementation arrangements remained unchanged. IDA allocated US$165
million, US$20 million, US$29 million and US$1 million respectively for Components 1a, 1b, 2
and 3, with 1a used to denote what was originally called Component 1 (Sub-National Basic
Services) and 1b used to denote the new LIG component (see previous section).
41.    New donor partners. In addition to the five original donor partners committing funds at
the time of appraisal (IDA, DfID, Irish Aid, Canadian CIDA and the Government of the
Netherlands), five new donor partners contributed resources to PBS during the implementation
cycle (the African Development Bank, the European Community, KfW of Germany and the
Governments of Austria and Spain). Most PBS donors channeled their funds through pooled
arrangements under several Bank-administered MDTFs (see Section 2.2 and Annex 12).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
42.    The Quality at Entry of PBS is rated as satisfactory for the reasons explained below and
in more detail in section 5.1 (a) of this ICR.
43.     The PBS operation was designed to address the context and development challenges
outlined in Section 1.1 above. PBS used existing government systems to: (i) support a long-term
process of decentralization, by strengthening resource availability and overall capacity at the
woreda and local levels; (ii) provide essential recurrent and capital investment financing in a
difficult fiscal situation; (iii) protect and expanding basic services at the local level and thus
improving human capital investments and opportunities for the poor nationwide; (iv) help move
forward the good governance agenda of the Government of Ethiopia (GOE); (v) bring back
donor partners and GOE in one focused harmonized fashion, as opposed to an independent and
fragmented approach; and (vi) bring to the policy dialogue the themes of public financial
transparency, local accountability and the role of civil service organizations (CSOs) in
articulating issues concerning the demand and supply of basic service delivery.
44.     The PBS design process and timeline were underpinned by the urgent need to prevent
adverse consequences from fiscal constraints and donor withdrawal of budget support. Both from
the perspective of the GOE and the PBS DPs, the project had to be prepared quickly in order to
be adequately responsive to the immediate fiscal, economic and social needs. The approach
adopted was for the Bank and the GOE to clearly agree on the principles, activities and
implementation mechanisms where possible, to be reinforced by an enhanced, on-the-ground
program of implementation support to resolve the implementation bottlenecks that were expected
to arise in the course of actual execution. A cross-sectoral Bank team based both in the field and
at headquarters was put in place, as well as a Secretariat based in the field to support donor
collaboration and program implementation. Some implementation elements of Components 2, 3

                                                9
and 4 were not fully in place at the time of Board approval and Grant effectiveness. Many of
them were addressed during the first stages of implementation, although some were resolved at
later stages of the program and are being consolidated under PBS II.
45.     PBS followed and built upon the analytical underpinnings and experience from the
successful DPL series. In light of country circumstances at the time, the choice of lending
instrument for PBS was a key decision. First, a Development Policy Lending (DPL) instrument
was not an option due to a political and economic environment of uncertainty. Second, the
country situation in late 2005/early 2006 did not meet the definitional standards of "emergency"
to trigger the use of an Emergency Recovery Loan instrument. Third, the possibility of merging
PBS objectives with another existing operation and scaling that up was dropped in the absence of
a suitable ongoing operation to which PBS could be linked. Fourth, a vertical single-sector
investment SWAp operation was rejected on the basis that Ethiopia's system of devolved
governance promoted budget allocation choices to be made across sectors at the sub-national
tiers of government rather than within a vertical sector program, and hence the vertical single-
sector SWAp would undermine the deepening decentralization movement. In addition, there
were on-going sectoral operations under implementation and development that were working on
sector quality enhancement. The final choice of instrument for PBS was that of a multi-sector
SWAp using a Specific Investment Loan to enable a more granular modality of engagement than
a DPL, but which nevertheless blended some of the features of a DPL in that it was fast-
disbursing, promoted policy dialogue on decentralized service delivery and accountability by
design, complemented more technical sectoral programs, used country systems to channel and
report on funds, and had an impact on a national scale.
46.     By design, the original implementation period of PBS was short, just over two fiscal
years. This duration is relatively short for designing and implementing transparency and
accountability activities, which in this case were both new and difficult, as well as the health
procurement (Component 2) activities. This short duration was determined by the duration of the
ICAS, which was about 18 months, and PBS was a central instrument of the ICAS. Also, given
the political uncertainties and high-risk nature of PBS, the Bank and other donors were unwilling
to commit funds for a longer period without first testing the proposed approach. It was expected
that, were PBS to prove successful, the implementation period could be extended and the
financing amount increased (both eventually done via Additional Financing in December 2007).
Alternatively, if PBS did not promote basic service delivery or contribute to deepening
accountability, then donors would not be locked into an unsuccessful program. Moreover, were
the conditions for budget support to improve, the short duration would enable agencies to revert
back to budget support without delay.
47.    Lessons learned from similar and related operations in Ethiopia and elsewhere in the
world were included in the PBS design (as explained in the PAD), especially from other
operations using SWAPs, including projects in Brazil, Uganda and India.
48.    A thorough risk assessment of PBS was conducted and mitigation measures were agreed.
The overall risk was identified as Substantial at the time of the original PBS approval in
recognition of the design innovations on the one hand and the uncertain political environment on
the other. It was seen and designed as a transitional instrument that was to initiate new
approaches and new types of activities in the Ethiopian context, which if seen to succeed, could
be extended or taken on by other operations. The implementation duration was short, two years,
and uncertainties abounded. In fact, it was recognized from the outset that these combined

                                               10
factors created high risk that activities initiated may not necessarily reach full maturity by the
end of PBS, and project indicator targets may not be achieved. This was particularly true given
the experimental nature of some of the activities, especially on the transparency and
accountability front. Some risks were appropriately diminished with the proposed mitigation
measures while others have persisted.
49.     The risk of activities not being fully completed or project indicator targets not being
achieved was nevertheless thought to be fully worth taking, given the potential gains, especially
in the longer term. PBS aimed to support decentralization of basic service delivery, which held
strong government ownership. The government was equally committed to improving its MDGs
through basic service delivery. Yet PBS recognized this as a long-term process, with a trajectory
that was not always predictable. In particular, a critical aspect of the process was enhancing
transparency and accountability, a key goal of PBS and a particularly difficult one given the
hierarchical nature and history of Ethiopian society. The challenge was to take steps that would
help plant the seeds for a long-term process of steady improvements in accountability, even if
these did not show up through marked changes in short-term project indicators.

2.2 Implementation
50.     Given the complexity of the project, the challenges it faced and the political context,
implementation of PBS I met its objectives by and large (see Table 1), though it experienced
delays in some activities. PBS also helped to: (i) sustain aid flows in the face of donor
withdrawal of budget support in a time of political crisis in 2005/2006; (ii) ensure funds were
targeted to service delivery at the woreda level; and (iii) adapt to Ethiopia's changed expenditure
system, following the shift to woreda-level block grants in 2002/03.
51.    PBS also strongly supported government capacity building efforts at the regional and
woreda level in the areas of public financial management, fiscal transparency and social
accountability, and through the pilot activities of LIG. PBS has contributed to strengthening on-
going government efforts in these areas and has accelerated their institutionalization. PBS has
also played an instrumental role in harmonizing donor contributions around the ongoing
decentralization process and avoiding fragmentation that could have diluted the effectiveness of
the complementary financial support.
52.     PBS supported an on-going, government-owned decentralization process and provided
TA to build capacity. The bulk of PBS resources--Component 1a and 1b--were provided as a
means to enable a committed government to implement decentralized basic service delivery and
strengthen its delivery of the MDGs. PBS funds pooled with Treasury funds and channeled to
regions and woredas, using country systems and accounts and providing TA to enhance capacity
rather than creating parallel structures. Implementation of PBS was aligned with the
government's existing priorities. PBS provides the federal government with funds to be
combined with domestic revenues and transferred according to set, objective criteria to sub-
national governments in the form of block grants. These block grants contribute to meeting local
needs consistent with national programs and policies, and with the service delivery priorities
identified by locally elected woreda councils and set out in woreda strategic plans.
53.     Implementation of PBS helped address some key outstanding capacity gaps that were
evident at the time of preparation. One of these was the poor expenditure tracking at the woreda
level, especially with regard to sectoral composition, which ensued after woredas were given

                                                11
discretion over expenditure allocation in 2002/03. While GOE realized this needed to be rectified,
PBS hastened the process by requiring regular reporting for the JBARs and providing TA.
54.    PBS also played a key role in supporting decentralization in the country by carrying
forward the strengthening of administrative and PFM systems, and building capacity, in support
of woredas, at the time the newest level of devolved responsibility. These activities were
financed mostly by Component 3, and on a pilot basis as part of the LIG component (1b).
55.     Building capacity for transparency and social accountability. PBS has helped to deepen
financial transparency at the Federal, regional and woreda/local levels and to induce increased
citizen participation and voice in demanding improved access and quality of basic service
delivery. FTA and SA are new concepts that GOE has included in its governance agenda since
2006, and PBS was able to support its piloting and implementation. While hard work, the
progress in this area was notable, especially given the historical context of Ethiopia.
56.    Intensive field-based supervision by Bank task team, and field visits. A number of
implementation issues and delays (see below) were improved over time as the Bank team
became largely field-based and also deepened staffing in critical areas where implementation
bottlenecks or weak GOE capacity were identified. This facilitated the provision of intensive,
day-to-day support for the various PBS components, and enabled close hands-on dialogue with
GOE and donors. Regular PBS field visits, conducted jointly by the Bank team with other donors
and GOE counterparts, also started to take place to regions and woredas. This intensive
supervision required a relatively large, enhanced supervision budget. (See Section 5.1 (b).)
57.     JBAR and JRIS Reviews. At the heart of PBS supervision and M&E were the JBARs,
which were a central part of each JRIS. A key purpose of the JBAR/JRIS Reviews was to
provide a forum for donors, the Federal government (including the line ministries for the PBS
sectors, as well as MOFED, MCB and OFAG) and the regions to jointly review issues and
progress on PBS and on decentralization as a whole; to frankly discuss challenges faced; and to
try and find pragmatic solutions. Adherence to the four PBS principles of additionality, fairness,
fiduciary responsibility and accountability was analyzed and discussed at the Reviews, and a
satisfactory finding regarding this was needed before disbursements under Component 1a (wich
accounted for most of the project funds) could be made.
58.    These Reviews were especially important to increase interaction on decentralization and
various sector issues between MOFED and the line ministries, and to enhance donor
harmonization. Preceding each JBAR/JRIS, a significant amount of data and various types of
information were collected and analysis done, to feed the discussions. This included analysis of
spending trends and composition for the PBS sectors and sub-sectors; data of this nature had not
been collected and analyzed on a consistent basis before. Outcome indicators and various sector
developments were also tracked at these Reviews. Furthermore, PBS field visits would often be
done just before a JBAR/JRIS, enabling the findings to be discussed at the Review. Finally, the
Reviews also facilitated the taking of steps to ensure compliance with project requirements, and
helped provide support to the GOE regarding key policy and operational issues for PBS.
59.    The JBARs at first took place quarterly, and then semi-annually. Organized by MOFED,
they involved representatives of relevant Federal ministries and agencies, regional BOFEDs,
PBS DPs and citizens' representatives from the Parliament's Budget and Public Finances
Standing Committee and the budget committees of regional councils.


                                               12
60.     Events beyond the control of the government. Several events put pressure on the
government's ability to finance basic services from its own resources, including: (i) a spike in
global food prices; (ii) the global economic crisis starting in mid-2008; (iii) droughts in some
parts of the country and floods in other parts; and (iv) the unpredictability in resource provision
from some donor partners. Despite these pressures, the government managed to increase its
contribution to the block grants each year above and beyond the level required in the PBS
agreements, signalling the priority GOE attached to PBS and the decentralization process.
61.     Generic capacity issues. Two factors hindered PBS implementation to some extent
across all components. First, institutional capacity at the woreda level in particular was still low,
which is not surprising since decentralization to the woreda level started only in 2002/03; indeed,
one of the goals of PBS I was to help enhance woreda capacity. This contributed to delays in
implementation and fiscal reporting (see Section 2.4). Second, the high turnover of trained staff
at key government implementing agencies at all levels, mainly due to low salaries, diluted the
gains in building capacity through training. This is a country-wide problem, affecting most IDA
projects in Ethiopia, and GOE has worked to mitigate this issue by various means available to it.
62.     Midterm Review (MTR). The main findings of the MTR for PBS I, conducted in May
2007, include the following: (i) PBS has proved to be an effective and appropriate modality for
supporting the decentralized basic service delivery and accountability pillars of the PASDEP,
and should continue as a medium-term financing instrument. (ii) Performance was strong for
project indicators, but there was a need to review them and make certain modifications in a few
cases (see Section 1.3). (iii) To reduce unnecessary transaction costs, the JBAR/JRIS Reviews
should be held twice a year instead of every quarter. (iv) Additional financing from DFID, IDA
and other partners should be sought to continue support to PBS. (v) A LIG pilot would be
included under the IDA Additional Financing.
63.     Implementation of Component 1a (Block Grants). This component was fully
implemented with minimum delays within the established period due to strong government
ownership and building on the government's ongoing decentralization efforts. The four core
principles (additionality, fairness, fiduciary responsibility and accountability) were consistently
complied with, based on the findings of the JBARs and JRIS reviews as well as the continuous
audits.
64.     The additionality principle (that GOE's own financing for the Federal block grants to the
regions was to increase by at least 10 percent per year in dollar terms) was surpassed. This, in
turn, was the main reason for the rapid growth in regional and woreda spending over the PBS
period. The fairness principle, that the block grant resources should be distributed (by the Federal
government to regions and by the regional governments to woredas) according to transparent,
fair and rules-based formulae was also found to be consistently applied. Adherence to the
fiduciary responsibility and accountability principles was judged to be satisfactory overall, in
compliance with the agreed actions linked largely to progress on Components 3 and 4.
65.    One implementation issue related to Component 1a was the frequency of the JRIS, which
was initially held quarterly. The transaction costs of these frequent JRIS reviews were found to
be excessively high. To address this issue, donors and GOE showed flexibility by agreeing at the
mid-term of PBS to hold the JRIS bi-annually instead of quarterly.
66.    This could have been even further strengthened by aligning the timing of the JRIS with
the Ethiopian Fiscal Year (EFY) so the release of PBS funds, which could only occur after a
                                                 13
satisfactory JRIS, would align better with the EFY. Once the JRIS reviews started to be
conducted twice a year instead of every quarter (after the Midterm Review), the two rounds of
disbursements in each EFY tended to occur around December (after an October JRIS Review)
and almost at the end of the EFY, or in a few cases in the following fiscal year (after an
April/May JRIS review). Improving predictability and proper planning for the government of the
block grant disbursements would be helpful.
67.     Implementation of Component 1b (LIG). A detailed review of LIG was conducted in
early 2010 (see Annex 10). The review found that, among others: (i) physical implementation of
specific projects has generally been satisfactory with an average completion rate of 81% for
projects started in EFY 2001; and (ii) 84% of projects were found to have satisfactory technical
quality. LIG projects have been implemented in all of the basic services sectors covered by PBS.
The implementation of this pilot component has laid the foundations for the long-term goal of
improving capital investments required in the delivery of basic services, and increasing the
resources needed for this.
68.    There have been implementation challenges, however. The GOE team did not manage to
complete the LIG Operational Manual for some time after effectiveness of PBS Additional
Financing. Since this was a condition of disbursement for LIG, its delay caused the first PBS
funds for LIG to be released six months behind schedule. This Manual was eventually completed,
with TA from the Bank. This initial delay has also led to a delay in the post-procurement audit of
LIG. Suitable consultants have been selected for this and contracting is now taking place.
69.     Other issues include: (i) some woredas perceived the LIG as a discrete project rather than
an opportunity to augment their own capital budget. This is likely due to poor communication on
the objectives of LIG; (ii) some woredas had difficulty finding skilled manpower to design,
implement and monitor projects and had to search the zonal or regional capitals to find
appropriate personnel; (iii) further capacity building is still required at the woreda level to more
appropriately allocate available capital funds to address basic services investment needs, as LIG
has increased woredas' historical capital budget by an order of five to seven times; this has also
created a management capacity issue in some woredas, resulting in implementation delays; and
(iv) the system to track and provide on-site monitoring needs to more consistently assess the
quality of investments. These are the types of lessons regarding constraints that the pilot LIG was
designed to generate; they need to be considered and addressed in any scale up of LIG.
70.     To help identify and address implementation issues on the ground, the Bank team started
to conduct regular and intensive field visits jointly with GOE officials, focusing exclusively on
LIG issues and LIG woredas (and conducted separately from the broader PBS field visits that
looked at implementation of all components). The above implementation challenges were
identified during these visits. To address these, the Bank team took two courses of action. First, it
put in place a group of consultants specializing in (i) the types of capital investment undertaken
by the woredas, (ii) planning and budgeting, to assist in the management of the investments at
woreda level and (iii) safeguard adherence. This group spent several months in the field, visiting
a selection of LIG woredas for at least two days each to get an in-depth understanding of the
challenges faced and to provide on-site support and raise awareness. Second, extensive training
has been conducted by MOFED with support from the Bank team. From August to September
2009 about 500 individuals, including officials from all current 99 LIG woredas, as well as zonal
and regional officials, attended a four-day training on planning and budgeting as well as
fiduciary responsibilities. Also, to assist the regional-level representatives, who are the first

                                                 14
points of contact with the LIG woredas, the team recently held another four-day training where
at least five representatives from each of the nine regions attended.
71.     Some of the more specific actions that the Bank team together with GOE took to address
the specific issues mentioned above include: (i) explanation of the objectives, principles and
procedures of LIG to woredas during the LIG field visits; (ii) advising woredas to recruit young
professionals and engineers who can work with more experienced regional/zonal officials to gain
experience; and (iii) encouraging MOFED to prepare a Planning and Budgeting Guideline and to
ensure that woreda officials are provided training on this guideline. As a result of all these
activities, awareness regarding LIG procedures increased, and improvements took place with
regard to many of the identified challenges.
72.     Implementation of Component 2 (Health). Despite significant initial delays in the
procurement process, all planned procurement under this component was completed by the
closing date. Almost the totality of all health commodities procured under PBS in 2009 had been
delivered to the Pharmaceutical Fund and Supply Agency (PFSA) and (at the time of writing)
was still in the process of being repackaged into kits for health centers and health posts.
73.     A main reason for the initial delays in implementation was a delay in the contracting of a
Procurement Agent. This had implications for the timing of purchases and the distribution of
items to health facilities (continuing even after the project closed). Procurement delays led to a
delay in launching the Quantitative Service Delivery Study (QSDS). The fieldwork that had to be
completed by April 2008 was completed in November 2009, for reasons discussed in Section 2.3.
74.     The initial delays were addressed by intensive "hands-on" efforts of the Bank country
office procurement staff and Bank task team, as well as by the FMOH/PFSA team and the State
Minister of Health. Regular joint meetings (at times once in two weeks) were held together with
the State Minister, and further day to day follow-up efforts took place. To facilitate this, the
Bank intensified its on-the-ground supervision efforts and staffing for this component. All
procurement issues were eventually addressed.
75.     Implementation of Component 3 (Financial Transparency). This component had a core
FTA stream and a PFM stream. In both areas considerable progress was made. MOFED's efforts
to enhance the capacity of the national, regional, zone and woreda administrations on core
financial operations and reporting, including financing additional accountants and IT personnel,
as well as hardware and software, advanced well, albeit still with some reporting issues at the
woreda level. This capacity building effort has allowed MOFED, among other things, to improve
its response time in providing the required JBAR financial information for the semi-annual JRIS
as well as the quarterly financial management reports (FMRs) / interim financial reports (IFRs).
The technical support provided to OFAG under the PFM stream in terms of computers, vehicles
and training, and related basic equipment allowed it to carry out quarterly continuous audits at
the woreda level in about 95 percent of all woredas nationwide (730 out of 770).
76.     The FTA stream supported activities designed to increase citizens' knowledge of budgets,
expenditures and service delivery by local government. This stream had a slow start for two main
reasons. First, there was an initial lack of familiarity with the FTA concept and tools, as it was
the first time that these concepts and the required activities were being introduced in the public
financial sector in Ethiopia. Thus, it was inherently more difficult to make a rapid start with the
FTA stream than the PFM stream. Second, there was a delay in the establishment of a dedicated
team within the MOFED to carry out the envisaged activities, including the selection of qualified
                                                15
consultants. Once in place, the Unit lacked expertise on FTA issues and needed strong support.
77.    To help address these issues, the Bank team stepped up its on-the-ground implementation
support for this component. A full-time Bank staff person was hired for this component, based
in-country. Regular support was also provided by an assigned FTA expert from Washington. The
Bank team provided close, hands-on implementation support in a range of areas, including on
design of FTA concepts and tools, understanding of FTA concepts, development of Terms of
Reference and other inputs for consultancies, development of guidelines for regions, and
supervision of trainings and regional workshops.
78.     With the help of this additional support, after the relatively slow start for the FTA stream,
implementation performance improved, and there has been steady progress, continuing into PBS
II. Transparency and accountability are new concepts to Ethiopia and, even though they were
introduced as an initiative of the donors and the Bank, GOE demonstrated increasing "ownership"
over the FTA activities at all levels (Federal, regional and woreda). During the PBS I period, the
four core prototype FTA tools (see Annex 2) were eventually developed, validated, disseminated
to regions and posted on the website for customization by the regions and use. Use of these tools
by citizens (albeit in a pilot context), envisaged as a target at appraisal, was not achieved under
PBS I, but they are now part of the activities to be supported under PBS II. The baseline FTA
Perceptions Survey (FTAPS) was finalized in June 2009, albeit after a long delay. (Fieldwork for
this survey was originally supposed to have been completed by December 2006; under
Additional Financing this deadline was extended to February 2008.) Fieldwork for a follow-up
FTAPs survey was supposed to have been completed under PBS I, but it was agreed this should
instead take place under PBS II. This would allow for adequate time to elapse after the first
FTAPs and for the follow up survey to be done as part of the ongoing regular Woreda
Benchmarking Survey series, thereby avoiding duplicity and reducing transaction costs.
79.     Implementation of Component 4 (Social Accountability). The social accountability (SA)
component aimed to strengthen the demand side of improving service delivery by providing
citizens with the tools and capacity to interact with local governments and service providers. It
was slow getting started, in part because of its novelty, and in part because of the need to create
an institutional `home' for these activities (via the independent management agent for the
component) and a tripartite governance structure (i.e., government, CSOs and donors). Once
established, significant progress was made. GTZ International Services was selected as the MA,
operating with a local partner, Center for Development Consultancy (CDC). Ultimately 12 lead
CSOs (6 more than expected at appraisal) in cooperation with 33 other partner organizations
completed the implementation of pilot SA initiatives in 80 woredas, and 6 towns and sub-cities.
80.     An important result of PBS was that SA was put on the table for government discussion
during a politically unsettled period when trust between CSOs and the state structures was at a
historic low. Even today, PBS continues to be the major vehicle through which SA in service
delivery is brought to the attention of policy-makers at the highest level.
81.     Another achievement was the establishment of a high-level Steering Committee, chaired
by a State Minister of Finance ­ an impressive development, given Ethiopia's historical and
traditional context. This Committee brought together representatives of the government
(MOFED, Ministry of Capacity Building and Ministry of Justice), CSOs and donors for the first
time around issues of SA, and gave non-governmental actors a direct voice in these PBS
activities. The functioning of this Steering Committee has been key to dissipating difficulties

                                                16
associated with working in a potentially politically charged environment and to expanding the
learning pilot from six to 12 SA projects in a participatory manner.
82.     Despite these achievements, inevitably there were also shortcomings. First, it took longer
than expected to start implementation, due to procedural issues regarding procurement and
contracting of the MA, and establishment of the MDTF (executed by GTZ) for Component 4.
Second, delays under Component 3 precluded timely delivery of the laypersons guidelines and
templates on public budgets to the MA, which stifled the envisioned dissemination and testing of
these tools by CSOs. Third, there were some delays in the direct transfer of funds from the
MDTF to the lead participating CSOs. Fourth, there were some weaknesses in financial
management as well as training, supervision and monitoring on the part of the MA. And fifth, the
Charities and Societies Proclamation of January 2009 could risk constraining the effectiveness
and sustainability of the FTA and SA components under future PBS operations, although
mitigation measures are in place (see Section 4). Additional challenges, based on preliminary
analysis, are detailed in Annexes 2 and 9. A comprehensive Evaluation and Design Consultancy
(EDC) is nearing completion at the time of writing, and will inform the design and scaling up of
SA activities under PBS II. An independent evaluation conducted as part of this effort showed
positive results in terms of the potential impact of SA activities (see Section 3.2).
83.    The Bank team took pro-active steps to address these issues. A core Bank team, with a
Component Lead, was assigned to follow-up developments and provide implementation support
to Component 4 (and also to Component 3). This team in turn mobilized international expertise
on SA to provide implementation support. As the MDTF moved into the implementation phase,
the Bank lead for Component 4 was moved to the field for more direct and continuous
implementation support. Given the delays in hiring the MA, the Bank team, in consultation with
the other members of the Steering Committee, devised the approach of advancing with two
demonstration projects to kick-start the component activities. Once GTZ was hired, the Bank
team provided multiple briefings to them regarding the purpose of the Component, and advised
on implementation issues (e.g. the need for close follow-up with implementing CSOs).
84.    One of the key ways in which this field-based implementation structure had an impact
was in the context of the context of the Charities and Societies Proclamation. The Bank team
mobilized rapidly to consult with both CSOs directly and other DPs on possible implications and
areas of concern. Following this, the Bank took the lead to enter into dialogue with MOFED on
obtaining assurances regarding the safeguarding of SA in the context of service delivery, an
important breakthrough in a charged atmosphere. Due in part to all these efforts, considerable
progress was ultimately made with SA activities under Component 4, as described above.
85.     Donor harmonization. Harmonization of aid and integration to the GOE's financial
systems has been guiding principles for donor participation in the cofinancing of PBS. In this
respect, success has been substantial. Major bilateral and multilateral partners continued to
provide aid when there was a risk of their withdrawing it, and their resources were harnessed in
support of a commonly agreed government program that successfully spent most money through
established national systems. IDA's total financing of almost US$444 million leveraged donor
financing of almost US$814 million equivalent from nine other partners (see Annex 2) and GOE
financing of over US$2 billion, thus allowing for scaling up development impact.
86.    Except for AfDB, Austria and partially KfW, all PBS donors provided their financing
through Bank-administered MDTFs using pooled arrangements that were subject to common

                                               17
procurement and financial management processes (see Annex 12 for full details). This ICR also
serves as a completion report for the MDTFs TF070499, TF070801 and TF070559 (totaling
$660 million equivalent, as well as their child MDTFs. KfW put funds into the MDTF
supporting the PBS Secretariat (see below), but not into the other MDTFs.
87.     One of the strengths of PBS is its multi-donor nature, providing a means for ten key DPs
to come together around a common instrument, a common approach, a common M&E
framework and largely a common financing mechanism. Towards this end, the efforts of the
Bank regarding donor harmonization and administration of the MDTFs supporting PBS have
been critical. Cofinancing from DPs, in particular cofinancing provided via the Bank-
administered MDTFs, have enabled the program to scale up development impact, while also
contributing to improvements in harmonization, planning and coordination of program activities,
and predictability of program financing (see Annex 12). Transaction costs for both GOE and
contributing partners were thus substantially reduced. But on the part of the Bank, the program
required an intensive degree of supervision, financed by a much higher level of resources than is
typically made available for supervising Bank operations (see Section 5.1). The efforts of the
Bank included, among others, quality control and oversight as administrator of the MDTFs,
handling a range of procedural issues regarding the MDTFs, and ensuring compliance with
fiduciary requirements, with continuous support from country-based staff.
88.    A PBS Secretariat was established to support the PBS Donor Group in the overall
monitoring and coordination of PBS program activities. The Secretariat assisted PBS Donors
with the tasks of ensuring the smooth implementation of PBS, assessing its performance and
progress, and preparing for policy dialogue with the government.
89.     Important progress has been made to improve donor harmonization, but there is still a
need to: (i) further strengthen alignment between DP resource transfers and the GOE budget
cycle; and (ii) work toward securing agreements on multi-year financing plans from DPs often
made difficult by their own funding cycles.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization
90.     Design of M&E Framework. The M&E framework was designed in close consultation
with GoE and DPs, in line with the PDO. The M&E framework included (a) project indicators,
as well as (b) additional information collected, analyzed and utilized via the JBAR/JRIS Review
mechanism (see description of these Reviews in section 2.2).
91.     The project indicators included appropriate outcome indicators to measure changes in the
protection and expansion of basic services (block grants of Component 1), and to measure the
outcomes of Component 2 (health). For Components 3 and 4, only output indicators were
included given the characteristics of these two components and recognizing the longer time
frame needed for the process of enhancing transparency and accountability to achieve
meaningful development outcomes. While the bulk of performance indicators were appropriate
to monitor progress and results achieved, some indicators proved difficult to measure and were
subsequently adjusted at the time the Additional Financing was approved.
92.     Implementation of M&E Framework. The JBAR/JRIS Reviews were critical for
monitoring the project indicators, as well as additional information critical for PBS and the
overall decentralization process. This included trends in sector spending and various sector
indicators, indicators of progress regarding transparency and accountability as well as capacity at

                                                18
lower levels (e.g. on fiduciary aspects), and information on operational aspects of PBS.
93.    Progress on Component 2 (including performance indicators) was monitored through
FMOH's monitoring framework for the health sector development program. Discussions were
also carried out with technical working groups of key line ministries to take stock and track
performance indicators, to align with the JBARs, and to discuss crosscutting issues (e.g. gender).
94.     PBS was supposed to benefit from the completion of specific surveys, like the QSDS for
Component 2 and the FTAPS for Component 3, which would feed into the M&E framework and
the JBAR/JRIS Reviews. Both were delayed (see Section 2.2), but their findings are now being
addressed under PBS II. In the case of the FTAPs, the inclusion of the second FTAPs as part of
the Woreda City Benchmarking Survey (WCBS) series will help ensure full "ownership" on the
part of the GOE; the WCBS is now an established part of the GOE's M&E framework.
95.    Some end-of-project targets set at appraisal were rightly increased to reflect the more
rapid progress being made on the ground and to harmonize with PASDEP targets. Similarly,
some baseline data were updated based on new information. Finally, some new indicators were
added to the results framework at the time of approval of the Additional Financing, partly to
align better with the PASDEP (GOE's main poverty reduction strategy document), and partly to
harmonize with the indicators utilized for IDA replenishment.
96.    During implementation, there were reporting delays for some key performance indicators
and for progress reports, mainly due to lack of reporting capacity, especially at the local level.
Delays in the start-up of LIG also slowed down data collection for this component.
97.      Utilization of M&E Information. The JBAR/JRIS Reviews were, again, critical for the
utilization of the information collected through the M&E framework. This information would
feed into discussions among participants on the relevant issues, and would help inform decisions
regarding next steps (see description of these Reviews in Section 2.2). At the end of each Review,
a list of actions would be agreed on to be achieved before the next Review. In addition, some of
the information collected via the PBS M&E framework fed into sector reviews and
decisionmaking fora for the individual sectors.
2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
98.     Financial Management (FM). For Component 1a (accounting for the bulk of the project
funds), the required quarterly financial reporting was a challenge in Ethiopia's newly
decentralized system. Woredas (about 770 in total) needed to report to regions, which needed to
consolidate the reports and submit to MOFED, and MOFED was required to submit a final
consolidated report to the Bank within 90 days after the end of each quarter. The annual audits
for this component were also challenging. All accounts needed to be closed (after resolving
discrepancies etc.) at all levels, including at the woreda level for all woredas, before the annual
audit for Component 1a could occur. And the Bank required each annual audit to be submitted
within nine months of the end of each fiscal year.
99.    These timelines required by the Bank need to be made more flexible for a large and
newly decentralized country like Ethiopia, with still-weak woreda capacity (see section 6).
Nevertheless, in view of the constraints, performance regarding FM including financial reporting
and auditing was relatively good, for the bulk of the funds (i.e. Component 1a funds).
100.   Overall, for PBS as a whole, FM performance was good on budgeting, fund flows and

                                                19
accounting aspects, but there were some issues with financial reporting and audits. There were
initial issues with the timely delivery and quality of FMRs/IFRs under Components 1a and 3, but
these were satisfactorily addressed by MOFED with hands-on assistance by the Bank country-
based fiduciary staff. In the case of Components 1b and 2, substantial progress was made over
time, but significant reporting issues remained even towards the end of the project (see Annex 2).
Audit reports were largely submitted on time, except for the first report for Components 1 and 3
for FY07 (2006/07) which was delayed by about six months, largely due to a misunderstanding
between MOFED and the Bank regarding the scope and methodology of the audit.
101. Procurement. Component 1 financed only recurrent costs. No procurement was
envisaged, but it was agreed that any procurement to be undertaken would need to follow local
government procurement procedures and rules. Under Component 1b (LIG), in general, woredas
had some difficulties in procurement planning, procurement file management, and procurement
of works. Another critical issue is that at the time of writing, the post-procurement audit for LIG
had yet to take place at the time of writing the ICR, but the contracting was about to take place.
102. Under Component 2, after completing a procurement capacity assessment of FMOH
during preparation, all the donors including IDA agreed that FMOH needed to appoint a
qualified procurement agent, and this was to be done by December 2006. From the start, FMOH
did not have ownership of the process and the procurement agent, after substantial delay, was
contracted in February 2008. Due to a lack of ownership and conflicting roles assigned to it, the
procurement agent did not perform as expected (see Annex 2). All of these factors led to
substantial initial delays in the procurement process, addressed later by intensive "hands-on"
efforts (see above under implementation of Component 2).
103. Under Component 3, there were initial delays in preparing the technical specifications for
the selection of qualified consultants to develop the four FTA tools; but over time, local expertise
was built, and almost all goods and services planned under this component were procured and
distributed/rendered accordingly. No procurement issues were reported for Component 4.
104. Safeguards (Environmental and Resettlement). Environmental safeguards were triggered
by Component 2 with respect to medical waste management and handling/spraying of
insecticides. The project files include reports of field supervision missions confirming that the
safeguards were largely being followed at the health centers and health posts of the localities
visited, although this was not done consistently across the board. The LIG Component (1b)
triggered compliance with the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and
the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), due to small-scale civil works, although in most
cases the LIG projects were environmentally benign and, thus, an environment and social
safeguard report was not required. Nevertheless, there were significant shortcomings regarding
the agreed safeguards, including lack of proper compliance by woredas with the ESMF and RPF
(see Annex 2 for more details). The Bank team did despatch a group of consultants specializing
in safeguard issues, among others, to provide on-the-ground support to the LIG woredas (see
Section 2.2). This has helped some corrective actions to be carried out (see Annex 2).
2.5    Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase
105. All components in PBS I are being scaled up under the follow-up operation PBS II,
which had a total allocation upon approval of US$1,278 million from GOE and donor partners,
of which US$540 million is from IDA. The PDO for PBS II is similar as that for PBS I, but with
an emphasis on improving both access and quality of basic service delivery, in recognition that
                                                20
decentralized service delivery under PBS I and before has been very successful in enhancing
coverage and access, but should now work more with complementary sectoral operations to
delve deeper into quality issues.
106. Under PBS II, the block grants component covers the same basic sectors as in PBS I, with
the addition of rural roads. LIG has been scaled up from 51 to 99 woredas, with the help of some
cofinancing from other donor partners (which is new), in addition to IDA. The health component
is being strengthened to accelerate Ethiopia's achievement of the health-related MDGs, and a
corresponding health operation is being discussed on health system strengthening to complement
the on-going dialogue and PBS activities. The pending agenda of further strengthening FTA will
be completed through the use of the four tools developed under PBS by citizens and rolled out at
the regional, woreda and kebele levels. Activities to enhance the PFM capacity, especially at
decentralized levels, have been scaled up substantially under PBS II and unlike PBS I, the
project includes activities that enhance procurement reform. The SA sub-program involves
scaling up of the pilot activities, based on the findings of the EDC (see Section 2.2).
107. PBS II will ramp up support on the M&E side and includes a component (Sub-program
D) dedicated solely to M&E, supporting efforts to more regularly produce high-quality outcome
and performance indicators for the basic services sectors. An important principle here is to
support activities with full government ownership, including from the individual line ministries.
PBS II also includes, as both PDO and intermediate outcome indicators, a range of indicators of
access and quality for the basic service sectors. These were largely excluded from PBS I (except
for the health sector), or included as Higher Level Objective Indicators.
108. GOE has continued to provide the bulk of financing for the PBS program (two thirds),
which bodes well for sustainability. Sustainability will also depend on macroeconomic
circumstances; in particular, sustained economic growth is needed to be able to continue to
channel increasing amounts of domestic public resources toward decentralized service delivery.
The economic situation is now relatively good, and the country appears to be on a recovery path
from the precarious macroeconomic situation of 2008/09 when the 12-month end-of-period
inflation rate soared to 64 percent in July 2008 and foreign reserves fell to less than a month's
worth of import cover (see Section 4).
109. The choice of instrument and the design of PBS have implications for projects beyond
PBS as well. As part of its Investment Lending Reform (ILR), the Bank plans to introduce a new
lending instrument that links disbursements more directly to results. The Bank's Operations
Policy and Country Services (OPCS) department has looked closely at PBS's experience in
providing fast-disbursing support (through the Block Grant component) based on joint reviews of
the four core PBS principles, and pairing that support with capacity building efforts at lower
levels on fiduciary and other aspects through more standard investment lending.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
110. At the preparation stage, PBS, a core part of the ICAS, was aligned with PASDEP,
GOE's main poverty reduction strategy. In this context, PBS was seen as a major contributor,
supporting GOE in developing and implementing a strengthened program of institution building
and governance reform to help accelerate its efforts to decentralize services and reduce poverty.

                                               21
PBS was to contribute to this objective through its focus on the fair and accountable delivery of
resources, promotion of budget transparency, especially at local levels, and piloting different
approaches to enhance civic engagement in local budgeting and service delivery decisions.
111. At the time of closing, PBS was aligned with the current results-based CAS, where the
project contributed to the achievement of three of the CAS pillars: to improve access to and
quality of basic service delivery, to foster improved governance, and to foster economic growth.
In addition, PBS also has deepened partnerships through IDA-supported multi-donor programs.
112.   Accordingly, the PDOs of PBS continue to be highly relevant.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
113. Assessment of PDO achievements. The ICR rates the achievement toward the PDOs ­
"protect and promote the delivery of basic services by sub-national governments while
deepening transparency and local accountability" ­ as satisfactory for the reasons stated below.
114. Protect and promote the delivery of basic services (supported by Components 1a, 1b
and 2): A core intention of PBS was to protect basic services through preserving the Federal
Block Grants (FBG), via Component 1a financing, from cuts that would have been likely if the
fiscal space was constrained. Measured against its original goal, the objective was achieved.
Between 2004/05 and 2008/09, the total dollar amount of the federal block grant to the regions
grew by about two and a half times, while total basic services spending by regions and woredas
almost doubled (see indicators in Table 1). Furthermore, the "fairness" test found consistently
that block grant transfers were distributed to regions and woredas in accordance with inter-
governmental fiscal rules, hence ensuring fair and rules-based allocation of the FBG resources.
115. The increases in the total federal block grant (FBG) were underpinned by the
requirements of the additionality test (an annual 10 percent increase in dollar terms of the
government's own financing for the FBG), which the government surpassed. The balance of
opinion among donors in Ethiopia and several government officials is that the requirements of
the additionality tests and the attention focused on the block grants as a consequence of the
regular JBAR and JRIS reviews at a minimum resulted in the originally planned levels of
funding for the FBG being protected and probably increased. Without PBS, it is unlikely that
there would have been increases in the FBG to the degree observed.
116.    The introduction of PBS not only mitigated the general pressure on expenditures but did
so more clearly at the regional level. So while the general government budget grew only by 1.6
percent per annum in real terms since 2005/06, at the regional level budgets increased on average
by 3.2 percent (and 6.5 percent for the recurrent budget). A similar pattern is observed at the
basic services level. In education and health, the data show an acceleration in real per capita
spending from 2006/07 onward suggesting a protective effect of PBS. Regional block grants to
woredas, where most basic services are in fact delivered, increased about 6 percent per annum in
real terms during the PBS period, and have remained fairly constant at about 62 percent of total
public spending by the regions. In other words, regional governments are not unduly holding
back increased resources for their own use. (See Annex 3 for more on all this.)

117. The block grant, co-financed by PBS, has of course been just one ­ albeit major ­
financing source for the basic services sectors. Several other factors contributed to the
improvements in service delivery indicators, as observed above. Complementary programs in the
education sector like the General Education Quality Improvement Program (GEQIP), for
example, complemented PBS I's financing of teachers' salaries, and financed such things as
teacher training, textbook purchases, etc. Such complementary investments and sectoral reforms
are very important to leveraging the impact of the expansion of service delivery.
118. The other two elements that complemented the FBG in the protection and promotion of
basic services were local investment grants (Component 1b) and the acquisition and distribution
of health inputs (Component 2). Both of these are now, in turn, discussed.
119. Regarding the Local Investment Grants (Component 1b), their actual implementation
started in early 2009, and it is too soon to reflect on overall outcomes and lessons learned from
this component. Nevertheless, there are some preliminary implementation findings derived from
field visits to about 10 woredas (20 percent of those participating) in early 2010 indicating the
likely satisfactory implementation progress of the pilot LIG (see Annex 10 for more details).
Woreda officials (up to the highest level of chief administrator) were supportive of the LIG. As
Table 1 shows, the three project indicators for this sub-component were largely achieved.
120. The Health MDG Performance Facility (Component 2) was managed by the FMOH.
The commodities financed by this component, representing up to a third of a typical woreda
health budget, along with public health spending at the regional and woreda level supported by
Component 1a, allowed a very substantial acceleration of coverage of core primary health
services in Ethiopia, especially in rural areas. Table 1 shows that performance for the Component
2 indicators under PBS was satisfactory.
121. Deepening transparency and accountability (supported by Components 3 and 4): Out
of the five project indicators for FTA (which was financed by Component 3), two were achieved
and one was partially achieved, while the other two were not achieved (see Table 1). This was
due to the delayed pace of implementation of the FTA activities (see section 2.2). The target of
improving citizen access to public budget information, a PDO Indicator, was achieved along a
number of dimensions. For example, there was widespread public disclosure of budgets, with 90
percent of woredas posting their budgets in public places. Budget literacy training was conducted
for 1,500 key citizens, and workshops on FTA tools were held for key citizens in five regions
(who are then expected to pass this knowledge to others). On the other hand, delays were
encountered vis-à-vis service delivery templates and "laypersons" budget templates, which were
supposed to be utilized by service facilities and woredas, respectively, by the end of PBS. Draft
templates were developed, but at the time of project closing they had not yet been customized for
local use by the regions. The baseline FTA Perceptions Survey was only finalized in June 2009.
122. Despite the mixed picture in terms of achievement of these project indicators, as stated in
Section 2.1, a key goal of PBS was to help put in place the initial building blocks for long-term
improvements in transparency and accountability. It was recognized from the outset that this
would not necessarily show up in readily measurable project indicators within a relatively short
time period. This was one reason why PBS I was rated from the outset as a Substantial Risk
project, with the highest risk attached to the transparency and accountability indicators.
123. In terms of potential long-term impacts, FTA activities have demonstrable signs of
success. For example, the widespread posting of budget information in public places,
                                               24
unprecedented in Ethiopia, appears to have helped to inculcate enhanced transparency. Regions
proclaim their budget annually and make it available for the public through different means, and
this has become customary for all woredas. The listing of woreda budgets and block grant
disbursements on MOFED's website was directly linked to PBS requirements and constituted a
first in Ethiopia. The baseline FTA Perceptions Survey is seen as a means to benchmark service
delivery information. It was distributed to regions with a guide on how to follow up on the
findings, disseminated to DPs, and posted on the MOFED website.
124. Importantly, the planned FTA activities that were not completed under PBS I are
expected to be completed under PBS II. Thus, implementation has been delayed, but not stopped,
and government "ownership" regarding FTA is now strong. Over the medium to longer term, the
signs are encouraging that the FTA agenda will take hold in Ethiopia in a relatively short period
of time, and that advances in this area will continue, albeit at their own pace. This by itself is an
important achievement, given the hierarchical and top­down traditions of Ethiopia.
125. Regarding Social Accountability, the targets for both project indicators were achieved
(see Table 1). One of the targets was to implement 6 SA pilots; in the end 12 were implemented.
126. An independent evaluation of the SA pilots has just been completed. Findings indicate an
increased awareness regarding citizens' rights and responsibilities, and improvement in
communication between service providers, communities and CSOs, triggered by the dialogue
created during interface meetings between service providers and service users. These meetings
provided a mechanism for constructive dialogue where service delivery problems were identified,
solutions recommended and action plans agreed. There is evidence that in the pilot areas, service
providers now offer better services to citizens and are more accessible to service users. Likewise,
there appears to have been a positive shift in the sense of ownership by the communities of the
service delivery process and their own roles and responsibilities. (See also Annex 9.)
127. Similar to Component 3, some of the achievements of Component 4 indicate a change in
mind-set with potential long-term impacts on accountability. These include the implementation
of the 12 SA pilots, the establishment of a Steering Committee with high-level government
representation (chaired by a State Minister of Finance) and the eventual participation of CSOs in
the JRIS reviews. Against the background at the time PBS was formulated, when SA issues were
not on the agenda, and civil society relations were strained following the elections, these have to
be regarded as very credible achievements.
128. Higher Level Objective Indicators and Service Delivery Outcomes. The PDO and
intermediate outcome indicators for Component 2 tracked health service delivery outcomes. For
other sectors, to assess improvements in service delivery (output and outcome) indicators, one
has to turn to the Higher Level Objective indicators appearing in the PAD. These have shown
substantial improvements over the implementation period of PBS I (see Table 2). Although these
indicators are outside the scope of PBS, PBS financing and the substantial increases observed in
basic services spending clearly contributed to these accomplishments. Many of these indicators
were already showing upward trends before the advent of PBS, but PBS was critical to sustaining
these trends, which would otherwise have been affected due to much-reduced donor financing.

3.3      Efficiency
129. PBS supported decentralized service delivery, and the data indicate large gains in the
efficiency of regional and woreda spending, in terms of coverage and access-related measures
(See Annex 3 for full details). For example, the education sector accounts for the largest share of
regional spending, and the rise in primary school enrolment far exceeded the rise in public
spending on primary education during the implementation of PBS I. This led to a substantial fall
in spending per student in real terms (see Table A3.7 of Annex 3) even if performance of quality
measures is more mixed (e.g., see Table A3.9 of Annex 3).
3.4      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
130. Most indicator targets were achieved or surpassed. From among the PDO indicators,
eight out of nine were largely achieved or surpassed, while one was partially achieved due to
implementation delays (see Table 1). The bulk of the PBS funds supported the protection and
promotion of basic services through the block grants of Component 1a, and progress on the key
performance indicators here was very strong. Progress was satisfactory for the indicators for
Components 1b and 2. Deepening of transparency and accountability, supported by Components
3 and 4, is a work in progress, with more mixed performance regarding the indicators. But
important steps have been taken to establish the foundation for long-term improvements in
transparency and accountability. Overall, the progress observed has likely externalities in
improving basic sector outcomes and helping consolidate the long-term process of decentralized
service delivery. Weighing all of the above, the ICR rates the overall outcome as Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development
131. No direct data-driven evidence on poverty or gender impacts was available to assess the
impact of PBS, largely due to absence of recent household or other data that could measure
poverty. However, indirectly PBS almost certainly contributed to the long-run reduction of
poverty through sustaining, and expanding, coverage of basic health, education, clean water and
                                                            26
rural agricultural services. PBS may also have contributed to the narrowing of the gender gap
observed in primary education. Between 2005 and 2009, the net enrolment rate for girls in grades
1-4 and grades 5-8 improved from 65.1 percent to 80.3 percent and 29.4 to 53.3 percent,
respectively. The block grants have also financed the salaries of HEWs. The number of HEWs,
who are mostly female, went from 0.27 per rural kebele in 2004/05 to 2.0 in 2008/09.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
132. PBS has provided significant value added to institutional and systems strengthening in
Ethiopia, especially as the bulk of the funds (all of Components 1a and 1b) were mixed with
Treasury funds and channeled to regions and woredas using existing country systems. PBS has
directly supported capacity building and enhancing of transparency and accountability through
PFM, FTA and SA activities, and through LIG. Component 2 has contributed to improvements
in the procurement, storage and distribution systems for health commodities.
133. Under PBS, the formula for distributing federal block grants across regions was improved.
It shifted from a simplified approach relying on just three parameters (population, development
level and own revenue) to one more oriented toward local needs based on a fiscal equalization
approach, more appropriate to enhancing sub-national service delivery.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
134. As noted above, PBS clearly had a protective effect in particular on regional and woreda
spending. The data also indicate that it had a protective effect on overall public spending and
helped mitigate the macroeconomic and fiscal crisis of 2007/09 by helping to bring in significant
amounts of foreign exchange. Moreover, it is likely that PBS resources, by helping to protect and
expand social services spending at the regional and woreda levels, allowed the government to
channel more of its own resources than it otherwise would have toward new and often pro-poor
capital spending as well as expansion of food security and agricultural programs (see Annex 3).
135. Since PBS finances local recurrent expenditure - mostly salaries of government officials
including teachers, development agents and health workers - the question has been raised as to
whether the project might have contributed to increasing aggregate demand and thereby to the
high inflation observed during the 2007/08-2008/09 period. Such an inference is debatable, given
three findings. First, PBS was implemented during a period of a declining fiscal deficit to GDP
ratio. Second, the average salary of government employees in Ethiopia has declined in real terms
during the last three to four years. And, third, inflation has recently been falling after peaking
around 2008, even though funding from PBS (I and II) has not been reduced.
3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
136. A stakeholder workshop was carried out in Addis Ababa on March 23-24, 2010 with the
participation of about 60 representatives of the federal, regional and woreda governments, CSOs,
donors and the Bank. The workshop addressed the following four themes for each of the five
PBS components: (i) what worked well; (ii) what worked less well with respect to the original
targets set in the project design and why; (iii) if PBS had to be designed and implemented over
again, what would GOE and donors do differently and why; and (iv) what could the Bank and
other donors do differently to make their assistance more effective and timely.
137. The findings and recommendation of this workshop, detailed in Annex 6, largely confirm
the overall findings, assessments and ratings of the ICR. The key findings are incorporated in the

                                               27
Lessons Learned section of this ICR (section 6). Some of the main themes that emerged from the
workshop were the need to ensure government ownership, the importance of appropriate
capacity building activities at all levels, the need to focus now on enhancing service delivery
quality, and the importance of harmonizing donor procedures with government systems.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
138. The risk rating for PBS I was considered to be Substantial at the time it was originally
approved in early 2006, due largely to country-level risks related to governance, transparency
and accountability, uncertainties on the macro-economic situation, and prevailing tensions in
Somali (Ogaden) as well as between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Due to subsequent improvements on
most of these fronts, PBS I was downgraded to Moderate Risk when the Additional Financing
was approved in 2007. At the time of preparation of PBS II, however, the risk was raised again
to Substantial, based especially on two new factors. The first was sustainability, given the
precarious existing macroeconomic imbalances at the time.3 The second was the Charities and
Societies Proclamation passed by Parliament on January 6, 2009, prohibiting certain CSOs ­
those with more than 10% of funding from foreign sources ­ from activity in political
governance and rights-based advocacy, while allowing their engagement in social and economic
development and other charitable purposes defined in the Proclamation. The government had
provided written assurances that this CSO law would not impede implementation of SA activities
in the delivery of basic services, which is a critical aspect of PBS. But concerns remained that
ensuring widespread communication to local authorities of the government's support for SA in
basic service delivery may be challenging. Aside from these two new risks, there were risks
identified related to governance, government capacity, community and CSO capacity, fiduciary
aspects, sector reforms and possible tensions following the 2010 elections.
139. The macroeconomic situation since then has improved significantly for Ethiopia, as for
other countries worldwide.4 Economic growth remains strong, and this should enable the upward
trend in own-revenue financing for basic service delivery to continue, which is important for
sustainability. Since approval of PBS 2, social accountability efforts have focused on evaluating
the PBS 1 activities. While those findings that has just been completed, are largely positive (see
Section 3.2), there has been little additional activity by CSOs and discussions are underway
about design of the second phase of social accountability activities. The signs so far are that
written assurances by the government regarding the CSO law, mentioned above, are being
honored and well communicated. There is still much uncertainty about the eventual fall-out of
the CSO law, but indications point to most CSOs finding ways to adapt to the law in ways that
do not preclude work on SA related to support in poverty reduction, social services and
economic development more widely.
140. While the 2010 elections have now been completed without adverse events, questions
have arisen about the possible politicization of aid through PBS, which could pose a reputational
risk. Given these questions, the PBS program will seek to develop new accountability

3
  For example, the 12-month end-of-period inflation rate was 23.7 percent by the end of March 2009 after reaching a historical
peak of 64 percent in July 2008. International reserves were equivalent to seven weeks of imports of goods and services in
March/April 2009, up from a low of about four weeks at end December 2008.
4
   Real GDP growth rate is expected to be 7.5 percent (IMF forecast) or 9.9 percent (GOE forecast) in 2008/09; (ii) end-of-period
inflation is now much lower at 7.4 percent in March 2010; (iii) Ethiopia's external position continues to improve as shown by a
decline in the current account deficit of about 54 percent relative to last year and an increase in gross international reserves to two
months of import cover in February 2010.

                                                                 28
mechanisms to ensure against the misuse of resources. Further, there continue to be difficulties
in financial reporting that the operation will address.
141. Regarding sustainability, the bulk of PBS (Component 1a) goes toward the Federal block
grants. The GOE surpassed the requirements of the Additionality criterion (see Section 2.2) and
ensured sharp increases in own-revenue financing for the block grants, indicating that
Component 1a is largely sustainable.
142. Given the improvements vis-à-vis the two primary risks identified during the preparation
of PBS II which are regularly monitored, but with new risks arising at the same time, the overall
risk to the development outcome of PBS continues to be Substantial.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
143. The rapid political and macroeconomic deterioration in Ethiopia in 2005/06 and the
withdrawal of direct budget support by donor partners motivated the Bank, donors and GOE to
develop a new instrument quickly to protect basic services to the poor, while supporting the
improved governance and decentralization agenda of the Government of Ethiopia (GOE).
144. The Bank provided project preparation support to GOE through a strong and experienced
core Bank team. Overall Bank performance at this stage demonstrated high responsiveness to the
government and country-specific context and needs, adaptability to a difficult political
environment and the sometimes differing positions of a range of donors, innovativeness in
developing in a very short period of time an instrument that was well suited to the particular
circumstances, and flexibility in moving from PRSC preparation to an innovative Sector
Investment Loan (SIL) in an accelerated timeframe.
145. Strategic relevance and approach. PBS was a core part of the ICAS and of the GOE's
decentralization and improved governance agenda. As mentioned in section 2.1, PBS was very
specifically designed to fit the country's circumstances. Accordingly, the ICR considers the
strategic relevance of this operation as highly appropriate.
146. Timeline of the implementation cycle and size of the proposed Credit. The size of the
IDA Grant was appropriate relative to the government's own resources for basic service delivery
and that of other major donor agencies. But the selection of a two-year SIL instrument, while
appropriate for the core protection of basic services (Component 1) and the uncertainty of the
times, was not ultimately sufficient for Components 2, 3 and 4. With the smoothing out of
political uncertainties and the support from donors and government on the PBS instrument, the
closing date was extended (see Section 1.7).
147. Two issues should be noted in relation to the short duration and need for extension: First,
the duration was stipulated by both Bank management and donor agencies, given that the PBS
principles and mode of operation were regarded as new and untested, with high risk attached.
Contextual uncertainties were also high, and the ICAS duration was only 18 months. PBS was
the central new instrument of the ICAS, and ­ unlike other operations in the portfolio ­ its
duration was deliberately linked to the duration of the ICAS. Second, the total amount of donor

                                               29
resources mobilized and the number of donor partners who joined PBS far exceeded the original
amounts and partnerships at the start of the program. This expansion contributed to the need for
greater time to complete a significantly expanded set of activities.
148. Client orientation. The Bank team, drawing on expertise from multiple sectors and a
long engagement with Ethiopia, had a strong understanding of the Ethiopian political,
macroeconomic and fiscal context as well as of the ongoing GOE governance reforms and
strategy to decrease poverty. The Bank's quick response mitigated the risk of a stalling or
reversing of the country's recent progress in service delivery and in human development.
149. Coordination with other donor partners. PBS both preserved government­donor
relations at a time when they were at risk of being ruptured over the political crisis, largely by
providing a vehicle for donors to continue to finance services that benefited the poor in Ethiopia;
and deepened donor coordination by bringing the key donors together with MOFED, the regions
and line ministries through the JBAR and JRIS reviews.
150. The multi-donor nature of PBS, and the fact that most of the funding from donor partners
went through Bank-administered MDTFs, built on and deepened the Bank's close collaboration
with donors and non-governmental partners in Ethiopia. Consultation with CSOs was carried out
during the preparation of PBS and their inputs were included in the project design.
151. Implementation arrangements and readiness conditions. The IDA team avoided a
parallel implementation structure that could have undermined the mandate of local governments
to deliver basic services. PBS utilized existing government structures and systems, with most of
the funds ­ all of the financing of Components 1a and 1b ­ being mixed with Treasury funds and
flowing through existing country systems.
152. As discussed in more detail in Section 2.1, the urgent need to approve the project in order
to protect service delivery gains demanded a short preparation period. The Bank team was well
aware of some of the implementation challenges that would arise after effectiveness. Rather than
prolong the preparation period and possibly precipitate the very decline in basic services it was
being developed to avert, it was decided that these challenges would necessarily have to be
addressed during implementation through enhanced, on-the-ground implementation support.
153. Risk assessments. The Bank team ranked PBS as a high-risk operation being undertaken
at a time of political uncertainty. Risks were identified and mitigation measures were agreed on.
Accountability issues, like citizens not feeling free to participate in demand-side accountability
activities, were among the highest risks identified. But the high risks produced significant returns.
In particular, significant steps have been taken in the areas of transparency and accountability,
even though not all of the short-term project targets for the transparency and accountability
indicators have been reached.
154. Rating criteria. The ICR rates the IDA performance at the preparation stage as
satisfactory, given that: (i) the Bank was very responsive to Ethiopia's needs in a time of crisis;
(ii) PBS was highly relevant for both the short-term fiscal situation and the long-term process of
decentralization and other improved governance reforms; (iii) PBS was an innovative way to
protect and expand basic services; (iv) donor partners were brought back in an harmonized
fashion to contribute to the process, and trust was rebuilt between donors and GOE; and (iv) PBS
was designed to use government systems.
155.   Based on the above, the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as

                                                30
Satisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision
156. The implementation cycle was under the supervision responsibility of two task team
leaders (TTLs). The tenure of the first one, also in charge of the preparation cycle, was until May
2009 at which time the new TTL took over. This transition was well planned, with the second
TTL being a part of the core team from the start. The second TTL was also the co-TTL for the
latter part of PBS I and the follow-up operation (PBS II), thus ensuring a smooth transition.
157. Initially, the core and wider Bank task team was largely based in Washington DC,
although HQ members spent frequent and lengthy periods in-country. Over time, the team
became largely field-based and provided intensive on-the-ground supervision which was critical
to help address implementation issues (see section 2.2). The first of the two TTLs was based in
Addis Ababa starting in August 2007 and the second one spent extended periods of time there. In
addition, in the latter phase of the implementation period, each component had its own field-
based task leader. The Bank team based in the country office was very supportive in maintaining
a day-to-day dialogue with the GOE and in providing hands-on training and support to
government officials on all aspects of the project, including fiduciary issues. These activities
were enabled by a relatively large, enhanced supervision budget provided by the CMU and
combined with resources from the Bank-executed parts of the PBS MDTFs. The project file
shows that ISRs were updated in the system about once every three and half months, on average.
In general, supervision missions included the appropriate skill-mix needed (see Annex 4).
158. During implementation the Bank team worked consistently to strengthen the
harmonization and collaboration with the other PBS donor partners. The Bank was the
permanent Chair, with a rotating donor co-chair, of the PBS Partners' Coordination Group and
hosted the PBS Partners ' Secretariat established to ensure adequate monitoring, assessment and
coordination of the PBS activities. This included hands-on capacity building in selected areas
where GOE's implementation capacity was seen as especially limited. These efforts entailed
high transaction costs for the Bank team and some of the other donors in the short term, but
brought the benefits of seeing PBS successfully implemented.
159.   The ICR rates the Bank supervision performance as Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
160.   The overall Bank performance is rated as Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
161. The GOE worked hand in hand with the Bank on PBS design and helped to ensure that it
built on their decentralization program and had strong government ownership overall. However,
certain elements of the PBS design and implementation were driven more by the donor partners
than by the government. While the FTA and the SA activities were initially proposed by donor
partners, GOE adopted and adapted these elements as part of its own good governance agenda.
GOE ownership of these activities was the result of serious dialogue on all key dimensions. The
GOE showed that once committed, it would do whatever was necessary to make progress.


                                                31
162. Given the accelerated preparation and approval process, the project files contain limited
information on the government's technical role during the preparation stage. However, the
willingness of MOFED to have the four core PBS principles as a basis to disburse resources
under Component 1, insisting on using government systems, agreeing to include FTA and SA
activities in the agenda and as one of the four core principles, and approving the implementation
of SA pilots by CSOs under an external management agent were all highly commendable. The
inclusion of the accountability activities under PBS was especially commendable given the
hierarchical and top­down tradition of Ethiopian society, and the near-absence of such activities
from the agenda before PBS.
163.   The ICR rates the Borrower performance during the preparation stage as Satisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
164. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, as implementing agency for
Components 1a, 1b and 3 ($355 million, $20 million and $6 million from IDA respectively). The
efforts of MOFED have been instrumental in ensuring the achievement of most of the project
indicator targets. Performance regarding the four core PBS principles (additionality, fairness,
fiduciary responsibility and accountability) was consistently found to be satisfactory at JRISs,
and there is evidence that MOFED followed up on the agreements reached during each JRIS in a
satisfactory manner. In particular, MOFED's intervention ensured that GOE's own-generated
resources allocated to Component 1a substantially increased over time.
165. Similarly, MOFED paid attention to FTA and SA activities in the policy agenda, despite
their newness in the public finance and service delivery systems, and continued supporting their
inclusion during PBS II. Indeed, MOFED played an increasing leadership role in ensuring that
the conditions for implementation of these activities were in place and negotiating with other
parts of government at various levels for their "safe passage."
166. Some activities, however, experienced delays during the implementation period, in
particular for Components 1b (LIG) and 3, as noted in Section 2.2. Even though significant
improvements paralleled project implementation progress, financial management reporting
continued to be an issue until closing. MOFED could have had stronger follow up on safeguards
by the regions and woredas, vis-à-vis the ESMF screening and other safeguards requirements of
Component 1b (LIG), although some detailed pro-active and corrective environmental safeguard
actions are being carried out in 2010 (see Annex 2). The post-procurement audit for LIG has still
not been done. Some of these problems are due to the high turnover of qualified and trained staff,
the understaffing of needed skilled manpower at MOFED for key required PBS-related tasks,
and the still-low capacity of woredas and some regional bureaus in Ethiopia's unfolding system
of decentralization. While MOFED established a PBS Coordination Unit to support
implementation and reporting, the capacity of the Unit remained below what was required and
was heavily reliant on one or two contract staff.
167. Federal Ministry of Health, as the implementing agency for Component 2 ($49 million
from IDA). Due in large part to efforts of the FMOH, performance has been satisfactory
regarding the health performance indicators under PBS I. There were significant initial delays in
procurement, but toward the end of the implementation period procurement progressed quickly
due to strong efforts on the part of FMOH and PFSA, and especially on the part of the State
Minister for Health. All planned procurements were ultimately completed and goods delivered
in-country, within the implementation period. But due to the delays, after the project had closed,
                                               32
the PFSA was still in the process of repackaging some of these goods into health kits to be
distributed to the health centers and posts. Although initial concerns arose, especially in the
quality and timing of the FMR reports, more recently substantial improvements have occurred.
Finally, dated covenants for Component 2 were not always complied with on time.
168. GTZ International Services, the implementing agency for Component 4 was instrumental
in: (i) overseeing 12 pilot projects on SA, which was six more than envisaged, in more woredas
(80) and with the participation of more CSO partners than originally envisaged; (ii)
strengthening engagement of some of the 45 participating CSOs on budget literacy and SA; (iii)
improving the dialogue between GOE and CSOs on SA and basic services delivery issues; and
(iv) improving capacity on SA among participating CSOs and woreda officials from a base of
close to zero to a point where participating CSOs could plan and implement SA activities.
169. On the downside, the two annual audit reports undertaken for Component 4 came out
qualified. The key observations made by the auditors' concerned cut-off issues, budget variances
and missing statements by CSO partners. In addition, the contractual covenant requiring GTZ to
prepare and submit to GOE and donor partners a closing report at the conclusion of their contract
was not upheld. And most significantly, the independent evaluation just completed pointed out a
number of weaknesses in training, provision of guidance, supervision and monitoring of the
CSOs, and concludes that the SA initiative would have delivered a better result had it been
managed by an agency with sufficient expertise and resources in social accountability, training
and capacity building, and participatory budgeting (see also Annex 9). The ICR rates the
implementation performance of GTZ as Moderately Unsatisfactory.
170. Overall implementation performance ratings: While there were some implementation
(and fiduciary) weaknesses regarding Components 1b, 2 and 3 which were implemented by GOE
(MOFED and FMOH), the bulk of the IDA funds ($355 million out of $430 million) and the
bulk of funds from donor partners went to Component 1a (Block Grants) for which
implementation performance was excellent. Achievement towards the PDOs was satisfactory,
with the targets for most key performance indicators achieved or surpassed (see Section 3.2). On
balance, the implementation performance of the Borrower GOE is rated as Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
171. For the Borrower, the overall rating for the preparation stage was satisfactory, and at the
implementation stage was also satisfactory. Thus, according to current ICR rating guidelines, the
overall Borrower performance is rated Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
172. This section focuses on lessons learned from PBS implementation. The question of
whether and when a PBS-type operation could be successfully implemented in other countries is
examined in greater detail in Annex 11.
   a. Size, visibility and the multi-donor nature of PBS has led to enhanced dialogue and
      traction on certain policy issues and activities, in a way that would not have been the case
      if these had been dealt with in the context of many smaller operations. It helped to focus
      joint Bank and development partners discussion with Government, as well as to focus
      government attention on important issues. Because adequate progress across all

   1b, 2, 3 and 4 have benefitted from being a part of PBS rather than being stand-alone
   operations. Similarly, the JRIS and JBAR activities undertaken alongside PBS have been
   a useful tool for fostering improved intra-governmental communication and coordination.
   JRIS/JBARs have provided a forum for enhanced discussion between MoFED and
   sectoral ministries on issues such as budget allocations and utilization at the sectoral
   level, as well as between the Federal Government and the regional governments.
b. During the preparation of PBS, there was a tradeoff between a robust preparation process
   (including fully addressing implementation readiness conditions) and the need to be
   adequately responsive to the immediate fiscal, economic and social needs of the situation.
   While this did result in some delays in implementation of some components, the sense is
   that it often makes sense to prioritize critical and pressing country needs, ensuring that
   there is an adequate risk assessment with appropriate mitigating actions, as well as a
   strong implementation support structure to resolve any implementation bottlenecks that
   may arise.
c. In the early stages of decentralization to local levels in poorer countries like Ethiopia
   where setting up systems and building capacity are critical at the outset, it is acceptable
   for PBS-type operations to aim to expand access and coverage of basic service delivery.
   Efforts to enhance quality should nevertheless be stepped up, through actions such as: (i)
   complimentary programs that support service delivery quality policies; (ii) steps to
   increase discretionary budgets at the regional and woreda levels; (iii) scaling up of
   instruments such as LIG; and (iv) strengthening capacity building at the local level in
   areas such as planning, budgeting, accountability, financial management, procurement
   and safeguards.
d. PBS-type operations should use existing government systems, complemented by
   systematic and comprehensive support to enhance capacity, especially at the local level.
   Efforts must also be made to ensure government ownership. GOE demonstrated strong
   ownership for most PBS activities, contributing to the overall successes observed in the
   development outcomes.
e. PBS has proved to be a good instrument for supporting strengthening horizontal service
   delivery systems at the local level, for broad funding of services, and for the introduction
   and reinforcement of FTA and SA. Nevertheless, the Bank and donor partners need to
   finance an appropriate mix of instruments, where the role of PBS is clearly defined and it
   is not expected to play roles that other instruments could better address. In addition to an
   operation like PBS, there is a need for sector-specific interventions like GEQIP and
   WASH ­ tailored to a context of decentralized service delivery ­ to address the sector-
   specific policy and systemic reforms needed to ensure effective service delivery within
   each sector. In some contexts, a budget support instrument may also help address certain
   issues and reforms that neither a PBS-type instrument nor sector-specific instruments
   may be able to do effectively. See Annex 11 for a full discussion of this.
f. Timelines for financial reporting and audits need to be more flexible in order to better
   adapt to the operational characteristics of a country like Ethiopia. The Bank's timeline
   requirements for financial reporting and annual audits for SILs are not well suited for a
   project like PBS, with broad geographical coverage using country systems in a large and
   recently decentralized country like Ethiopia, with still-weak woreda capacity.

                                            34
   g. Simple steps can and should be taken to facilitate financial management. For example,
      there are currently too many continuous audits and other types of individual project
      reporting requirements across all projects in the woredas; these need to be consolidated
      into a common auditing and reporting exercise. Furthermore, there should be a
      modification to the current practice of sending FMRs/IFRs only after reporting has been
      obtained from all regions and all (about 770) woredas; this often results in delayed
      disbursements. Delays would be reduced if FMRs/IFRs could be sent based on partial
      submissions by the regions and woredas.
   h. Better alignment of the disbursements of donor partners including IDA to GOE's budget
      cycle at the start of the FY is desirable. Among others, greater predictability would be
      desirable as to how much will be disbursed by donors each FY, and resources need to be
      made available in a timely manner, ideally at the start of each FY. One proposal has been
      that the disbursements under Component 1a (supporting the FBG) of any one fiscal year
      should be dependent on the findings of JRISs of the previous fiscal year. This would
      enable the exact amounts of the disbursements to be known before the start of the fiscal
      year, and the first round of disbursements could take place very early in the fiscal year,
      instead of around December as was happening under PBS I.
   i. Successfully supervising a large multi-donor program like PBS, especially with the bulk
      of the donor funding going through Bank-administered MDTFs, requires a dedicated
      country-based staff, an organizational support structure and sufficient resources--far
      more than is typically available for Bank operations--to manage the day-to-day
      transactions and address the project implementation requirements of all the donor
      partners and GOE. This would not have been possible without a sufficiently large amount
      of enhanced supervision budget. The establishment of the PBS Donor Partners'
      Secretariat was also very helpful in this regard.
   j. An evaluation of the Component 4 SA pilots has just been completed, and the next steps
      will depend on the findings and on discussions at the Steering Committee. Some
      preliminary lessons (see Annex 9 for more details) include: (i) the need for a management
      agent with broad SA experience; (ii) the need for extensive training and supervision
      throughout the implementation process to overcome limited knowledge and experience
      by the CSOs on the concept and practice of SA; (iii) inclusion of members of the woreda
      councils and service providers in training is key; (iv) interface meetings reviewing
      assessments of services provided are very useful, allowing service users and providers to
      agree on action plans; (v) stronger links should be established between SA activities and
      government programs focusing on improved governance, including the government's
      efforts in FTA which continues to be supported under PBS II.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
173. This section summarizes GOE's contribution to this ICR (see Annex 7). PBS, although it
was a new instrument and different from other instruments implemented in the country, has
contributed to mobilize the necessary financial and technical resources to protect and to promote
the delivery of basic services and is well suited to Ethiopia's development agenda. PBS allows
increasing block grant transfers from the Federal Government to Regions and from Regions to
woredas. PBS also supported GOE's efforts to promote transparency and accountability. Budget
                                               35
disclosure has become a regular activity at all government levels. The continuous audits provided
opportunities to evaluate PFM capacities at lower levels. The FTA tools are expected to deepen
transparency and accountability at all government levels. Similarly the recruitment of the
Component 4 MA brought new knowledge and built capacity on SA approaches.
(b) Cofinanciers
174. DPs concur with this ICR assessment, including lessons learned and recommendations
(see Annex 8). PBS has, indeed, proved an effective instrument for supporting Government's
core service delivery objectives, deepening the decentralization agenda and laying the foundation
for enhanced citizen participation around the budget processes. Going forward greater focus on
strengthening the M&E systems and enhancing the dialogue with regions and sectoral ministries
not only on access, but also on effectiveness and service delivery outcomes, will be necessary.
(c) Other partners and stakeholders

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      This section describes the outputs of each of the five components included in PBS. The
assessment is primarily based on the Aides-Memoire, ISRs and other related documents/studies that were
prepared during and after the implementation cycle encompassing 10 JRIS missions, the field ICR
mission of February 15-25, 2010 and the stakeholder workshop carried out March 23-24, 2010.

2.      Component 1a ­ Sub-National Basic Services (Block Grants). This component estimated to
cost about US$3,028.33 million (Table A2.2) ended up documenting expenditures amounting to
US$3,855.00 million (Table A2.3), 127.23 percent of the total estimated. Since its inception in 2006, PBS
has provided approximately US$1,090 million to this component from all donors representing about 28
percent of the total, while GOE's own revenue has accounted for the remaining 72 percent (as shown in
Table A2.3). IDA's contribution amounted to US$376 million (about 10 percent of the total).

3.      This component provided financing for the protection and expansion of basic service delivery in
education, health, agriculture and water by sub-national governments through the federal block grant
scheme. Regular monitoring of the implementation progress of this component ensured adherence to the
four core PBS principles agreed with GOE and all donor partners (additionality, fairness, fiduciary
responsibility and accountability) fully explained in the main text of this ICR. Monitoring of the
implementation progress of this component, originally on a quarterly schedule, later on changed to twice
per year, was carried out through the JBARs and JRISs. Release of PBS funds for Component 1 took
place only after the conclusion of successful JBARs and JRISs. Benchmarks were set at each JRIS
review to be achieved before the next review, in line with the four core PBS principles.

4.      Under the principle of additionality, the following two requirements were fully satisfied. First,
GOE was required to maintain, over the life of PBS, its trend growth of 10 percent in own-revenue
financing (outside the one provided by the donor partners) in dollar terms of the federal block grants
allocated to basic service delivery. The data shows that this amount went from a baseline of US$528
million equivalent in EFY97 (2004/05) to US$979 million equivalent (10.021 billion Birr) EFY2001
(2008/09). Including the amount provided by the donor partners, the federal block grant increased from
US$642 million equivalent (5.556 billion Birr) to US$1,567 million equivalent (16.349 billion Birr) in the
same period.

5.      While recognizing that the federal government does not have the mandate to affect decisions
regarding spending at the sub-national level, the second requirement of the additionality core principle
concerned an agreement with the GOE that sub-national spending trends would be monitored under PBS
to confirm whether increases in the block grant transfers were leading to correspondingly greater
spending on basic services. Between EFY1997 (2004/05) the baseline and EFY 2001 (2008/09), the last
year for which there is data before the closing of the grant, the following are changes in sub-national
spending on the basic service sectors: (i) in education from US$292 million equivalent to US$619 million
equivalent (increase of 112 percent); (ii) in health from US$78 million equivalent to US$217 million
equivalent (increase of 178 percent); (iii) in agriculture and natural resources (excluding water) from
US$111 million equivalent to US$240 million equivalent (increase of 116 percent); and (iv) in water
US$24 million equivalent to US$67 million equivalent (increase of 177 percent). Aggregating the above
basic services, the spending increased from US$505 million equivalent to US$1,143 million equivalent
(increase of 126 percent).

6.     The Protection of Basic Services (PBS) program was consistent with the principle of fairness.
Block grant disbursements from the federal government to the regions and from the regions to the
woredas (districts) were made in transparent, fair and rules-based formulae. Additionally, the actual

                                                   39
transfers were about equal or close to their budget allocations. Despite some initial accounting
discrepancies and difficulties that were resolved, the statistical analysis undertaken prior to the JRIS
missions to test the fairness principle confirmed the absence of any systematic deviations in block grant
allocations/disbursements related to political or ethnic factors (measured for example by voting patterns).

7.      The performance regarding the core principles of fiduciary responsibility and accountability was
judged via progress on the PFM and the FTA activities under Component 3 of PBS and the SA pilots
under Component 4. A series of actions concerning these two core principles were agreed at each JRIS to
be achieved by the next JRIS. Adherence to these agreed actions, as well as to the Dated Legal
Covenants related to PFM, FTA and SA, along with fiscal reporting and PBS's audit requirements, were
key parts of the agenda of the JRISs. As further explained in the assessment of Components 3 and 4
below, overall findings of these Joint Reviews and Implementation Support rated the compliance of these
two core PBS principles as either moderately satisfactory or satisfactory.

8.       Under Component 1, there was a gradual phasing out of the formula for the block grant
allocations from the federal government to the regions from an over-simplified approach relying on just
three parameters (population, development level and own revenue) to one more oriented toward local
needs based on a fiscal equalization approach, more appropriate to enhance sub-national service delivery.
What remains to be done in future PBS-type operations is to continue improving the quality and impact of
basic service delivery targeted to reduce poverty and to track the destiny of these expenditures in a more
periodic and systemic fashion.

9.      M&E and Key Performance Indicators: The Financing Agreement has an indicator for the
increase in block grants, which is an intermediate indicator in the PAD, while the Additional Financing
Project Paper (and original PAD) uses a related but different indicator as an outcome indicator: the level
of regional spending on basic services. Both the level of the block grants and the level of basic services
expenditures were systematically monitored by the PBS monitoring and evaluation operation.

10.     As illustrated in Table 2 of section 3.2 and the Data Sheet of the ICR, and as argued in the main
text and in Annex 3, PBS seems to have contributed to the significant progress noted in terms of key
service delivery indicators.

11.      Financial Management: The audit report for Components 1 and 3 for FY07 (2006/07) was
delayed by about six months while the one for FY08 (2007/08) was received on time. The delay for the
first audit report was largely due to a misunderstanding between MOFED and the Bank regarding the
scope and methodology of the audit, due apparently to miscommunication by the Bank team. The audit
reports in both years were clean (unqualified) and various internal control issues and weaknesses stated in
the management letters were rectified.

12.      Timelines for financial reporting and annual audits. The Bank's timeline requirements for
financial reporting and annual audits for SILs are not well suited for a project like PBS, with broad
geographical coverage using country systems in a large and recently decentralized country like Ethiopia,
with still-weak woreda capacity. For Components 1a and 1b, the Bank required: (i) FMRs/IFRs
submitted quarterly, no less than 90 days after the end of each quarter (bi-annual reporting is allowed for
some countries, but not for Ethiopia, because its financial management capacity is considered too weak);
and (ii) annual project audits conducted no less than nine months after the end of the fiscal year. These
were stated as being the maximum allowable time limits under Bank policy, but they are insufficiently
flexible for the context of Ethiopia. More flexible timelines for the annual audits for Components 1a and
1b would be especially helpful. These are audits of regional (for 10 regions) and woreda (for about 770
woredas) expenditures financed from Treasury sources (including PBS). These accounts do undergo the
regular annual general government audit, which is mandated independently of PBS. This latter audit

                                                    40
typically takes place about a year after the end of the fiscal year, sometimes longer.5 If the deadline for
the PBS annual audits were more flexible, this general government audit could be used as the audit of
PBS (Components 1a and 1b). But the PBS requirement of audit submission within nine months of the
end of the fiscal year means that a special audit was done just for PBS (Components 1a and 1b), parallel
to the general government audit process. Aside from being a duplication of efforts, this is not in line with
the principle of using and strengthening existing country systems.

13.    Procurement: Component 1 financed only recurrent costs and no procurement of goods, services
or works were envisaged. It was agreed that any procurement to be undertaken as a recurrent expenditure
of Component 1 would be conducted following local government procurement procedures and rules.

14.     Component 1b ­ LIG. This component was not in the original PBS project and was introduced
as part of PBS's Additional Financing, which became effective in April 2008. The goal of LIG was to:
test recently developed national standards like planning and budgeting, procurement and technical
guidance; (ii) better understand constraints of capital investment at the local level; and (iii) learn from
experience in the pilot woredas to help design and roll out the national LIG. Two outcome indicators
were included in the PAD of the Additional Financing to measure achievement toward these goals. This
pilot was implemented in 51 woredas in five regions. According to Tables A2.2 and A2.3 below, at the
closing of PBS, this component disbursed the totality of US$20 million allocated at the time of approval
of the Additional Financing. IDA was the only financing source as other potential donors voiced their
preference to continue supporting stand-alone capital investment programs with some of the basic sectors.

15.      Although the Additional Financing became effective in April 2008, the first tranche of LIG IDA
funds amounting to US$10 million was delayed for about six months until November 2008, when
agreement was reached between IDA and MOFED on the LIG's Operational Manual and on the FMR
template. The second and last tranche of funds amounting to the remaining US$10 million was released
in May 2009. It is too soon to reflect on overall outcomes and lessons learned from this component. But
significant information has been obtained from a LIG Review done in early 2010 (see Annex 10) where
10 woredas were visited and this has been used to draw on to obtain data on progress for the final
regarding the two outcome indicators for this component ­ see below for more on this.

16.      As already explained in section 2.2 of the ICR, there were several shortcomings with the LIG
implementation. First, woredas viewed LIG resources as a discrete project rather than an increase in their
own capital budget. Second, financial management awareness on the part of the woredas was quite low,
especially with respect to the FMR reporting. Third, some woredas had difficulty finding skilled
manpower to design, implement and monitor projects, needing on many occasions to search the zonal or
regional capitals to find engineers, architects or contractors with sufficient capacity. Fourth, the support
by the regional authorities in having the woredas implement LIG was at best weak and insufficient.
Finally, there were some significant weaknesses regarding safeguards (see next three paragraphs). The
ICR team was informed that all of the above issues are currently being addressed under the enhanced LIG
Component under PBS II.

17.     Future challenges for this component, some being already addressed by PBS II, are to continue:
(i) improving the quality and impact of capital investments for basic service delivery; (ii) capacity
building at the woreda, in particular for improved financial reporting for a more timely release of funds
among other things; (iii) strengthening the technical on-site support by the regional authorities; and (iv)
strengthening the linkages with other sector-related capital investment programs. The LIG is being

  This is the current situation; at the start of PBS, there was a large backlog in the closing of regional and woreda accounts, and
this led to long delays in the timing of the general government audits.

                                                               41
expanded and strengthened under PBS II to 99 woredas (including the 51 of PBS) with a total funding of
US$87 million.

18.     M&E and Key Performance Indicators: Information is now available to assess the two agreed
outcome indicators. With regard to the "quality" indicator, the investment process review carried out
during the field visits confirmed that all 10 woredas had adopted and were implementing the national
standards/systems on planning and budgeting, procurement and financial management, However
environmental screening is still at a preliminary stage with woredas, as a result of orientation given
during the field visits only starting to screen capital investments. This process is expected to be
completed by April 2010. Information from the quarterly FMRs/IFRs submitted by woredas show that
for the "quantity" indicator, 76 percent of EFY 2001 allocation was spent by the 51 woredas and this
surpasses the PAD target of 40 percent. See additional information in Annex 10.

19.     The agreed intermediate outcome for LIG has been met, implying that about 96 percent of the
original 51 pilot woredas under PBS have been trained by MOFED in the operational methodology and
LIG procedures as preparatory activities to improve the quality of capital investment.

20.     Financial Management: With this component, substantial progress was made over time in
financial reporting in particular, but there was still significant scope for improvements towards the end of
the project, especially in the areas of planning and organization and financial management reporting
capacity by the participating woredas. There is scope for strengthening the training provided to the
woredas and the support provided to woredas from the BOFEDs. In addition, there are weak capacity
issues with woredas. See also comments under Component 1a above, also applicable to Component 1b.

21.      Procurement: Component 1b (LIG) included the procurement of small contracts under shopping,
as well as in some cases larger contracts under national competitive bidding. In general, woredas had
difficulties in procurement planning, procurement file management, and procurement of works. LIG's
dated (legal) covenant concerning the delivery of a post-procurement audit by May 31, 2009 covering a
minimum of 25 percent of the pilot LIG woredas, has not yet been met at the time of writing this ICR, but
suitable consultants for the work had been selected and the contracting was about to take place.

22.      Safeguards (Environmental and Resettlement): The Additional Financing required that
Component 1b (LIG) be implemented in accordance with the ESMF and RPF safeguards prepared for the
purposes of the construction of small-scale civil works under this sub-component. Most of the LIG
projects involved small-scale and environmentally benign civil works, and thus, an environment and
social safeguard report was not required. In addition, the woredas were supposed to use a standard design
for all construction, which comes from the region and has environmental safeguards embedded in it.

23.      There were some shortcomings with respect to the safeguards that were agreed to for the LIG
including (i) the JRIS field visits have confirmed a lack of awareness by local and regional officials on
their need to comply with the ESMF and RPF, thus no staff had been assigned to carry out the envisaged
tasks at the local level; (ii) the procedures to comply with the ESMF and RPF were included in the LIG
Operational Manual, which was approved by GOE six months after effectiveness of the Additional
Financing, but they were not given proper attention by federal, regional and woreda governments since no
orientation/training was provided; (iii) at the time of the closing of PBS I, MOFED had not yet appointed
an LIG environmental and social management specialist to follow up on the compliance of the ESMF and
RPF among participating woredas, provide technical support when required and ensure integration of
environmental and social issues into the LIG as needed; (iv) the Annual Review of ESMF Implementation
has been only partially completed, but no Annual Environmental Audit took place under PBS, with the
first one now being considered under PBS II; and (v) the Environment and Natural Resources Donor
Working Group was never activated during PBS.

                                                    42
24.     Some detailed pro-active and corrective environmental safeguard actions have been carried out by
GOE in 2010. For example, an LIG environmental and social management specialist has been hired (in
April 2010), and an action plan is being implemented in which all woredas are being given orientation on
screening of projects. These woredas are now screening all projects implemented in EFY01 and to be
implemented in EFY 2002 and EFY 2003.

25.     Component 2 ­ Health MDG Performance Facility. According to Tables A2.2 and A2.3
below, this component expected to cost about US$135.7 million, ended up documenting expenditures
amounting to US$124.85 million, 92 percent of the total estimated. For reasons already explained in
section 2.2 of the ICR, this is the only component whose trust fund has been extended to the end of
December 2010 to disburse the totality of available funds.

26.      Even though this component was managed at the federal level by the FMOH, its function was to
procure and transfer good quality and cost-effective medical inputs to health facilities and workers, an
essential element to improve the quality of health services under a decentralized system. Furthermore, the
value of Component 2 transfers may have been up to a third of a typical woreda health budget, clearly
supporting local level basic services. This aimed at providing predictable financing for those critical
inputs for primary health service delivery that could not be efficiently funded at woreda level through the
federal block grant supported under Component 1. In addition, it also aimed at: (i) supporting capacity
building at the FMOH, the implementing agency; (ii) supporting the acquisition and distribution of
critical health commodities; and (iii) strengthening of procurement and logistics.

27.     Despite significant initial delays in the procurement process, all planned procurements were
completed by the closing date. This component procured, among others: 3.2 million ITNs; 27 million
doses of coartem (an antimalarial); 21.1 million doses of long-lasting injectable contraceptives for women
and 13.3 million doses of other types of women's contraceptives; and equipment for 7,000 health posts
and 1,999 health centers (out of about 15,022 and 3,200 respectively in total).

28.     At the time of writing this ICR, almost the totality of all procured health commodities goods
contracted under PBS during 2009 (vaccines, contraceptives, essential drugs and medical equipment for
health centers and health posts) had been delivered to the PFSA and were in the process of being
repackaged into kits for health centers and health posts. Distribution of these packages has been already
made to the Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute, the five teaching universities and 966
health centers and health posts (49 percent of the universe). The ICR team was informed by the FMOH
that by the end of June 2010, the remaining 1,023 health centers and the rest of the health posts would
receive these packages. The storage, packaging and distribution activities of these health-related
commodities and goods has been a welcoming learning experience by doing.

29.     After the close of the project, there was an unused balance of about US$12.6 million in the
MDTF associated with this component, due mainly to: (i) fluctuation of the Birr against the basket of
currencies included in the SDR; (ii) investment income generated by the unused funds in the trust fund for
this component; and (iii) new unanticipated contributions from the European Community that arrived in
December 2009. To allow the program to utilize this balance, agreement was reached between the donors
financing Component 2 and GOE to extend the closing date of the corresponding trust fund (TF56942) to
December 31, 2010.

30.      Procurement: For Component 2, the findings of the procurement capacity assessment undertaken
for the FMOH during preparation indicated that the ministry's organizational setup was not conducive to
handling procurement activities attuned to IDA's procedures. Thus, all the donors including IDA agreed
that FMOH needed to appoint a qualified procurement agent (a dated covenant that was to be achieved by
December 2006). From the start, FMOH did not have ownership of the (prolonged) process and the

                                                    43
procurement agent, after substantial delay, was contracted in February 2008. The hiring of the agent by
the Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) method was also delayed due to the initially weak
procurement capacity within FMOH. (The QCBS method, when applicable, is considered to be the "gold
standard" for procurement, but can be quite complicated to handle for entities with weak procurement
capacity.)

31.      The procurement agent was charged with two main responsibilities: (i) carrying out the
international competitive bidding packages for the procurement of certain health-related goods; and (ii)
building procurement capacity within the FMOH. But due to a lack of ownership and conflicting roles
assigned to it, the procurement agent did not perform as expected. A major complicating factor was that
the working arrangements, tasks and division of responsibilities between the agent with the FMOH as
identified during the appraisal of PBS needed to be significantly revised within a year given a
comprehensive Business Process Re-Engineering (BPR) exercise initiated by the ministry, affecting all its
departments and autonomous operational entities. Furthermore, and critically, since FMOH did not, from
the start, have "ownership" of the procurement agent concept, it was initially reluctant to work with the
agent.

32.      FMOH communicated to the ICR team that they had recognized their weakness in procurement
capacity, but instead of having this agent, they would have much preferred capacity building of their own
procurement structures ­ initially the Pharmaceutical Supply and Logistics Department of FMOH, and
then the Pharmaceutical Fund and Supply Agency (PFSA), an autonomous procurement and distribution
agency created as a result of the BPR process. Furthermore, the two main tasks of the procurement agent
­ carrying out procurement of certain items, and building procurement capacity in FMOH ­ appeared to
be inconsistent with each other, and there appeared to be little incentive for the agent to engage in true
capacity building since this could limit the length of its own usefulness and its own contract. The agent
also turned out to make several mistakes when handling the procurement of the packages assigned to it,
resulting in a lack of confidence in it on the part of FMOH.

33.      The initial delay in hiring the procurement agent led, in turn, to overall delays in the procurement
process for other items. In the first year and a half of PBS I, most of the procurements that took place
were those handled by UNICEF and UNFPA on behalf of FMOH. Although these procurements
ultimately went well, there were initially some problems and delays here too, because certain contractual
provisions and clauses normally required in all supplier contracts financed by the Bank are not permitted
by these UN agencies. These include the right to impose sanctions in the event of fraud and corruption,
and the right to audit records and accounts. Special waivers of these requirements had to be obtained
from the Managing Director of the Bank to proceed with procurements handled by UNICEF and UNFPA,
which took time. More recently, global agreements have been reached between the Bank and these two
UN agencies, so that special waivers are no longer necessary, as long as a predetermined contract format
is used. But this development came too late to be of use for PBS I.

34.      Despite the initial problems, nonetheless, with the support of the procurement agent through 2008
(end of contract) and by the intensive "hands-on" efforts of the Bank country office procurement staff and
Bank task team, as well as by the FMOH/PFSA team and the State Minister of Health, the FMOH
satisfactorily addressed the procurement issues and acquired the required health commodities.

35.      M&E and Key Performance Indicators: Some Component 2 indicators that were a part of the
original PBS were revised at the time of appraisal and Negotiations of the Additional Financing because it
was not possible to track changes in these indicators within the implementation period. This is because
progress on these indicators required population-based surveys and could only be measured once every
five years via Demographic and Health Surveys. The indicators in these cases were modified to allow for
measurement using administrative data that were collected on a regular basis.

                                                     44
36.      As a result of the activities financed by Component 2, the health spending at the sub-national
level under Component 1 and in collaboration with other efforts, the health sector has managed to reach
its performance indicator targets in almost all areas and surpass them in some instances (as shown in
section 3.2 of the ICR).

37.     Financial Management: With this component, there were issues with financial reporting.
Substantial progress was made from one fiscal year to the next in financial reporting. For example,
FMRs/IFRs were initially submitted with a delay of several months. But with the help of additional staff
hired, FMOH has improved its performance regarding these FMRs/IFRs drastically; reports were largely
submitted on time towards the end of the project. Still, was significant scope for improvements towards
the end of the project.

38.      The audit reports for Component 2 for FY07 and FY08 were submitted on time. The FMOH took
corrective actions to address some issues in the FY007 management letter, mainly related to a lack of
adequate reporting and tracking at lower levels of the supply chain for the commodities distributed in the
first year of PBS. This was, in turn, due partly to gaps in reporting and record-keeping on the part of
UNICEF and UNFPA, who were in charge of the procurement and much of the distribution of the
commodities procured in the first year. The FY08 audit noted no major management letter issues, but a
follow-up study was nevertheless conducted in late 2009 to help strengthen the commodity supply chain.
Because Component 2 is still active due t o the extension of the closing date of the corresponding trust
fund, a last audit covering up to December 31, 2010 will be due by June 30, 2011.

39.     Under Component 2, two advances given to UNFPA for the procurement of contraceptives were
both documented (i.e., expenditure statements given) with delays of several months or more. In both
cases, the total amount of the advance exceeded the amount finally spent, and the difference was
supposed to have been returned; again, long delays ensued.

40.      Safeguards (Environmental and Resettlement): Environmental safeguards for Component 2 were
triggered with respect to medical waste management and handling/spraying of insecticides. At the time of
appraisal, the Bank team reviewed the FMOH's existing Guidelines on the Handling and Disposal of
Waste in Health Facilities, Guidelines for Malaria Vector Control and Guidelines for Indoor Residual
Insecticide Spraying. These were found to be appropriate and sufficient to provide the required
safeguards. In addition, a Vector Management Plan was required prior to procuring any insecticide under
Component 2 for malaria control purposes.

41.     The project files include reports of field supervision missions confirming that the Guidelines were
being followed at the health centers and health posts of the localities that were visited. Two recent reports
consisted of findings from: (a) a visit to Adama and Dugda woredas, two highly malarious woredas in
Oromiya region; and (b) a visit to the following five woredas with LIG projects: Wegera in Amhara, Kiltu
Kara and Gedeb Assasa in Oromiya, Odu Buldiglu in Benishangul Gumuz, and Angacha in SNNPR.

42.      The first of these reports found that the guidelines were being followed closely followed. The
report was comprehensive, and examined various aspects of insecticide spraying, storage and handling of
insecticides, and medical waste management. The second report was less comprehensive. It found that
the proper procedures regarding malaria control, insecticide spraying and medical waste management
were generally being followed, though not consistently across the board in all of the woredas examined.
Furthermore, not all of the woredas examined had copies of the relevant guidelines, even though they
were largely aware of and following the proper procedures.

43.   Component 3 ­ Financial Transparency and Accountability. According to Tables A2.2 and
A2.3 below, this component estimated to cost about US$13.91 million, ended up documenting

                                                     45
expenditures amounting to US$10.54 million, 76 percent of the total estimated at appraisal. This shortfall
is mainly due to delays in starting implementation activities, especially with respect to the FTA stream of
the component.

44.     To attain its stated goals, this component included the following two major streams: (i) the PFM
supporting MOFED's efforts to enhance the capacity of regional and zone administrations on core
financial functions and operations; and (ii) the FTA supporting the preparation and implementation of
tools for both government and CSOs to improve citizens' knowledge and understanding of the public
budget process and opportunities for engagement in the budget process, as well as initiatives to increase
the accountability of local service providers (schools, local health clinics, agricultural development
workers, etc.) to citizens. The FTA stream was also meant to support the implementation of a household
Financial Transparency and Accountability Perception Survey (FTAPS).

45.       The PFM stream activities progressed well, including:

      a. Support to OFAG. Two specialized training programs were conducted to enhance OFAG. To
         date, 12 rounds of the continuous audit have been undertaken covering almost 95 percent of all
         the woredas (730 out of 770). These continuous audits have provided fiduciary assurance by
         highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the government financial management system at the
         sub-regional level. Procurement of specialized audit software, as well as of computers (50
         laptops and 14 desktops), peripheral equipment and 14 vehicles was also undertaken. In some
         cases, OFAG carried out follow-up audits to check if prior audit findings were addressed.

      b. Enhancing Accounting and Information Technology Capacity. Under this activity, MOFED hired
         103 accountants (more than the 50 mentioned in the Financing Agreement) and 65 information
         technology staff on a contractual basis to strengthen financial reporting capacity at MOFED,
         BOFED, as well as the zones and woredas.

      c. Training of BOFEDs and WOFEDs on Physical and Financial Reporting Systems has been
         provided to enhance the capacity of these bureaus and offices in preparing the financial and
         physical reports required by PBS, including the LIG. Albeit these efforts, submission of timely
         financial managing reports of good quality continues to be an issue in need of further addressing.

      d. Participatory Budgeting. Under this activity, support is being provided for capacity building of
         selected MOFED, BOFEDs and city administrators on participatory budgeting strategies and
         methodologies, including attending related workshops in other countries.

46.    On the other hand, the following FTA activities, in particular those related to the use of the four
FTA tools developed under this component, have shown less progress than the ones under PFM stream.

      a. The prototype guide for the Development, Piloting and Refinement of Layperson's Guides on
         Budget Process (tool #1) has been prepared, validated, approved and disseminated by the
         government to regions for customization.

      b. The prototype templates for the Design of Laypersons' Public Budget and Expenditure (tool #2),
         for the Disclosure of Service Delivery Facilities (tool #3) and for Media Disclosure of Regional
         and Woreda Public Budget Information (tool #4) have been prepared, validated, approved and
         disseminated by the government to regions for customization and use. Separate templates are
         being produced for regional public budget information and for woreda public budget information.



                                                     46
    c. Budget literacy training has been piloted to 1,500 participants drawn from five regions and
       workshops on FTA tools provided to 450 key citizens in five regional states. Participants include
       council members, staff sector offices, CSOs and journalists.

    d. After some delays the household Financial Transparency and Accountability Perception Survey
       (FTAPS) work was finally undertaken jointly by a group of international and national consultants.
       The setback was due to some delays in the consultant selection process and disagreement over the
       methodology used to measure financial transparency and accountability. The final report was
       released by the GOE in June 2009, well behind schedule (this report was expected by April
       2008). A second follow-up survey will be carried out in the first semester of 2011 under PBS II.

47.      M&E and Key Performance Indicators: Regarding the Results Framework for Component 3,
there was one outcome indicator under PBS I, requiring an improvement in citizens' understanding of
public budget processes as measured by quantitative surveys. The baseline and final values for this
indicator were to be obtained from an initial and follow-up FTA Perceptions Survey (FTAPS), both
conducted during PBS I. At the time of the Mid-Term Review in early 2008, the first FTAPS still had not
been contracted out. Thus it was decided to modify this outcome indicator and split it into two: (i)
"Citizens have improved access to public budget information at federal, regional and woreda and sub-
woreda levels," without a quantitative survey needed to track changes (see Data Sheet PDO Indicator 2);
and (ii) to keep up the pressure, an additional PDO indicator was added whose targets would be fully
achieved only if the first FTAPS was finalized by April 2008 and the second follow-up FTAPS would be
under way by May 2009 (Data Sheet PDO Indicator 3). The Additional Financing Agreement retained
the original PAD outcome indicator rather than the two split indicators in the Project Paper.

48.   Financial Management: There were no major issues regarding financial management for this
component.

49.      Procurement: Component 3 supported the procurement of goods and services. Contracts for all
these acquisitions were below US$50,000 and were to be carried out by regional and local levels under
the shopping method. Even though there were delays in preparing the technical specifications for the
selection of qualified consultants to develop the four transparency tools; over time, local expertise was
built, and almost all goods and services planned under Component 3 were procured and
distributed/rendered accordingly.

50.      Component 4 ­ Social Accountability (SA). According to Tables A2.2 and A2.3 below, this
component estimated to cost US$6 million ended up documenting expenditures amounting to US$7.48
million, 24.7 percent more of the total estimated. This increase is explained mainly by the fact that this
pilot was implemented in 12 CSOs instead of the 6 originally planned at appraisal. About 75 percent of
the total was allocated for grants to the 12 participating CSOs' activities, 4 percent for capacity building
and training and 21 percent for management and coordination.

51.      At the closing of the first PBS Grant Financing Agreement in June 30, 2009, 12 lead CSOs had
completed implementing their pilot projects on SA in about 80 woredas (about 11 percent of the totality
in the country). The pilot projects focused on the four basic services sectors: education, health, water and
sanitation, and agriculture. However, since the outputs of Component 3 concerning the laypersons
guidelines and templates on public budgets were not finalized and approved at the time of SA pilot
project implementation, the envisioned dissemination and testing of these tools by CSOs could not be
done. Instead, CSO's relied on the adaptation of SA tools that were quite untested in Ethiopia but
represented good international practice, like, inter-alia: Right Based Approach, Community Score Card,
Citizens Report Card and Participatory Budgeting as well as Focal Group and Interface Discussions and
Participatory Planning and Monitoring.

                                                    47
52.       Though SA was new for most of stakeholders, the pilot projects achieved the expected outcomes
by adapting best practices of SA and creating a learning initiative among participating citizens. The
following are some examples of the areas of dialogue undertaken between citizens and local providers of
basic services: water--water pumps repaired and better water distribution; sanitation--garbage dumping
facilities and latrines; health--drug supply, sanitation, extended working hours, equipments and child
delivery service arranged; education--text books, separate toilet for girls, furniture and additional tutorial
sessions; and agriculture fertilizer and seeds, training for farmers and veterinary assigned. There were a
number of positive findings from the pilots, as well as challenges and lessons learned. These are detailed
in full in Annex 9.

53.      There were a number of challenges regarding implementation of this component. First, it took
longer than expected to start implementation, due to the following: (i) the length of the Bank-managed
procurement process to select the management agent (MA); (ii) the arrangements were not typical and led
to longer contract negotiations with the MA; and (iii) the recipient-executed MDTF required more time to
set up than anticipated. Second, delays under Component 3 precluded timely delivery of the laypersons
guidelines and templates on public budgets to the MA, which stifled the envisioned dissemination and
testing of these tools by CSOs.

54.      Third, there were some delays in the direct transfer of funds from the MDTF to the lead
participating CSOs, because donors had not yet allocated sufficient funds for the corresponding MDTF
and because of GTZ's lack of appropriate preparation of disbursement requests. Also, due to lack of
sufficient capacity, some CSOs were not able to provide consistent and timely FMRs/IFRs, thus further
delaying the submission of consolidated reports to the Bank for the release of additional required funds.
Fourth, there were some weaknesses in financial management as well as training, supervision and
monitoring on the part of the MA (see Annex 9).

55.     And fifth, the Charities and Societies Proclamation of January 2009 could risk constraining the
effectiveness and sustainability of the FTA and SA components under future PBS operations, although
mitigation measures are in place. (See Annex 9 for more details on these issues and on further
challenges.)

56.    M&E and Key Performance Indicators: Regarding SA, the targets for both project indicators
were achieved. In particular, one of the targets was to implement 6 SA pilots; in the end 12 were
implemented.

57.     Financial Management: The two financial audit reports for Component 4 (for FY07 and FY08)
were qualified, even though GTZ responded to all the observations made and followed up with corrective
measures. The trust fund for this component closed on June 30, 2009 and required a last audit for the
"grace period" (July 1-October 31, 2009) when disbursements could still be made for activities completed
before the closing date. This last audit was finally completed and submitted in April, 2010.

58.     Procurement: Although IDA did not finance Component 4, since it was supported by a trust fund
administered by the Bank, Bank procurement rules and procedures applied. About 75 percent of the total
budget allocated to this component consisted of grants to the 12 participating CSOs. No procurement
issues were reported.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

I.   Introduction
1.      The Protection of Basic Services (PBS) I primarily supported decentralized service delivery in
Ethiopia. The bulk of the financing, under Component 1a, supported block grants (providing untied
funding) to regional and woreda governments. This Annex provides economic and financial analysis
focusing on decentralization and decentralized service delivery in Ethiopia, and the role of PBS in
supporting this. Note that much of this annex is drawn from Dom, Lister and Antoninis (2010). The
Annex is based on analysis of the best data available on public expenditures and on service delivery,
complemented by a review of qualitative evidence and visits to the four regions which led
decentralization (Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR and Tigray ­ the 4DRs ­ account for more than 85 percent of
Ethiopia's population.)

2.       Before proceeding, it should be underlined that all of the budget and spending data below reflect
allocations/spending from on-budget Treasury sources only. Data on spending from other sources is not
included, largely because of the difficulty in obtaining disaggregated data on spending (especially at the
regional and woreda level) from other sources (e.g., Specific Purpose Grants, off-budget spending,
community contributions ­ see below). In the case of Specific Purpose Grants, analysis is complicated by
the fact that in most cases, the entire amount of the grant appears in the federal budget, even though the
spending occurs in fact at the regional and woreda levels. When spending from these other sources is
included, the picture may change substantially in many cases, and this is an important caveat to be noted.

II. Trends in Spending on Basic Services at Different Levels of Government

3.      The past 10 years have seen rapid economic growth in Ethiopia, but public expenditures have
grown less rapidly. As a share of the fast-rising GDP since 2002/03, public spending has decreased
substantially from 23.6 percent in 2003/04 to 18 percent in 2009/10. This has unavoidably affected the
Poverty Targeted Expenditure (PTE) sectors, in terms of spending as a share of GDP. As a proportion of
the general government budget, the PTE sectors have received consistently high and rising allocations
(though with a slight flattening toward the end of the period). But total spending on the PTE sectors as a
proportion of the country's GDP declined between 2004/05 and 2008/09, as shown in Figure 3.1 below
(although it was budgeted to increase again in 2009/10).

4.      Against this difficult background, there have been some fluctuations but overall the shares of
total spending going to decentralized levels have held up and even increased (See Table A3.1 below).

Source: World Bank/MOFED data.
Note: * The data for the years 2006/07 and 2007/08 may be problematic as it was not possible to ascertain how many of the
regions had reported including the breakdown between regional bureau and woreda levels, and this number could differ for the
two years. From 2008/09 onward all regions reported with the breakdown.



5.       The story behind the hiccup in the regional share trends for 2005/06 is noteworthy. The 2005/06
budget was allocating a smaller share to regions. In the event, as aid resources were scarce that year
due to the withdrawal of budget support, the government protected the regional transfers over
other expenditures, which resulted in (i) a 100 percent budget execution for the regional level for that
year and (ii) a share of actual expenditure greater than that of the previous year and also the subsequent
year, in which PBS funding had become available. The higher budget shares going to the regional
level after 2005/06 (including on the capital side) may plausibly be linked to PBS. In turn, the lower
share in 2009/10 reflects the crunch felt by the government as its overall public sector purchasing power
is eroded by inflation and it has adopted a more conservative fiscal stance, while incompressible priorities
have emerged at the federal level (e.g., higher education).


                                                            52
 6.       More funds are being spent at decentralized levels: the flows to decentralized levels have
 increased not only in real terms (0) but in real per capita terms (0). Ethiopia's population is growing
 fast so that even maintaining per capita public spending is an achievement. Per capita analysis is
 complicated by discrepancies between the 2007 census and previous population projections but the
 overall picture is that real per capita on-budget expenditures at regional level have grown (by 2.5 percent
 per annum) since 2001/02 and this has been true too at woreda levels in all 4DRs (Table A3.3). In turn,
 basic services budgets at regional and woreda levels have also increased in real terms and in real per
 capita terms.

 7.       Total (general government 6 ) expenditure on basic services sectors (education, health and
 agriculture and rural development including natural resources) increased in real terms (by 12.5 percent)
 between 2002/03 and 2009/10 (see Table A3.4). The share of general government expenditures on basic
 services sectors also grew. Federal spending on the basic services sectors grew rapidly7 but in real terms
 total basic service budgets at the consolidated regional and woreda levels have also gone up and real per
 capita budgets for basic services at these levels has increased too.

8.       The most important finance source for regions is the discretionary transfer from the federal
government to the regional governments or the block grants, which is known as the "federal subsidy" and
is directly augmented by PBS Component 1a. In turn, the main source of woreda finance is a similar
discretionary transfer from the regional government. Formulas for the discretionary transfers have
become more transparent, both at federal and regional levels, and there have been shifts at both the
federal as well as the regional level toward improved formulae for distributing the block grant resources
to regions (for the federal block grant) and to woredas (for the regional block grant).

9.      Other than the block grants, significant resource flows to the regional and woreda governments
include: (i) own revenues; (ii) loans and assistance earmarked for specific projects (through various
channels); (iii) Specific Purpose Grants (SPGs), including aid funding in most of them; (iv) expenditures
undertaken by higher levels on behalf of lower levels, with flows in kind rather than finance (PBS
Component 2 ­ the procurement of health inputs ­ is a significant example); and (v) community
contributions. However, there is a relative lack of reliable information on these complementary flows,
and as a result most detailed analysis tends to focus on the block grants.

10.      Non-discretionary resource flows appear to have grown more than the discretionary block
grant (although both of course have grown rapidly). There are not enough data to say precisely how
the composition of resources available to decentralized governments evolved in terms of proportions of
the various resources (block grants, own revenue, other on- and off-budget resource flows). However,
there is evidence that (i) non-block grant resources may be considerable at woreda level ­ and that this

                                                       54
can be very variable across woredas (see Box 3.1); and (ii) the volume of Specific Purpose Grants (SPGs)
as a particular kind of non-discretionary resources, is increasing more rapidly than the volume of
discretionary resources.

                    Box A3.1. PBS Secretariat Review of Woreda "Off-Budget" Resources
 This review, conducted in 2008, looks at different types of non-Treasury and off-budget resources flowing to
 the woreda level, namely: spending done at regional level, loans and grants, community contributions, NGO
 contributions, UN and global fund flows, and Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), in Tigray, Amhara and
 Oromia.
 The paper highlights that (i) in all three regions, most of the externally financed capital is regionally managed
 so doesn't show on woreda budgets even though arguably much of it is for services under woreda mandates;
 (ii) there is not much coordination and little known on how PSNP resources are being spent, but they are large;
 (iii) there is no information at all on in-kind flows of resources (including PBS Component 2 health
 commodities); (iv) based on BOFED estimates in Amhara, as much as about half of the total assistance to
 regions could be off-budget.
 Making various assumptions to estimate the orders of magnitude found in the different regions for these
 different resource flows, the paper concludes that there could be as much as 30-40 percent of resources
 available at woreda level which are `off-woreda budget.'
 Making further assumptions (based on partial data) about how various resource flows contribute to different
 natures of expenditure (salary, O&M and capital), the paper concludes (cautiously) that if all off-budget
 resources are taken into account, roughly 34 percent of woreda spending could be on capital investment, and
 12 percent to O&M. Community contribution and PSNP would each account for a third of the total capital
 budget of woredas, estimated in this way. Clearly, these very rough estimates completely change the picture of
 woreda level spending compared to when only woreda budgets are considered.

III. Impact of PBS on Spending and Service Delivery
11.      Breaking the period since the start of woreda-level decentralization (2002/03 onward) into two
shows that on average, in real terms budgets grew less fast after 2005/06 (the start of PBS) than in the
first part of the period (Table A3.2). But the data also suggest that the introduction of PBS not only
mitigated the general pressure on expenditures, but did so more clearly for the regional level. So
while the general government budget grew only by 1.6 percent per annum in real terms since 2005/06, at
the regional level budgets increased on average by 3.2 percent (and 6.5 percent for the recurrent budget).
A similar pattern is observed when one looks at the basic services sectors only, in aggregate (Table A3.5).

12.      Individually, the trends in terms of real per capita budgets at regional and woreda levels have
been rather volatile but there has been an overall increase in real terms over the 2001/02­2009/10 period
in all three basic service sectors at the consolidated regional and woreda levels (Table A3.5), except in
agriculture (including natural resources). In education and health, the data show an acceleration in real
per capita spending from 2006/07 onward, just after PBS was approved (which was in May 2006),
suggesting again a protective effect of PBS on these sectors in particular. The reduction in real per capita
spending on agriculture does not take into account the substantial increases in funding going to the sector
over this period via specific purpose grants like the Productive Safety Nets Program (PSNP) and the Food
Security Program (FSP).

Note: It was not possible to include 2001/02 in the analysis as data on federal capital allocations are not available.


13.     These observed protective effects of PBS on regional spending are likely due in part to the
additionality criterion whereby the federal government made a commitment under PBS I to
increase the federal block grant (to regions) financed from its own sources by at least 10 percent
every year in dollar terms. Ultimately, in fact, the increases in the block grant exceeded what was
required by the additionality criterion by a significant amount, and this certainly contributed to the
patterns observed since 2005/06 and shown in the above tables, as well as Table A3.6 which shows the
evolution of federal block grants to the regions over the lifetime of PBS. Note that the share of the total
block grant financed from the government's own sources remained roughly constant at about a third,
while the total increased substantially over the PBS I period.

14.      Would GOE have increased the block grant transfers as much without the additionality criterion?
The balance of opinion among donors in Ethiopia, and many government officials, is that the attention
focused upon the block grants by PBS, the JBARS and the additionality criterion almost certainly resulted
in the grants being protected at a time of budgetary contraction following the 2008 macroeconomic crisis,
and probably to them being increased more than they would have been otherwise.

15.     Woreda block grants (which is a sense are more relevant for the purposes of delivering basic
services - at least in the four main regions) have increased at about 30 percent p.a. in nominal terms
(about 6 percent p.a. in real terms) during the PBS period, and have remained fairly constant at about
62 percent of total public spending by the regions, suggesting the that the regional governments are not
unduly holding back increased resources for their own use.

16.      In the case of the health sector, aside from providing additional resources through the block
grant for regional and woreda governments under Component 1a, Component 2 has financed large
amounts of federal purchases of critical health commodities for distribution to lower levels (e.g.,
insecticide-treated bed nets, vaccines, contraceptives, anti-malarial medications, and equipment for health
posts and centers).

17.     The protective effect of PBS on spending, especially at the regional and woreda levels,
certainly had an impact on protecting the trends in service delivery and in attaining the MDGs that
had been observed at the time PBS was developed, and which was threatened by the withdrawal of
budget support in 2006. These trends are examined in the next two sections.

18.     This section has focused on the impact of PBS on spending on basic services. Later on in this
annex, impacts of PBS along other dimensions are examined: on capacity building as well as transparency
and accountability at decentralized levels (Section VII) and overall financing and other impacts (Section
VIII).

IV. Role of Targets for Basic Service Delivery

19.      The government has set ambitious targets for expanding basic service delivery at lower
levels, and these have lead to large increases in the relevant types of staffing to be financed through
regional and especially through woreda budgets. This is illustrated in 0, which demonstrates that
recent rapid growth in woreda-level staffing as the result of these targets and policies, often set at the
federal level. The figure focuses on the growth in numbers of Health Extension Workers (HEWs), kebele
managers and development agents (DAs) as well as teachers. As an example of federally set targets, all
rural kebeles (communities) are required to have two HEWs each and three DAs each.

20.     These and other targets have undoubtedly led to enhanced results on the ground in terms of
certain specific service delivery indicators especially those related to enhancing access, but there are
indications that quality may have suffered, and resources available for capital and non-salary
spending remain constrained. Below, data are provided to show how several indicators of access to
basic services have improved very substantially over the last several years, for example, education
enrolment rates. But the picture regarding indicators of quality is mixed; some quality-related indicators
have actually disproved. For example, there has been a contraction in per student spending at the regional
level: regional education per capita budgets have remained roughly constant or have shown small
increases over the past five years, while enrolment rates have expanded rapidly (see Table A3.7).

21.      The fiscal space available for capital and non-salary recurrent (O&M) spending from on-
budget resources remains constrained, which in turn impacts the quality of spending and outcomes.
This affects in particular the basic service sectors (see Table A3.8 for examples of this) and it is caused in
part to the rapidly increasing salary needs, due in turn to the ambitious targets referred to above. But
there is an important caveat here: off-budget flows of resources at the woreda level, including community
contributions, are highly significant (see Box A3.1), and can substantially change the picture that emerges
when only on-budget flows are considered. Unfortunately, the data on off-budget resources is scarce,
making it difficult to incorporate this into analysis.




                                                                       58
22.      The good news is that, whereas teachers' numbers are bound to continue to increase as
enrolment continues to expand, the numbers of DAs, HEWs and kebele managers should stabilize
around those estimated for 2009/10 since the targets for these personnel have been fully or almost
fully met. Provided woreda budgets keep expanding, and all other conditions being equal, this should
mean that there would be increasing space in woreda budgets in future for non-salary recurrent and
capital spending, which should in turn positively impact quality.

V. Evolution in Service Delivery Indicators and Social Sector Programs

23.      This section provides data illustrating the point made above that basic service delivery indicators
related to volume and access have largely shown substantial improvement over several years ­ helped
substantially by the setting of ambitious targets, as mentioned above ­ while the picture regarding
indicators of quality is mixed. These points are best illustrated with the education sector (see below). But
some data are also provided on key indicators for the health sector. These are the two basic services
sectors for which outcome data are the most readily available and also the most reliable.

24.      Note that there have been large-scale national Education and Health Sector Development
Programs in place since the mid-1990s, and these have intensified following the end of the war with
Eritrea in 1998. This is part of an ambitious policy agenda of expanding core social services that has been
pursued for over a decade, helped by a redirection of military spending to the social sectors after the end
of the war with Eritrea.

25.     Following the articulation of the MDGs in 2000, agreement was reached with donors on a further
scaling-up exercise, for both the social sectors, as well as for investment in basic infrastructure and for
food security and agricultural programs. This expansion of services, and corresponding large increases in
public spending, was at core of Ethiopia's initial PRSP (the SDPRP in 2002) and the subsequent PASDEP
(2005-2010).

26.     The Bank has supported this process from the beginning, with a sequence of sector credits (the
Health Sector Development Program (1998-2006), and Education SDP (1998-2004), two adjustment-type
operations (ERSC (2001) and ESAC (2002)), followed by two Poverty Reduction Credits (PRSC I and II,
both 2004), and then PBS in 2006.

27.     Primary and secondary education enrolment and enrolment rates have shown increased
substantially over the last several years, continuing a steeply upward trajectory that began around
1992/93 and accelerated to some extent in the last five or so years, especially for the primary level
(see Figure A3.3). From 3.7 million in 1995/96, primary school enrolment (Grades 1 to 8) reached 8.75
million in 2002/03 and 15.3 million in 2007/08 (an average growth rate of 26 percent per annum ­ see
Figure 3.3). This is now pushing through to the secondary level, with first cycle secondary enrolment
(Grades 9-10) having risen from 0.5 million in 2001/02 to 1.3 million in 2007/08 (i.e., also growing at 26
percent per annum on average). The country as a whole also made significant headway in bridging the

                                                      59
enrolment gap between boys and girls at primary level (the Gender Parity Index for the primary GER rose
from 0.67 in 1999/00 to 0.9 in 2007/088; this trend has accelerated since 2002/03.

28.      Two major factors facilitated the initial takeoff well before woreda decentralization in
2002/03, and continue to work through the system: (i) the introduction of a new language policy, whereby
the regional state governments of the recently established federation were to choose the language of
instruction in primary schools; and (ii) the introduction of a `fee free policy' in primary schools too. But
the upward trends in volume and access (enrolment, etc.) have continued at a rapid pace under the phase
of woreda-level decentralization (2002/03 onward), illustrating that decentralization works best
together with appropriate sector policies.

29.     There has been however a deterioration in recent years in some quality indicators like
repetition rates, dropout rates and performance in Grade 8 learning assessments (see Table A3.9).
But completion rates have still increased despite this, because of the sharp increase in enrolments at
Grade 1.

  The Gender Parity Index (GPI) is the ratio of female to male values of a given indicator. A GPI of 1 indicates parity between
sexes. The GPI for Grades 5-8 remained lower than for Grades 1-4 enrolment but both rose at comparable paces.

    Completion Rate: Grade 8                                                    34.0%           37.0%
    Achievement: Average on Standard Grade 8 National Assessment                 39.7               35.6

30.     The pattern observed in Ethiopia (particularly in education) of an initial rapid increase in
volume and access under decentralized service delivery, but possibly at the expense of quality, is
quite common and has also been observed in the early stages of decentralization in many other
countries. The deterioration in certain education quality indicators as seen above has caused alarm
among some, but in fact it could also have been taken as a striking achievement to have managed such an
enormous expansion with only a comparatively small deterioration in efficiency/quality. And the story
does include some good news, such as significant increases in the proportions of qualified teachers in
primary schools, and a lack of the high levels of teacher absenteeism common in many countries.
Furthermore, one must note that in line with the strong commitment of the government to universal access
as a matter of equity, federal policies and national priorities were first about access. Improving the
quality of services is also less directly amenable to policy directives. The experience in other countries
shows that improvements in quality tend to come later in the decentralization process. Nevertheless,
improving quality is one of the key goals of the new General Education Quality Improvement Program
(introduced in 2008) and the evolving new Education Sector Development Program (2011-2015).

31.     Turning now to health, several key basic health indicators have improved substantially
during decentralization, and especially so in the last few years when PBS was in place (see Table
A3.10). Even more so than for the education sector, these improvements represent not just the latest
development in a long-term trend of improvement, but a quite substantial acceleration. At the core of
these successes has been the expansion of the Health Extension Program (started in 2003), with the
rollout of basic coverage through an expanded network of local health facilities and services, and
widespread coverage of community-based female Health Extension Workers (HEWs), combined with
intensive campaign-style approaches to some key health problems: immunization, malaria, HIV/AIDS
and family planning. This illustrates again the fact that decentralization works best together with
appropriate sector policies.

                                                                  2003/04    2005/06    2007/08

32.     While the available data are mostly administrative data (from routine reporting systems) which
are not as accurate as survey-based data, there is universal agreement that impressive strides have been
made in primary health care, addressing malaria control and HIV/AIDS interventions, and there is greatly
increased coverage of contraception and immunization. The next Demographic Health Survey (DHS),
expected in 2011, will provide a solid basis for measuring the evolution of health indicators, based on

                                                             61
survey data; it will enable comparisons with the data from the last DHS survey which was conducted in
2005.

33.     Aside from the administrative data which are used to track most health indicators, evidence is
available from the rapid impact assessments conducted by the WHO in the four larger regions. These
show that between 2001/04 (annual average) and 2007, confirmed malaria outpatient cases decreased by
67 percent, malaria admissions by 54 percent and malaria deaths by 55 percent.9

VI. Impact of Decentralization on Service Delivery Performance

34.     Attribution is a challenge in any instance. In the case of concern in this study, it is
particularly so because the period in which decentralization was introduced also saw many other
factors unfold, that could potentially affect performance in basic service delivery. After the severe
drought of 2002/03 economic growth was continuously high and the GDP per capita grew by 7.5 percent
per annum and more, which ­ all other factors being equal - should have pushed the demand for services
upward. There are no data on poverty levels after 2004/05 but the especially high inflation of the 2007/09
period must have had an impact ­ likely to be variable among socioeconomic groups (e.g., surplus
producing vs. subsistence farmers). The last decade was also one of rapid policy development in all basic
service sectors (see previous section on education and health policies). In such a context, any coincidence
between the introduction of decentralization and a change in sector performance should be analyzed
particularly carefully.

35.      One role that woreda decentralization (since 2002/03) has likely played is that of raising the
level of community contributions, through woreda officials' proximity to the communities. The PBS
Secretariat Review of "off-woreda budget expenditures" (see Box 1) highlights the importance of these
contributions in woreda plans and budgets; and while there are no data series that would allow comparing
these recent estimates with similar pre-decentralization estimates, evidence from fieldwork at community
and woreda level suggests that indeed, communities contribute more and to more activities than used to
be the case earlier on. The ICR team was also given the example of a health center construction program
that the regional Government of Tigray had recently decided to delegate to woredas after the regional
health bureau had failed to meet the program targets, mainly because it was unable to organize the
required community contributions.

36.      It seems likely that decentralization facilitated the implementation of key federal policies
and national priorities, leading to the acceleration observed in several education and health
indicators over the last several years. As mentioned above, there have been steeper upward trends over
the last several years for a number of indicators in both education and health, and this coincides with the
period of woreda decentralization (2002/03 onward). However, such acceleration also followed the
adoption of federal policies specifically aimed at making a difference (e.g., UPE enrolment and retention
campaign, ABE 10 and girls' education policies, the Health Extension Program). The precise role of
decentralization here is hard to quantify, and the counterfactual cannot be observed. But it is at least
plausible, and indeed probable, that woredas, taking their responsibilities of raising local awareness and
mobilizing communities seriously (including via substantially increased community contributions), and
probably "kept on their toes" by higher government levels, made a difference. In short, a decentralized

   Alternative Basic Education provides opportunities for children to cover in three years the curriculum of Grades 1-4, through
flexible arrangements such as greater proximity of the ABE centers from remote villages/communities, training of local residents
(e.g., Grade 10 leavers) as ABE facilitators, and flexible teaching calendar and timetable which allow children to continue attend
their domestic tasks at the same time as attending education. After these three years, the children are integrated into `regular
schools' in Grade 5.

                                                               62
(to the woreda level) service delivery structure appears well suited for the implementation of key federal
policies such as those mentioned above.

37.     There is some evidence that decentralization, using a system where the bulk of resources to
lower levels is distributed via a block grant whose size follows a predetermined formula, has led to
a more equitable distribution of resources across woredas. In many regions, notably the four largest
ones who have decentralized the most quickly (Oromiya, Amhara, SNNPR and Tigray), rural schools out-
performed urban ones in Grade 8 learning scores in 2008, in contrast with the situation found in 2004.
The work of Garcia and Rajkumar (2008) found, similarly, that since decentralization to the woredas in
2002/03, one had observed a more equitable distribution across woredas of resources and of indicators
such as the pupil­teacher ratio, in SNNP and to some extent in Oromiya. This does not mean that
decentralization is the only factor. Factors such as the presence of work opportunities and evolution in
children's and parents' expectations matter tremendously as well. But at the very least decentralization
supported any behavioral change that may have occurred.

38.     An important indicator of the potential success of decentralization is the extent to which
different choices are indeed made in different jurisdictions, since this is at the heart of the concept
of effective decentralization. And there is significant evidence of this. This is despite constraints
imposed by inadequate funding at lower levels especially for discretionary purposes, and the targets set at
the federal and regional levels (for Health Extension Workers, etc. ­ see above). Available data show this
mostly at regional level (as woreda disaggregations are lacking). Significant examples include: (i)
Oromia's choice to retain a higher share of expenditures at regional level, a 60:40 split in favor of
woredas compared with roughly 75:25 in other decentralized regions; (ii) external assistance is included
in regional transfers to woredas in SNNP and Amhara, not in Tigray and Oromia; and (iii) both Amhara
and Tigray make special allocations from the pool before applying the formula to share the block grant
among woredas ­ Amhara first funds a Specific Purpose Grant for urban infrastructure, while Tigray
makes a special allocation to woredas that have Erob and Kunama minorities.

39.     Finally, there is some evidence of decentralization having a positive impact not only on the
basic service sectors as strictly defined for PBS, but also for other sectors as well that could be
considered a part of or related to "basic services." The ICR team was struck that regional informants,
when asked whether decentralization had "worked," almost invariably cited the new access to local justice
as proof of decentralization's worth.

40.      We turn now specifically to the period since the start of PBS at the end of 2005/06. The data here
indicate that the protective effect of PBS on spending, allowing the continuation of the process of
woreda-level decentralization that had started in 2002/03, appears to have helped ensure a continued and
in some cases accelerated expansion of coverage of core education, health, agricultural extension, and ­ to
a lesser extent ­ water supply services. The evolution of key coverage indicators in these sectors over the
period of PBS I implementation is shown in Table 2 of section 3.2 of the main text.

VII.    Decentralized Capacity and Accountability, and Impact of PBS along Three Dimensions

41.     Capacity is nowhere adequate. However, it is a remarkable achievement to have expanded
woreda-managed staff and services so rapidly with only limited adverse effects on quality. It is also
quite amazing that not even 10 years after woreda-level decentralization, there are local (participatory)
planning processes and plans and systems of local accountability (of executives to councils) in place at
the woreda level. Let us remember that this started almost from scratch: woredas were passing
information upward for regional planning and budgeting and executing regional budgets and plans;
councils were in place but with little to oversee as all decisions were taken at the regional level.


                                                    63
Unsurprisingly the new systems and processes are fledgling. But they are very important foundations that
the decentralization process thus far put in place, and to build upon.

42.     Some systems are clearly stronger ­ especially financial management systems. Others (woreda
planning and budgeting and horizontal accountability systems) have been established from scratch, which
is a considerable achievement upon which to build in the future. Regional governments are committed to
strengthening woreda capacity and active in this respect. But further challenges lie ahead. Capacity is
uneven (across jurisdictions and management areas). Capacity development has been uneven too: some
areas have received less attention than others, and coordination across initiatives needs to be improved.

43.     There has also been a realization of the importance of transparency and accountability, and
citizen participation in the service delivery process, which are relatively new concepts in Ethiopia (the
report's main text and Annex 9 have more on this). A comprehensive Good Governance Package has
been introduced, based on these concepts, and is an integral part of the government's core strategy
PASDEP.

44.    A key goal of PBS has been to support these efforts to enhance capacity, transparency and
accountability at decentralized levels. Some of the contributions of PBS I in these areas include:

    a. Supporting public financial management (PFM) efforts to strengthen the structure necessary for
       fiscal decentralization, for example, through hiring additional accountants and IT staff and
       financing capacity building activities at the federal and regional Auditor General offices.
       (Under PBS II, these efforts will be scaled up, covering a much broader range of PFM
       strengthening activities, including the rollout of the IBEX II system.)

    b. Helping address some key outstanding gaps in the newly decentralized structure that were evident
       at time the operation was prepared, for example, lack of expenditure tracking at the woreda
       level. After woredas were given discretion over expenditure allocation (in 2002/03), it had
       become apparent that neither government nor donors could any longer effectively say what the
       sectoral composition of actual (as opposed to budgeted) expenditure was in Ethiopia. While the
       government realized this needed to be rectified, PBS hastened the process by requiring regular
       reporting for the JBARs, and providing technical assistance.

    c. PBS added the process of continuous audits of woreda governments. While these were intended
       in part to satisfy donors that funds disbursed under PBS had been properly used, they are
       acknowledged by government officials to have been helpful more broadly in identifying and
       rectifying weaknesses at the local government level.

    d. PBS supported a number of innovative and unprecedented transparency and accountability
       initiatives (e.g., posting of budgets in public places and social accountability pilots) ­ discussed in
       detail in the report's main text and in Annex 9. While these were slow to get started, they have
       now gained some momentum, and there is a sense among officials interviewed for this report that
       while this is something the government would have got to eventually, it was not on the agenda at
       the time, and the impact of PBS activities has at the very least accelerated these initiatives.

    e. PBS I supported Local Investment Grants (LIG) to enhance the capacity of local governments
       along various dimensions like local planning, procurement, financial management, handling of
       capital investments and accountability. (Annex 10 provides an overview of the successes and
       challenges of the LIG pilot under PBS I, based on a recently conducted thorough review.)

VIII.     Overall Financing and Other Impacts of PBS

45.    As noted above, it is clear that PBS had a protective effect in particular on regional and woreda
spending. But the data indicate that it had a protective effect on overall public spending, and also
helped mitigate the macroeconomic and fiscal crisis of 2007/09 by helping to bring in significant
amounts of foreign exchange. These protective effects have been enabled by the size of PBS; at its peak
PBS I disbursed about US$490 million in 2006/07, representing about 22 percent of all official
development assistance to Ethiopia that year (see Table A3.11).11

              Table A3.11: PBS and Estimated Total Aid Disbursements (2005/06­2008/09)
                                                           2005/06          2006/07         2007/08          2008/09
     PBS I Disbursements /a                                    91              444             430             129

        b/Source: OECD, note OECD data presented by calendar years; for FYs estimated as simple average of calendar
        years. b/ Note does not include disbursements under the follow-on operation PBS II, which would have increased
        inflows to about US$ 474 million in 2008/09, representing about 14 % of ODA.

46.     The protective effect mentioned vis-à-vis overall public spending is due to the fact that despite the
notional earmarking, money is of course ultimately fungible. The net addition of resources ­ whether
from PBS or other sources - has likely may have allowed the government to protect and perhaps expand
its own expenditures elsewhere more so than they otherwise would have.

47.     Budget support was introduced in Ethiopia during a period when the government was embarked
on three major initiatives: (i) expansion of social services; (ii) massive new capital investments; and (iii)
large-scale expansion of food security and agricultural programs. It is likely that PBS resources, by
helping protect and expand the expansion of social services at the regional and woreda levels, allowed the
government to channel more of its own resources than it otherwise would have toward new capital
spending as well as expansion of food security and agricultural programs.

48.      Over the period of PBS I implementation, for example, own-financed federal capital spending
rose from $672 million equivalent in 2004/05 to $1,279 million equivalent in 2008/09. It is unlikely that
this expansion would have occurred, to this degree, without the introduction of PBS at a time when
budget support was suspended. It should be noted that this capital program included many investments
that are needed to lay the basis for longer-term growth, and ultimately reduce poverty ­ in areas such as
higher education, power supply and telecommunications. It also included items that had a direct impact
on the poor, such as the federal rural electrification program.

  In fact, there are a substantial number of new, `non-traditional' donors, have been providing increasing amounts of aid to
Ethiopia in recent years (such as GAVI, the Global Fund, China and India), and not all of these flows are captured in the OECD
data), as a consequence the actual significance of PBS funding would be somewhat less than implied by the table.

* These data were obtained from the system. The total figure for spending on preparation is misleading because
most of it in fact went towards preparation for the PRSC III (budget support) operation which was suspended in
mid-FY06. (PRSC III and PBS I shared the same project code in the system). The preparations for PRSC III had
been intensive, involving various teams within the Bank and dialogue with various sectors, as well as some
analytical work on different issues.

Crosscutting Lessons Learned as Identified during the PBS Stakeholder Workshop on March 23-24,
2010 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

1.       The following is a subset of some of the lessons that emerged in this workshop. These and others
are also interspersed in the rest of this document.

2.      Without sufficient "ownership" by the government, activities may not have the desired impact,
and may be executed with delays, for example, in the case of the hiring of a procurement agent in FMOH
(under Component 2).

3.       Need for a continuation and an enhancement (where appropriate) of intensive and sustained
tailored-made capacity building effort, targeted to the lower levels decision-makers involved in PBS ­
woredas, kebeles and CSOs ­ through, for example:

         Training, not only on fiduciary aspects (e.g., financial management and reporting,
         procurement and environmental safeguards), but also on substance (e.g. transparency, social
         accountability, better targeting of capital expenditures, appropriate mix between recurrent and
         capital expenditure).

         Coaching/Hands-on support (including regions to woredas; federal government to regions
         and appropriate technical assistance at higher levels).

         Appropriate manuals and tools, in appropriate languages.

         Appropriate staffing of skilled personnel, and steps to reduce and mitigate high levels of
         turnover.

4.      Need to continue strengthening the operational linkages (articulation) of PBS with other ongoing
GOE programs and civil society interventions (e.g., block grants/LIG with PSCAP, PSNP, individual
sector programs; FTA and SA; recurrent and capital investment expenditures; linkages with new entry
points for social accountability, like the justice system, environment and police):

        Need for more effective and timely communication, and more awareness creation.

        Need continued and (where needed) more attention to operational issues (in a participatory
fashion), including:

                Planning (new activities, scaling up exiting activities);
                Programming;
                Setting of appropriate targets and timelines;
                Implementation (flexibility);
                Safeguards issues;
                Effective and timely monitoring and use of the information for decision-making
                purposes;




                                                     70
          Taking various steps to ensuring over time sufficient discretionary budgets which in turn
          would help enhance the quality of basic service delivery; and
          Fine tuning of operational procedures based on assessment findings (lessons learned, etc.).

   Need to focus more on enhancing the quality of basic service delivery. Need also to provide
   operational definitions of how to measure quality in education (e.g., improved learning
   achievements, improved retention and improved efficiency), as well as in health, water and
   agriculture.

   Need to pay sufficient attention to the issue of equity in the allocation and expenditure of
   recurrent and capital investment resources.

   Need to ensure not to overload PBS (it is not a magic bullet, and should in a complementary
   fashion to other interventions as appropriate).

   Need to focus in particular on the fiscal, institutional and technical sustainability of the PBS
   activities that are showing "positive" outcomes.

   Need for more timely shared information on projected donor partners' contributions and transfer
   of funds, as well as better alignment of procedures of donor partners with government systems
   (e.g., allocation of funds at the start of the fiscal year).

   Need to simplify and make more flexible Bank fiduciary procedures attuned to the characteristics
   of a large and newly decentralized country like Ethiopia.

    1. Executive Summary

1.1 Background
The Government of Ethiopia from the start acknowledged the critical importance of state transformation
and decentralization to the success of Ethiopian's long term development, democracy and good
governance agenda. In this context, the devolution of basic service to woredas (districts) is being made
effective along with the buildup of capacities at woreda and kebele levels.

In this regard, the Government of Ethiopia has been allocating huge resources as Federal Block Grant and
transfer to sub national levels to enable them to fully engage in eradicating poverty as well as improving
basic services in a fair, transparent, and accountable manner. The preceding PBS block grant allocation
and transfer showed sharply increasing from year to year with the aim of improving delivery of basic
services at lower level to enable beneficiaries to break multi-generation poverty traps.

There were clear encouraging outcomes on pro-poor expenditures improvements and potentially high
impact activities and the deepening of transparency and the accountability in the public arena.

In this connection, the Government and development partners have been working together to reinforce
and deepen the reform program of the country to improve the basic service delivery at grass root level.
Accordingly, the Government of Ethiopia and international development partners beginning from 2006
have embarked on a new mechanism known as Protection of Basic Services (PBS) to protect and enhance
decentralized public service delivery through financing of key expenditures at the sub-national levels. The
program also was developed with the expectation of improving transparency and accountability in public
finance management.

The project evolved over a period of three years of 2006-2009. The PBS I was initially planned to be
undertaken for a period of 2 years starting from June 2006 to June 2008. The positive results of the first
intervention which enabled to mobilize a strong international partnership to support the program at the
same time to serve as to bridge the gap between phase one and two of the program.

In addition to the Government's contribution five development partners namely IDA, Department of
International Development of UK Government (DFID), Irish Aid, Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA) and the Government of the Netherlands committed funds at the time of appraisal for the
implementation of the original PBS. The additional financing brought five new development partners
namely African Development Fund, the European Commission (EC), German Development Bank (KfW)
and the Governments of Australia and Spain and the original five development partners have provided
substantial support for the program.

The first Financing Agreement was signed between the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the
International Development Association (IDA) for a total amount of US$215.00 million (Grant No. H 224-
ET) and on 29 May 2006 and the second Additional Financing Agreement was signed between the two
parties on 17 January 2008 for the total amount of US$215.00 million (Grant No. H347-ET). PBS
development partners channeled their funds through pooled arrangements through World Bank
administered Multi Trust Funds (MDTF90445, MDTF56885 and MDTF57673). Similarly, the
Government has showed its commitment by increasing its contribution to the Federal Block Grant (FBG)
each fiscal year above and beyond the required in the PBS agreements (30 percent increase instead of the
agreed an annual 10 percent increase in Government's own financing) for basic services.

As the block grant transfer is the most important source of funding by both the regional governments and
Woredas, fund disbursement uses the block grant transfer mechanism for service delivery by both the




                                                    73
regional governments and Woredas and the fund flows have been undertaken through the prevailing
financial management systems of the government.

Now, the implementations of PBS I has been completed at the end of June 2009 with substantial
achievements and successes. The purpose of this document is to prepare an Intensive Learning
Implementation Completion and Results Report.

1.2 Objectives of the PBS I
The project development objective of the PBS operation is to protect and promote the delivery of basic
services by sub-national governments while deepening transparency and local accountability in service
delivery.

1.3 Components of the PBS I
The program constitutes four components:
        Component 1: Promoting the Delivery of Basic Services by Sub-national government with the
        largest resources aimed at protecting and promoting the delivery of basic services at regional and
        woreda level by way of financing the recurrent expenditures of education, health, agriculture and
        water. Apart from financing the recurrent expenditure of these sectors it has a capital expenditure
        element; named as Local Investment Grant (LIG) coming onboard with additional financing as
        pilot program which aimed to support performance-based Specific Purpose Grant with access
        criteria established in areas relevant for improving the quality of capital investment at local level.
        Component 2: Promoting the Health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which allocates
        resources for funding high-impact health commodities including ITNs, drugs, rapid test
        diagnostics kits to primary health centers, vaccines and medical equipments as well as capacity
        building activities in the health sector.
        Component 3: Strengthening Governance Systems on Financial Transparency and Accountability
        which intended to enhance transparency in public budget processes and management (budget
        preparation, expenditure and audits) at regional, city Administrations, Woredas and service
        facility levels as well as capacity building activities for Ministry of Finance and Economic
        development (MOFED), Bureau of Finance and Economic Developments (BOFEDs) and Office
        of the Federal Auditor General (OFAG)
        Component 4: Social Accountability intended at supporting capacity building for and piloting of
        selected large scale pilot initiatives aimed at strengthening citizen voice and enhancing
        accountability of public sector service providers to citizens. It also engaged in building demand
        side governance capacity on public budget issues among citizens and civil society organizations.
1.4 Purpose of the Intensive Learning Implementation Completion and Result Report (ICR)
The purpose of this Intensive Leaning Implementation Completion and Result Report is to assess the
progress in the implementation of the project including the progress made towards meeting the project
development objectives, challenges still remaining in the way of the successful completion of the project
and to map out the way forward in terms of leveraging the lessons learnt and outcomes gained in terms of
expanding the scope of the project. This ICR is intended to take stock of the achievements of program
objectives, outputs and outcomes. The lessons learnt from this ICR would help in the designs, preparation,
and implementation of other similar future interventions. From the Government perspective this ICR
serves as the project's self evaluation of its implementation performance during the life of the program.

1.5 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Indeed, PBS as financing instrument has been designed to support the implementations of the ongoing
PASDEP the core development agenda of the country designed preceding PBS. Accordingly, the program



                                                     74
preparation, design and quality at entry were properly carried out according to the objectives of the
program. The Government both at federal and regional levels which include MoFED, concerned line
ministries, Regional Governments (BOFED and Woreda Office of Finance and Economic Development
WOFED) and other concerned institutions were fully involved in the assessments of needs of the funds
for the selected economic sectors.

The Government's background work towards PBS I facilitated the Bank's Preparation Mission in
identifying various issues and making recommendations on PBS's design and content. The Government
had prepared detailed identified sectors reports which include review of the health, education, water
supply, agricultural development and recommended direction for the proposed PBS I. The existence of
Ethiopia's overall and sector development policies, strategies and plans (PASDEP) at national level
facilitated the smooth design and implementations of PBS.

In addition, the Government and the development partners concerted efforts paved the way for good
preparation, especially in implementation of the program beginning from federal to regions and woredas
and the development of an effective strategy.

1.6 Relevance to the Bank CAS
The consistence of the program to government priorities and the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), like poverty reduction strategy, meeting MDG goals, improving basic services delivery and
promotion of economic development and macro-economic stability was properly checked.

1.7 Project Risks
The Government's full commitment to implement the project and put in place institutional arrangements,
required staff with adequate skills at federal, regional and woredas levels were ascertained. Proper
consideration was made to fully involve all stakeholders including officials from all regions, woredas and
Kebeles and household beneficiaries, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and the likes at every level.
Furthermore, institutional arrangements for successful implementation of the project were made through
the existing Government structure and establishing new ones as required. These have enhanced the
implementation and sustainability of the achievements of objectives and outputs of the PBS.

1.8 Institutional Arrangements
At the beginning of the program implementation the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was established
under Macroeconomic Management Department of MOFED to be responsible for the overall coordination
of the implementation of the program including managing the component one, undertaking various
procurement activities and other responsibilities while other agencies like the Ministry of Health was
designated to implement component two falling under its normal mandates. In similar way, the
Management Agency (GTZ International Service) was also recruited to manage the implementation of the
social accountability component.

1.9 Program Monitoring and Evaluation
The government and PBS partners agreed to base PBS Monitoring and Evaluation on PASDEP result
frameworks and the Annual Progress Report (APR) which is the prevailing PASDEP's monitoring and
evaluation system. The Joint Budget and Aid Review/Joint Review and Implementation Support
(JBAR/JRIS) held every quarter for sometimes and after midterm review twice a year served to evaluate
results and impacts of PBS I.

The Monitoring and Evaluation framework built on core set of appropriate outcome indicators to
measures changes in protection and expansions of basic services of component one and two of the
program. On the other hand, given the character of the envisaged activities and specific objectives of
component three and four, the monitoring and evaluation framework included only output (intermediate


                                                   75
outcome) indicators including public disclosure of budgetary information and transparency and
accountability. More broadly, the PBS monitoring and evaluation system systematically monitored both
the level of the federal block grant transfer and the level of expenditures as well as implementation
progresses of all envisaged program activities against targets set in the PASDEP. Over the program
implementation period eight successive reviews beginning from July 2006 to May 2009 have been
conducted in order to assess PBS I results.

As per the design of the PBS a set of tests have been attached to monitor the implementation of
component one including additionality, fairness, transparency and accountability and fiduciary
responsibilities. During PBS I intensive evaluations were made against those tests based on the
information compiled from federal, regional and Woreda levels.

2. Achievements of the PBS I

On the bases of various reports produced and assessment conducted all targets of the program were either
fully achieved or almost achieved and in some cases were surpassed by large margins. More specifically,
the high level program outcome and intermediate indicators have all been largely achieved and in several
cases exceeded than the targets. Various findings confirm that the objectives of the program have been
fully met and the data indicated large gains in the efficiency of regional and woreda spending in terms of
coverage and access of social basic services.

From the angle of Government, overall performances of the program was successful and fully achieved
the overall objectives of the program by contributing to the implementations of the development agenda
of the country focusing on decentralization and expansions of core social services. Importantly, the
implementation of PBS deepened partnership and bring into line the development partners support to
synchronize through World Bank disbursement and procurement rules and procedures.

The quality of service delivery and expansions in the selected sectors of education, health, agriculture,
water as well as sanitation and rural roads which came on board after the signature of additional financing
has been improved at all levels. This support brought positive impact on expenditure of governments at
all levels and enhanced policy dialogue between Government and development partners on
macroeconomic and sector issues. The Public Financial Management capacity at all levels has been
strengthened and communications and partnership among all stakeholders has been improved.

The allocation of block grant to regions increased in a fair and transparent manner. From the base fiscal
year of 2005 until 2009 the Government has increased its federal block grant funding to sub-national
governments to enable them to increase basic services. The Government had managed to increase its
contribution to the Federal Block Grant (FBG) each fiscal year above and beyond the required in the PBS
agreements (30 percent increase instead of the agreed an annual 10 percent increase in Government's own
financing) for basic services. This has assisted regions and woredas to increase their spending for basic
services as well as help to achieve the overall objectives of the program.

As a result of substantial allocation of resources for the program the overall performance of primary
education has been strong in terms of rise in primary school enrolment exceeding the target including the
quality of education that children receive. In a similar way, after the inception of the program in health
sector a lot of achievements have been recorded in terms of improvements of primary health service
deliveries, increasing the numbers of health extension workers, enhancing the availability of health
commodities and the likes. Rural access to potable water has also been improved. The performance of
agriculture and rural roads sectors were noticed as indicated in various reports produced and assessments
conducted.




                                                    76
Similarly, all monitoring and evaluation results through using the agreed JBAR/JRIS framework attested
that the government fulfilled all requirements including fiscal reporting, disclosure of budget information
at all levels, conducting continuous audit, and Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability review
with results turned out encouraging and found significant progresses in all aspects. PBS I contributed to
Government efforts to sustain gains in key human development indicators as well as to enhance
transparency and accountability at all levels.

Indeed, the Government has made significant efforts including deepening of decentralization agenda
financial transparency and accountability issues as well as the need for popular participation and citizen's
engagement in the budget process and service delivery become of paramount importance. Activities to
stimulate demand-led accountabilities was established in PBS I and created a significant Government
supported efforts in its own good governance agenda.

As to budget and spending data concerned the total program cost including the Government contribution
was estimated at US$4,367.03 million at appraisal. Out of the total allocation, IDA contributed US$430
million (9.85 percent), other participating development contributed US$747.05 million (17.11 percent)
and the Government contributed US$3,189.98 million (73.05 percent) of the total project cost, over the
implementation period of PBS I. At completion out of the total allocations of development partners
including the World Bank about 98.28 percent has been disbursed and utilized for the intended purposes.

On the other front the project complied with all fiduciary policies. The resources have been utilized for
the agreed purposes and envisaged activities. Project accounting and auditing have consistently been
conducted in accordance with the agreement reached between the two parties. All procurements have
been conducted of course with slightly delays by keeping the agreed procedures and rules.

Most critically, the four principles of tests of additionality, fiduciary responsibility, fairness and
accountability have been fully met consistently by using eight reviews conducted jointly by the
Governments at all levels and development partners since effectiveness of the program.

The following sections assess the success and achievements by individual program components.
Delivery of Basic Services Sub Component: The annual increase in the block grant transfer to sub
national levels has made it possible that there has been a marked contribution in the resources available
for service delivery at woredas level and consequently in extent of services provided. This can be seen
through various produced reports during the life of PBS I, looking at government financial data, speaking
to woreda officials in the field and most importantly perhaps by speaking to ordinary men, women and
children living in the woredas benefiting from the interventions. In similar way, block grant transfers
performances from the Federal Government to Regions during the implementation period of PBS have
shown increasing trends.

As a continuous process all essential information regarding the Federal and Regional Governments'
budget and actual revenue and expenditure data have been posted on the MOFED website and published
in the national newspapers for public information. Regions having regional newspapers have also used to
publish highlights of their fiscal year budget in local languages. Likewise, Woredas have regularly posted
budget information on notice board and public. The support enabled some regions continuously apply
their innovative mechanisms to avail budget information to the public. Similarly, the implementation of
PBS contributed to deepen and expand the budget dissemination laterally from woredas to offices and
units.

The continuous audits by Office of the Federal Auditor General and joint field visit reports with the
development partners as well as samples sent to MOFED from different regions not only justify the
widespread dissemination of budget information but also the timely transfer of budget to the beneficiaries.


                                                    77
Hence, budget information is readily available to the public with encouraging innovations in
dissemination than ever before.

The fulfillment of all tests by the Government was very much successful as described in the various
reports produced in PBS I including continuous audit reports of the Office of the Federal Auditor General.
All the data collected and reports produced confirmed that the Government has fully fulfilled its
agreement related to addionality as well as fairness. In similar way, the positive results of the fiduciary
test have been endorsed by an independent National Audit Office of the United Kingdom which visited
Ethiopia and undertake an assessment related to effective functioning of the decentralized system in basic
service delivery through setting priority, allocating more resources for basic services giving more
attention on monitoring and evaluation, budget disclosure and engaging communities at sub-national
levels.

Pilot Local Investment Grant (LIG) Sub-component: The PBS resource has been contributed to enable
to undertake construction of health posts, elementary schools, agricultural extension services and water
and sanitation infrastructures with sufficient attention to environmental concerns. Thanks to this pilot
initiative citizens' access to basic services have been improved and the demand for additional
infrastructural set up has been created and the capacity to design investment projects, leveraging local
planning, helping to open discussion on real choices has been enhanced to realize their development plan
at local levels.

Health MDGs Support Facility Component: There are strong evidences of positive impact on health
sector the support brought in by using PBS resources. As all planned commodities including vaccines,
contraceptives, ITNs, anti malaria, spray pumps, emergency drugs and equipments for 2000 health centers
and 7000 posts have been procured and delivered at PFSA warehouse. Medical equipments have been
delivered to the facilities of one thousands (1000) Health Center (HC) and one thousands and five
hundreds (1500) Health posts (HPs) and the remaining health post and health centers will get their share
soon.

These actions together with distribution of necessary drugs and other EPI and Family Planning (FP)
commodities like vaccines and contraceptives has contributed to improve the access to quality primary
health service. In the mean time, the increased availability of critical health equipments and commodities
at health facilities enabled personnel to provide better services. Generally, since the inception of PBS the
availability of health supplies including bed nets, vaccines and contraceptives has been improved
throughout the country which has been endorsed by beneficiary Woredas in all parts of the country.

As the result of procurement and distribution of ITNs to 750,000 households which would contributed to
the reduction of the malaria outpatients cases by 67 percent, malaria admission by 54 percent and malaria
deaths by 55 percent and these results confirmed by the latest rapid impact assessment conducted in four
main regions. The implementation of component two of the program contributed to the country to
dramatically scalded up the fight against malaria. Moreover, the procured and distributed lab equipment
including microscope and audiovisual equipment and spray pumps for indoor residual spray has been
enhanced the achievements recorded in the life of PBS I.

The target of deploying of 30,000 HEWs has already been achieved and as a result the target of the ratio
of health extension workers to population reached above the targets. In addition, two thousand five
hundred eighty six (2,586) Health Extension Workers (HEW) supervisors were trained in all regions and
this training has improved the supervision of HEWs and in turn the HEWs enabled to improve the
services they have been providing to the communities.




                                                     78
In general, as measured against key performance indicator DPT 3 increased to 81.6 percent slightly less
than the target, HEW deployment reached 31, 831slightly above the target, and Measles reached 76.6
percent. The intermediate outcome of Contraceptive Acceptance Rate (CAR) indicator has already
exceeded the current fiscal year of 2009/10 target which stands at 56.2 percent, which is close to the
identified target for the end of PBS I financing. In similar way, PBS has contributed to the start up of the
Emergency Surgery and Obstetrics trainings by financing the procurement of medical equipments,
furniture, books and teaching aids and vehicles for identified Universities contributing to the Government
program of reducing the maternal mortality rate. Thus, the sector through the contribution of PBS support
has managed to reach its performance indicator targets in almost all areas and surpass them in some
instances. Generally, the output and impact of the Health MDGs Support Facility could be rated as
satisfactory.

Financial Transparency and Accountability Component: This support contributed to the improvement
of the core public financial management of MoFED, BoFEDs, ZoFEDs and WoFEDs by reinforcing the
Government reform program of public financial management and transparency and accountability in
budget administration. Strengthening of institutional as well as human capacity in the sphere of public
financial management helped to keep financial report timeline and the accounting back log occurred in
the past which now become history.

Equally, supply of appropriate equipments and conducting various training to build the capacity OFAG
personnel through the support of PBS enabling OFAG to undertake twelve rounds of continuous Audits in
selected regions of 730 sub-national entities in which these actions provided the opportunities for the
governments at all levels to evaluate public financial management capacities at lower level as well as
gave fiduciary assurances, helped to identify strengthens and weakness of the Public Financial
Management (PFM) and helped to improve PFM in continuous bases.

Similarly, all endeavors that have been made to improve budget literacy and accountability initiatives
under the component have achieved successful results except delays in the finalization of preparation of
FTA tools. The widespread publication and posting of regional and woredas budgets in Ethiopia has
gained its momentum and the actions started serving to catalyze transparency and accountability at all
levels. Now, budget disclosure has become a regular activities at all levels of governments. It has become
evident that all Regions have really brought into the FTA agenda by introducing their own FTA initiatives.
In addition, thanks to this intervention the capacity of communities, end user engagement on service
delivery issues and the accountability of Service Facilities to end users and local communities, has been
enhanced.

On the other hand, the development of the core Financial Transparency and Accountability (FTA) tools
took some time ­learning timely defining the scope of the work and recruitment of consultants. The main
achievements in PBS I under this component have been the design of the core tools and the initiation of
some implementation activities which enable to strengthen citizens' participation and awareness in public
budget administration. Now, the finalized FTA tools were distributed to the beneficiary regional
Administrations to customize them fit with different Regional contexts and conditions. Steps have been
undertaken to customize during the ongoing PBS the FTA tools of service delivery and budget and
expenditure templates, laypersons guide to public budget process and media disclosure of regional and
woredas public budget information which now has already been started with a lot of improvements and
achievements.

In general, as to separate monitoring and evaluation activities of the tools, the results are encouraging and
significant progresses have been made in all aspects. Moreover, the efforts made to enhance transparency
and accountability at all levels were commendable. Indeed, all monitoring and evaluation results attested



                                                     79
that the government fulfilled all requirements including fiscal reporting, disclosure of budget information
at all levels, conducting continuous audit, and PEFA review.

Social Accountability Component: A total of 12 lead CSOs and their partners, representing a total of
about 50 CSOs operating in approximately 80 woredas, cities or sub-cities has been implementing the
Ethiopian social accountability pilot projects concentrating on four basic services sectors education,
health, water and sanitation, and agriculture in order to strengthen the use of social accountability
approaches by citizens and CSOs as a means to make basic service delivery more effective, efficient,
transparent, responsive and accountable. Although social accountability was new for most of stakeholders,
some of the preliminary findings endorsed that the pilots were completed with satisfactory outcomes to
adopt best practices of social accountability and create a learning initiative including showing the active
involvement of service providers and local government officials by adapting Social Accountability tools
to the context without major problems.

Generally, the social accountability pilot projects have contributed to best practices in social
accountability, enhanced awareness in social accountability, contributed to improved social service
provisions and effectiveness in service delivery as well as contributed to improve relationships between
civil society and regional and local governments. Without doubt, the implementation of PBS has
contributed to develop and reinforce dialogue between government and citizens and in particular
membership based civil society organizations at woredas levels. Similarly, these pilot projects enhanced
citizens awareness about budgets and expenditures on basic services.

3. Major Factors Affecting Project Implementation and Output and Outcomes

Despite the success and remarkable achievements, some of the project activities such as introduction of
radically new and potentially far reaching FTA initiatives under the support of all stakeholders were the
major challenges of the governments at all levels and development partners which required extensive
energies and long time engagement.

4. Sustainability

The investments under the program are likely to be sustainable given that a firm commitment from the
Governments side at all levels and PBS activities are the major development agendas of the country to
provide such as fiscal, institutional and technical support in a sustainable manner for the envisaged
program activities to be continuously implemented as well as to sustain all the positive achievements to
preserve the results of PBS I at the grass root level.

The increasing trends of the last three years transfer of Federal Block Grant to Regions and from regions
to Woreda confirmed that the Government has a capacity to sustain all positive achievements by
allocating substantial resources within available resource envelop. This is evident from the three years
(2003-2005) Macroeconomic Fiscal Framework projection figures.

Therefore, since the Government adopted a good development policies and strategies, institutional and
financial framework with conducive policy environment for private sector investment undoubtedly the
Government is able to sustain most of the results of the PBS I. The sharp increase in the Federal Block
Grant transfer within short period of time is a good lesson for the Government and in the future it has
created adequate capacity to generate sufficient resources by doing so to sustain the achievements
recorded. In addition, the Government has taken concerted fiscal, monetary and administrative measures
and will continue to do so to enable the Government to collect substantial resources and allocate adequate
resources for country's priority areas including basic service delivery sectors to sustain all the
achievements of PBS I.

5. Performance Evaluation of Government and Development Partners

During the project design, preparation, implementation and operation phase both the governments at all
levels and the development partners had worked closely to facilitate the finalization of the program design.
They had made intensive field visits jointly and intensive meeting and reviews and resolved many issues
at local levels that contributed for the smooth implementation and operation of the project activities.
Taking into consideration the strengths with the weakness of each governmental institution, the World
Bank and its collaborative development partners and other stakeholder performance rated as satisfactory.
Hence, the overall performance rate of the Government and the World Bank including other participating
development partners in detail is presented as follows.

5.1 The World Bank and other Participating Development Partners Performance
The Bank's active engagement and its leading role in coordinating the consultations between various
development partners and Government and the technical assistances it provided during the design and
implementation of the program was highly satisfactory. The Bank in collaboration with other local
Development Assistance Group provided critical expert advice during the design and preparation of this
complex program to be implemented in the country.

Similarly, the Bank's and development partners' supervision performance is rated satisfactory. During
implementation, all development partners actively supervised the project at regular intervals by using the
Agreed JBAR/JRIS mechanism. The team comprising the World Bank and participating development
partners was praised for it's proactively and frank assessment. The supervision were not only conducted,
at the beginning quarterly later on twice a year, but implementation support advise was given from the
field more frequently during the implementation period and often in one to one and group sessions. In all
eight conducted JBAR and JRIS all the involved parties found their input useful both technically and
administratively for facilitating speedy implementation as well as utilization of the allocated resources for
intended purposes.

Hence, the overall performance, because of the quality of support they provided during program
preparation and appraisal, the quality of supervision and the continuous technical support and advice they
provided for enhancing implementation, advice offered to government, the positive activities and actions
that emerged from supervision missions and their special thematic approaches, the lead role played in
other development partners coordination and harmonization is rated satisfactory.

5.2 Government's Performance
The performance of the Government was satisfactory during project preparation. Technical configuration
of the project was completed and institutional aspects scheduled to be firmed up during appraisal. The
existence of clear development policies, strategies and plans (PASDEP) has ensured ownership,
consistency with country priorities and facilitated design and implementation.

As to implementation performance, the Governments' performance at federal, regional and woredas level
was credible during the life of PBS I. Different government agencies including federal line ministries and
Regional Governments, project offices at all levels and sector bureaus also collaborated by giving the
necessary support during the implementation period. The Government ensured that the project received
adequate support from all stakeholders to smoothly implement the project. It generally complied with all
covenants of the Financing Agreements. On the other hand, there were some delays initially in kicking off
the process in procuring envisaged goods and recruitment of consultancy services, which was
subsequently addressed and delivered.

A separate Programs Coordination Unit has been established at MOFED to effectively coordinate all
ongoing development projects including the PBS I. This unit was engaged in facilitating the work flow of


                                                     81
responsible MOFED operational arms and support in their endeavor to meet the required results. Because
of this Unit establishment the flow of information and reports among the governments at all levels and
development partners has been improved.

In general, the performances of Governments at all levels, in preparations, negotiations, coordination,
fund disbursement, implementation, operation, procurement, follow up and monitoring of the PBS
activities was very good and rated satisfactory.

Ministry of Health's Performance
Establishing a separate unit under Ministry of Health with key experienced personnel assigned on a full
time basis was found to be successfully relevant and effective to undertake all the envisaged activities of
the component. The procurements of various health commodities, capacity building in several areas and
strengthening of procurement and logistics of Ministry of Health and other related institutions have been
undertaken as required but slightly with delays. Health is one of sectors that shows significant results in
advancing human development. Thus, the performance of the Ministry of Health rated as satisfactory.

Office of the Federal Auditor General's Performance
In line with the agreement the Office of the Auditor General (OFAG) has dedicated to fulfill all the
required activities lies under its mandate. As a result, OFAG has been able to deliver its envisaged PBS
outputs on time and has learned in the process to become more responsive to requirements of the PBS.

Accordingly, it was able to carry out twelve quarterly continuous audits covering about seven hundred
thirty out of seven hundred seventy woredas to assess compliance with the four PBS principles associated
to the release of PBS funds for the major part of the program namely component one. Similarly, OFAG
carried out follow up audits to check whether the audit findings were addressed and recommendations
were complied with by the beneficiary woredas.

5.5 Management Agency's (GTZ International Agency) Performance
The Management Agency (GTZ International Agency), through its technical support played a big role to
assist the project in giving technical advice in the areas of contract management, Quality Assurance,
training, and information management systems and procurement. MA closely worked with the project
from the beginning of the social accountability operations and it has assisted in filling the shortfalls in
some of the key areas and its performance rated as satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
PBS is a good one and the lessons from its implementations as well as its successes should be
disseminated and replicated in similar future intervention. The following pertinent issues can be cited as a
learning ground for future interventions:

       Involving all stakeholders at all levels particularly participating in the design, need assessments,
       implementations and monitoring and evaluation of the projects had created ownership of the
       project and this could be considered as one of the lessons drawn from the implementations of PBS
       I.
       The high level ownership, existence of PASDEP, commitment and leadership by the Government
       at all levels was instrumental to the success of the PBS.
       The World Bank and its collaborating development partners and other stakeholders and the high
       commitment in conducting road show at beneficiary regions in continuous manner were critical to
       the project success which could be considered as one of the lessons extracted from this
       intervention.




                                                    82
       Appropriate organizational structure is a key issue with the huge influence on the success of any
       project specially integrated, inter-sectoral projects like PBS that involve a large number of
       agencies and activities.
       One of the lessons which could be drawn from the implementation of the project is the successful
       links and smooth interactions between federal, regional and woredas as well as with the various
       development partners had made commendable contribution to the successful completion of the
       program.
       Using the existing government financial system and ensuring the government ownership were one
       of the major reasons to the success of PBS implementations which complemented by systematic
       and comprehensive support to enhance capacity particularly at local level.
       World Bank support for PBS implementation not only helped to leverage additional financing
       from other development partners but also contributed to better harmonization, improved
       development partners coordination, joint planning of technical assistances and joint accountability
       for results by using pooled arrangements and common reporting systems.
       As owner of the project the Government of Ethiopia's commitment was evidenced by the constant
       engagement in all activities including the review of PBS I by federal and regional and other
       implementing agencies at all levels. At regional levels all authorities including the presidents of
       the regional councils oversaw the overall implementations of PBS in the regions contributed for
       the success of the program.
       We have noted that institutional strengthening is a long term process which cannot be achieved
       within a lifetime of a single intervention.
       In terms of overall management both the Government at all levels and development partners in
       many ways displayed significant flexibility in dealing with the challenges that faced during the
       implementation of PBS I and this could be considered as one of the success stories of the program
       and could be drawn as a lesson for future interventions.

7. Conclusion
PBS, even though it was a new instrument and different from other instruments implemented in the
country, has contributed to mobilize the necessary financial and technical resources to protect and to
promote the delivery of basic services by regional and Woreda governments and perfectly suited to the
development agenda of the country. All those involved in the implementation of PBS have made earnest
efforts to implement planned activities, as rightly signified by results recorded during the implementation
of the program. PBS allows increasing block grants transfers from the Federal Government to Regions
and commensurately from Regions to Woredas.

The program also supported the government effort in promoting transparency and accountability by
reinforcing to finance the implementation of its public finance management reform program which has
been on board prior to PBS I. In this connection, budget disclosure has now become a regular activity at
all levels of governments. The continuous audit exercise also provided opportunities to evaluate public
finance management capacities at lower level. The audit outcomes hinted to the government where
discrepancies are and where more effort is needed to improve the financial and other operational
capacities. The PBS implementation contributed to improve the working harmonies among government
institutions starting from federal to regions and woredas and the flow of reports.

On the other hand, PBS on top of contributing to the overall financing capacity in the budget, efforts
made to respond to its requirements enhanced reporting capacity at all levels. Moreover, the program
created momentum to speed up reports from Woredas to Regions and from Regions to Federal. Hiring
more accountants and information technology personnel from the project finance as well as capacity
building activities that have been undertaken under the project are contributing to improve public
financial management and roll out the reform process throughout the country.



                                                    83
The FTA tools have promoted transparency and accountability and expected to deepen transparency and
accountability at all levels of governments. These tools build confidence among communities and citizens
to better understand budget processes and information.

Similarly the recruitment of the Management Agency (GTZ International Services) for managing Social
Accountability brought new knowledge and build capacity on social accountability approaches.

8. Recommendation
It is extremely important to tell a story that underlines to a sufficient extent the successes and potential of
the project in contributing for the efforts of the country's development endeavors. PBS I have proven to
be a more effective instrumental in supporting the implementation of country owned plans including
decentralization, good governance, service delivery and the MDGs ownership, leadership and delivery of
results are key. It has contributed to the implementation of the capacity building program of the country.
The relationship among Government and development partners has been strengthened and trusts among
all stakeholders have been built. Moreover, the Government believes that this instrument is very
important and useful, hence, its decision to continue with the PBS.

The Government is devoted to scale up the best practices of PBS I to all over the country. In this context,
the development partners need to deeply understand the trends, development and achievements recorded
through the implementation of PBS I which would have positive impacts towards common objectives of
accelerating growth, promoting service delivery and poverty eradication. It is important to maintain the
momentum of the existing effective relationship between development partners and government who has
clearly demonstrated commitment, leadership and delivered results in terms of growth and enhanced
service delivery. Despite this, and the needs being great, Ethiopian still receive aid, in per capita terms,
half of sub-Saharan averages.

Therefore, the Government urges its development partners to scale up supporting the development agenda
of the country to enable it to achieve the MDGs targets by fully implementing the country's development
plans of PASDEP.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Joint Donors Statement on the PBS I Implementation Completion & Results Report

PBS Design

The PBS instrument was designed in response to a difficult governance situation, which was threatening
to reverse the significant progress towards achieving key human development indicators in Ethiopia.
Development Partners are appreciative of the strong and effective leadership role the World Bank played
in the design, preparation and appraisal of PBS 1. Moreover, the World Bank was able to galvanize
strong international donor support for the programme, in the context of rapidly deteriorating relations
between donors and the Government of Ethiopia.

The design of an alternative and innovative instrument in response to the post 2005 election governance
shocks was timely and demonstrated a sound analysis of the nature of the governance challenges and risks
to the country's long development. The emphasis on protecting and scaling up the delivery of basic services
while enhancing accountability, transparency, and ensuring fairness in the allocation of budgetary resources
to regions, was consistent with the Government's own poverty reduction strategy and its commitment to
decentralization. Furthermore, the objective of protecting basic services reflected international experience
highlighting the importance of maintaining critical support for core poverty reduction interventions in the
event of shocks. The key principles underlying the design of PBS I (additionality; fiduciary responsibility;
fairness; and accountability) were well conceived and appropriate, considering the challenging governance
context and the heightened risks of political capture of resources intended for basic services. The focus on
strengthening accountability and expenditure tracking mechanisms at sub-national levels and fostering
social accountability to enhance citizen voice around budget and service delivery outcomes was particularly,
important.

Development Partnership

PBS I embraced the Paris declaration principles of aid effectiveness, including harmonization, use of
country systems, joint reviews and alignment to Government's priorities. Indeed, the harmonized and
inclusive approach adopted by the World Bank in the design, review and dialogue processes (such as the
JRIS and JBAR) and in the use of country systems was a key factor in securing a shared commitment to
the PBS goals and principles. The World Bank facilitated the engagement with a broad range of
stakeholders, including civil society; this proved useful in building consensus around key concerns,
particularly the need for effective accountability safeguards.

We recognize the importance of the World Bank's role in specific aspects of harmonization, notably the
establishment of Multi Donor Trust Funds, through which most of the donor funding for PBS I was
channeled. Although the overall transaction costs of managing the partnership and coordinating with the
Government proved high (as noted in the ICR), DPs believe that PBS serves as a model of effective
development partnership in Ethiopia.

Programme Monitoring & Implementation Support

PBS I was a complex and challenging programme in many respects. First and foremost, its
implementation involved a multiplicity of government institutions at both federal and regional level, and
numerous development partners. The coordination of a programme of such scale and complexity was
always going to be challenging, requiring an effective mechanism, and the requisite capacity.



                                                   85
The creation of the PBS Donors Secretariat, which is hosted by the World Bank, and jointly financed by
partners, proved invaluable in augmenting collective donor capacity for monitoring programme
implementation, coordinating activities with sector ministries and MoFED, and supporting the analytic
work through the JBAR. Continued support to the PBS Secretariat by DPs will be necessary to sustain the
required monitoring requirements for PBS II.

Development partners are highly appreciative of the strong implementation technical support the World
Bank staff provided to the programme, though, deployment of adequate staff to handle a number of PBS
implementation issues, such as public financial management, procurement and safeguards, was slow
initially.   We believe that joint efforts and the World Bank's readiness to adapt to evolving
implementation challenges, contributed significantly to PBS I implementation achievements. DPs
appreciate the concrete steps taken by the World Bank to improve its supervision capacity in the later
stages of PBS 1, and particularly for PBS II. Locating the task team leader in country has also been
critical.

Government Performance

The Government's readiness to embrace a new type of instrument with a strong accountability and
transparency agenda was crucial in moving forward with PBS. Development partners are also
appreciative of the fact that Government was able to manage and coordinate the programme effectively,
despite capacity challenges. The capacity to manage and coordinate the programme with sector ministries
and regions has been further enhanced under PBS II. Generally, DPs found the Government responsive to
issues arising from the PBS I joint reviews.

Conclusion

The Development Partners welcome the opportunity to comment and provide their insights and
perspectives on the design of PBS I, its implementation performance, outcomes, and key lessons learnt.
Development Partners concur with the ICR assessment of PBS I, including the lessons learned and
recommendations. PBS has, indeed, proved an effective instrument for supporting Government's core
service delivery objectives, deepening the decentralization agenda and laying the foundation for enhanced
citizen participation around the budget processes. Going forward greater focus on strengthening the
Monitoring & Evaluation Systems and enhancing the dialogue with regions and sectoral ministries not
only on access, but also on effectiveness and service delivery outcomes will be necessary.

Annex 9. Social Accountability Under PBS I

1.      The focus of this Annex is on social accountability activities (SA) under PBS I (Component 4).
The preparation of this Annex by the ICR team has benefited from both primary and secondary sources of
information. (The Annex was prepared by consultants Gabe Korajian and Muhammad Mussa.) The ICR
team has reviewed relevant documents on the progresses and challenges made in the implementation of
the SA Component of PBS I. Some of the documents reviewed include the PBS PAD, PBS additional
funding document, MA (GTZ) periodical reports, Aides-Memoire and others. The team has also
conducted interviews with a variety of stakeholders, including officials from the government at federal
level, donor agencies and CSOs. The team has also visited woredas and selected communities in
Oromiya, Tigray and Dire Dawa. During these field visits, consultations were held with the woreda
administrations and WOFEDs, CSOs and community groups.

I.   Country Context and Background Analysis

2.       Component 4, Social Accountability (C4, SA) engages citizens and Civil Society Organizations
(CSOs) in pilot activities to enhance budget literacy and downward accountability in the context of
decentralized service delivery. SA aims to enhance access to and quality of basic services delivered to
citizens. It relies on constructive dialogue that brings ordinary citizens, CSOs, local government
institutions and public service toward a common vision of effective service delivery and improved
accountability. The concept of SA underlies both the rights and the corresponding responsibility of
citizens by ensuring services provided is efficient, effective and transparent. SA aims at improving
responsiveness at the implementation stage of government policies and programs. By getting involved in
assessing the performance of service providers, citizens are able to impact the quality of services
provided.

3.      However, if one looks at the history of Ethiopia, transparency and accountability between
government and its citizens have rarely been practiced. That situation stems from the belief that
government is supreme and does not owe citizens any explanations. As a result of this relationship, face-
to-face communication between civil servants and citizens has always been limited and the doors of
public officials have not been readily accessible to ordinary citizens.

4.       In a recently published news article, the Ministry of Capacity Building had this to say about the
relationship between the government and the citizens: "For centuries Ethiopians were told the government
was supreme and citizens were the servants. Citizens thought of themselves as servants and the public
service officials thought of themselves as the masters. Now, here we are trying to change this mind-set of
the Ethiopians by telling them that the citizens are supreme while the government is there to serve them.
The old mind-set that still dominates the Ethiopian culture creates serious impediments for reforms the
government is trying to introduce."

5.       Predominantly an agrarian society, Ethiopia was governed by feudal rulers until the overthrow of
Emperor Haile Selasssie by the Derg Regime in 1974. During the time of the Emperor and before, the
concept of social accountability was not part of the accepted norms and citizens were discouraged to
engage in any form of discourse with the government. The feudal administrations were top heavy,
hierarchical and paternalistic in nature. Citizens were looked upon as servants. However, although
demonstration of displeasure was discouraged, people in top government positions and possibly the
emperor himself occasionally accepted grievances from the public and addressed them on a selective
basis, depending on the seriousness of the matter.

6.      During the Derg administration, citizens both in rural and urban areas were organized at the
kebele levels (lowest tier of government). They were forced to attend regular meetings on political


                                                   87
indoctrination, mainly focusing on socialist/communist ideology. Various forms of complaints coming
from citizens were seen as antirevolutionary; and anyone demanding his/her basic rights was severely
punished. Despite the brutality of the Derg military regime, it stayed in power for seventeen years until it
was overthrown by EPRDF in May of 1991.

7.       Since the coming of the EPRDF government to power, Ethiopia has undergone changes in the
administration of government services and has decentralized most decision-making capacity to local level
institutions. In support of decentralization, the government has embarked on major initiatives such as the
Civil Service Reform Program (CSRP), Public Sector Capacity Program (PSCAP), Woreda Capacity
Building Program (WCBP), Plan for Accelerated and Sustainable Development Plan to End Poverty
(PASDEP) and the Business Processes and Reengineering Program (BPR.) BPR has been the focus of
attention for the current government in the last two years. The main objective of BPR is to improve the
quality of services and proper time management that meets the need of its citizens.

8.       Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) have existed in Ethiopia since the 1920s. These include
CSOs with significant foreign funding as well as local membership-based associations. The latter focus
on aiding families during death and funeral rites; organize members belonging to the same church or
mosque denominations; act as charitable foundations for women; and a few others. Eddirs are the most
popular of these membership-based organizations. Their duties include facilitating the burial ceremony of
the deceased; and providing the bereaved family with a fixed amount of money, food, kitchen utilities and
a tent to hold the attendees. It is estimated that there are over 200,000 Eddirs operating in Ethiopia.

9.       Until the early 1990's, planning and budgeting in Ethiopia followed a top­down approach
without citizen engagement. Planning was initiated at higher levels without taking into consideration the
priority needs of citizens. There was no financial transparency regarding public funds; but the budgetary
institutions were accountable to the Treasury as the auditing and reporting systems were very strict. Since
the early 1990's, participation and accountability have been a part of the development strategy of the
government. The introduction of PBS has been an additional instrument in strengthening transparency
and accountability at different tiers of government. Interviews with government officials and others
indicate that the country was on a path to enhanced financial transparency and social accountability, but
PBS accelerated this path and promoted changes that would not otherwise have occurred, at least not
within a similar short span of time.

10.     Along these lines, Financial Transparency and Accountability (FTA) activities, financed by
Component 3 of PBS I, have been rolled out for the first time in the country's history. Budget disclosure
is now a part of the budget call and preparation process. At the federal level, MOFED made available on
its public website data on budget allocations and in-year outturns. Disbursements to the regions and
woredas ­ by woreda ­ were also available. Similarly, regional level data on budgets is available to both
the People's Representatives (regional parliament) and through the press. Budget data is either posted at
the woreda offices or in rare instances printed in the local media.

II. Social Accountability - Component 4 of PBS I

11.      PBS Component 4 (C4) aimed at strengthening the use of social accountability approaches by
citizen and civil society organizations as means to make basic service delivery more effective, efficient,
responsive and accountable. The Component sought to:

    a. Enhance transparency of the budget process and to engage citizens and civil society in budget
       literacy;




                                                    88
    b. Strengthen the voice of citizens and civil society organizations and enhance downward
       accountability in the context of decentralized service delivery; and
    c. Assess the experiences gained under the various initiatives supported in this component,
       disseminate these lessons and prepare a scaling-up of effective social accountability approaches.

12.     While PBS Component 3 on FTA sought to enhance financial transparency and downward
accountability, C4 focused mainly on strengthening of the demand side of government service delivery to
increase responsiveness and accountability. Both Component 3 and 4 would emphasize on building the
necessary bridges between the supply and demand sides.

Institutional Arrangements for the Implementation of Component 4

13.     The activities of Component 4 were financed by a Bank-administered Multi-Donor Trust Fund
(MDTF), consisting of contributions from DFID, CIDA, the Irish government, the European Commission
and the Dutch government. The implementation was managed by a management agent (see below). A
donor group, the Transparency and Accountability Group (TAG), provided oversight of the activities of
financial transparency and social accountability.

14.       The management agent (MA) was recruited on a competitive basis by the World Bank. GTZ
International Services and a local partner, Center for Development Consultancy (CDC), were selected.
The MA was responsible for overall component implementation, providing technical assistance and/or
capacity building, networking, and facilitating support as needed including the provision and supervision
of all trainings conducted for service providers, service user and CSOs.

15.     The main task of the MA was to coordinate and support the piloting of SA approaches by
appropriate CSOs, and promoting a learning process through monitoring and reporting of results. The
MA acted outside the government structure and was guided on overall policy and strategic direction
provided by the Steering Committee.

16.     A Steering Committee (SC) was formed to provide guidance and direction to the MA. It
comprised of representatives, in equal proportions from the government (Finance and Economic
Development, Capacity Building, and Justice Ministries), CSOs (CRDA, PANE, and CORHA) and three
representatives from the development partners. The chairperson was H.E. State Minister Mekonnen
Manyazewal.

17.     The selection of CSOs was undertaken by the MA. After calling for Expressions of Interest, 96
national CSOs responded. A final version of the revised guidelines and scoring criteria approval was sent
to all CSOs. The MA organized an information meeting for the CSOs and received proposals from 47
pre-qualified CSOs. The proposals were evaluated by a Selection Committee appointed by the MA. The
Committee took into account issues of regional coverage, diversity of CSO types and gender. Twelve
lead CSOs with their partners organizations were selected to pilot the projects, comprising a total of about
45 CSOs.

Overview of the PBS Social Accountability Activities

18.      Prior to the launching of the social accountability (SA) pilot projects, two demonstration projects
were commissioned in two locations, Ledeta Sub-City of Addis Ababa and Debre Birhan. The purpose of
these demonstration Projects was to pre-test SA concepts, approaches, and tools/instruments. The
projects were contracted to two local CSOs, Zema Setoch Lefitih that worked on Water and Sanitation
and Initiative Africa focusing on participatory budgeting.


                                                    89
19.      The two demonstration projects had specific objectives:

         Pre-test various SA concepts and approaches;
         Provide a learning lesson for other CSOs;
         Introduce SA tools and instruments and initiate actionable activities at the woreda level; and
         Identify lessons learned and best practices that will help in the design and implementation of SA
         pilot projects in Ethiopia.

The Twelve Pilot Projects

20.     Following the two demonstration projects, lessons learned were imported into the 12 pilot
projects. Each pilot tested one or more tools in specific sector or sectors, and the duration of the
implementation was 18 months. The pilot projects were implemented by 12 lead CSOs and their
implementing partners, for a total of 45 CSOs. These CSOs were operating in the Oromia, Tigray,
SNNPR, Amhara, Beni Shangul-Gumuz, Harari and Somali Regions, as well as in the cities of Dire Dawa
and Addis Ababa. A total of 86 woredas and cities/sub-cities, and over 300 kebeles were covered. Most
of the CSOs focused on education followed by health, water and sanitation, and agriculture.
21.      The following tools were tested in the projects:

                 Community Score Card (CSC);
                 Citizen Report Card (CRC); and
                 Participatory Budgeting (PB).

22.     Nearly all CSOs adopted the CSC. The PB tools (budget literacy and expenditure tracking) were
used by four CSOs in 11 woredas. Three CSOs worked on CRC in 8 woredas. In addition, all CSOs
applied methods of Right Based Approaches, Focal Groups and Interface Discussions, and Participatory
Planning and Monitoring instruments.

23.      An introductory workshop on piloting of SA was held for the CSOs before the launching of the
pilot projects. The participants were provided background information on the PBS framework and good
governance initiatives. SA tools were introduced to the more than 95 participants from federal, regional
and local governments and the twelve grantee (lead) CSOs. Project implementation guidelines,
developed by the MA, were distributed. African Regional Seminars on Participatory Budgeting were
organized around the theme of "Strengthening Budget Transparency, Participation and Independent
Oversight", and were attended by selected CSO grantees and members of the Steering Committee.

24.     Workshops were held on "External Communication" for 30 CSOs. Participation in the ANSA-
Africa Stakeholders, two-day seminar held on "Growing Social Accountability Networks." The seminar
was attended by 120 participants from 30 African countries. The workshops held included a Regional
Capacity Building Workshops on Budget Literacy (in Dire Dawa) and Regional Capacity Building
Workshops on Moderation and Facilitation in five regions to train facilitators for the 12 projects. The
MA provided additional technical and advisory support to grantee CSOs and IPOs on a demand basis.

25.     The success of the pilots depended on a number of factors including the approaches followed by
the CSOs (and which of the tools were tested ­ CSC, CRC or PB). The MA prepared a capacity building
strategy whose objective was to increase the level of understanding on social accountability. The capacity
building strategy was approved by the Steering Committee and work commenced. Workshops organized
by CSOs that included local governments were used as an approach to create a conducive working
environment and improve the dialogue between the service providers and service users.

CSO Work on Budget Literacy

A group of five CSOs led by Rift Valley Women and Children Development Association (RWCDA) piloted SA
initiatives in 11 woredas of the Oromiya region. The CSOs had started piloting the SA initiatives in the woredas
where they were active in service delivery activities before the SA initiatives. In collaboration of the regional
BOFED, they conducted training programs on the PASDEP, MDGs and the Components of PBS. Then, sensitization
was made on the different activities of the SA initiatives.

This training was an eye opener on the work of the CSOs with the woredas and they linked the SA activities with the
good governance package of the government. Steering Committees (SCs) were then initiated by the CSO and
established at the woreda level for organizing the development activities in the woredas including the transparency
and accountability. The SCs are composed of different sector offices and chaired by the Deputy Woreda
Administrators ­ the CSOs are observers in the SCs. The SCs then assisted in establishing kebele budget monitoring
groups (KBMG) composed of 24 members from different community members (youth association, women
associations, the elderly and religious groups) ­ this structure was the entry point for the CSOs in promoting social
accountability and transparency.

Training was conducted on budget literacy and expenditure tracking. The CSOs used their own tools for budget
literacy since the government FTA tools developed under PBS C3 were not ready.




Main Achievements of SA Activities

26.    The following are among the main achievements of the SA activities under PBS I Component 4.
They were widely reported in interviews undertaken by the ICR team and several were also highlighted in
the GTZ reports, as indicated. 12 Most were also reported in the Intensive Learning ICR Stakeholder
                         13
Workshop of March 2010.

         The most striking achievement is the increased understanding of the concept and purpose of SA
         that has occurred in the pilot woredas among government officials, communities and the CSOs.

         Another important achievement emerging from the interviews conducted and from the various
         reports is the improvement in communication between service providers, communities and CSOs
         triggered by the interface meetings.

         Consensus reached in the interface meetings helped service providers and service users to identify
         service delivery problems and come up with solutions. In some cases, these changes have already
         resulted in improved service delivery. It is also notable that all kebele and woreda officials
         interviewed reported that the SA approach contributed toward more effective service delivery.

         There has been a significant positive shift in the sense of ownership by the communities of the
         service delivery process and their own roles and responsibilities. This was repeatedly reported
         during the ICR team's interviews as well as by several of the CSOs.

   Intensive learning ICR Stakeholder Workshop Report, March 23-24, 2010, p. 1.



                                                           91
       The Community Scorecard (CSC) was widely piloted and emerged as the most effective and
       popular of the social accountability tools in all the reports, community meetings, and mission
       interviews as well as in the discussions in the Intensive Learning ICR Stakeholder Workshop of
       March 23-24, 2010.

       In many cases relationships between woreda staff and CSOs have significantly improved.

       SA activities appear to have helped increase participation in community activities by women,
       particularly in taking responsibility in community committees as well as in women's associations.

       The ICR team learned during the interviews that the pilot projects in most cases had enhanced the
       capacities of the CSO through "learning by doing." This was also noted by GTZ.

       In some of the woredas where the SA has been piloted there was a better understanding by the
       public on budget processes, especially among those who participated in budget literacy activities.

Experiences from Field Visits in Tigrai, Oromia, Somali and Harari Regions

27.     The following are some specific examples of change in attitudes and improvements in service
delivery that were attributed to the SA pilots by woreda officials, SCO representatives and community
members interviewed by the ICR team.

 a. In a Harari health center, interface meetings helped address absenteeism of health officers and
    improve the supply of medicine. The maternity department now is more responsive to women's
    needs and has improved its services, including offering testing for HIV.

 b. Female citizens, who often had poor access to public offices, told the team that they are now treated
    better and that they find woreda and kebele offices more accessible than in the past. For example, a
    woman in Haramaya who had participated in the SA projects said that she is no longer afraid of the
    government when it comes to defending her rights to be treated equally when requesting services.
    She says that she no longer sees public servants as masters and citizens as servants, and because of
    her ability to speak out, she and her friends say they are now receiving better services.


 c. In a surprise visit to Al Negash Woreda in Tigray Region that had an SA pilot implemented by
    REST, the ICR team interviewed five farmers and a priest who had all attended the training courses
    and participated in the project. They shared the following experiences which they said were results
    of the pilot activities:

            "We are not afraid to talk to service providers and discuss with them what is needed in the
            community."
            "We can now walk into government offices and discuss what needs to be done because we
            practiced this in the interface meetings."
            "The interface meetings gave us the experience to openly discuss with service providers
            what we want."
            "Now we know that we have the ability to cooperate and work on community problems
            which in turn require us to take responsibility by doing our part of the job."
            "Because of the project we now have a few more water points in our community."
            "We also participate in our schools through PTA and provide our input to improve education
            in the community."


                                                  92
  d. Interviews were conducted with patients, community representatives, health workers and
     administrators at Kasech Assefaw Health Center in Mekele. The health center was part of the SA
     pilot implemented by the Womens' Association of Tigrai. The interviewees reported that based on
     the use of the Community Score Card at the beginning of the project, two main issues were
     identified as major problems: lack of sufficient medicines and unsanitary conditions. The interface
     meetings between service users and providers that subsequently took place discussed and agreed on
     solutions to the problems which were incorporated into an Action Plan for improving the
     conditions.

  e. As a result, the quality of the health center and its services are monitored by both the staff and the
     users and have improved; the bottlenecks in the supply of drugs have been addressed; the health
     center is clean; staff attendance has improved; and community representatives are now formally
     participating in decision-making, with a representative on the health center's Board. Kasech
     Assefaw Health Center was recently classified as a model by the Ministry of Health, and health
     workers from different parts of Ethiopia have recently came to learn from its experience.

  f.   In a site meeting at a newly built elementary school in Somali Region, outside of Dire Dawa, the
       coordinator of the Zonal Administration reported on the utility of the interface meetings: the school
       was built after the community and the government discussed the problem of school facilities. A
       new water point was dug to provide clean water to the students and staff. Separate washrooms for
       male and female students were also built. A PTA was established. Since the formation of the PTA,
       teachers and parents meet regularly to discuss problems facing the school. Both teacher and student
       absenteeism have decreased.

  g. Talking to a Kombolcah Administrator from the Oromia Region, the ICR team was told that the
     interface meetings had served as a "mirror" where he could see himself and his problems more
     clearly, and had helped him and his administration understand the needs of the community and gaps
     that existed in service delivery. Although the process of involving citizens in helping to solve
     problems is not often practiced, he felt this had provided ownership to members of the community
     in much needed services.

  h. The Deputy Administrator of Harar in the Harari Region who was involved in the pilot project from
     the beginning provided a typical response to the question of training: He felt there now is a better
     understanding of the woreda's responsibility regarding the needs of service users. As a result of
     improved dialogue through the interface meetings, the community now shares an ambulance with
     neighboring towns, a service that they can use when needed. They have also placed a solid waste
     bin in the community. However, he also identified the following challenges:

               "Trust did not exist between service users and providers in the past and still today it is
              something we need to work on daily."
              "We face high turnover of staff at the woreda level...most of the service providers who took
              the training in SA are no longer working for the woreda."

(i)    In an interview with the Mayor of Kombolcha Woreda in the Oromia Region, the Mayor shared the
       following challenges:

              "The relationship between service users and providers is still not as good as expected, which
              needs to be worked at."
              "Service users think we can do everything for them while they are slow in taking their own
              responsibility."
              Old habits are hard to die."


                                                     93
III. SA Tools and Approaches, and Sustainability

28.     Three social accountability tools were piloted: Community Score Card (CSC), Citizen's Report
Card, and CRC) and Participatory Budgeting (PB).

29.      The Community Score Card turned out to be the most appropriate of the tools.14 It was found to
be user friendly as well as providing an appropriate basis for interface meetings between citizens and
service providers to find solutions to the identified problems. On the other hand, the Citizen Report Card
was found to be less suitable in many cases because it involves a randomized survey, for which special
skills are required. However, it also provided the basis for useful interface meetings.

30.     Participatory Budgeting was found to be less useful in the pilots, because it seemed too difficult
to use for most citizens, many of whom can neither read nor write. Moreover, in most cases only a very
small portion of the woreda budgets is allocated for capital investments for which citizens could
potentially have a say.

31.     Regarding the adoption of these three tools, it is noted that the CSC was implemented
successfully in most pilot woredas, whereas the CRC was successfully implemented in only eight
woredas, by three CSOs, which reflects its limited suitability. The PB was implemented in only 10
woredas, which also reflects the difficulties of using this particular tool.

Approaches used in the pilots were as follows:

1. Providing awareness and training on SA to citizens, service providers (regional, zonal and woredas)
using interactive training:

32.      Despite the shortcomings in quality and the limited knowledge of the trainers commented upon
by some of the interviewees, the overall impact of the awareness-creation and training sessions was
generally considered positive. Virtually all of the citizens and other stakeholders interviewed said that
they had learned a lot about SA, its meaning and potential, and, above all, how to employ SA in their
interactions.

2. Identification of problems using participatory techniques in focus groups, employing a matrix format:

33.     This approach was not quite so straightforward at the outset; some group members and facilitators
had difficulty in developing and using the matrix, which required some degree of education. However,
once the technique had been mastered, they were able to utilize the matrix.

3. Interface meetings, in which service providers and service users discuss identified problems:

34.     The interface meetings proved to be one of the highlights of the process adopted. For the first
time, service users and service providers were gathered in a room and engaged in constructive dialogue.
Secondly, the interface meetings, which commenced with different assessment of the same service by
each side, was found to enable each to see the other's viewpoint, and for the service users to appreciate
the constraints on the service providers, which had not happened before.

35.      In summary:

14
   The suitability of the CSC is also noted in "PBS SA in Pilot Project in Six Woredas of Tigray Region" (REST-GTZ-ESAP, c.
2009, p. 20). A complete description of the CSC may be found in Care, Malawi, The Scorecard Toolkit.



                                                           94
 Implementation Technique/Approach                   Comment
 Awareness-creation and Training                     Despite shortcomings, impact was generally positive.
 Problem identification using participatory          Technique required more training. However, once mastered, it
 techniques                                          proved effective.
 Interface meetings                                  These were characterized by constructive dialogue, understanding
                                                     of others' viewpoints, and members' seeing themselves through the
                                                     eyes of the others. Overall impact: very positive.

36.     Taking into consideration the fact that the pilot projects were geared toward creating learning
process, the main objective of which was to test the tools, it is too early to assess sustainability. However,
the ICR team found in a number of cases that signs of sustainability are already emerging. In some cases,
these have arisen through CSOs, which developed strategies to sustain the achievements;15 in other cases
they have arisen from the basic design of the project. For example, in visits to regions and pilot woredas
where committees and councils were established after the project was completed, the pilots had let behind
sustainable impacts:

     (i) A health center in Tigray Region now has ordinary citizens on the Board. In addition, the
         members on the Board are from different sectors, including government, ordinary citizens, and
         the private sector and health officials. These improvements have come about as a result of the
         pilot projects.

     (ii) In the Harari Region, a woreda had asked the CSO to provide the roster of individuals who had
          received training in budget literacy, in order to invite them to attend the council meetings on the
          woreda budget and provide their input. After receiving the names, the woreda council made sure
          that they were invited for the budget discussions and their inputs were highly appreciated by the
                  16
          council.

37.      GTZ also found cases where strategies to sustain and institutionalize SA approaches had been
developed.17 It must nonetheless be noted that in most cases sustainability has not been fully achieved.
This is to be expected since these are pilots with a limited duration, and sustainability is to be addressed
in the design of the next phase of SA activities under PBS II.

IV. Social Accountability Under Component 4 - Challenges and Lessons Learned

38.     The next phase of social accountability (SA) activities, under PBS II, will await the results of an
independent Evaluation and Design Consultancy (EDC) which is ongoing at the time of writing. The
lessons learned and messages in this section are not meant to substitute for the findings, analysis and
recommendations of the EDC which are expected in July 2010. This annex should be regarded as interim
observations.




15
   In the GTZ reports, GTZ reports that developing strategies to sustain best practices was included as one of the tasks in the MA-
CSO Agreements.
16
   These CSO initiatives, aimed at ensuring sustainability, are discussed in more detail in Derash Relief & Development
Organisation, 2009, p. 6.

39.      In the Intensive Learning ICR Stakeholder Workshop a number of specific challenges were
identified. 18 According to the MA, some of the challenges reported can be attributed in part to the
following constraints that the MA faced:

       i. The number of pilot projects had originally been planned to be six but was later increased to 12,
          causing capacity problems for the MA.
      ii. The initial US$100,000 allocated in the first year for capacity development was not enough as the
          MA had spent US$60,000 on the first large-scale workshop in Addis. The US$40,000 for the rest
          of the year was inadequate. (The significant increase of funds in the second year gave the MA a
          chance to provide additional training.)
     iii. The implementation period was relatively short, due in part to a relatively long procurement and
          contracting process for the MA, which took a year.
     iv. Donor pressure to work at a faster pace, without realizing the constraints, created problems for
          the MA.

40.      Combined with those noted by the Mission during the interviews and those reported in the GTZ
reports, some of the major challenges and lessons learned are as follows:

Institutional Issues and Government Involvement

     It is impressive and unprecedented in Ethiopia that the government agreed to a component financing
     independently implemented social accountability projects, overseen by a high-level Steering
     Committee with membership by three important government ministries and chaired by a State
     Minister of Finance. This demonstrates high-level government involvement and ownership of the
     process. However, the ownership of Component 4 has not been shared broadly across government
     actors, neither at the federal, regional nor woreda levels. This situation is understandable, because
     Component 4 consisted under PBS I of a series of pilots, implemented by a managing agency outside
     the government system.
     In the next phase, steps need to be taken to enhance government ownership in a broad manner
     in SA activities, at all levels of government, with a view to enhancing sustainability, and also to
     establish stronger linkages between SA and FTA activities. These steps could include establishing
     focal social accountability people at the federal and regional levels, as is planned (and well under
     way) under PBS II for FTA. It is even possible that the FTA focal people under PBS II would also
     address SA issues, and that the FTA training (at regional and woreda levels) incorporates SA training.
     Decisions will be taken on what the appropriate structure for the next phase is, after the current
     evaluation of the pilots is finalized and fully analyzed.
     It was observed that government-affiliated CSOs tended to have more success in obtaining the
     confidence, and therefore support, of woreda government staff, which in turn enhanced the chances of
     success of these pilots. But even with the CSOs that were not affiliated to the government, the right
     types of efforts could enhance the chances of cooperation and collaboration with woreda staff. In
     particular, in order to enhance knowledge and cooperation regarding SA on the part of government
     staff, an important lesson is that future pilots should utilize to a greater extent Interface Meetings,
     since these proved to be successful instruments in finding common ground and communication
     between government staff and citizens.19 As noted in the previous section, Interface Meetings had

   Intensive Learning ICR Stakeholder Workshop Report, March 23-24, 2010, pp. 1-2.
19
   Although the initial Interface meetings between service users and providers were quite argumentative as a result of disparities
between service users and service receives, it was probably the first time these two groups came face to face and openly
discussed community problems. The Kombolcha Woreda Administrator in a discussion session with the mission said that the
interface meetings served him as "Mirror" where he could see himself and his problems clearly. He continued to say that the


                                                               96
    very positive impact. In addition, government-affiliated CSOs, independent CSOs and
    government officials should be involved in trust building workshops.
    Woreda capacity building should incorporate adequate training of members of woreda councils
    who play key roles in making decisions in budget utilization and service delivery.

Community Issues

    There were expectations from the communities that CSOs would come with resources for water
    points, health services etc. This led to problems when these expectations were not fulfilled. To
    overcome this, a key lesson is that guidelines should be developed for the modus operandi of the
    initial approach by an NGO/CSO to a community, to ensure that these expectations are
    minimized and that the community is fully aware of the nature of the SA activity before it begins.

    Throughout most of the pilot projects, the deep-rooted community mind-set of what GTZ referred to
    as "too much respect" for public service providers was a serious challenge.20 Thus at the beginning
    there was hesitation by citizens to address poor service delivery. This was eventually overcome. But
    in future efforts, to mitigate this problem, additional awareness and training should be provided
    both to service providers and service receivers, that is, mixing these two groups together from
    the beginning, and discouraging separate training. In order to address the cultural difficulties
    involved in introducing the concept of SA to traditional communities, it is recommended that the
    CSOs be given more intensive and in-depth training and guidance in how to handle initial
    community meetings.

Project Design and Activities

    To improve further coordination in design, the woreda-level administration (including the councils),
    the CSOs and citizens should all be engaged in the designing of the project.
    Project training tools should be prepared before the project commences.
    The training CSOs received was not adequate and lacked continuity; even though through
    engagement in the projects they learned a lot and became more efficient. An important lesson is thus
    that every CSO receives at least two weeks of training in SA by the Management Agent at the
    beginning of the implementation of the project.              Additional training through the
    implementation stage and close monitoring (including of the effectiveness of the training) is also
    recommended.
    The Community Score Card (CSC) was found to be the most effective and user friendly in general.
    Therefore, the use of CSC should be encouraged. The CRC and PB SA tools were in general
    found to be somewhat difficult to implement, at least in the setting of these pilots.21 And so, their use
    should be minimized, except in the case of larger communities, where further consideration should
    be given to how to implement the Citizen Report Card (CRC) effectively. Whatever is done, it is


interface meetings helped him and his administration understand the needs of the community and gaps that existed in service
delivery. Although the process of involving citizens in dialogue is not often practiced, he was very pleased to see community
participation leading to a higher level of awareness which provided ownership to members of the community in much needed
services. 
20
   "Piloting Social Accountability in Ethiopia, Analytical Report with Case Studies, June 2009, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, GTZ June
2009, p. 35.
21
   This is likely due to the context of Ethiopia where FTA and SA initiatives are new. In countries like Ghana with more
advanced citizen participation initiatives, more complicated tools like PB have been quite effective.



                                                             97
       important to note that implementing more than one SA tool in a pilot project often turns out to be
       more than the CSO and community can handle.22

       If any one project tried to cover 2 or more regions, this turned out to be difficult as it required extra
       resources, and better communication and coordination. The lesson here is that CSOs should cover
       one region only in future efforts and the project should be implemented within a 100 km radius.

       Financial Transparency and Accountability under Component 3 progressed slower than had been
       expected at the outset, e.g., the Budget and Expenditure and Layperson's Tools were not finalized
       before the end of PBS I. This hampered linkages between Components 3 and 4 in the pilots. Now
       that the tools are rolled out and FTA team established in the regions and woredas, a key focus of
       future SA activities should be to enhance the effectiveness of FTA on the ground, including by
       linking them with interface meetings

Capacity Issues

       The MA was not well staffed to adequately address the demands of 45 CSOs; especially much needed
       training and coaching of the CSOs. Supervision was generally weak. The close attention needed by
       CSOs was lacking, and there were complaints that the feedback from the MA to the CSOs on the
       results of the M&E was inadequate or not timely. There were also some complaints from DPs about
       the process of recruitment of the MA; they felt that they had not been sufficiently involved in this
       process, although the procurement was acknowledged to be fully competitive (using the stringent
       Quality and Cost Based Selection method, with international advertisement etc.).

       In the opinion of the ICR team, given their shortage of experienced staff, the MA and its local partner
       delivered the training and supervision to the best of their ability, but were constrained by the fact that
       social accountability is a relatively new concept in Ethiopia. Furthermore, some of the complaints
       from the MA listed above (e.g., unanticipated increase in the number of pilot projects from 6 to 12,
       and lack of sufficient budget for capacity development in the first year) likely had an impact. It is
       unclear whether a different MA, resulting from a different recruitment procedure, would have resulted
       in an improved situation regarding training, supervision, MA staffing, etc. Nevertheless, in future
       efforts, steps need to be to be taken to ensure that the hired Management Agent has extensive SA
       experience. And, appropriate adjustments need to be made (e.g., more budget provided to the
       MA for certain activities) if the number of pilot projects or scope of activities is increased
       beyond what was originally anticipated, as happened in this case when the number of pilot projects
       was increased from 6 to 12. Overall, the MA should receive funding commensurate to the scope of
       project implementation activities.

       Consideration should be given to having more than one MA, for example by having additional MAs
       in the regions.

       In general the lack of knowledge and experience by the selected lead CSOs and their partner CSOs on
       the concept of Social Accountability was a major challenge of the pilot projects. However after
       become familiar with the concept of SA and by applying it on the ground, CSOs improved their
       performance, particularly in terms of implementation.
       It was generally considered that the selection and recruitment of the lead CSOs to implement the
       project was conducted fairly and professionally. However, the Selection Committee appears to have

22
     See, for example, "PBS SA in Pilot Project in Six Woredas of Tigray Region" (REST-GTZ-ESAP, c. 2009), p. 19.



                                                              98
     put too much weight on the technical quality of their proposals, and might have missed some CSOs
     that had capacity and were familiar with the concerned regions and woredas with good background in
     the local culture and languages. In future efforts, when selecting the lead CSOs, relatively more
     weight should be placed on familiarity with local culture and languages and their standing and
     experience in the particular region.
     On the other hand, the selection and recruitment of the CSO partners reportedly left a lot to be
     desired. Many of the partner CSOs did not possess sufficient awareness or knowledge of SA, nor the
     capacity to discharge their responsibilities effectively, often requiring additional extra work and time
     by the parent CSOs that could have been spent in other areas.23 In a few cases project money was not
     fully utilized because of lack of capacity. A key lesson is that the MA's contract should ensure
     adequate involvement of the MA in the selection of the CSO sub-contractors.
     In addition, the hiring of consultants for the CSOs was problematic due to the shortage of suitable
     consultants, 24 and delays in recruiting them. The MA should be required to train capable
     consultants (at least two weeks intensive training) who have experience in SA issues.

Annex 10: Findings From Local Investment Grants Component Review
              (for 10 woredas from field visits conducted from January to April 2010)


Achievements

       All woredas demonstrated strong commitment to the project.
       All woredas have appropriate staff for planning at local level and most woredas have kebelle
       plans.
       All woredas have a functional modified cash basis double entry accounting system.
       The financial management and accounting system, especially that dealing with the regular
       government recurrent budget, is functioning well.
       All woredas have some experience of goods procurement.
       All woredas have established units that deal with environment and social safeguard issues.
       Environment and social safeguard screening of capital investments initiated and underway.
       Physical implementation of specific projects in woredas has generally been satisfactory with
       average completion rate of 81 percent for projects started in EFY 2001.
       The overall technical quality of most projects implemented so far has been found satisfactory.
       The Technical Output assessment has been carried out. As per the Table below, 69 projects were
       inspected by consultant engineers on the review team and 58 projects (84 percent) were found to
       be of "satisfactory technical quality."

Issues constraining further progress

Planning and Budgeting
     Uncertainty regarding the availability of capital funds for EFY 2002 for 99 woredas and EFY
       2003 for the 48 new woredas (following DFID and KFW postponement of release of funds).
       There is now a financing gap in both years which, if not quickly addressed, has the potential to
       seriously disrupt the whole LIG program since woredas have planned and are implementing
       projects based on promises/commitments made to them in regard to release of funds.
     Uncertainty regarding availability of fund for EFY 2003 for the 51 1st round woredas.
     No clear-cut methodology or procedures on how sector plans and kebele plans are integrated at
       the woreda level.
     Kebele plans are not incorporated in the woreda plans.
     Although there are planning guidelines in the regions, there is no standardized procedure that
       guides the woredas and kebeles in the production of plans.

Recommendations:
    Issue of funding for EFY 2002 and EFY 2003 should be addressed as soon as possible and
      woredas advised.
    MOFED has prepared a Planning Guideline and this should be finalized and the necessary
      training and support given for its implementation.


                                                   100
Procurement Management
     Almost all works procurement were not handled by the woredas but delegated to the zones.
     On goods procurement, there were some shortfalls in that all the 10 woredas did not follow
       proper bid opening/evaluation procedures.
     Some regions decided, as part of regional policy, to use registered SMEs on works contracts and
       these SMEs were given direct offers without competition.

Recommendations:
    Works procurement and implementation should be handled by the woredas and they should
      establish engineering office or unit with appropriate staff.
    Training should be provided at regional level on specific aspects of procurement where woredas
      are experiencing problems.

Financial Management
     Only four woredas out of the 10 woredas have implemented IBEX with one abandoning it.
        Those that have implemented it are experiencing networking problems.
     There is a multiplicity of bank accounts in woredas (between eight and 13 bank accounts).
     There are problems with the quality and timely submission of FMRs/IFRs.
     Long delays in the LIG fund transfer process (i.e., six months into the year) and this has affected
        implementation.

Recommendation:
    BOFEDs should, together with MOFED, address the IBEX installation and networking problems.
    The issue of the multiplicity of bank accounts in woredas should be addressed.
    MOFED, should as soon as feasible, arrange training on LIG Financial Management Manual for
      BOFED and woreda officials.

Environmental & Social Management
    No awareness on the LIG ESM and RPF and the need to screen safeguard for public capital
       investments.
    Screening of safeguard issues by woredas is yet at preliminary stage.

Recommendations:
    Training should be provided on the ESMF and RPF.
    Woredas and regions have been provided with an Operational Summary of the ESMF and model
      screening forms and should screen all projects implemented and to be implemented.

Monitoring & Evaluation
   The monitoring and evaluation plans and reporting system of all woredas are still preliminary.
   No specific arrangements or initiatives have yet commenced to establish the M&E framework
       under the program.

Recommendation:
    Finalize the M&E guideline and provide the necessary training and support for implementation at
      federal, regional and woreda levels.

Technical Quality Review of Capital Investments
    Major crosscutting issues for all works
        No engineering service in almost all visited woredas.
        Lack of experience and knowledge in procurement of works at woreda level.


                                                 101
         Contract Administration and supervision in most cases handled at Zonal level.
        Roads
         Lack of design (geometric design, alignment design).
         Lack of direction and awareness on the type and class of road eligible at woreda level.
     Water Supply
         Preference for high-technology options.
         Inadequate access to spare parts.
        
Actions planned and already taken to address some of the issues and constraints

Planning and Budgeting
    Planning Guideline prepared and being reviewed. Should be finalized and distributed to all
       regions and woredas by June 2010.

Environmental and Social Management
   The review team prepared an Operational Summary and distributed it to the woredas visited and to
      BOFEDs for them to distribute to all the other LIG woredas.
   The team also assisted the woreda officials in four woredas in completing two model screening
      forms for two of their projects which will also be used to screen all projects implemented in EFY
      2001 and to be implemented in EFY 2002. The model screening forms were also provided to the
      BOFEDs to distribute to the other LIG woredas not visited. The BOFEDs will instruct these
      woredas to screen all projects implemented in EFY 2001 and to be implemented in EFY 2002.
      This exercise is planned to be completed by April 30, 2010. Reports on progress to be prepared by
      woredas/zones/regions/MOFED as per formats in new LIG M&E Guideline/System.
   It is planned to carry out training on environmental and social management for woreda and
      regional officials. The training will be held in Addis Ababa and in each of the regional capitals.
      This is to be one by June 2010.
   MOFED Safeguards Specialist has been appointed (April 2010) and will accompany review team
      to the remaining five woredas to be visited.

Annex 11. PBS Relative to Other Instruments

1.         PBS was the right instrument in the right time and place. 

2.         It was very well suited to achieving what was required at the time: 

           Sustain aid flows in the face of almost certain donor withdrawal of budget support, in 2005/06;
           Ensure funds were targeted to the service delivery level; and
           Adapt to Ethiopia's changed expenditure system, following the shift to woreda-level spending (as
           part of decentralization to the woreda level) in 2002/03.

3.      In these circumstances, PBS was an instrument that was innovative, different from other
instruments and almost perfectly suited to the conditions, despite the fact that it crafted in a very short
space of time.

     I.        Introduction

4.      This note explores the attributes of PBS as an instrument of external assistance, its pros and cons
from the points of view of both the Bank and the government, and how it fit within the wider Ethiopia
assistance program.

5.    The analysis is based on extensive interviews with current and past Bank staff, senior
Government officials and staff of other donor organizations, 25 as well as a detailed review of the
documentation on PBS, and the Bank's assistance program more generally.

     II.       PBS in Context: Understanding the History

6.      To understand the role and design of PBS as an instrument, it is important to locate it in the
longer-term evolution of Bank assistance to Ethiopia.

7.      Although it differs from its predecessors, PBS is in many ways the latest in a string of support
operations that began in 2000. They started with the Economic Rehabilitation Support Credit (ERSC),
followed by the Economic Structural Adjustment Credit (2002), and two Poverty Reduction Support
Credits (both in 2004), which led into the Protection of Basic Services project (2006).

8.       Although the balance shifted over time, all five operations had components or reform objectives
related to public expenditure management, human development through increased pro-poor spending and
better service delivery, and in the case of the first four, private sector growth. (See Table A11.1). 




25
  Interviews were conducted with Bank staff who managed the country program, carried on the macroeconomic dialogue, and
worked on the specific sectors; with senior officials in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development as well as sector
ministries, and with officials from other donor organizations.

        Transparency
      Source: Adapted from World Bank (2008b).

9.      At the end of the war with Eritrea in 2000, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia and the President of the
World Bank met and reached an understanding that the Bank would provide US$700 million in support
for stabilization and rehabilitation of the country following the war, and re-launch a major effort to
expand primary services (education, health, and basic infrastructure) and improve human development
outcomes.

10.      The ERSC was the first operation in this program. It was successful in its objectives of
stabilizing the economy and reallocating expenditure to poverty-reducing sectors. 26 It was much less
successful in the reform objectives (centered around private sector development, and public sector
management), partly because the government and the Bank had very different perceptions of what was
intended. As a subsequent review by the Bank's Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)27 noted: "Indeed,
the attempt to introduce reform elements... antagonized the government (which believed Ethiopia had
been promised unconditional assistance) and may have set back the reform in the longer term by
hardening positions prematurely on both sides."

11.      The follow-on ESAC was intended to carry forward the reform agenda, while still supporting the
shift to pro-poor spending, and continued macro stabilization. However under time-pressure created by
urgent balance of payment needs, the reform objectives and expected follow-up actions from ERSC in
areas such as fertilizer policy, telecom sector reform and privatization, were downplayed or omitted.

12.     ESAC was followed with a series of PRSCs, intended to carry forward the reform and pro-poor
service delivery agenda. They were also to serve as a vehicle to scale up assistance to Ethiopia, with
substantial parallel budget support from bilateral donors, in line with the general thinking on the role of
PRSC's in the Africa Region at the time.

13.     The PRSC program was intended as a series of three single-tranche operations, with each
operation outlining the actions and triggers for the next in an ongoing program of reform and
strengthening. It was also thought that budget support through PRSCs would gradually replace SWAps in
health and education.

14.   Each PRSC operation had similar areas of focus: strengthening public sector and expenditure
management, rural development, PSD and human development. In the words of the IEG evaluation: "It

became apparent early on that the Bank and the government had inconsistent expectations. All of the
rural development and PSD issues had been on the agenda of either ERSC or ESAC, and the Bank had
hoped to be able to agree to further actions under the PRSC program. But it was not possible to reach
agreement on specific actions." Because of disagreements, particularly over telecoms sector reforms, the
Bank reduced the amount of PRSC I from US$150 million to US$120 million. Similarly PRSC II was
reduced to US$130 million because of inadequate progress on PSD. (However as discussed
subsequently, the resources were not lost to Ethiopia; the funds that were cut were added on to other
operations.)

15.     PRSCs I and II made progress in expanding budget support and improving governance for service
delivery and human development 28; but the outcomes were rated as Moderate.

16.    Unsatisfactory for promoting PSD, financial sector development and rural development, under
PRSC II even progress on institutional performance slowed, and experience with the human development
Component was mixed.

17.    The main lessons that were drawn from the experience with the PRSC instruments by the ex-post
IEG review29 were:

     (i)     The Bank moved too quickly to direct budget support; and that it was premature for the human
             development sectors;
     (ii)    On PSD, there was not a shared understanding and expectations between the Bank and the
             government;
     (iii)   The Bank relied too heavily on budget support, leading to the risk of program failure;
     (iv)    Effectiveness in rural development and education suffered from the lack of complementary
             programs; and,
     (v)     PRSC improved donor alignment but ultimately proved no more flexible than other forms of
             aid. The program was cut, but not enough, when it turned out that the government support for
             PSD and rural development was weak. When a major dispute arose over governance, the
             entire program was terminated."

18.     By late 2005 the landscape had shifted considerably, and the PRSC sequence was suspended, to
be replaced by PBS I. The political violence and crackdown following the 2005 elections had led to a
threatened wholesale withdrawal of bilateral support, and pressures on the Bank that undermined the
constituency for further Budget Support to Ethiopia.

19.     Preparation of PRSC III was halted, and the Bank engaged in an urgent dialogue with the
government to try to find a way of saving assistance so that the progress made to date in the social sectors
would not be reversed, and the poor who received basic services did not suffer as the result of reduced
funding. At the same time, in several sectors, the Bank no longer had in place broad sector development
support programs (like SWAps) that could finance basic services; the devolution of spending
responsibilities in Ethiopia in 2003 (under which woredas, or districts, were provided funds from the
regional governments in the form of block grants, which they were notionally free to spend as they saw
fit) made it difficult to tie funding to specific sectors or activities using traditional Bank lending
instruments. (There were a number of sector-specific projects in the portfolio but only addressing smaller
subsets of sector activities mostly at the Federal level. Mechanisms for tying aid to specific sectors at
regional/woreda levels, given the newly decentralized system, were not readily available at the time, at
least not as part of traditional SWAp-type instruments. However, more recently broad sector programs

adapted to the new decentralized context of the country have been introduced. For example, the General
Education Quality Improvement Program (GEQIP) provides funding partly through a specific-purpose
grant which provides earmarked funding to regions and woredas for specific education activities.)

20.      PBS was developed as an instrument is response to these conditions. (In fact PRSC III, which
had been appraised, was transformed into PBS I). Aid was notionally earmarked to finance recurrent
delivery of basic services, and an additionality test was introduced to ensure that funds provided by PBS
donors for service delivery by regional/woreda governments would be truly additional to those financed
from own government sources. 30 The requirement of the additionality test under PBS I was that the
government's contribution to the federal block grant to regions from its own sources would need to
increase by at least 10 percent every year in US dollar terms. This was accompanied by agreement on a
series of intermediate outcome indicators, as well as measures to ensure fairness, increase accountability
and transparency in local spending and carry forward the process of fiscal decentralization.

21.      It was an elegant design. But inevitably one instrument cannot address too broad a range of
policy issues and at the same time fully address the strengthening of sectoral service delivery, and clearly
a mix of instruments is needed. What PBS as an instrument was, and was not, suited to achieving is
discussed in the subsequent section.

    III.    A Short Aside on the Macroeconomic Context
22.      The primary goal of PBS was to support the provision of basic services but it also had a
secondary goal of serving a stabilization function, like the ERSC and ESAC had done. Approximately
US$350 million of budget support had been scheduled for 2005/06, and withdrawal of this amount of aid
(which represented some 10 percent of public expenditure, and about 2 percent of GDP) would have left
the government with a significant financing gap, and potentially threatened macroeconomic stability.

23.     In the immediate term serious macroeconomic disruption was avoided. However by 2007/08
Ethiopia was facing a full-blown crisis, brought on by a combination of the worldwide global crisis and
rapidly rising fuel and import prices, and excessive government expenditure and borrowing. Inflation
soared to 61 percent,31 foreign exchange reserves fell to less than a month's worth of import cover, and by
mid-2008 the country was in dire macroeconomic straights.

24.      During the last major crisis the ERSC had successfully promoted stability, and in conjunction
with the Fund's PRGF program, helped set the stage for sound macroeconomic management for several
years in the face of difficult external circumstances32. At this time however there was no Fund program in
place, and only limited engagement under PBS on purely macroeconomic issues.

25.     In the end, the government managed its way out of the crisis by a combination of a significant
contraction of public spending and aggressive exchange rate management. Subsequently there has been a
re-engagement with the IMF, and resumption of a robust macro dialogue involving the Bank and the
Fund.

26.      The following sections summarize what may have been gained, and what may not have been
gained, by using PBS as an instrument. It draws on the interviews and documents around PBS, but also
on evidence from wider analysis of trends in Ethiopia and the contribution of PBS (discussed in Annex
3). The assessment is mostly from the point of view of the Bank's dialogue and program, and while some
of it is specific to Ethiopia, much of it is intended to inform thinking about the wider use of PBS-type
instruments in other countries in the future (especially given the range and mix of instruments at the
Bank's disposal).

What Was Gained as A Consequence of PBS?

         Sustained aid financing for critical social services, in an environment in which it was difficult to
         use traditional sector SWAps or other traditional sector instruments due to the recently
         decentralized nature of public expenditure. The data suggest in the wake of the withdrawal of
         budget support in 2005/06, PBS had a significant protective effect on government expenditures as
         a whole, but particularly on regional expenditures (see Annex 3).

         Sustained macro-level aid inflows, and thus balance of payments support, to Ethiopia; in
         particular, PBS provided an instrument that enabled continued transfers in the face of politically
         difficult conditions, in a way that pure budget support could not do.

         A deepening of the `special relationship' between the Bank and GOE (as a consequence of having
         developed the instrument and thus of having saved budget support), which almost certainly
         bought the Bank more policy influence than it would have otherwise enjoyed (in spheres well
         beyond those covered by PBS).

         Preservation of the relationship between the government and donor community more generally.
         In December 2005 when budget support donors sent a letter to GOE saying they were not able to
         continue funding, there was a real crisis of trust between the government and the external aid
         community. PBS provided a means for major bilaterals (e.g., DfID and CIDA) to justify
         continuing their support, and others (such as the EU) subsequently became engaged, because they
         did not want a full rupture of their relationship with the Ethiopian government.33

         A place at the table for the other donors in the macroeconomic dialogue in Ethiopia, through the
         Joint Budget and Aid Reviews (JBARs). Although the reviews focused mainly on fiscal transfers
         and expenditure composition, they also provided PBS donors with an opportunity not previously
         had to engage with the government, the Bank and the Fund on the broader macroeconomic
         framework.

         A continuing engagement in supporting decentralized service delivery in Ethiopia, particularly
         decentralization to the woreda level, which started in 2002/03. There is significant evidence of a
         positive impact of decentralization on service delivery (see Annex 3), which PBS supported via,
         among others: (i) providing significantly increased resources to regional and woreda levels
         (underpinned by the requirements of the additionality criterion ­ see above); (ii) strengthening
         capacity especially at decentralized levels (e.g., through continuous audits and hiring of large
         numbers of accountants under Component 3, strengthening woreda-level planning and ability to
         manage local capital spending under the Local Investment Grants of Component 1b); and (iii)
         enhancing transparency and accountability at all levels, including of regional and woreda
         governments.
33
   Furthermore, the health Component allowed many more donors who could not finance the budget-support-like component to
still be `part of' PBS, and participate in the broader dialogue on transparency and accountability.



                                                         107
         Greater engagement with the regions; the focus on decentralized expenditure and service delivery
         deepened engagement of the Bank with regional and woreda governments, and the JBARs also
         stimulated debate between the regions and the federal government over fiscal decentralization
         issues.

         Strengthening of health procurement (bottlenecks in procurement and distribution of medical
         commodities had been a major issue previously in the health program; Component 2 of PBS had
         to deliver a lot of resources in a short period, and although there were still delays, the
         concentration of effort led to a building up of logistical and procurement capacity).

         The beginnings of a shift to greater accountability and transparency in public spending and
         service delivery (through activities such as the posting of budgets in public places, and social
         accountability pilots with civil society organizations, discussed separately elsewhere ­ e.g., in
         Annex 10).

         Greater innovation at regional and woreda levels to try different approaches toward decentralized
         service delivery, facilitated in turn by rapid increases in available resources from the block grant
         and also through Local Investment Grants (Component 1b). For example, with a rapidly
         increasing overall envelope, it has been possible to experiment with different and improved
         formulae for distributing federal block grant resources to regions, and regional block grant
         resources to woredas, without any one region or woreda experiencing a reduction in the level of
         its allocation when moving from one year to the next (even though it may experience a fall in its
         share of the total pool due to a change in the distribution formula).34 This type of experimentation
         would be politically more difficult to do if it led to reduced allocation levels (as opposed to
         shares) for some regions or woredas.

         Resolution of the problem of being unable to track expenditure composition after it had been
         devolved to the local level (which had been a significant issue in 2006). The requirements for
         reporting expenditures, more timely closure of regional accounts, and demands of the JBARs, put
         pressure on the lower levels of government to improve expenditure tracking. PBS provided
         assistance in doing so, and provided the opportunity to increase the size of the block grants
         significantly as a quid pro quo.

         PBS worked through, and built on, government systems, and thus both avoided duplication of
         effort, and reinforced the efforts to strengthen domestic systems (e.g., the bulk of the funding was
         for Components 1a and 1b; this funding was mixed with Treasury resources and flowed through
         regular Treasury channels to regional and woreda governments).

         Part of the benefit in terms of strengthening decentralization was probably indirect (but
         significant): it is possible that Component 1, the provision of financing to the woredas, had as
         much, or more, of an impact in strengthening the capacity of local-level government and service
         delivery (through ensuing the provision of adequate resources with which to act, and thus be
         taken seriously), as did the strengthening through technical assistance and capacity building under
         Component 3.




34
  A new formula is being phased in for the calculation of regions' shares of the total pool of federal block grants. The new
formula takes into account regions' individual service delivery needs (it is "needs based") and is considered a substantial
improvement over the formula that was being used previously.



                                                           108
What Was Not Possible To Achieve with an Instrument Like PBS?

27.      This section highlights some of the things that an instrument like PBS was less well suited to
achieving, relative to ­ for example ­ development policy-based lending, budget support or more sector-
specific instruments (SWAps or otherwise). This is not to imply that PBS should have (or was intended
to) address all the areas that these other instruments were better placed to address, but exploring them
does serve to illustrate the importance of having a complementary mix of instruments in place.

[Note: At the time PBS was formulated it was not feasible to develop new sector-specific projects (e.g.,
SWAp) in Ethiopia, for most sectors (because of the devolution of spending decisions to local
governments); nor was it feasible to continue untied budget support (due to the political crisis). So the
Bank lacked other instruments (other than PBS) to address, in parallel, program strengthening in the
sectors, or reinforce the macro dialogue, or carry forward the growth-related reform agenda (although as
was seen earlier, little progress was being made in this area under the budget support operations
anyway).]

28.      PBS was not as well suited to achieving the following:

         A voice in the nuts and bolts of service delivery and reform issues specific to individual sectors;
         PBS was too generalized to get into these nitty-gritty issues, with the exception of the health
         sector which had its own specific component under PBS.35 Views are mixed on this, but among
         Bank and donor sector staff there is a sense that PBS alone was not an adequate vehicle to carry
         forward the necessary dialogue on structural and program changes needed to make service
         delivery more effective within the sectors. (By contrast, PBS was much better suited to
         addressing certain crosscutting cross-sectoral issues that were relevant to service delivery,
         especially at decentralized levels ­ this was one of its main goals).

         At the time PBS was formulated there were no significant complementary broad sector operations
         in place in the lending program, for the basic service sectors, with the exception of the water
         sector for which there was the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project. Even the WASH
         project at the time was limited to just one of the donors providing significant financing for the
         water sector ­ IDA ­ and thus was not a broad program as such. (Multi-partner broad programs
         were, however, subsequently developed ­ see below ­ and Component 2 of PBS I was in essence
         a sector-specific program.) The need for sector engagement was recognized by the framers of
         PBS, and the JBARs attempted to build in consultations; however, the process (and staff) was
         fully occupied with the many fiscal, decentralization, accountability and other crosscutting
         aspects of PBS, and inevitably only limited effort could be invested in service delivery reform
         issues specific to individual sectors. Furthermore, the sense among sectoral staff and donors is
         that the ministries do not see PBS as adding financing to "their" sectors (aside from the health
         sector), and have remained fairly unengaged in the PBS process. (And this matters, because
         despite the notional decentralization of authority, many major decisions on the structure of
         programs, services delivered and targeted staffing levels are still made through national level
         policy in Ethiopia.)

         Sector engagement has been deepened under PBS II, but it is clear that an instrument like PBS
         cannot alone take on the necessary dialogue and interactions required to properly address the

35
   In general service delivery, quality improvement requires very specific (and generally sector-specific) interventions like, for
example, revised management and supervision structures for outreach staff; reforms to the content of their work programs;
reforms in staffing patterns and incentives. PBS I, while contributing to some broad systemic improvements, was not able to
address these kinds of issues.



                                                              109
          range of issues relevant to each sector. Note, however, that PBS did manage to generate more
          engagement of sector staff and donors in the discussion of expenditure composition, and provided
          them with a degree of information of sector spending that many had not previously had.

          The effect on macroeconomic dialogue, in the absence of an alternative budget support
          instrument, was probably neutral ­ the Bank had had a good sustained fiscal and macro dialogue
          with the government from the late 1990s onward.36 The intensity of this dialogue flagged in about
          2007 when there was no Fund program, but has since been re-established. (While PBS provided
          a forum for sectoral staff and bilateral donors to become more engaged, the JBARs have
          essentially covered the macroeconomic framework mostly as a context for the discussion of
          spending on basic services, and have not substituted for, or materially deepened, the main
          macroeconomic dialogue.)

          Did the Bank give up any traction with the central authorities on other elements of the growth
          agenda that it had been pursuing under the previous adjustment and budget support operations?
          Probably not ­ in most cases it appears that there was no meeting of minds on the main
          outstanding issues (telecoms, fertilizer, financial sector reform and the like), and one could
          plausibly argue that little was lost by no longer having a national-level adjustment program in
          place to address these issues.

29.     The above have been viewed by some as failings of PBS I. But in fact, many of the things listed
above that PBS was not well suited to achieve were either not achievable at all, or could have been better
achieved by other instruments, such as development policy lending or budget support instruments and
sector program instruments. The appropriate way to correct these perceived "failings" of PBS would
have been to introduce these other instruments, to the extent possible, thereby achieving a portfolio with
an appropriate mix of instruments.

30.      Of course, budget support was not in practice possible for much (or perhaps all) of the period of
PBS I implementation, although it remains on the table and could be introduced into the portfolio at some
point in the future alongside PBS II. However, broad multi-partner sector program instruments adapted to
the realities of the decentralized structure of Ethiopia have been gradually brought into the portfolio.
These include the General Education Quality Improvement Program (GEQIP) (approved in FY09), the
Agricultural Growth Program (AGP (a FY10 deliverable) and a revamped WASH program (the WASH
project, approved in FY04, became a multi-partner program). The GEQIP and the new WASH program
put much of their funding toward specific-purpose grants providing earmarked funding for service
delivery at lower levels, complementing the untied block grants.

 under "Projects". In fact, it started off as a project in FY04 but later became part of a multi-partner sector program.
 Its disbursements in millions of USD were 4, 1, 6, 6 and 3 in FY05, FY06, FY07, FY08 and FY09 respectively.
 GEQIP did not disburse before FY10.
 b/ Includes fertilizer credits, Global Food Crisis Response (GFCR) Program, and Emergency Recovery and
 Demobilization programs.
 c/ Note PBS represents 40 percent of disbursements net of the extraordinary GFCR disbursement in 2008/09.

32.      As can be seen, the shift to Budget Support under the PRSCs was in fact not very pronounced.
Development policy lending - in the form of adjustment credits or budget support under PRSCs ­ has
remained fairly constant at about one-third of support to Ethiopia each year, before the advent of PBS.
The proportion of effectively untied financing has only begun to rise substantially in the past two years,
with PBS now representing over 40 percent of disbursements (net of the special GFCR funding in
2008/09). Note that in Table A11.2, WASH is classified under "Projects" rather than "Sector
Development Programs". In fact, it started off as a project in FY04 but later became part of a multi-
partner sector program (see first note below the table). GEQIP does not appear in the table since it did
not disburse before FY10. AGP also does not appear in the table since it is expected to go to the Board
later this fiscal year.

    VI.      PBS in the Context of Possible IDA Support Instruments

33.    This section seeks to consider how conditionality and financing flows might compare (or have
compared) under adjustment lending, the PRSCs and PBS; what might have happened if conditionality
were not met; and whether PBS offered a more secure form of financing than earlier budget-support
instruments. Assessing the counter-factual for these is difficult, but the following notes make an attempt,
based on the available data and discussions with donors, Bank and government officials.

34.     Did PBS represent a more stable platform for delivering support than earlier budget support and
policy-based lending?

35.     There is no indication that financing flows would have been greater with Budget Support ­ in fact
the empirical evidence (Table 2) clearly shows they have been larger with PBS. At any rate, continuing
budget support at the time that PBS I was prepared was not an option.

36.     With PBS there was less risk of not disbursing funds ­ in part because the operation was based on
policies and priorities on which there was little disagreement between the government and donors (see



                                                         111
discussion below); unlike, for example, previous PRSC operations, which were both reduced in size
because of lack of agreement over fundamental policy approaches.

37.      However, PBS does suffer from being a multi-tranche operation, which leaves financing at risk if
a true divergence of approach between the government and donors occurs. Furthermore, at 40 percent of
the current IDA program (in terms of disbursements), it puts a lot of the program at risk if things do go
wrong.

What would have happened to aid flows if conditions had not been met?

38.     The conditions for disbursing PBS funds under Component 1a ­ which accounted for the bulk of
the PBS funds ­ were completion of a successful JBAR and JRIS. Perhaps the most rigorous condition in
each JBAR/JRIS was that the federal government had to have met the additionality and fairness tests
regarding increasing transfers to sub-national governments. But the success of each JBAR and JRIS also
depended on the fulfillment of actions agreed to at the previous review; at each review a range of actions
was mutually agreed to, to be fulfilled before the next review. These actions were largely related to what
was needed to advance activities and outcomes under Components 1b (LIG), 3 (Financial Transparency
and Accountability, and Public Financial Management) and 4 (Social Accountability).  

39.     The additionality and fairness tests were ultimately met or exceeded in each period, and actions
agreed to by the government at each JRIS were largely fulfilled, so the question of not disbursing (or
disbursing a reduced amount) never arose. It seems fairly likely that the linking of these tests and actions
to Component 1a disbursements did make a difference in terms of changing behavior, although of course
observing the counterfactual is impossible. The link with disbursements does appear to have led to the
carrying out of certain actions linked to transparency, accountability and enhanced capacity that would
otherwise not have taken place, or not as quickly. The additionality test does appear to have played a role
in the very large increases in funding observed over the last few years in the federal block grants to the
regions (see Annex 3 for more on this).  

40.     In reality, little may have been the risk to the government of losing financing over the long term,
since funds are effectively fungible within the IDA envelope. (Note, for example the funds cut from
PRSC II (because of lack of agreement on telecoms) were not really lost to Ethiopia; the US$20 million
that was cut was fed back into the Productive Safety Nets Program (which increased from US$50 million
to US$70 million)).  

What other instruments might have been used? 

41.     As noted, at the time there was little choice but to develop something like PBS: policy-based
lending was getting little policy traction; PRSCs had proven too blunt an instrument to address service
delivery for human development, and anyway the political climate would not support fully untied budget
support without some form of earmarking and monitoring. The only real alternative might have been
similarly earmarked funding, but with more of a link to sector reforms and performance (e.g., health,
education and water supply) rather than to crosscutting decentralization issues. 

42.    Although PBS ­ or something like it - was the right instrument at the right time, it now seems
reasonable to consider what might be a reasonable mix of alternative or complementary instruments
moving forward. 

43.     Options might include: 




                                                   112
      a. The continuation of a strengthened PBS (along the lines of PBS II - with greater attention to
         monitoring, outcomes and performance, and maybe more intensive involvement in strengthening
         the service delivery architecture in the sectors).

      b. A shift back to broad sector-specific multi-partner instruments, but perhaps still tied to local-level
         financing (this is happening to some extent with operations like GEQIP, which provides purpose-
         specific grants to sub-national governments for particular elements of education spending).

      c. Regional-level lending: a possibility that was being seriously considered within the Bank in about
         2002, as the next step after adjustment lending in support to Ethiopia was the introduction of
         program-type operations at the regional level - either tied to specific sectors, or of a more general
         type, like PBS, (this makes a lot of sense, given the federal system and distribution of policy-
         making authority in Ethiopia ­ it is a model that has been pursued in India, Nigeria and other
         federal states).

      d. A return to national-level budget support, linked to macro performance and a set of key growth-
         related policy reforms (this would presume a level of convergence between the Bank and the
         government on some key elements of the growth agenda - convergence that has not existed in the
         past).

44.     Some combination of these instruments would likely be the optimal choice, and this debate is
taking place in the context of the CAS and lending program deliberations. Already the number of broad
multi-partner sector-specific operations has increased (e.g., GEQIP and WASH revamped), and
resumption of some form of policy-based budget support is on the table for further consideration at some
point.

      VII.      To What Extent Was the PBS Instrument a Creature of the (Very) Specific
                Circumstances that Existed in Ethiopia at the Time?

To What Extent Is It Generalizable?

45.      A number of aspects of PBS were clearly specific to Ethiopia (most notably the shift to the block
grants on the woreda level, and the need to respond quickly to threatened aid withdrawal in the face of
political upheaval). Certainly the program design represented a very tailored response to immediate
country conditions; nonetheless many elements of PBS can probably be carried over profitably to other
countries. 

46.          Elements characterizing the Ethiopia situation, that underpinned PBS include:

          General agreement on broad policy directions: a government that was pursuing many of the
          "right" policy directions: the major push on expanding financing for education, health, water
          supply and agriculture had been underway for some time; and through the dialogue on the MDGs,
          SDPRP and PASDEP, there was general government­donor agreement on the broad direction of
          national development policy.

          Effective service delivery: despite some concerns with system design and staffing adequacy, there
          was near-universal agreement that in Ethiopia service delivery systems "worked" (civil servants
          showed up for work and did what they were supposed to do; policies agreed and designed
          centrally were carried out faithfully at the implementation level).




                                                      113
        Credible national systems: the government systems of financial management (ensuring money
        does not go astray), expenditure control (ensuring budgets are allocated for their intended uses),
        and procurement had already been examined under several PERs, a CFAA and CPAR, and
        accepted as adequate for the previous budget support operations. (The major weakness in
        2003/05 was the inability to any longer track end-use expenditure, following the shift to woreda
        block grants in 2003, and as a consequence considerable effort was expended in PBS in
        addressing this, through Component 3.)

        The decentralized federal system: A characteristic of Ethiopia, which carries over to a number of
        other borrowers, was the federal system of transfers, by which monies could ­ at least notionally
        ­ be identified with transfers to the regions. What was helpful, and perhaps more specific to
        Ethiopia, was the fact that there was in place a tier of the government that had only responsibility
        for frontline, poverty-related expenditures, so the channeling of PBS financing down to this level
        almost assured a one-to-one mapping with priority expenditures.

        A track record of sound macroeconomic management: Ethiopia had, since at least the end of the
        1998 war with Eritrea, followed cautious fiscal and monetary policies and carefully managed
        macroeconomic stability, and external and internal balances. (In fact, it was only beginning to
        lose control ­ through external pressures and excessively rapid increases in spending, at about the
        time PBS was initiated.)

        Financing was earmarked for areas of in which there was policy agreement: PBS financing, to
        the extent it was notionally "earmarked" was allocated to those elements of the PASDEP program
        where there was the most agreement, and least disagreement, between donors and government
        over resource allocation and broad policy direction (primary education, primary health care, etc. ­
        as opposed to, for example, agricultural inputs, TVET, investments in power and telecoms
        expansions, where there was substantially more controversy). The question of course is the
        extent to which fungibility of funds dilutes this notional earmarking.

47.      One of the most interesting aspects of PBS financing was the attempt ­ largely successful ­ to
insulate aid financing that clearly benefits the poor from being at risk due to short to medium-term
political upheaval. (A similar case could probably be made for insulating such funding from short-term
macroeconomic mismanagement.)

48.      One can think of a large number of countries and circumstances in which this would potentially
apply. The risk of course is that, once the operation is committed to, the incentives are such that leverage
to influence these broader outcomes is diminished. In a sense one could argue that we were lucky with
PBS; that the political crisis of late 2005 passed, and the need to withhold financing was never tested. In
the end - at least in these circumstances - PBS proved a more reliable and predictable means of providing
financing for basic services than budget support would have.

49.      One main conclusion to be drawn regarding having this sort of instrument quite dominant in the
lending program, is that to have the maximum impact on the effectiveness of service delivery, it needs to
be matched with significant sector-specific operations. And to ensure there is adequate traction on the
macroeconomic and growth agenda, it is possible that it may need to be paired with some form of
development policy lending at some point, although the manner in which this should be done needs to
further analyzed and looked into.

Annex 12. Donor Harmonization

     I.   Context

1.      The Protection of Basic Services (PBS) project provided a framework for the support of basic
services delivery and enhancement of transparency and accountability, with enough flexibility for the
support of development partners (DPs) to be provided in line with their agencies' sometimes differing
requirements. PBS provided a foundation on which to strengthen partnerships with joint accountability
for results between the Government of Ethiopia (GOE) and DPs in the decentralized delivery of basic
services, while working to achieve greater efficiency in the use of common management arrangements
and systems. Throughout preparation and implementation of the first phase of the PBS, the project
enjoyed strong support from both GOE and the DPs.

2.      The PBS is supported by nine DP agencies aside from the Bank of which seven (CIDA, DFID,
EC, Irish Aid, KfW (partially, to support the PBS Secretariat), the Netherlands, and Spain) provided
cofinancing via Bank-administered Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTF), using the following pooled
arrangements and common procurement and financial management processes: (i) parent MDTFs
TF070499 and TF070801 with recipient (GOE)-executed child MDTFs TF056885 and TF090445
respectively, each supporting Components 1a and 3; (ii) parent TF070539 with recipient (GOE)-executed
child TF056942 supporting Component 2; (iii) parent TF070559 with recipient (Management Agent)-
executed child TF057683 supporting Component 4; and (iv) parent TF070732 with Bank-executed child
MDTF TF058321 supporting the PBS Secretariat (see below).37 KfW put funds into the parent MDTF
supporting the PBS Secretariat, but not into the other MDTFs.

3.       The remaining DP agencies (AfDB, Austria, and KfW (for Component 1a)) provided parallel
financing with funds directly channeled to GOE. IDA's total financing of close to US$444 million for the
first phase of PBS has leveraged significant donor financing of close to US$814 million equivalent of
total project cost for the first phase. Of the total amount leveraged from other DPs, US$660 million have
been channeled through Bank-administered MDTFs.

4.       Political tensions that followed the 2005 elections resulted in, among other effects, suspension of
budget support. As a result some DPs based their decision to withdraw budget support on the perceived
risk related to governance, particularly the risk that unconstrained budget support could be vulnerable to
political capture or diversion from the core priority of basic service delivery. At the same time, both the
Bank and major donors did not want the poor of Ethiopia to suffer as a result of reduced aid to Ethiopia or
suspension of direct budget support. It is in this context that some DPs opted to channel their funding
through the Bank to enable them to support and help protect the delivery of basic services, especially for
the poor.

5.        The contributions to the first phase of PBS are shown in Annex 2 (Tables A2.1, A2.2 and A2.3).

6.       A separate MDTF (TF070732) was also established at the beginning of PBS to finance the
establishment of the PBS Donor Secretariat to support the PBS Donor Group in the monitoring,
coordination and assessment of project performance and progress, helping to facilitate smooth
implementation, and for policy dialogue with government. Staffed with both international and national


37
   Out of these 5 parent MDTFs, the following closed already or will close on June 30, 2010: TF070499, TF070801 and
TF070559 (totaling $660 million equivalent). This ICR also serves as a completion report for these 3 parent MDTFs (and their
child MDTFs). Parent MDTFs TF070539 and TF070732 (and their child MDTFs) are being extended beyond June 30, 2010 and
will be linked to PBS 2.

consultants, the PBS Secretariat implemented a set of five core activities: (i) planning and preparation for
joint reviews (i.e., semi-annual Joint Review and Implementation Support Mission (JRIS) and Joint
Budget and Aid Reviews (JBARs)), and monitoring and evaluation; (ii) fiscal/financial data collation and
analysis, including sector analysis; (iii) collaboration with a range of partners, government institutions,
including sector ministries, technical and sector working groups to ensure effective communication and
cross-fertilization of ideas and information; (iv) external communications and publicity; and (v)
administrative support and other project monitoring as required. Development Partners contributed both
in cash and in kind contributions for the PBS Secretariat. DfID, Irish Aid, KfW and the Netherlands
provided cash contributions to the MDTF totaling close to US$1.12 million equivalent; CIDA and EC
provided in-kind contributions. The Bank provided the facilities (with equipment, logistics, etc.) to host
the Secretariat.

    II.      What Worked Well

7.      IDA financing for PBS has leveraged Additional Financing from other Development
Partners, allowing for a scaling up of development impact. Use of pooled arrangements and common
reporting systems has contributed to better harmonization, improved donor coordination, joint planning of
technical assistance and joint accountability for results.

8.      The comparative advantage of the Bank in leadership expertise and in providing quality
oversight in terms of fiduciary responsibilities carried out for the most part with CO-based staff was
acknowledged by Development Partners. The DPs mentioned that PBS could not have happened without
the strong leadership of the Country Director and the strong (and multi-disciplinary) task team, which
included a TTL who excelled at negotiating with the government and listened to all stakeholders. The
TTL competently handled pressures that resulted from managing a high visibility project with many DPs,
including high-level donor representatives.

9.      Government ownership and strong support from the development partners for PBS has
culminated in a strong partnership for supporting basic services delivery, while also strengthening
transparency and accountability. Joint accountability for results has contributed to the process for scaling
up results.

10.     Development partners were able to support program innovations, in particular work to
increase financial transparency and accountability (Component 3).

11.     Streamlining the Joint Review and Implementation Support (JRIS) process from quarterly
to semi-annually, agreed jointly between GOE and Development Partners, helped to reduce frequency of
reviews. In turn, time saved was used to increase focus on implementation and working toward the
achievement of results on the ground.



                                                   116
12.     Implementation of MDTF activities followed Bank procurement and financial management
guidelines and procedures. The use of Bank rules did contribute to a reduction in transaction costs on
the side of the Development Partners since most of their field offices were not sufficiently staffed to
provide such oversight. Bank fiduciary staff from both headquarters and the country office provided
assistance as well as informal capacity building to GOE staff.

13.     The Bank played a lead role in project supervision, providing a fairly comprehensive
quality oversight for PBS activities. This role enabled the Bank to leverage additional resources from
Development Partners to ensure the enhanced supervision of all components of a complex and multi-
sector program such as PBS.

14.     The Bank was proactive in strengthening partnerships. As part of this, the Bank was efficient
in managing and coordinating MDTF activities, often exercising flexibility to accommodate Development
Partners' urgent or special requests. While this could be taxing at times, it has, contributed to forging
positive and trusting relationships with development partners.

15.     For the most part, Development Partners who channeled their cofinancing through MDTFs
were able to indicate their multi-year contributions to the project, important aspects of project planning
and financing, which aided the cooperative nature of the project.

    III.       Areas Requiring Further Improvement

16.     There were several aspects related to the implementation MDTFs that did not work as smoothly
as they could have:

Need to further strengthen harmonization

           There was a high degree of donor harmonization but it was not always possible to harmonize the
           schedule of fund transfers by individual MDTF DPs since they have their own fiscal years and
           institutional requirements. This can make it difficult to coordinate and plan for the availability of
           resources required for the project.
           Receiving additional and/or originally planned contributions from contributing partners less than
           six months before the closing of the MDTF did not help implementing entities to effectively use
           the funds to help achieve development objectives.

Communication

17.      The terms and conditions of Framework Agreements between the World Bank and Development
Partner Institutions at the headquarter level are not always communicated down to the Development
Partners at field office level. This shortcoming can lead to unnecessary delays with the timely
establishment of MDTFs. The Administration Agreement with the European Community was signed six
months later than expected in part due to the lack of clarity on provisions of Framework Agreements
agreed at headquarter level.  

Management Agent of Component 4

18.     During the ICR, the Development Partners voiced their concern about the perception that the
agent hired to manage Component 4 on social accountability lacked the respective expertise. After a
competitive process, GTZ took over as management agent in June 2007. The agent did not know the
subject area and had to learn "on the job" resulting in much hand holding and capacity building by Bank




                                                       117
staff, including DP technical staff, who had scarce time resources. (See Annex 9 for more on this issue,
and on the recruitment process of this agent.)  

Reporting

19.     Although DPs did receive quarterly unaudited financial statements and an annual management
assertion that their funds were being used for intended purposes, they indicated the need for additional
and solid financial reporting especially on project commitments and disbursements.  

20.      Extensive reporting on PBS was provided to DPs as part of the JRIS/JBAR process, important
elements to the donor harmonization process. Notwithstanding, DPs expressed the desire to receive more
detailed reporting. Although a senior staff in Washington D.C. did have this role, DPs felt that while the
staff responded to their inquiries wisely and efficiently it would be best to have a (more junior) staff
recruited in Addis for the sole purpose of providing detailed reports to DPs. To this end, resources
provided by some DPs to support the enhanced supervision of PBS can be used to recruit this staff in-
country.  

21.     Although training was provided, most donors had not attempted to use the Bank's Donor Portal
and some did not know their agency's password. The ICR mission team provided additional guidance on
using the Donor Portal upon request.

Program Secretariat and Steering Committee

22.      The PBS Program Secretariat was created through an MDTF to support the PBS Donor Group in
the monitoring and coordination of the project. Although the PBS Partners' Secretariat established for the
first phase of PBS worked relatively well, some DPs perceived a lack of clarity on the role and
responsibilities of the Secretariat as well as in the relationship between Secretariat and PBS Donors. This
area is being addressed in the context of the second phase (PBS II).  

Program Management

23.      Although PBS I was management intensive, donor dialogue for PBS improved following the
relocation of the Task Team Leader (TTL) to Addis Ababa and the recruitment of a field-based TTL for
Component 4. DPs spoke highly of the TTL and the task team and that any shortcomings ­ which were
not identified - with TF Management rested on both sides. 

24.       There were delays in release of MDTF funds to GOE by the Bank due to the delay in reporting by
the woredas, which was a condition for disbursements. There were also disbursement delays attributable
to initially weak capacity of GOE to accurately prepare Financial Monitoring Reports. 

Component 4 on Social Accountability

25.      Although the activities under this component worked generally well, it stands out as being the
only one not implemented by the GOE and it may have been regarded by the government as something
that was imposed by the donors. The GOE initially perceived social accountability to be an "advocacy"
component. It was an uphill battle to get it off the ground and social accountability was introduced in a
very limited manner. Bank capacity to oversee Component 4 was initially weak since the specialist was
based in headquarters ­ a shortcoming that has now been resolved with the recruitment of a field-based
staff. In the course of implementation, the Management Agent (GTZ) was able to strengthen its capacity
to effectively carry out its responsibilities. The pilot was considered to be too big, having too many CSOs
and sectors.  


                                                   118
 

Procurement and Financial Management

26.    Bank procurement and FMS guidelines were applied to all MDTFs resources administered by the
Bank, and according to the interviews held during the ICR mission these two areas would have warranted
more extensive preparation which was not possible due to how fast the project had to be prepared. Given
the weak procurement capacity, procurement of goods especially for Component 2 was delayed. (See
more on this in the main text and in Annex 2.) 

Capacity Building

27.     Individuals interviewed during the ICR indicated that capacity building to staff of government
agencies had been limited. The high turnover of skilled personnel at all levels of government adversely
affected the capacity building efforts The GOE is unable to keep qualified personnel due to better offers
from the private sector. 

    IV.     Lessons Learned

28.     Cofinancing channeled through MDTFs should, to the extent possible, be aligned with GOE's
planning and budget cycle on the one hand, and on the other hand at the Development Partner level,
schedule of payments should be harmonized to maximize development impact, ensure predictability
and timely resource availability.

29.     MDTFs can contribute to better donor harmonization, with joint accountability for results
between GOE and Development Partners. Provision of sufficient resources and the effective planning of
the use of these resources enable robust monitoring, coordination and supervision of program activities ­
key elements to facilitate the achievement of Project Development Objectives and improving
implementation performance.

30.      Transaction costs of MDTFs are high and have reputational risks for the Bank, therefore
parallel funding should not be discouraged since all funds are pooled to achieve the same PDOs. Under
PBS I, all DPs regardless of the mechanisms by which they channel their financing for the project
(cofinancing or parallel financing) are considered joint partners with joint accountability for results.

31.     The Global Partnership and Trust Funds Operations Department (CFPTO) would benefit
from "informal" consultations with Operational staff managing MDTFs, including CMUs, to inform the
process of negotiating/agreeing on umbrella Cofinancing Agreements. Similarly, DP technical staff based
in country offices should be adequately informed by their headquarters on Cofinancing Agreements with
the Bank.

32.      The Bank's role as administrator of MDTFs and oversight function should not be confused
with the Bank assuming the responsibility for implementation. Though in the case of PBS, all
MDTFs regardless of whether they are Bank- or recipient-executed, are administered by the Bank,
responsibility for implementation lies with the Recipient (or GOE) for recipient-executed MDTFs. In this
context, and as part of joint accountability for results, DPs open communication with implementing
entities is welcome.

33.      PBS I was a large but successful operation and should have adequate visibility. PBS would
benefit from a well-articulated communications strategy.




                                                  119
34.     Joint Reviews help in promoting joint accountability for project results, promoting
partnership, and in leveraging additional resources to scale up results.

35.     Over time, the implementation of innovations under Component 4 has provided GOE staff
valuable lessons in promoting engagement of civil society, and implementation of community
scorecards, citizens' report cards and participatory budgeting. These lessons will be incorporated in the
design and preparation of activities for scaling up social accountability interventions under the second
phase.

36.    Both government and other partners expressed the concern for improving capacity
requirement and asked the Bank to work toward streamlining Bank procurement guidelines and services.

37.     During the ICR mission interviews, some reports indicated that there were not enough visits
by donors to woredas financed by PBS. This was probably due to the large woreda population covered
by PBS, but additional visits should be encouraged. Fresh and diverse perspectives are in deficit, and
could come from more and sustained donor engagement given the complexity of the country outside of
Addis Ababa.

38.    Bank staff provided technical support in areas of finance, procurement and Bank guidelines
and procedures. It is recommended that this technical support be increased to more people in charge of
implementation in GOE.

The story of PBS is a very good one and the lessons from its implementation should be disseminated and
replicated in other countries. The strength of the dialogue during which donors, GOE, and CSOs were
brought together in one dialogue was policy focused and there was a horizontal chain of delivery of basic
services. The PBS program was isolated from the vagaries of Ethiopian politics and had a robust MDG
results matrix that made it attractive to donors. Donors were mobilized, and all the development partners
including the Bank, relied on each other to deliver on this first positive step for the provision of basic
services to Ethiopians.
