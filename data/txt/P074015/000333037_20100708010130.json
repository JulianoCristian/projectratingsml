Services (PBS) Project for Ethiopia were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was satisfactory, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: PBS-type operations should use existing\n            government systems, complemented by systematic and\n            comprehensive support to enhance capacity, especially at the\n            local level. Efforts must also be made to ensure government\n            ownership. Government of Ethiopia (GOE) demonstrated strong\n            ownership for most PBS activities, contributing to the\n            overall successes observed in the development outcomes.\n            During the preparation of PBS, there was a tradeoff between\n            a robust preparation process (including fully addressing\n            implementation readiness conditions) and the need to be\n            adequately responsive to the immediate fiscal, economic and\n            social needs of the situation. While this did result in some\n            delays in implementation of some components, the sense is\n            that it often makes sense to prioritize critical and\n            pressing country needs, ensuring that there is an adequate\n            risk assessment with appropriate mitigating actions, as well\n            as a strong implementation support structure to resolve any\n            implementation bottlenecks that may arise. Simple steps can\n            and should be taken to facilitate financial management."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
