the Protection of Basic\n            Services (PBS) Project for Ethiopia were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was significant, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: decentralization is a complex inter-action of\n            programs and processes and successful approaches need to\n            take a holistic view that clearly defines the objectives in\n            terms of the accountabilities of the decentralized units and\n            builds their capacity to meet those accountabilities. The\n            PBS was initially narrowly focused on recurrent expenditures\n            for basic service provision and it was only with the\n            inclusion of the Local Investment Grant (LIG) that important\n            areas such as planning and implementation management\n            capacity at the local level were addressed. While it is not\n            necessary for a single operation to encompass all aspects of\n            decentralization it is important that the Bank's\n            analytic work underpins a holistic view of the process and\n            that the Bank identifies gaps and supports programs to\n            address them. The decision to embed a health component\n            channeled through the line ministry, within a program of\n            support for enhancing the management and accountability of\n            local governments is questionable. It succeeded in supplying\n            inputs but did not provide the follow up to ensure that\n            those inputs were effectively used. And it diverted some of\n            the focus that might otherwise have been placed on how well\n            the decentralized service provision was functioning."}, "docdt": "2013-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
