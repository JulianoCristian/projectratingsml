Savings Development Loan\n            (CSDL) Project is the first in a series of projects being\n            developed by the World Bank and Morocco to improve the\n            accumulation and allocation of long-term savings and to\n            guarantee the long-term sustainability of the country's\n            pension system. The project's main objective is to\n            improve the allocation of savings to private productive\n            investment by reforming contractual savings institutions,\n            including insurance companies, savings banks, and the\n            pension system. There are four components. The first 1)\n            assists in drafting an insurance code, particularly\n            concerning foreign ownership provisions; develops an\n            insurance sector restructuring plan, and produces a\n            timetable to liquidate damage claims; and agrees on a plan\n            and schedule to fully liberalize insurance tariffs. The\n            second component launches actuarial studies and external\n            audits of the existing pension system; appoints a pension\n            reform committee; and authorizes independent management of\n            pension fund reserves. The third component introduces\n            segregated portfolios for the deposits associated with the\n            national social security fund (CNSS) and the national\n            savings fund (CEN); and replaces the fixed administered rate\n            on deposits with portfolio returns from investments. The\n            fourth component drafts legislation on portfolio management,\n            secured lending, and money market mutual funds."}, "docdt": "1997-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
