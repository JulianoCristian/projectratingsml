LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:         Kingdom of Morocco
Amount and terms: US$50 million and FRF295.1 million (US$ 100 million equivalent) at variable rates for
twenty years, including a five-year grace period, at the standard Libor and Pibor interest
rates respectively for the US dollar tranche and the French Franc loan tranche. Parallel
financing may be provided by the African Development Bank for an amount of FRF405
million and US$68.26 million, at variable interest rates and would be a two-tranche
operation .
Loan description:  The Contractual Savings Development Loan (CSDL) is the first in a series of projects
being developed by the Bank and the Kingdom of Morocco to improve the accumulation
and allocation of long-term savings and guarantee the long-term sustainability of the
country's pension system. CSDL's main objective is to improve the allocation of savings
to private productive investment by reforming contractual savings institutions, including
insurance companies, savings banks and the pension system. It is based on the premise
that two important elements are required to put Morocco on a higher growth path: higher
savings, and higher efficiency in savings allocation. Specific policy measures concern: (a)
completing the financial restructuring of the insurance sector, and improving its solidity
and image; (b) laying the basis for improved efficiency, transparency and financial
viability of the existing pension system, and for the development of a capitalized pension
funds; (c) changing the role of the Caisse de Dep6t et de Gestion (CDG) in the collection,
administration and allocation of the financial resources of the pension system and savings
banks; and (d) further improving capital market infrastructure and the range of instruments
available to (institutional) investors. A policy matrix detailing the specific actions to be
supported by CSDL is reported in the annexes.
Benefits:         The main benefits of CSDL will be: (a) improving the financial management and
competitive behavior of contractual savings institutions, especially insurance companies
and savings banks; (b) laying the foundations for a deep reform of the pension system,
based on the restructuring of the existing pension schemes, and on the development of a
funded pillar which will contribute to the accumulation and efficient allocation of savings;
(c) allowing a more dynamic accumulation and management of resources by contractual
savings institutions, in the context of prudential guidelines, thus eventually reallocating
part of their resources toward private productive investment; (d) promoting competition in
the management of funds and in financial intermediation by transforming contractual
savings institutions into true institutional investors and by laying the groundwork for the
emergence of a class of competitive asset managers in Morocco; and (e) further improving
the financial sector infrastructure which will make this efficient allocation of long-term
financial resources possible in practice.
Risks:            The main risks concern: (a) the potential increase in Government expenditures (especially
the recurrent component) because of the resources needed to implement insurance and
pension reform; (b) the possibility that the Government make ad hoc pension concessions
(adjusting without actuarial consideration of the pension parameters) thus further
worsening the sustainability of the pension system; (c) the commitment of the authorities
to implement the pension reform. These risks will be mitigated by the strong commitment
of the Moroccan authorities to pursuing the proposed reforms, as shown in the Letter of
Development Policy. Furthermore, it is mutually understood that adherence to the fiscal
monitoring indicators agreed in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) will be an essential
pre-requisite for continued Bank support, in the form of additional follow-up loans, for
implementing the longer term reform program.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A CONTRACTUAL SAVINGS DEVELOPMENT LOAN
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed single currency
loan with a US dollar tranche in an amount equal to US$50 million and a French Franc tranche in an amount
equal to FRF295. 1 million to the Kingdom of Morocco to help finance a Contractual Savings Development
Loan. The Loan would be at the Libor-based rate for the US dollar loan tranche and at the standard Pibor-based
interest rate for the French Franc loan tranche with a maturity of twenty years, including five years of grace.
Parallel financing may be forthcoming from the African Development Bank for an amount of FRF405 million
and US$68.26 million, at variable interest rates and would be a two-tranche operation. The Moroccan
authorities will confirm compliance with all conditions for Board presentation by November 21, 1997.
I.    INTRODUCTION
2.    The proposed Contractual Savings Development Loan (CSDL) would be a quick-disbursing one-
tranche operation, for the equivalent of US$100 million. It fits in a medium-term reform program developed by
the Kingdom of Morocco and the Bank to increase the mobilization of long-term domestic savings, improve
their allocation to private productive investment, and guarantee the long-term sustainability of the country's
pension system. It is intended as the first of a series of projects, consistent with the long term nature of the
reform effort, especially pension reform. Through these projects, the Bank would help Morocco improve the
viability and efficiency of its contractual savings institutions. Medium-term efforts will be required to
complete and consolidate the reforms implemented under this loan. For the insurance sector and capital
markets, it means completing liberalization and further enhancing competition in the context of an improved
regulatory framework. For the pension system, it entails a major reform effort based on the recommendations
of the actuarial studies and audits carried out as part of this operation. The proposed program is in line with the
general objective of the 1997 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on January 30, 1997,'
as well as with its specific recommendations for private sector development.2
3.    The CSDL represents a continuation of the reform of the financial sector that Morocco launched in the
late eighties, and that the Bank has supported through previous operations, notably the Financial Sector
Development Project (FSDP) of 1991, and the Financial Market Development Loan (FMDL) of 1995. These
operations gradually removed distortions impeding the mobilization of financial savings and their free
intermediation; contributed to reducing the crowding out of financial resources by the Government; and
improved competition in financial services. This gradual approach to financial sector reform has paid off.
Morocco has now a healthy commercial banking system and an emerging capital market, both of which are
necessary for the development of a modem and productive private sector.
4.    Despite these achievements, domestic savings and private investment in Morocco remain significantly
below those of countries that have achieved high and sustainable growth. To alleviate this constraint, a reform
of the contractual saving sector, coupled with continued fiscal discipline, is necessary for two major reasons:
(a) despite their potential, the underdeveloped and ailing insurance sector and pension system contribute to low
The general objective of the CAS for Morocco is to "accelerate growth and social development through strong
reform within a process of political opening."
2     The specific recommendations for private sector development include "reforming institutional savings to mobilize
domestic savings and improve the efficiency of intermediation."

savings mobilization -- particularly long-term; and (b) the Treasury captures a significant share of available
long-term savings, thus preventing a market-based allocation of scarce domestic resources. In particular, most
of the contractual savings, equivalent to 14 percent of commercial bank deposits in 1996, are centrally
deposited at a fixed administered rate at the Caisse de Dep6ts et de Gestion (CDG). The availability of long-
term resources is all the more important, as the maturity mismatch between long-term private investment
opportunities (privatization, infrastructure projects, etc.), and scarce, mostly short-term available resources, is
becoming a significant obstacle to growth.
5.    The CSDL aims at improving the mechanisms of long-term savings mobilization and allocation,
through the reform of contractual savings institutions -- insurance companies, the pension system, and savings
banks. The reform program supported by CSDL will: (a) improve the financial management and competitive
behavior of contractual savings institutions, especially insurance companies and savings banks; (b) lay the
foundations of a deep reform of the pension system, through the restructuring of the existing pension schemes,
and the development of the capitalized pillar; (c) allow a more dynamic management of resources by
contractual savings institutions (notably, CDG) in the context of prudential guidelines, thus eventually
reallocating part of their resources toward private investment; and (d) further improve the financial sector
infrastructure which will make this efficient allocation of long-term financial resources possible in practice.
6.    Policy actions supported by the loan:
*  Insurance liberalization and restructuring, in the context of prudential rules:
- adoption by the Council of Government of the new Insurance Code, in line with EU standards, and
allowing entry of foreign insurance firms;
-  introduction of prudential regulation for insurance;
-  presentation of a specific plan and timetable for the settlement of the past-due insurance claims on
five liquidated insurance companies, and payment of first scheduled installment;
-  gradual liberalization of insurance tariffs by the year 2001, following agreed-upon modalities and
timetable;
-  insurance privatization -- offer for sale of the state-owned insurance company CNIA.
*  Launching of the pension reform:
-  establishment a Pension Reform Committee responsible for launching the actuarial studies of all
pension schemes, and producing a comprehensive summary report; based on the conclusions of the
Committee's report, the Ministry of Finance will prepare a medium-term pension reform program;
-  launching of independent financial audits of the existing pension schemes;
-  full separation and autonomy of the civil servants' pension scheme (CMR) from the Treasury;
-  the freeze of all ad hoc changes in the parameters of pension plans, except for immediate
reductions in their generosity.
* Change in the role of CDG from deposit-taker to fund manager:
- removal of the fixed administered rates on all CDG deposits;
- spin-off of part of CDG portfolio into open-end joint stock companies; the return on these funds
will be the realized portfolio return.
* Capital markets regulatory and legislative framework:
- presentation to the Council of Government of the new law on securitization and secured lending;
- preparation of draft legislation/regulation on (a) portfolio management on behalf of third parties
(including portfolio investment management firms and investment counselors); and (b) money
market mutual funds.

7.     Monitorable indicators. Following SAL practice, a set of indicators will be monitored under CSDL to
assess the outcome of the program of reforms. The three performance indicators below are closely related to
the program of contractual savings reform, which is to be implemented in the context of strict fiscal discipline.

II.    RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A.    Macroeconomic outlook
8.     This section provides a summary assessment of recent economic developments in Morocco, and of the
economy's short- to medium-term outlook. Further discussion of the economic outlook and Bank assistance
strategy is provided in the Morocco CAS.
9.     Recent developments. The evolution of the Moroccan economy in 1996 points to a sharp
improvement since the previous year, as indicated by several key indicators: real GDP growth of 12 percent
(- 7.6 percent in 1995); current account deficit down to 1.6 percent of GDP (against 4.7 percent in 1995);
external reserves up to 5 months of imports of goods and non factor services by the end of the year.3
Agricultural production, which increased by 78.8 percent, accounted for most of this favorable GDP
performance. Budgetary performance for the 1996/97 was solid, with a budget deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP
(5.6 percent for the 12 months of 1995).4 Revenue performance (up 12 percent over 1995) benefited from an
anti-corruption campaign, while the level of overall expenditures remained basically unchanged; recurrent
expenditures rose by 4 percent -- largely on account of a 6 percent increase in wages and salaries -- while
capital expenditures fell by 14 percent. The 1997/98 budget was presented with a 4.1 percent anticipated
deficit; revenues and recurrent expenditures are budgeted with about 12 percent increases, but the capital
expenditures are set to increase by 23 percent. Given the near US$500 million net repayment of foreign debt,
the 1996/97 deficit relied fully on domestic, largely non-bank financing. Prudent monetary policy and a
reduction in food prices contained inflation to 3 percent.
3      For the first six months of 1997, the trade balance improved by 4 percent, on account of a drop in food imports
and an II percent increase in exports. Tourism receipts and remittances from Moroccans abroad, on the other
hand, are at about 3 percent and 6 percent, respectively, below last year's level.
4      These ratios are calculated without taking into account privatization receipts. With privatization receipts, the
budget deficit amounts to 1.9 percent of GDP in 1996 and to 5.2 percent in 1995.



4
10.   Despite these favorable trends, a substantial agenda remains if Morocco is to achieve the sustained
growth rate required to absorb rising unemployment and reduce social disparities. Several challenges are worth
highlighting:
The growth performance of the economy remains extremely volatile due to the agricultural sector's
vulnerability to drought. Weather-induced cycles have been more frequent in recent years, with the
exceptional output growth of 1996 (based on a 78.8 percent rise in agricultural value added) following a
drought-induced drop in output in 1995 (43.9 percent decline in agricultural value added) and a good
agricultural performance in 1994 (63 percent rise in agricultural value added). A decline in agricultural
output is likely in 1997. Despite efforts at diversification, the economy remains overly dependent on
agriculture; growth in the nonagricultural sectors averaged a modest 2.1 percent per year in 1993-96.
Despite having substantially reduced its budget deficit since the early 1980s, Morocco's debt burden
remains heavy. Total Government outstanding debt (including Government guaranteed external debt) was
93 percent of GDP in 1996. External debt to GDP and debt service ratios (including Government
guaranteed debt) were 58 and 35 percent, respectively, in 1996, with very little scope for additional external
debt relief. The Government has accumulated substantial domestic payments-arrears, amounting to about
3.8 percent of GDP by end-1996. Financing of the deficit relies heavily on domestic resources,5 notably the
sale of domestic debt to banks and to the nonbank sector, and results in the crowding out of private
investment. Moreover, the need to maintain a tight budgetary stance has kept capital expenditure low,
putting a squeeze on total resources available for investment.
* The behavior of private savings and investment remains a concern. Gross national savings and gross
investment are structurally low and declined in 1992-95, reflecting partly the impact of droughts in 1992-93
and 1995, and partly the budgetary situation. Compounded by rigidities in labor, land, and goods markets,
and low levels of education, these constraints have resulted in insufficient productivity gains and rising
levels of unemployment.6
Net external transfers are negative, and average about one billion dollars per year, one quarter of which is due to
the IBRD.
6      The 1995 census showed urban unemployment at 23 percent, with much higher rates among the young and
among the better skilled; underemployment is widespread in rural areas. This figures, however, may be inflated
due to the temporary immigration from rural areas caused by the 1995 drought.

11.   Prospects. Preliminary expectations point to a negative real GDP growth of about 2.5 percent and low
inflation (2 percent) in 1997. Due to poor weather in the winter of 1996 and early 1997, agricultural value
added is expected to decline by up to 25 percent, and the nonagricultural sectors -- notably manufacturing and
services -- should be the main contributors to growth. Provided the Government perseveres with policies
conducive to macroeconomic stability, and assuming limited external shocks (either negative or positive),
Morocco can be expected to grow in the medium term at the 1990-94 level of about 3.5 percent per year in real
terms. This growth performance would not be sufficient even to absorb new entrants (the urban labor force
being estimated to grow at 4 percent per year), let alone reduce unemployment and improve living standards.
12.   Laying the basis for stronger growth in the economy in the medium term will require a strong private
investment revival for the rest of the decade. The bulk of the rise in investment will need to be supported by an
increase in domestic financing, if Morocco is to avoid excessive dependence on external borrowing. Hence, the
importance of deeper macroeconomic consolidation, particularly a tight fiscal stance to reduce Treasury
financing needs and the extent of crowding out, coupled with structural reforms aimed at sustaining savings and
investment at sufficient levels. Among the structural reforms, further deepening of the insurance sector while
improving its solvency, modernizing the capital market, and reforming the way the pension system manages its
funds, will contribute to increasing savings mobilization, making domestic resources available for productive
investment, and reducing dependence on external financing.
B.    Financial sector reform: outlook and prospects
13.   Morocco has followed since the mid-eighties a two-pronged approach to financial sector reform. First,
the banking system has been gradually liberalized in the context of strengthened supervision and prudential
regulations. Second, and most recently, efforts have been focused on the development of capital markets. This
approach, which has been supported by two Bank sector adjustment loan operations,' has gone a long way
toward eliminating major distortions to competition, establishing the market legislative, regulatory and physical
infrastructure, and achieving a substantial degree of financial depth, as measured by the ratio of M2 to GDP (an
annual average of 65 percent of GDP in 1995-96). However, the cost' and availability of financing, particularly
long-term, remain impediments to private investment. Although substantial long-term private sector projects
are being appraised and state assets are being sold on the market in the context of privatization and
infrastructure development, Morocco does not yet effectively mobilize the resources required to finance them.
This is due to three main problems:
*  7he saving rate is low -- gross national savings in Morocco were 17 percent of GDP on average in 1994-95
(15 percent private, including PEs); domestic savings were just about 14 percent. These are very low levels
when compared with high-growth developing countries, whose national and domestic savings rates
typically reach over 30 percent (see Figure II.1).
*  Financial assets are short-term -- most financial savings are kept in short-term instruments, largely short-
term bank deposits. The ratio of time and savings deposits to total deposits in commercial banks was 49.7
percent in 1995, against an average of over 80 percent in other countries in the region (Egypt and Jordan),
as well as in high performing developing countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brazil and Chile (see
Figure 11.2). On the other hand, the contractual savings sector and the securities markets still mobilize a
relatively limited amount of resources (see Table II.2).9
7     These are the 1991 Financial Sector Development Project, and the 1995 Financial Market Development Loan.
Annex IV lists the main reforms, and indicates whether they were part of Bank loan conditionality.
The benchmark nominal market interest rate -- commercial bank rate on short- and medium-term credit -- was
about 11 percent in 1996, while inflation declined from 6 to 3 percent between 1995 and 1996.
9     The state is still today the only primary issuer of bonds (corporate bonds are not yet issued); secondary trading is
extremely thin; and the recent increase in stock market activity has been due mainly to the privatization program.

The Treasury captures a large portion ofprivate savings -- this is described in Box 11.1, which shows the
extent of channeling of funds to the Treasury in the Moroccan financial system. More than 50 percent of
total net domestic financial resources of non financial agents are captured by the Treasury; '0 20 percent of
these resources are channeled to the Treasury through contractual savings institutions (the pension system,
insurance companies, postal savings).

14.    The Moroccan authorities believe that reforming contractual savings institutions, and establishing a
level playing field between the Government and the private sector for the allocation of their resources,
constitute the next critical phase of financial sector reform. There are three main reasons for this. First, they
are prerequisites to increasing domestic savings, particularly long-term. Second, they will ensure that private
firms have access to a wider range of sources of finance and can compete for credit on an equal footing with the
public sector. Third, they will contribute to increasing competition in the financial sector by allowing new
instruments and agents to emerge alongside commercial banks and by further developing capital markets.
10     The remaining 47 percent includes the private sector and public enterprises (PSPEs). Moroccan data do not allow
to disaggregate these two sectors.

M.    THE CONTRACTUAL SAVINGS DEVELOPMENT LOAN -
PROPOSED STRATEGY AND BANK SUPPORT
15.    The proposed operation is intended as the first in a series of loans which will support the development
of contractual savings and of a new class of institutional investors in Morocco. Worldwide experience has
shown the merits of encouraging institutional savings as a way of facilitating savings accumulation and the
efficient allocation of resources. By mobilizing long-term financial resources, contractual savings institutions
are a major driving force for the modernization of capital markets. Although their main responsibility is with
their affiliates and policyholders, in the process of ensuring good pension and insurance payouts, they produce
substantial macroeconomic benefits and spillover effects. They are in fact ideal vehicles for the provision of
term finance, and can be a catalyst for the growth of bond and equity markets as well as asset-backed
securitization. Spillover effects include the development of more efficient trading and settlement systems, the
adoption of better accounting and auditing standards, and the disclosure of more meaningful and reliable
information. They have also played an important role in strengthening corporate governance.
16.    Pension reform is one of the key components of the proposed strategy. This will entail initiating
reforms to improve the efficiency, transparency, and financial viability of the existing public PAYG system,
and lay the foundations for moving towards a multipillar system, including the option of fully capitalized and
privately-managed pension funds. The medium-term objectives and benefits of pension reform will be: (a) to
reduce the fiscal cost of the PAYG system due to inefficient financial management, institutional fragmentation,
and to the adverse impact of the aging of population, and thus to increase public and national savings; (b) to
generate an investable surplus of long-term savings and improve the allocation of resources, thus resulting in
higher long-term growth, investment and savings; (c) to guarantee security in old age to Moroccan workers



10
through an actuarially balanced system; and (d) to reduce labor market distortions, encourage labor supply and
discourage shifts into the informal sector through a reduction of the payroll tax implicit in defined benefit
PAYG contributions.
17.   The CSDL launches a major reform program which is inherently long-term, especially with regard to
pension reforms. The project has been designed, therefore, as the first in a series of projects in which the Bank
will support the Kingdom of Morocco's efforts to improve the viability and efficiency of contractual savings
institutions. Following is a description of the short-term policy actions. Medium-term efforts, supported by
future Bank programs, will be needed to complete and consolidate the reforms implemented under the present
operation. This medium-term strategy is sketched at the end of this section, and in the Policy matrix.
(a) REFORMS SUPPORTED BY THE LOAN
18.   The key elements of the reform agenda supported by the CSDL, required to continue the momentum of
financial sector reform, include: (a) improving the capacity of insurance companies to collect savings and
invest; (b) creating the foundations for supplementary capitalized pension funds under private fund
management as well as other pension fund mechanisms; (c) changing the role of the CDG in the collection,
administration and allocation of the financial resources of the savings institutions and the pension system; and
(d) continuing the complementary actions to improve the financial markets and provide a spectrum of
diversified instruments to investors. Annexes I and II provide a summary of the policy actions that are
proposed as part of this loan, as well as the key performance indicators, monitoring tools, and critical
assumptions.
A.    Reform of the insurance sector
19.   Current situation. The insurance sector is not well developed in Morocco. It suffers from high levels
of claims relative to premia in automobile insurance and low levels in other lines, implying a cross-
subsidization among different classes of the insured. It also suffers from long delays in settling claims, again
especially in the automobile branch; and some companies have engaged in mispricing and mismanagement.

20.   As discussed in the 1994 Country Economic Memorandum for Morocco, Government-imposed
constraints on insurance companies have been largely at the root of the industry's problems and lack of
competitiveness. The Moroccan authorities have taken since 1994 several measures for the restructuring of the
insurance sector. Five companies were liquidated in 1995, and several others restructured. Regulated tariffs
have been raised to allow for a reduction in claim ratios, while insurance companies have been encouraged to



11
set aside adequate levels of reserves for the payment of future claims. An incentive system of premium
discounts and penalties has been introduced to reward good drivers and penalize bad ones. Although these
measures have contributed to improving the financial health of the sector, much more remains to be done. Of
particular concern remains the problem of the outstanding claims of the five insurance companies liquidated in
1995. The total amount of these claims is estimated at DH6 billion. The Government created a fund (Fonds de
solidarite) to repay the accumulated liabilities of the liquidated companies, most of which are claims by victims
of car accidents.
21.   Program to be supported under CSDL. The Government recognizes that the insurance sector needs
a major overhaul, which entails: liquidating the accumulated claims of the five bankrupt insurance companies --
a hefty burden on the industry and on its image with the customer; approving the new Insurance Code; and
improving the organization, human resources and marketing strategy of all companies.
ACTION 1.1    The Direction des Assurances et de la Prevoyance Sociale (DAPS) has prepared an excellent
draft Insurance Code. This creates a modern institutional framework for the operations of insurance
companies, clearly defines the responsibilities of the parties to an insurance contract, and adopts the new
approach of monitoring solvency that is in conformity with the approach adopted by the European Union; the
criteria for solvency monitoring have already been introduced with circular (instruction) of 29/3/1996, and are
in force since January 1997. However, the Code in its current form also contains a prohibition against
foreigners (as well as single Moroccans) holding a majority interest in Moroccan insurance companies. The
Moroccan authorities recognize that this prohibition is not compatible with the liberal orientation of broader
economic policy in Morocco,"' and have agreed to redraft Article 201 in a way that would allow the
establishment of foreign companies through the creation of local subsidiaries, provided this serves the
economic needs of the country and it will not undermine the stability of the market. It has been suggested that
entry of two or three foreign companies, preferably from leading insurance companies of countries that are not
already represented in Morocco, would contribute to creating a more competitive and innovative insurance
industry without undermining the stability of the market.
ACTION 1.2   Settlement of outstanding claims of companies in liquidation. Settling the debt of the five
insurance companies in liquidation is essential for restoring the public image of the insurance sector. However,
payment in full may give wrong signals to policyholders that the state is responsible for all insurance liabilities,
and would be very costly for the state budget. The authorities propose to settle 50 percent of each claim (about
US$350 million) and they have appointed an ad hoc committee of experts to examine the different claims and
authorize their settlement. The DAPS has prepared a brief note setting out the plan of action and the financing
mode for settling these claims (see Annex IV). The funds required to cover these arrears will come partly from
the proceeds of asset sales, and partly from the Government budget via the Fonds de solidarite.
ACTION 1.3    Premium liberalization. One of the essential features of a regulatory approach that is based on
solvency monitoring is the liberalization of insurance premiums and their determination by competitive market
forces. In conformity with this approach, the authorities have sought to lift, with immediate effect, all
regulations on insurance premiums, except those on automobile insurance. However, representatives of the
sector have asked for a delay until the years 2000/01 for all premium deregulation, because of concerns about
the ability of individual companies to set prices in a rational and informed way (giving the lack of adequate
statistics on claims as one reason for seeking this delay). The insurance association has proposed the use of
administered premiums (tarifs homologues), which would be established by the association and approved by
the authorities. After some negotiations, the authorities have decided to liberalize all insurance premiums
progressively, with a timetable that would allow companies to develop their databases and expertise for rational
pricing policies. The phasing takes account of the availability of pricing structures through the international
reinsurance market, since those lines that depend more on international reinsurance will be liberalized first (in
The authorities have indicated that their main concern is to ensure an orderly insurance market in Morocco and
avoid an influx of foreign companies that might destabilize the market. They have also indicated that existing
foreign majority holdings in some companies will not be affected by the new Code.



12
fact, it is worth pointing out that aviation and marine hull insurance, which rely heavily on international
reinsurance, are already free of government regulation). Liberalization will be completed by the year 2001.
B.    Pension reform
22     Current situation. The Moroccan pension system comprises 4 pension plans and 6 company schemes
(caisses internes). It is a partially-funded system based on the scaled premium method whereby the
contribution rate is set every five or ten years in the light of the anticipated level of pension benefits and
investment income of existing reserves. Most of the pension plans suffer from serious weaknesses that derive
from the failure to adjust the contribution rate, from the insufficiency of reserves, and especially from the
generosity of their targeted benefits. The financial position of the various pension plans has been sheltered by
the non indexation of pension benefits, although falling inflation has removed this safety valve for the system.
23.    All the different pension plans face serious problems. CMR, which covers civil servants and the army,
suffers from a progressive aging of its covered population. This is linked to the maturity of the scheme and to
the slowdown in recruitment of civil servants.'2 CMR has recently taken measures to implement internal
management and controls, including the set-up of a statistical and financial database, which were non-existent
until recently. CMR was owed large arrears from the Treasury which also manages directly CMR reserves.
The Government has recently decided to fully pay up its contributions (at an expense of about US$120 million).
CMR needs to lower the accrual factor of its benefits and to eliminate other features that increase its costs.
24.   RCAR covers the non regular staff of the Government as well as all staff of public entities which are
under the financial control of the Government. Although it comprises a capitalization component for the
contributions of employees, it is basically a defined benefit (DB) PAYG scheme in which the state has a
residual obligation to make up for any shortfall in benefits. RCAR has a young demographic structure but its
future is clouded by the right of its workers to become regularized after seven years of service and thus to
transfer to CMR. RCAR has created substantial reserves in its capitalization component, on which it has
earned a more than adequate real return.
25.    CNSS covers employees in the private sector, and risks other than retirement (disability, health, family
allowances). Although it is a compulsory system, coverage is very limited (see Annex VI). CNSS runs
substantial surpluses in its social funds, especially the fund for family allowances, but its pension system is
breaking even despite a young demographic structure, and, according to simulation, significant cash deficits in
its pension system are likely to appear by the year 2014. A reallocation of contributions from family
allowances to pensions will prevent the emergence of a financial deficit, as will an expansion in coverage.
However, in the long run, CNSS will face serious financial pressures resulting from progressive aging of the
covered population, the maturity of the scheme, the inevitable evasion and the manipulation of the scheme by
workers (affiliation for the minimum period for benefit eligibility, understatement of income in early years,
overstatement before retirement, etc.).
26.    CIMR is a voluntary scheme covering employees of participating private firms. It is a mixed system,
comprising both a fully-funded plan (employee contributions) and a PAYG plan (employer contributions), but
since it is a DB scheme, there is an implicit residual obligation on employers to top up their contributions to
meet promised benefits. Although CIMR has accumulated substantial reserves from its capitalization
component, it is essentially an underfunded DB scheme. Its legal charter expires in the year 2000, which
creates added uncertainty about its future. CIMR is looking to the Government for a bail-out, but in principle
the shortfall in reserves should be made up by increased contributions from participating employers.
12    A recent proposal to include civil servants' benefits in the salary base for the calculation of CMR contributions
and payments is likely to increase CMR reserves in the short term, but will result in higher payments and
worsened balances in the medium and long term.

27.    There is little information on the condition of the internal schemes for various parastatal entities."3
Some, such as that for the railways staff (ONCF), appear to be in severe financial difficulty, as a result of
declining employment levels, extremely generous early retirement provisions, and inadequate past
contributions or reserves. The situation of other internal schemes, which may not suffer from declining
employment and may have built some reserves, may be less serious, although detailed data are not readily
available.

28.    Program to be supported under CSDL. The Government agrees that the current situation calls (a)
for a thorough analysis of the short- and medium-term viability of the system as such, and (b) for the
strengthening of fully capitalized options that would stimulate the accumulation of long-tern savings.
ACTION 2.1    The studies. In the short-term, the authorities need to examine various reform options for the
existing pension plans. For this purpose a series of actuarial studies must be undertaken. These should
investigate the likely evolution of the various pension plans in their current fonn as well as the impact of
various alternative reform options. The latter should include: (a) a substantial change in the parameters of the
existing schemes but without any systemic reform; (b) creation of a mixed multipillar system following the
Swiss or Dutch approach;'4 (c) creation of a complementary but voluntary capitalization pillar, following the
British approach of voluntary and gradual contracting out; and (d) partial or total conversion of the current
systems to defined contribution (DC) PAYG systems from their present defined benefit (DB) PAYG structure
(the new Swedish approach). For each reform option, the studies should assess the total cost for all
participants; the rights acquired by the existing contributors; and the employers' obligations. The implications
of the reform measures for capital markets development, administration and marketing costs, and the regulatory
framework should also be examined. The different scenarios should also address the issue of how each of the
caisses will evolve, and the advantages and disadvantages of increasing their coordination, harmonizing their
main parameters, and moving towards a consolidated system with a more limited number of pension plans.
The authorities will also need to initiate extemal audits of the various pension plans to establish the adequacy
of their intemal controls and financial management systems. Pending the conclusion of the study of reform
options, the authorities intend to refrain from indexing pension payments to inflation (although the fall of
inflation has reduced the importance of this inequitable but financially convenient safety valve for the system),
changing parameters of pension funds (e.g. retirement age, contribution rate) in a generous way without
actuarial adjustment, and will take measures to prevent the use of early retirement pensions by some internal
schemes.
13     The following entities have internal pension schemes: Bank al-Magrib, Office Cherif/en des Phosphates (OCP),
Office dExploitation des Ports (ODEP), Office National des Chemins de Fer (ONCF), Office National
d'Electricite (ONE), Regie des Tabacs.
The Swiss and Dutch systems are based on a two-pillar structure, whereby the first pillar is an unfunded public
scheme, and the second consists of private pension funds. The second pillar is mandatory in Switzerland,
voluntary in the Netherlands. Most private schemes are of the defned-benefit variety, though in the Netherlands
there is a gradual shift to defined contribution plans.



14
ACTION2.2    Pension Reform Committee. To promote and supervise these studies, the Moroccan authorities
have agreed to appoint a Pension Reform Committee (Comite de Suivi) consisting of senior officials and
technical experts from the Ministry of Finance, other ministries, and the various pension schemes. The
Committee, which is already operational, is responsible for setting up the terms of reference and validating the
actuarial studies of all pension schemes, including the six internal systems of public enterprises (to be
completed by end-September 1998), and for producing a comprehensive report on the state of pension systems
(by end-March 1999). Based on the conclusions of the Committee's report, the Ministry of Finance will
prepare (by end-December 1999) a medium-term reform program aimed at guaranteeing the financial viability
of the existing pension schemes, and at introducing a capitalized pension pillar. The authorities will also
prepare programs for a publicity campaign to explain to the public the unsustainability and economic costs of
the current systems and the desirability of systemic reform. The Committee will be responsible for monitoring
progress in pension reform. Its terms of reference will include specific monitoring and supervision functions;
the Committee will have regular exchanges of views with Bank missions on its activities in this respect.
ACTION2.3    Separate the civil servants'pension scheme (CMR) from the Treasury. The authorities have
agreed to authorize the independent management of CMR reserves -- currently managed directly by the
Treasury though a single cash account. This measure will allow to properly identify the excess funds
attributable to CMR, and will improve government budget discipline.
C.    Reform of CDG
29.    Current situation. CDG is the largest domestic non-bank financial intermediary in Morocco. It
operates as a financial institution under the authority of the state, which is exercised through a supervisory
board.'5 Today it pools funds collected as mandatory deposits from the social security system, postal savings,
and other deposits from some voluntary depositors -- a total of 15 percent of annual asset flows of PSPEs in
1993-95 (see Box 11.1). It invests in Treasury bills and bonds (over 50 percent of assets in 1995), stocks, real
estate and other assets. It pays a fixed, administered (below-market) rate of return to its main depositors,
realizes an intermediation margin (between 200 and 300 basis points) and, gives most of its profit back to the
Treasury in the form of corporate income and profit taxes (over 80 percent of annual net profit in 1975-93). It
supports the Treasury bonds market by playing an important role in the primary auctions (CDG accounted for
19 percent of Treasury auctions in 1993-95).
30.    CDG has a public obligation towards its main depositors, CNSS and CEN (Caisse d'Epargne
Nationale).'6 CNSS funds (49 percent of total CDG resources) are contributions for old-age pensions, disability
and survivor pensions, family allowances, and health insurance, and represent a Government obligation in the
Moroccan PAYG system. CEN funds, the second largest (17 percent) of CDG's deposits, carry an explicit full
Government guarantee. CDG administers these funds prudently, although no detailed prudential guidelines
exist to date. Apart from the annual accounting disclosure requirements and the periodic auditing of its
resources, CDG investments are not subject to investment performance valuation standards, or to market
performance benchmark, and depositors have no say in its investment policy. Owing to the intermediation
margin captured by CDG, the return paid to depositors has consistently been lower than alternative low-risk
investments or other comparable investment funds -- e.g. the return on Treasury securities or on the private
Members of the supervisory board are the Minister of Finance, the Minister of the Economy, the Governor of the
central bank and two members of the Supreme Court designated by the Minister of Justice. The chief executive
officer is designated by the Dahir. The secretary general and the chief financial officer of the Caisse are designated
by decree. CDG annual operating budget and net profits allocation are subject to the approval of the Ministry of
Finance.
16     CEN is a state-owned savings bank linked to the postal system. It collects deposits from very small savers, and
has the obligation to transfer all its net cash flow to CDG. Deposits at CEN are explicitly guaranteed by the state;
their remuneration (and CEN itself) is tax exempt.



15
pension plan portfolio (CIMR).'7 However, since 1993, the decrease in Treasury bond yields has made the
fixed administered rate paid by the CDG more attractive for its depositors.
31.   In addition to managing funds which entail a Government commitment or contingent liability, CDG
plays other important roles in the financial system. First, it is one of the few institutions in Morocco to offer
long-term financing and to systematically transform short-term funds into long-term investments -- although
CDG's deposit base has been quite stable over the years, most of these deposits (including CNSS's) represent
short-term resources. Second, it has a license as a Treasury securities dealer (Intermediaire en valeurs du
Tresor), and could play an important role in providing liquidity to the secondary Treasury securities market, as
it becomes a more competitive market player.

32.   Program to be supported under CSDL. Any vision for the future of CDG must take into account the
specificity and complexity of its role -- a prudent state manager of social security funds which in many countries
are entirely invested in government securities or absorbed by the Treasury as general government resources and
managed with even less transparency and accountability, but also a public institution whose relative size and
scope of activities are not compatible with the development of a competitive buy-side in the securities market.
Our vision tries to keep this complexity into consideration. CDG's reform will involve the following steps:
*  Transforming CDG from a deposit-taking intermediary into an institutional portfolio manager by spinning
off most new flows of CDG deposits and part of outstanding assets from its two major depositors
(accounting for 72 percent of CDG outstanding deposits), in individual open-end joint-stock companies for
each depositor; involve the CDG depositors in the Board of Directors and investment management of these
segregated mutual funds to be created by CDG.
*  Removing the fixed administered rate on CNSS and CEN deposits, to be replaced by realized portfolio
returns on the new segregated open-end investment companies, and by a variable benchmark rate indexed
on Treasury bonds on the remaining pooled funds of these two depositors.'"
*  Giving CEN -- one of the main CDG depositors -- the option to use outside portfolio managers for
managing part of its segregated portfolio once CEN's internal structure and management capacity are
sufficiently developed.
33.   In this vision, the future of CDG and the fund management industry is that CDG becomes a competitive
fund manager among many, along with its more limited function as deposit-taking financial intermediary,
focusing in particular on the management of (a) funds from PAYG social security in a prudent, dedicated,
17    In addition, CDG administrative and personnel expenses are high (65 basis points) compared to the international
performance of similar institutional fund managers.
18    This measure excludes most minor deposits from specialized funds which by law earn zero interest.



16
monitorable manner (as in France and Canada); (b) deposits from other, possibly capitalized pension funds that
will choose, voluntarily, to use CDG as a fund manager, in competition with other fund managers; and (c) other
funds deposited by CEN and other institutions, increasingly on a voluntary, competitive basis. The likely
impact of this transformation will be a better allocation of funds in the Moroccan financial sector; higher
returns on the deposits at CDG; lower margins charged by CDG and thus lower lending rates; and the
development of a competitive industry of fund management and non-bank intermediation. The following
paragraphs will give the details of CDG situation today and of the project's reform proposal.
ACTION 3.1    Transforming CDG operations. The key measure in this respect is the transformation of CDG
core operations from a deposit-taking institution into a fiduciary fund manager, by identifying distinct
investment objectives directly related to the nature of the funds entrusted to CDG by its main depositors, and by
introducing the concept of arms-length client relationship with its main depositors, including segregated
portfolios and an explicit fund management mandate, with periodic supervision of outcomes and objectives. As
discussed in a KPMG report on the institutional strategy of CDG, this will require a significant change in the
culture of the institution as well as the development of new professional skills and modem portfolio
management systems.
* Constitution of a segregated portfolio for CNSS's pension system resources: the resources of CNSS are not
homogeneous, although they are treated as such. The proposal to create a CNSS portfolio at CDG will
require the accounting and financial segregation of CNSS' resources according to their sources: pension
contributions, family allowances, and health benefits. Net funds from the health care system fulfill mainly
current needs and are akin to working capital; CDG could continue managing them within a common
portfolio. The proposed segregated portfolio would include a portion of the existing stock as well the new
flow of funds associated with the pension scheme managed by CNSS.
* Constitution of a mutual fund for CEN's customer deposits. While CEN resources consist largely of sight
deposits, taken together these funds have a rather large stable component. Since CEN deposits are fully
guaranteed by the state, the separate CEN portfolio must be invested in low-risk assets, along the lines of
money market mutual funds. This portfolio would be funded by CEN's existing and new deposits at CDG
and would include Treasury bonds and bills, and if available high grade commercial papers, as well as
commercial bank term deposits.
* Creation of fund management committees -- the role of each committee will be to: (a) decide in a concerted
manner the investment policy covering depositors' funds; (b) establish, together with CDG, methods for
evaluating portfolio performnance, and procedures for the regular supervision of this performance; (c) take
any initiative necessary to strengthen cooperation between CDG and its institutional depositors. The
committees could include external consultants acting on behalf of depositors. The statutory form of these
committees will depend on the specific form of organization selected for the creation of the segregated
funds. CDG's proposal is to create segregated portfolios in the form of a regulated open-end mutual fund
(SICAV) for CEN and in the form of a regulated investment fimd for CNSS (FCP). The participation of
CEN in the funds management would be through its representation on the board of directors of an open-end
joint stock company.
ACTION 3.2    Market-basedportfolio returns on CDG managedfunds. Returns on the segregated funds
managed by CDG coming from CNSS pension contributions and CEN depositors will be realized portfolio
returns, each being monitored in comparison with the return of a composite market index on a net basis (i.e.,
net of commissions). This will introduce investment performance standards on the effectiveness of CDG fund
management on behalf of its depositors and make transparent non-market or under-performing investments.
The remaining pooled CNSS and CEN funds managed by CDG will be remunerated on the basis of a
government bond index (5-year Treasury bonds) replacing the current fixed administered rate.
ACTION 3.3    Competition infund management. The relationship with depositors having segregated
portfolios at CDG (CNSS and CEN) should include the option, for the depositors, to entrust the management
of part of their funds to private institutions or fund management firms under the supervision of CDG. Such
delegation could take place (a) indirectly through the acquisition of OPCVM issues, with CDG acting as



17
intermediary on behalf of its depositors (CDG's portfolio already includes a number of mutual funds shares); or
(b) directly through a management contract signed with a private fund management company. The
management contract would have to comply with the prudential regulation to be introduced on portfolio
management and custody of securities on behalf of third parties (see below, Section D).
D.    Complementary capital market reforms
34.   The objectives of the reforms of capital markets supported by this loan are to elaborate the legislative
and regulatory measures required for the operation of institutional investors and professional fund managers,
especially pension fund managers. To this effect, a Working Group is being created within the Ministry of
Finance, with specific terms of reference to be approved by the Bank, which include the drafting of legislation
and regulations for fund management, fiduciary relationships, investment advisory. In addition, new legislation
on securitization will be presented to the Council of Government.
ACTIoN 4.1    New legislation on fund management. Drafting by the Working Group of new
legislation/regulations on fund management regarding fiduciary responsibility and investment powers
specifically for pension funds and in general for all types of funds and the licensing of fund managers and
fund management firms.
ACTION 4.2   New legislation on securitization/secured lending. The development of pension funds and
asset management in Morocco will be a function of the development of an array of new opportunities for such
institutions to diversify their investment into various financial instruments. Today the only paper on the market
is Government paper, and secondary trading is very thin. Launching high quality asset-backed securities and
other types of long-term financial instruments is key to allow pension and other funds to diversify their
portfolios and attain the high return and reasonable risk combination required to make them a financially viable
alternative to the present defined-benefit, PAYG system. The new legislation on securitization, which is
especially focused on creating the preconditions for mortgage-backed securities, and was prepared with the
help of the IFC, is a key prerequisite for the emergence of new long term, secure instruments for financing, and
will promote market deepening and long term saving.
ACTION 4.3    Legislation on money market mutualfunds. Elaboration of new legislation/regulations to allow
the creation of money market mutual funds, with a special emphasis on the investment rules for investment in
negotiable securities (Titres de creance negociables, TCN).
(b) REFORM STRATEGY FOR THE MEDIUM TERM
35.   The CSDL initiates a medium-term reform process. Continued efforts by the Kingdom of Morocco, to
be supported by subsequent Bank operations and technical assistance, will be needed to complete and
consolidate the reforms carried out under CSDL.
36.   Monitoring and reporting. Monitoring and reporting will be facilitated through the close
coordination of the supervision activities of the proposed operation, and the preparation of the second phase of
the reform program. As part of the initial supervision of CSDL, technical assistance will be provided from the
Bank to assist the Govemment in implementation of the pension reform component of the program. This will
include, in particular, assistance to the Direction des assurances et de la prevoyance sociale, as well as to the
main pension schemes, in the design, development and implementation of a customized software to be used in
the analysis of pension reform options."9
37.   Medium-term strategy. While it is impossible to identify specific measures to be implemented in the
medium term prior to assessing the outcome and issues resulting from the first phase of the reform, the
19    Customized software will be based on PROST version 5, the World Bank visual basic pension simulation
program. For an application of this software to the case of CNSS, see Annex V.



18
medium-term strategy will include, as sketched in the Policy matrix and Letter of Development Policy
(Annexes II- III):
*  Insurance: completing within five years the settlement of claims of the liquidated insurance companies;
completing by the year 2001 the full liberalization of insurance tariffs; restructuring the Fonds de solidarite
and redefining its role in the insurance sector; and introducing measures aimed at reducing adverse claim
settlements and delays in claims payments by insurance companies, in coordination with the Ministry of
Justice.
*  Pension reform: implementing a major reform effort based on the conclusions and recommendations of the
studies carried out as part of this operation, including the development of the capitalized pillar.
*  Savings banks: preparing CDG to become one of the competitive pension fund managers by pensioners.
Activate CEN's role as a resource mobilizer; once CEN's internal management capacities will be
sufficiently developed, authorize CEN to manage part of its funds through managers outside of CDG.
*  Capital markets: approval by the Council of Government of the legislation drafted as part of this operation.
IV.   THE PROPOSED LOAN
A.    Loan amount and terms
38.   The proposed program consists of the actions included in the present operation, as described in the
policy matrix (Annex II), and of the medium-term reform program described in the letter of development
policy. The present operation will a be quick-disbursing loan, in the amounts of US$50 million and FRF 295.1
million to be disbursed in one tranche by effectiveness. The anticipated closing date of the loan will be
December 31, 1998, to allow for program supervision.
39.   A quick-disbursing, one-tranche loan of the proposed amount is justified on the basis of: (a) the fiscal
cost of reform faced in the short run by the Government for implementing the actions included in the policy
matrix; (b) the commitment to pursuing and implementing a wide ranging medium term reform program, as
described in the Letter of development policy, whose costs and benefits will be substantial, and which is
expected would be supported by future Bank loans; and (c) the external financing required to maintain the
present course of fiscal deficit reduction in a situation of significant external indebtedness of Morocco, coupled
with the economic volatility caused among others by the extreme sensitivity of the economy to the weather
induced fluctuations in agricultural production.
40.   Fiscal cost of reform. The fiscal costs for the Government of the actions proposed in the policy matrix
will amount to US$65 million in 1997, and to US$94 million in 1998. As detailed in Annex IV, these costs will
include:
* Government's contribution to the settlement of past insurance claims of bankrupt insurance companies,
respectively, US$31 million and US$53 million in 1997 and 1998. The total outstanding amount of the
claims is equivalent to around US$700 million. The Government has announced a settlement plan for more
than half of this amount over five years (equivalent to US$368 million) based on Government contribution
of US$263 million and revenue from asset sales of US$105 million.
* Government's contribution to the restructuring of the Compagnie d'Assurance Transport (CAT). The
restructuring will be financed through advances over a three-year period starting in January 1998 from the
Fonds de Solidariti. The advances will be reimbursable (over three years) after ten years. The total cost to
the Government over this period will be US$21 million.
*  The other element in the fiscal cost of reforms will result from the reduced profits of CDG -- which are
transferred to the Treasury as a monopoly rent in the form of dividends and taxes -- due to the removal of
the fixed administered rate paid to CDG's customers. The replacement of the administered rate by a



19
market rate will raise CDG's resource costs to around 10.15 percent,20 therefore reducing (other things
being equal) the margin realized by CDG by 145 basis points. The direct cost to the Treasury of the
liberalization of CDG's rate on deposits will amount to about US$34 million per year in 1997 and 1998.
41.   In the medium term, the cost of reform will derive from further insurance claims liquidation, from
pension reform, and from the loss of CDG's monopoly rent Although the Treasury will lose this rent
permanently, since CDG's income will be based on a market-determined spread, and will be transformed from
a pure intermediation margin on deposits into an asset management fee income, the net cost to the public sector
over the future years will decline for several reasons. First, a portion of CDG's balance sheet represents public
sector obligations: if the return on the portfolio managed by CDG on behalf of social security (CNSS) is higher,
this will convert into a lower future liability for the Treasury. Second, the removal of another non-market rate
may strengthen the trend of interest rate reduction throughout the financial system, therefore allowing the
Treasury to fund itself at a lower cost.
42.   The main cost to be faced upon implementation of the pension reform will be the upfront fiscal cost of
the transition towards a multipillar pension system, with fully funded pension plans. This cost, to be determined
on the basis of the detailed actuarial analysis of Morocco's pension plans, and deriving from the policy choices
to be made as a result (the cost is a function among other things of the number of pensioners moving into a
funded pillar), could be as high as 1-1.5 percent of GDP.
43.   The Government of Morocco has expressed in the Letter of Development Policy its commitment to
implement a comprehensive program aimed at accelerating economic growth and at ensuring that such growth
benefits the entire population. The program, as expressed in the Letter of development policy for this loan
(Annex III), encompasses the two key themes of (a) strengthening the private sector as an engine of growth,
notably through a continuation of sound macroeconomic policies, financial sector reform, privatization
(including in the banking sector), and private participation in infrastructure; and (b) accelerating social and
rural development, with specific targets set for the provision of basic infrastructure, and increased education
and health coverage. This is a broad set of reforms whose costs for the Government - as well as the benefits for
the economy - will be substantial.
44.   High indebtedness, macroeconomic vulnerability. The fiscal cost of the proposed reform program is
the main rationale for the proposed adjustment support to Morocco. In addition, it must be noted that
Morocco's balance of payments remains vulnerable to external shocks, and that reducing the domestic
financing of the budget deficit would ease the crowding out effect. In particular:
*  The balance of payments remains vulnerable to external shocks -- variability of oil and phosphate prices,
periodic droughts, slowdowns in growth of its major export market (the European Union), swings in
tourism and foreign direct investment. In addition, with a high debt service burden of 30 percent, major
fluctuations in export proceeds would reduce Morocco's capacity to import. The following trends are
likely to influence economic performance: (a) prospects for continued growth in the EU are good, and oil
prices (at about US$20 a barrel, the highest level since 1990) are unlikely to climb much in coming years;
(b) phosphate prices are 20 percent above their early 1990 level; a return to that level would reduce exports
by 3 percent; (c) a repeat of the 1995 drought would maintain food imports at their 1995 and 1996 level, or
nearly 60 percent higher than in 1994. Morocco has built up foreign reserves equivalent to five months
worth of imports by mid-1997. Foreign borrowing will contribute to strengthen this reserve position, and
thus represents a prudent policy for Morocco.
*  Since 1993, Morocco has made net repayments on its foreign loans averaging US$400 million a year, in an
effort to ease its debt service burden. The stagnation of capital expenditures also contributed to lower
project related disbursements. As a result, financing the budget has come to rely increasingly on domestic
resources (3.2 percent of GDP in 1996/97 compared with less than I percent in 1991). Given the modest
level of national savings, this has put pressure on the cost of capital and has contributed to crowding out of
20    This is the rate on 5-years Treasury bonds, which will be used as benchmark retun on CDG's pooled funds.



20
private sector investments. The availability of a quick disbursing loan, bolstered by a lower overall budget
deficit, would contribute to easing this crowding out effect. In addition, the Bank is helping Morocco to
elaborate and implement a consistent strategy to reduce the debt burden. Among others, IDF funding has
been approved to finance the implementation of active debt management techniques by the Treasury.
B.    Benefits and risks
45.   Benefits. The benefits of these reforms are potentially very large, although difficult to quantify,
especially in the short run. They are, in the short run:
*  Increased competitiveness, transfer of know-how and new products that will derive from allowing foreign
ownership of domestic insurance companies in the context of the new Insurance code.
*  An improvement in the image and competitiveness of the insurance industry.
*  The immediate benefits from launching the pension reform will derive from: the freeze of all ad hoc
increases in the generosity of pension plans; the establishment of a Committee to launch the reform; a
public awareness campaign; the launching of in-depth actuarial and financial analyses of the system; and
the implementation of transparent and timely pension accounting and disclosure -- these measures will
highlight weaknesses in the existing system, speed up the reform effort and reduce long term costs.
*  Removing the fixed administered rate on CDG deposits and the transformation of CDG into a fiduciary
fund manager for its main depositors will have a positive impact on the financial returns to institutional
investors, and ultimately to the social security contributors in the case of CNSS, and the postal savers in the
case of CEN. In particular, reduction in the intermediation costs charged by CDG to its main depositors
could bring savings of about 145 basis points on the managed funds.2' In addition, the changes proposed in
CDG's mandate will significantly improve the transparency of its investment process and allow its
customers to better monitor portfolio performance.
46.   The current amount of resources mobilized by insurance, pension, and postal savings (a large part of
which is intermediated by CDG) affected by the policy actions supported by this loan is about DH5 billion, i.e.,
US$550 million, equivalent to 2.5 percent of GDP (excluding family allowances).
47.   In the long term, the greater benefit will come from pension reformn. As the simulations in Annex VI
show, the present system will start generating deficits in the year 2014 at the latest. Postponing a solution will
entail a much larger fiscal cost -- according to the simulations, the net present discounted value of the
accumulated debt, without any reform, could be as high as 65 percent of 1994 GDP. In addition, there are large
potential benefits from the development of a funded pillar. A quantitative evaluation of these benefits will be
possible only after detailed information on each plan is disclosed and a clear reform strategy has been agreed.
However, a good yardstick can be the outcome of the Latin American reforms. Latin American pension funds
managed combined assets of more than US$ 100 billion in 1996, and these funds are expected to quintuple over
the next decade. These long-term resources have contributed to private investment -- including privately
financed large infrastructure projects -- and to sustained growth.
48.   Risks. The main risks of this operation concern:
*  the potential impact on the resources needed to implement the insurance and pension reforms which could
derive from a fiscal slippage, in particular the recurrent component of Government expenditures (especially
civil servants' wage bill);
*  the possibility that the Government will make ad hoc pension concessions in the near future (by modifying
pension parameters without actuarial adjustment), thus further worsening the system's sustainability;
*  the commitment of the authorities to implement the pension reform.
21    This will arise from CDG's transformation from a deposit taking intermediary (charging an intermediation
margin) to an institutional portfolio manager (charging a management fee).



21
49.   These risks will be mitigated by the strong commitment of the Moroccan authorities to pursuing the
proposed reforms, as shown in the Letter of development policy. Furthermore, it is mutually understood that
adherence to the fiscal monitoring indicators agreed within the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) will be an
essential pre-requisite for continued Bank support, in the form of additional follow-up loans, for implementing
the longer term reform program.
C.    This loan and the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
50.   This project aims at alleviating one of the main growth constraints for the Moroccan economy, as
identified in the CAS discussed by the Board on January 30, 1997. Low savings and an inadequate supply of
long-term capital tend to increase the cost of capital and undermine external competitiveness. One quick-
disbursing policy-based operation to support the Government of Morocco's efforts to alleviate these growth
constraints is included in the base case lending program, and is consistent with broadly containing Bank
exposure to Morocco within the guidelines. The base case lending program presented in the CAS gives priority
to a policy-based operation in support of PE reform; we propose, however, to proceed first with this loan, on
the grounds that preparation of the reforms to be implemented under CSDL are at a more advanced stage than it
is the case for a program of Bank support to PE restructuring.
51.   The triggers to the base case lending program are: (a) continued improvement of macroeconomic
indicators; (b) progress in implementation of the social priority projects; and (c) progress in PE reform. Based
on available information, these conditions appear to be satisfied.22 The Government of Morocco's continuing
commitment to the long term reform program is expressed in the Letter of development policy.
V.    RECOMMENDATION
52.   1 am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

In the social sectors, implementation of two of the three BAJ projects is satisfactory (delays remain in the BAJ-
Education project), and the PAGER rural water program was successfully negotiated in July 1997. Recent
progress on PE reform include the approval of a far-reaching telecommunications reform law; multi-service
concessions to private sector providers (Casablanca water, wastewater and electricity distribution); preparation of
infrastructure projects involving private participation (Tanger port, Casablanca-El Jadida toll road) and of a
second-phase privatization strategy to be endorsed by the Government

ANNEX Il.
LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
Dear Mr. President:
I .    Morocco has implemented since the beginning of the 1980s a consistent strategy of structural
adjustment and macroeconomic stabilization, which has allowed the country to grow at an average real rate of
4 percent per year over the period 1980-1996. The 1990-1996 period has witnessed an effort to consolidate the
macroeconomic framework and accelerate strong and sustainable economic growth, by allowing the private
sector to play a larger role as an engine of growth. Important legislative and regulatory reforms in the banking
sector and capital markets, the liberalization of interest rates and the gradual elimination of credit ceilings,
extensive privatization, the signature of a free trade agreement with the European Union have strengthened this
process.
2.    More progress still needs to be achieved in order to reach a level of savings and investment sufficient to
maintain economic growth and to avoid excessive dependence on external borrowing, and to ensure a better
allocation of this growth to the entire population. Thus, the Government will put in place a program focused
on two key themes:
*  An accelerated pace of reforms, aimed at strengthening the private sector as an engine of growth through
continued privatization, the opening of infrastructure to private capital and competition, and the launching
of public sector reform; and
* In parallel; continuation of a comprehensive social and rural development policy aimed at accelerating
basic infrastructure provision in underprivileged rural and periphery urban areas; and launching a reform of
education and health so as to expand coverage of basic services to the entire population.
To meet these challenges, the Government intends to deepen its actions in the following areas:
3.    Private sector development: (i) continuation of sound macroeconomic policies, aimed at reducing the
budget deficit to a sustainable level, at reducing the debt burden, at making productive investments a priority in
public expenditure, and at maintaining inflation under control so as to ensure external competitiveness;
(ii) continued efforts to upgrade the legislative and judiciary framework; (iii) continuation of financial sector
reforms as detailed in the following paragraphs; (iv) continuation of the privatization program; and
(v) increased efforts to attract private investment in infrastructure, notably in the energy, telecommunications
and transport sectors. It should be highlighted that the Government is already well advanced in the
implementation of these reforns: the decrees of application of the new law on telecommunications are being
prepared, an agreement has been reached with an independent provider for electricity production, and several
other projects are under study. Furthermore, the Government has recently launched a study to initiate an in-
depth reform of the public sector, to adapt it to the new role of State in the regulation of the economy. It has
also put in place mechanisms of accrued dialogue with the organization of employers and trade unions.
4.    Social sector and rural development: the integration of underprivileged population groups in the
development process is a major concern for the Government, and constitutes a fundamental target in its
development policy. It should be noted that long-dated efforts have been undertaken in this respect. The
policies and objectives detailed below aim at pursuing the implementation of the main programs: (i) For rural
infrastructure, the Government has put in place three major programs aimed at achieving, over a ten-year



Annex III
Page 2 of 5
period, access to drinking water and electricity for 80 percent of the rural population, and the realization of
11,000 kilometers of rural roads. Appropriate financial mechanisms have been devised for roads and
electricity, and are under final exam in the case of the drinking water access program. At this regard, the
Government will make all its efforts to reach 40 percent of the rural population with drinking water and
electricity by the year 2000. (ii) Furthermore, the Government has adopted the principle of decentralization as
a way of increasing local governments' responsibility in the development process. The Government is also
examining the modalities of cooperation with non-governmental organizations in order to enhance the
effectiveness of public sector development programs. (iii) Two major reforms are also under study in the
education and health sectors. The main objective of these reforms is to increase the coverage of basic services
and to improve their quality, with particular emphasis on women and girls in rural areas. In the education
sector, the Government will do everything possible to reach a rate of primary school enrollment on the national
level of 84 per cent by the year 2000/01 and 95 per cent by the year 2005/06. The Government will also make
an effort to move rapidly in the coming years towards a gross rate of primary school enrollment for girls in the
rural areas of 52 per cent by the year 2000/01 and 60 per cent by the year 2005/06. The Government has also
launched a social priority program covering the 13 poorest provinces, which is now operational and benefits
from priority budgetary allocations. (iv) The Government is also studying new social housing policies aimed at
clarifying the role of the private and the public sectors in providing social housing; launching a mortgage
market; and centralizing public intervention for low income population groups and unhealthy housing. (v)
Finally, the Government will put in place a social observatory before year-end to insure follow-up of all
activities in the social sectors.
5.    Financial sector reform. Much more needs to be done to ensure that private domestic savings and
investmnent will be sufficient to spur stronger economic growth, and to avoid an excessive reliance on external
borrowing. Domestically, several efforts have to be made to improve the availability of long-term funds for
productive investments. On the external front, Morocco is experiencing a negative net resource transfer from
official multilateral and bilateral donors, and faces a high cost of capital from commercial lenders. Therefore,
an improvement in the allocation of domestic savings, as well as an increase in their level, are key pre-
requisites for higher growth. Large portions of domestic savings, channeled towards contractual savings
institutions, or captured by the informal sector, could be put to more efficient use by creating modern
mechanisms and conditions for a more efficient accumulation and financial management of funds.
6.    The reforms and developments of the last five years have contributed to the upgrading of the banking
sector, which today is sound and largely private, and to the modernization and expansion of capital markets,
especially the Casablanca Stock Exchange -- now a private, dynamic institution. The Government intends to
pursue this approach. For the banking sector, the Government intends to complete the privatization process of
the Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE) and to proceed with the modification of the
institutional framework for the Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP) so as to open its capital to the private sector.
It also intends to implement the restructuring of CNCA, including in particular its recapitalization; paying
Treasury's arrears to CNCA; handling farmers' overindebtedness; and strengthening CNCA's management
capacities. Finally, the Government will pursue the liberalization of the foreign exchange market in order to
gradually strengthen the convertibility of the dirham.
7.    Competition among alternative instruments, agents and institutions needs to be further encouraged, in
order to deepen financial markets, reduce the overall cost of capital, and allow productive firms to obtain long-
term funding from a menu of possible sources, direct and indirect. In addition, competition must be
encouraged in a climate of transparency and disclosure, where individuals can take informed financial decisions
and invest their savings in an efficient manner, within clear rules of prudential control on the institutions acting
on their behalf. To meet these new challenges, the Government intends to pursue a comprehensive reform
program focused on three broad themes:
* first, by launching a deep reform of contractual savings institutions and, in the medium term, by
encouraging the emergence of institutional investors and pension funds, the Government aims at obtaining
a better allocation of long-term funds and an improvement in domestic savings rates;



Annex III
Page 3 of 5
* second, by developing and encouraging alternative vehicles for savings and investment (mutual funds,
insurance companies, pension funds, and a whole fund management industry), it aims at spurring
competition in the financial sector;
* third, by launching the reform of the pension system, it aims not only at creating new vehicles for the
accumulation and investment of long-term capital, but also at providing the conditions to improve the long-
term viability the pension systems.
8.    This is a deep, structural set of reforms, which will take time and continued efforts to carry out. To
ensure effective design and implementation of this broad reform program, the Government is seeking the
assistance of the World Bank and of the African Development Bank in terms of technical assistance and
financial support. The present operation, whose specific actions are detailed in the attached policy matrix
(Table I), covers the first phase of contractual savings reform -- in the areas of insurance, pensions, savings
intermediaries, and capital markets. It lays the groundwork for subsequent reforms through:
* the restructuring of insurance companies in precarious financial conditions;
* an in-depth analysis of pension reform options;
* the drafting of new legislation and regulations on fund management, and the promotion of this industry.
9.    This operation must thus be seen as the initial component of the medium-term strategy, which the
Government is committed to implement in its entirety. The medium-term Government program -- as detailed
in the attached matrix (Table II) -- aims at continuing and deepening the reforms started under the present
operation. The key objective of this medium-term strategy is to define and then put in place a modern, viable,
and possibly multipillar pension system, while at the same time developing the financial market infrastructure
necessary for the efficient allocation of pension funds assets. To allow this, new instruments and agents, and
specific expertise -- through training, transfer of know-how and practice -- will have to be developed.
10.   The implementation of this continuum of reforms over the next few years will require technical
assistance, monitoring, and eventually funding from the World Bank and the African Development Bank. To
this purpose, the Government of Morocco intends to pursue its cooperation with the World Bank to:
* continue the financial restructuring and liberalization of the insurance sector;
* define, on the basis of analysis, actuarial studies, financial audits, and consultations with the different
stakeholders, a detailed program for pension reform;
* define a parallel program of capital market upgrading and improved competition in savings intermediation
and management; and
* define a program of technical assistance required to guarantee the success of the overall reform program.
11.   Insurance. In the insurance sector, the medium term strategy will involve:
(a)   settling the outstanding claims on bankrupt insurance companies;
(b)    concluding an agreement between the Ministry of Finance and representatives of the insurance
sector, specifying the conditions, modalities and timetable of tariffs liberalization, which the
insurance companies will be called to apply by the year 2001;
(c)   re-examining the role of the Fonds de solidarite with a view to restructure it and redefine its
role in the insurance sector; and
(d)    engaging in di,cussions with the Ministry of Justice, the insurance companies, and other
professions involved (lawyers, medical doctors, experts, etc.) with a view to reducing the
delays in the payments of claims by insurance companies.
12.   Pensions. Pension reform is today at its initial stage. The Government of Morocco has the intention to
undertake a broad sequence of actions as part of this medium-term strategy for pension reform; the specific



Annex III
Page 4 of 5
actions to be undertaken will need to be examined and defined along the way. This sequence will involve in
particular:
(a)   the completion of the actuarial studies and financial audits of the Moroccan pension schemes,
under the supervision of an inter-ministerial Pension Reform Committee (Comite de Suivi),
supported by the advice and technical assistance of the World Bank as well as other donors;
(b)   the elaboration by the Comite de Suivi of a comprehensive report, including a quantitative
estimation of the financial implication of alternative reform scenarios, leading to pragmatic and
feasible proposals;
(c)   the preparation, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance, of a medium-term reform
program, action plan and timetable for implementation based on the results of these studies;
(d)   the development of the necessary framework for the development of capitalized pension funds,
whose parameters are to be identified based on the conclusions of the studies; and
(e)   the freezing of the current parameters of all pension funds, except in the case of reductions in
their generosity.
13.   Capital markets and savings intermediation. The sustained reform of capital markets and savings
intermediaries will accompany the implementation of insurance and pension reforms. Capital markets reform
will entail the adoption of new regulatory measures on: (a) portfolio management on behalf of third parties
(including the licensing of portfolio investment management firms and investment advisors); (b) money market
mutual funds; and (c) pension funds. Savings intermediaries will undergo major changes, which will make
them increasingly subject to market conditions, improve their competitiveness, and promote competition in
asset management.
14.   The transformation of the role of CDG in the Moroccan financial system deserves special attention.
With deposits amounting to 9 percent of total financial savings, CDG plays an important role in the Morocco's
financial system mainly as a secured financial outlet for excess cash balances from various institutions, and
also as a rare but steady supplier of long term funds. As other financial institutions, CDG needs to adapt to a
rapidly changing market environment. The ongoing financial sector reforms leave increasing room for market
forces and promote a wider use of direct financial instruments. These reforms call CDG to become a more
active and competitive participant in the securities market, by complying with performance measurement
requirements in the management of funds on behalf of its depositors.
15.   More than 80 percent of CDG's assets consist of fixed income securities and more than 70 percent of
its liabilities derive from its two largest depositors, the main social security fund (CNSS) and the postal savings
institution (CEN). The Government short and medium-term development plan for CDG aims at promoting its
role as a fund manager while building the institutional capacities of its two main depositors. To this end, CDG
will have to reposition itself on market-based activities, and in particular to develop its fund management skills.
16.   The actions foreseen by the present operation thus involve: (a) the creation of two segregated mutual
funds for each of CDG's two main depositors, CNSS and CEN based upon customer relationship; (b) the
introduction of a Treasury bond index for the remuneration of the remaining pooled funds. The first action
implies that CNSS and CEN acquire the necessary managerial skills to evolve from their current status of
passive depositors towards one of active participants in the definition and monitoring of their respective
investment policy. Both components of this plan mean that the source of CDG revenues will gradually change
from an asset-liability spread to a fee-based income from asset management. This will lead to a significant
reduction in government receipts from CDG, in the form of dividends and taxes, which will benefit CDG's
current and future customers.
17.   In the future, CDG's role will evolve from a captive deposit taking institution to a competitive asset
manager on behalf of its main depositors. For CEN, this implies (a) a gradual transfer of its funds to fiduciary
management; and (b) the creation of procedures and structures necessary for its active participation in



Annex III
Page 5 of 5
investment decisions. At the same time, in addition to developing CEN's institutional capacities, restructuring
efforts will be oriented towards upgrading and enhancing its role in the collection of small-scale savings -- one
of the key reform objectives. Once CEN's internal structure and CDG's management capacity are sufficiently
developed, a part of CEN's funds could be managed by external fund managers, according to mutually agreed
conditions.
18.   The material that follows in the attachments provides further detail on the Contractual Savings
Development program and the medium-term reform strategy. The Government of Morocco is committed to
carrying out the actions enumerated in Table I.

around 10 percent (5-year Treasury bond rate, to be used as benchmark return on the pooled funds).
Other things being equal, this will reduce the margin realized by CDG -- and transferred to the Treasury
in the form of dividends and taxes -- by about 145 basis points.

MOROCCO: RECENT FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM
1.    Treasury financing/reduction of public sector's preferential access to savings24
* Mandatory Treasury bonds to sight deposits ratio is reduced from 35 to 25 (FSDP, 1991), and to 10 percent
(FMDL, 1995-96).
* Auction market for T-bills is opened to insurance companies and other enterprises (FSDP, 1991).
* Bank mandatory holdings of bonds issued by SFIs are (except for agricultural bank, CNCA) eliminated in
1994.
* Fiscal incentives to purchase Treasury bonds are eliminated (FMDL, 1995).
* Access to auction market for T-bills is gradually broadened to include, since 1995, all economic agents,
residents and nonresidents. While only banks may submit bids for their own account as well as for
customers, the list of participants eligible to submit bids for their own account was extended in August
1996 to include insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds.
* The maturity structure of short-term as well as medium- and long-term bills is simplified, and tap issues
introduced to enhance market liquidity (FMDL, 1996).
* BAM establishes a clearing and settlement system for secondary market transactions in Treasury bills (Jan.
1996).
- Treasury starts reducing the premium qn bonds issued to nonfinancial residents over bills sold through
auctions, to unify the market for Treasury securities (March 1996).
2.    Indirect monetary control
* Removal of credit ceilings (encadrement du credit - FSDP, 1991).
* Setting of single rate on all variable rate BAM advances (7 days) (FSDP, 1991).
* Liberalization of rates on deposits with maturity longer than 3 months (FSDP, 1991).
* Establishment of market-related, adjustable ceiling on lending rates (1991, FSDP).
* Elimination of ceilings on lending rates; all banks required to quote a prime rate (FMDL, February 1996).
* BAM introduces weekly repurchase auctions as the main channel for bank rediscount. Banks can also enter
five-day repurchase agreements at rates exceeding those of the repurchase auctions (FMDL, June 1995).
* Bank reserve requirement calculation is shifted from a weekly and monthly basis to a daily average over a
period of one month. This provides banks with greater flexibility in the management of their liquidity and
encourages money market operations (FMDL, September 1996).
3.    Banking sector
* Strengthening of bank supervision: the risk concentration ratio is redefined in 1992 to include all bank
commitments. A minimum ratio of 8 percent of capital to risk-weighted assets, in accordance with BIS
Basle standards, becomes effective in 1993 (FSDP). New loan classification and loss provisioning
regulations are adopted in May 1993, followed in July 1993 by the requirement of independent audits.
Provisioning reaches 75 percent of required levels at the end of 1995, and full compliance by all banks is
24    Sources: World Bank, President Reports, various issues; IMF, StaffReport, 1996.



Annex V
Page 2 of 2
expected to be reached in the financial statements for 1996. FMDL in 1996 also strengthens bank
supervision rules concerning foreign exchange transactions of banks. Beginning July 1996, (FSDP,
FMDL), SFIs become subject to capital adequacy and risk concentration ratio rules.
* Bank privatization: BMCE and SNI are privatized in 1995 (FMDL). BNDE is offered for sale in 1996/1997
(FMDL). CIH restructuring plan is being adopted prior to offer for sale (FMDL, 1997). BCP articles of
agreement, modified through new legislation (FMDL, early 1997) to allow offer for sale.
*  Establishment of aforeign exchange market: The minimum provision of DH100,000 required for opening
nonresident Moroccan accounts in foreign currencies is eliminated in 1995, and the foreign currency
account limits for exporters of goods and services are increased from 10 and 5 percent, respectively, to 20
percent (FMDL). BAM in 1996 issues regulations establishing an interbank foreign exchange market where
banks are authorized to deal among themselves and with their clients foreign currencies against foreign
currencies, and foreign currencies against the dirham in the domestic market (FMDL). BAM issues
standards for the accounting treatment of bank foreign currency operations in 1996.
4.    Capital market development
* Privatization of the Casablanca Stock Exchange in 1995. Establishment in 1994 of the Securities
Commission (Conseil Deontologique des Valeurs Mobilieres - CDVM), to supervise market functioning
and ensure compliance with the new regulations.
- Operational upgrades to CDVM: first formal annual report, 1996 (FMDL).
- Issuance of comprehensive decrees and regulations implementing the new Stock Exchange Law (1993) and
defining the framework of operation for mutual funds and equity funds (FMDL, 1995, 1996, 1997).
- Implementation of accounting framework for mutual funds (FMDL, 1996).
* Presentation of Law on Corporations to the Parliament (FMDL, 1996).
* Implementation of an action plan (and approval of related legislation in 1996) creating a central depository
system for securities traded in the stock exchange, of a trade settlement and delivery system, and of an
automated quote system (to be finalized before end 1997, FMDL).
* Approval by the Prime Minister of rules governing the National Council for Accounting and presentation to
the Council of Government of the draft law on the preparation, publication, and certification of
consolidated financial statements (FMDL, 1996).
* Elimination of Government guarantee on domestic bond issues by public enterprises (FMDL, 1996).
* Enactment of the law on accounting rules to be applied by insurance companies (FMDL, 1995), and
issuance of a decree by Minister of Finance setting accounting rules for insurance companies (FMDL,
1996).
* Fiscal neutrality of mutual funds (1996).
* Launching of study and action plan on the status and potential role of institutional savers in the
development of financial markets (completed, Bossard, 1996; FMDL).
* By August 1996, 13 brokerage firms and 18 mutual funds have been approved. Most of these have been set
up by banks, which are no longer allowed to directly operate on the stock market.

ANNEX VI.
A SIMULATION ANALYSIS OF THE LONG-TERM
PENSION SYSTEM OF CNSS
A.    Introduction
CNSS (Caisse Nationale de Securite Sociale) is the main Moroccan pension fund, covering private
sector employees on a mandatory basis. It provides a variety of services, including family allowances and
family health assistance; short-term pensions to cover short-term sickness, maternity, birth and death; and long-
term pensions to cover disability, old-age and survivor benefits. It also operates 13 polyclinics and provides
limited additional health care. The CNSS covered approximately 900,000 effective contributors in 1994,
almost 11 percent of the labor force.
This annex isolates the long-term pension component of CNSS and analyzes its evolution and financial
sustainability. Before discussing this component in detail, however, it is worthwhile looking briefly at the
overall situation of CNSS. Most of CNSS revenues are derived from contributions, collected from employers
and employees. Contributions are specifically divided between the three major functions, with the following
contribution rates in place since March 1995:
EMPLOYER        EMPLOYEE           TOTAL
FAMILY ALLOWANCES                  8.87              --              8.87
SHORT-TERM PENSIONS                0.44             0.22             0.66
LONG-TERM PENSIONS            ,    6.08             3.04             9.12
TOTAL                   15.39            3.26             18.65
Contributions to the long-term pension system are subject to a wage ceiling of DH5,000 per month.
Funds totaling DH10.3 trillion have been accumulated by end-1995, equivalent to over three years of
expenditures; interest on these reserves, which are mandatorily deposited at CDG (Caisse de Depot et de
Gestion), accounted for 14 percent of CNSS revenue in 1995. The surpluses of CNSS are due to the very high
contribution to family allowances, the proceeds of which have been used to subsidize old-age pensions. In
1995 for example, family allowances accounted for 55 percent of contribution revenues and only 38 percent of
expenditures; conversely, long-term pension accounted for 42 percent of contribution revenue and 55 percent of
expenditures. Contribution rates to long-term pensions have gradually increased in recent years, from 5.04
percent in 1993 to 9.12 percent since March 1995. But given that long-term pension contributions are subject
to the wage ceiling, while family allowances are not, these changes have not been sufficient to correct the
situation. The imbalance is expected to worsen as the population ages.

CNSS has corrected this imbalance "on the books" by shifting resources among the accounts it holds at
CDG. Substantial funds have been transferred from the family allowances account (and to a minor extent from
the short-term pensions account) into the long-term pensions account. The effects of the reallocation of funds
are reported in the table above, which shows the actual distribution of CNSS' resources (collected contributions
minus payments), and the resources as currently reallocated at CDG.
CNSS' long-term pension system
CNSS runs a defined benefits pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system. Current outlays of pension
benefits are paid out of current revenues from a payroll tax. The system is mandatory and publicly-managed,
and covered 142,000 beneficiaries of long-term pensions in 1994 -- distributed among old-age pensioners
(76 percent), survivors (22 percent), and disability pensioners (2 percent). Eligibility and benefit rules for the
different categories of long-term pensions are reported in the table below. These rules are fairly generous.
Despite this generosity, however, defacto the average old age pension replacement rate was only 34 percent in
1994; this reflects a young pension system where contributors have not yet acquired their full pension rights.

Shortcomings of the present system
Our simulations indicate that the long-term pension system of CNSS is heading towards trouble.25 The
system is projected to be in cash deficit by the year 2014, with the reserves fund being depleted soon after (in
the year 2022). If system maturity is taken into account -- perhaps a more realistic scenario -- the pension
system is projected to be in cash deficit as early as in 1998.26 The substantial fund reserves of DH5.5 billion
(taking into account CNSS funds reallocation) will also deplete by 2010. This implies that current new entrants
into the labor force are expected to contribute to a system which will be bankrupt when these individuals start
working or are in the midst of their working careers. If the current system prevails throughout the simulation
period, given the demographic evolution of Morocco, the present discounted value of the cumulative cash
liabilities of the pension system could be as high as 28 percent of 1994 GDP. The implicit pension liability of
the system (in the hypothesis it had stopped in the base year) would be 43 percent of 1994 GDP.
These are tentative and initial results.
"System maturation" is the process in which young people who are eligible for pension, an a new system,
gradually grow old and retire, thereby raising the system dependency ratio to the demographic dependency ratio.
In a fully mature system all old people in the covered group are eligible for full pensions.



Annex VI
Page 3 of 15
In addition to demographic pressures, system maturity will also exert increasing financial pressures on
the long-term pension component of CNSS. This is because the average benefit level will rise to reflect longer
contribution histories of the plan's affiliates. In fact, the present discounted value of the cash liabilities of the
pension system could be as high as 65 percent of the base year GDP if system maturity is taken into account. In
this case, the implicit pension liability would also be higher, at 47 percent of 1994 GDP.
The CNSS pension component has a few other problems as well.
*  Current coverage rates are exceedingly low (11 percent), stemming from low male and female labor force
participation rates.
*  The number of years of contribution required before becoming eligible for pensions is also exceedingly low
by international standards. On average, a contributor can retire after only 10 or 15 years of contributions
provided he or she is 60. This creates a very serious incentive to evade.
*  There is no link between contributions and benefits - thereby creating an environment for adverse labor
market incentives.
*  There is no indexation of pension benefits to either wages or inflation thereby substantially eroding the real
value of pensions over time.
*  The current ceiling on contributions results in revenue loss for the pension system, and favors high-income
groups, thereby introducing inequities in the labor market.
*  The rising payroll taxes necessary to balance a rapidly dwindling pension fund would most likely have
serious consequences on the competitiveness of labor markets, and on labor demand. This effect is
exacerbated by the low rate of returns on current pension fund surpluses.
e  To the extent that earlier generations.receive a higher income transfer, the incentive for private savings is
reduced. Moreover, deficit financing of the pension fund through government borrowing would further
reduce the savings available for future growth and investments.
Scope andfocus of the paper
This paper provides a description of the simulations performed on the long-term pension component of
the CNSS. Further, the focus is on providing a glimpse of the behavior of the current PAYG system. With
additional data, later drafts will include simulations for some reform options and sensitivity analyses under
different assumptions.
Due to data availability, the starting year for the simulation horizon is 1994. The end year is 2054 --
implying a simulation horizon of sixty years. Two sets of simulation results are considered in this analysis:
a  Base Case Scenario. The first scenario corresponds to the pension system as it exists today, with no change
in any of the parameters except for demographic changes. Hence this set of simulations could be considered
to reflect the impact of pure demographic shocks on the long term pension system.
*  System Maturity Scenario. The second set of simulations were performed under the assumption of system
maturity. As the system matures, more and more workers will acquire the necessary contribution rights to
secure pension benefits. Specifically, we allowed the pension system's nominal coverage rates to expand
to 20 percent for males and 8 percent for females by the year 2040. These are conservative estimates and
reflect the coverage rates for the cohorts aged 30-35 in 1994.
Our simulation strategy is simple. First, the population is projected to the year 2054. Next, the
demographic profile of the pension system is derived and projected based on data available for the base year.
Finally, financial projections are derived by superimposing financial data and other pertinent information on
the demographic profile. Some of the key macroeconomic assumptions and pension parameters used for this
analysis are reported in the table below. All macroeconomic assumptions are based on World Bank estimates.

B.     Simulation Results
The data for these simulations were provided by CNSS and the Direction des assurances et de la
prevoyance sociale at the Ministry of Finance of Morocco. The simulations were run using PROST version Sc,
a visual basic pension simulation application/program.27
Population Projections
The population of Morocco is projected to increase from approximately 26 million in 1994 to about 60
million by the year 2054.28 Much of the pressure on the existing pension system will stem from the rapid aging
of the population as the average age rises from 25 to 37.5. Like in other developing countries, falling mortality
rates, together with falling fertility rates and low immigration, will spell trouble for the PAYG long-term
pension system -- which taxes current workers to finance the retirement of 'their elders. The share of population
over 60 years of age is expected to grow from 7 percent to almost 22 percent over the simulation horizon,
suggesting a young but rapidly aging population profile. In contrast, the proportion of working aged
individuals as a fraction of total population is expected to grow by only 3 percent. The number of old aged
individuals per hundred working-age individuals (the old age dependency ratio) will grow from 12.7 to 36.7, a
fairly rapid increase, suggesting that more and more workers are necessary to support an aging population.
These rates of growth are much higher than those experienced by even the older developed nations.
The demographic pressure will raise CNSS' social security expenditures, as it has been the case in most
countries with older populations. These trends imply that in order to ensure a viable pension system, young
workers will be required to sacrifice a high and increasing share of their own well-being to fulfill the promises
made to the elders by CNSS. Given that higher income groups usually live longer, and given their ceiling on

These population predictions are based on mortality rate projections which imply that the life expectancy at birth
of the average male (female) would increase from 65.6 (69.2) in 1994 to 78.2 (81.6) by the end of the projection.
Total fertility is expected to decrease from 3.68 in 1994 to about 2.66 in 2054. The basis for the mortality
assumptions was RCFN55 adjusted for improved mortality according to Bank estimates.

contributions during their working years, this also amounts to an income transfer from low income workers to
higher income retirees.
Demographics of the pension system
Given the population projections and the coverage rate assumptions of the pension system, the stock of
potential contributors is expected to grow from approximately 1.2 million in the base year (1994), to about 3.12
million by the end of the simulation horizon, 2054. Accounting for evasion (a measure of contributor
headcount loss), the stock of actual contributors grows from only about .9 million in 1994 to 2.34 million by the
end of 2054.29 With system maturity, these numbers are higher, with the stock of effective contributors
becoming almost 2.9 million by 2054. These numbers suggest that there is scope as well as a serious need to
increase the pool of contributors. Strengthening measures to increase compliance and reduce the leakage of
potential contributors would increase the number of contributors by almost 25 percent. These would include
setting up better information systems to track down individual work histories, as well as changing the current
benefit rules which allow workers to retire after only 10 or 15 years of contributions. Similarly, increasing
coverage and labor force participation rates, which are very low in Morocco, especially for women, would
increase the pool of potential contributors at first and increase the revenues of the pension fund.30
The stock of beneficiaries is expected to grow from about 140,000 to close to one million (900,000)
during the period 1994-2054, with old-age pensioners accounting for much of the increase. Thus, the old-age
pension system dependency ratio will move in parallel to the population dependency ratio, rising rapidly from
its starting value of 12.0 to 30.9. This implies that more and more contributors will be required to finance a
growing number of old age pensioners. Accounting for system maturity raises total beneficiaries to about two
million by 2054. A direct implication of this is that future benefit levels will have to fall, or future payroll
taxes to rise, in order for the pension system to remain financially viable.
As mentioned earlier, some of this rise in the system dependency ratio may be alleviated in the short
run by increasing coverage and raising the minimum retirement age and/or the minimum years of contribution -
- an approach that has been tried by several OECD countries like France,31 Germany, Japan and the United
States. The mandatory retirement age in Morocco is 60 for both genders, and is low in comparison to other
countries with similar demographic profiles and much lower than in the OECD countries. While there is some
rationale to this in the sense that early retirement may be viewed as a means of reducing unemployment by
encouraging older workers to withdraw from the labor force -- this may not be an appropriate policy in a
growing economy with already low labor force participation rates. In addition, with increasing life expectancy,
the retirement age should be raised in order to curtail the pension fund expenditures of the CNSS. With a
higher retirement age, workers accrue higher benefit rights as their working histories are lengthened, but these
benefits are paid over a shorter period of time and there may be a net gain to the pension fund.
In the long run, with increased coverage and labor force participation, the future stock of beneficiaries
will invariably rise. Moreover, as hinted earlier, raising the retirement age will not automatically reduce
pension fund expenses. Workers will accumulate more rights and new retirees will have to be compensated.
Whether this actually increases expenditures or not depends on a number of parameters. However, because the
time lag between enlarged coverage of the pension system and eligibility for benefits could stretch over two
decades, the full impact of extensions of coverage and labor force participation would be felt later.
29     This is a very conservative estimate. In all probability, evasion will be higher as younger workers accumulate their
required years of service quickly.
30     Although when these individuals retire they would eventually have to be paid their pensions. Thus total pension
liability may in fact go up.
31     France has raised the qualifying period for full benefits from 37.5 years to 40 years, and has raised the base
earnings for computing benefits from 10 to 25 years and changed the indexing rules from wage indexing to base
indexing.

Financial Evolution
Like most immature systems, the long-term pension component of CNSS had accumulated fund
reserves by 1994 -- about DH550 million based on contributions minus payments; or DH5.5 billion accounting
for the transfer of family allowance reserves -- along with a small cash reserve. However, these reserves are
expected to decline rapidly. According to our base-case simulations, by the year 2014 the cash reserves will be
in deficit, meaning that the current payroll taxes will not be sufficient to cover current pension obligations. At
this juncture, the system will either have to start raising payroll taxes or reduce the replacement rate to new
pensioners -- neither of which are viable nor politically palatable. Raising payroll taxes or educing the
replacement rate could also have serious repercussions on the labor market. By the end of t Ae simulation
period, the fund would have to collect more than twice the payroll tax rate -- increasing from about 7 percent in
1994 to about 8.5 percent in 2020 and to 16.5 percent in 2054 -- in order to maintain current replacement rates.
Alternatively, the average replacement rate would have to fall by more than 200 percent. Given the lack of any
systematic indexation of retirement income, such a policy measure would seriously set back the real living
standards of the elderly and most likely would not be politically viable.32 With system maturity, as more
individuals qualify for benefits, the payroll tax would have to be even higher -- as high as 34 percent in 2054 to
balance the current account. Such a payroll tax rate would be excessively high by international standards.
The generosity of CNSS' long-term pension system also undermines its financial viability. While the
average replacement rate in the base year was only 34 percent, the benefit formula is in fact very generous.
Low replacement rates primarily reflect an immature system where workers have not yet acquired their full
working rights. There are various ways in which the system appears overly generous:
*  The average pensioner can retire if he or she is 60 and has contributed for at least 3240 days -- i.e., on the
average of 20 working days per month for about 13 years. The accrual rate is 50 percent with a one percent
increment for every year in excess of 13. Such an accrual formula creates an incentive for individuals to
retire early since the bonus for working an additional year is only 1 percent while the payroll tax is about 7
percent. The highest ratio of benefits to contributions accrues to those who work for only 13 years, and
there is a transfer from those who work longer to those who retire soon after contributing for 13 years.
*  Disability pensions require only 6 years of contribution history and provide almost the same generous
benefit as old-age pensions, provided the individual is not eligible to receive old-age pensions. Such a
benefit formula creates incentives for individuals to claim disability if they are nearing the age of
retirement and have already fulfilled their old-age contributions.
*  The reference wage for pension calculations uses only the best of the last 3 or 5 years of wages whichever
is higher. This creates an incentive for individuals to manipulate wages, notably by misrepresenting their
wages towards the later years of their working careers. Most industrialized economies use lifetime wages
for pension calculations, with past salaries adjusted for inflation and wage growth.
As a result of all these factors, the net present value of the current account deficit is about DH78,478 million, or
about 28 percent of current year GDP, while the implicit pension debt is about 47 percent of base year GDP.
With increasing coverage, system maturity and possibly evasion, both these indicators could be appreciably
higher in later years.
32     In Gernany for instance, where the payroll tax is already at 20.3 percent, it has been proposed to gradually let
pension benefits erode from about 70 percent of a person's last net salary to about 64 percent by 2030.

C.    Conclusions
There has been worldwide interest in reforming defined benefits PAYG pension systems due to their
inherent weaknesses and declining rates of return. Problems include:
* they are fiscally not sustainable, and require rising payroll taxes;
* the lack of any interaction with the financial sector and failure to build financial savings;
* inequities stemming from ceiling on the contributions and benefit formula;
* widespread evasion -- resulting from the benefit formula as well as from the fragmentation of the domestic
economy;
* labor market distortions;
* too low coverage;
* weakness in administration and information systems.
The problems of the CNSS are not unique. Yet, in most countries, social benefits are often considered
to be rights of the citizens, and governments are skittish about paring them or introducing drastic reforms. As a
result, few people are even aware of the looming gap in pension funding. In the short run, the CNSS could
adjust in a number of ways some of the parameters of the existing pension system to improve its short-term
sustainability.
*  In order to balance the long-term pension fund, the affordable contribution rate would have to rise to over
16 percent of the nominal wage bill by the year 2050.
*  In order to balance the pension system fund, the 'affordable' average old-age replacement rate -- the ratio
of average old-age pensions to average reference salary -- will have to fall to almost 20 percent.
* An alternative way of raising effective contributions would be to reduce or eliminate the wage ceiling on
contributions since they account for a gap of about 25 percent between contributions calculated on the basis
of declared wages, and contributions calculated on the basis of wages subject to a ceiling.
*  Contributions could be extended by increasing coverage, which is very limited at present; and/or by
improving collection. Evasion caused a loss of 12 percent of CNSS revenue in 1995. Collection, however,
has significantly improved since the 1980s; evasion accounted for 25 percent of due contributions in 1988.
*  Raising the retirement age would increase the pool of contributors and initially improve the financial
picture of the pension fund. Delaying retirement,' hq(wever, may put upward pressure on pension
expenditures as individuals retire later with longer Wears of service and hence qualify for higher pensions.
It should be noted, however, that these measures will not prevent the pension system from going into
deficit. They will merely postpone bankruptcy by a few years. It is therefore quite urgent that the stage for
systemic pension reform be constructed in the immediate future. Given that the long-term pension system of
the CNSS is still young and future pension obligations are likely to be higher with population aging and system
maturity, it is best to start thinking of pension reform now. The overall objective of pension reform should be
to provide a basic social need by protecting the old and the unfortunate, as well as to promote economic growth
by eliminating perverse distortions and creating savings. International experience in pension reforn has yielded
a fairly diverse set of outcomes reflecting differences not only in cultural and economic factors, but also
political philosophies concerning the relative roles of the government, employers and individuals in providing
retirement income. Rather than rely solely on intergenerational redistribution schemes to provide old-age
income, countries are increasingly diversifying the provision of old age income support usually by providing
some public benefits but supplementing them with privately managed savings schemes.
