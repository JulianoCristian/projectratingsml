   will address two major weaknesses in development\n            administration in Zambia which include: (a) inadequate\n            capacity to carry out macroeconomic analysis; and (b) the\n            lack of timely and accurate financial information required\n            for analysis and the efficient management of the economy.\n            Related to these two main aid objectives, the project will\n            also strengthen the processes of budget preparation and\n            revenue estimation and improve coordination between planning\n            and budgeting. Specifically, the project would provide: (i)\n            macroeconomic analysis; (ii) a financial management system;\n            (iii) budget and revenue specialists; as well as (iv)\n            training; and (v) follow-up services to Technical Assistance I."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
