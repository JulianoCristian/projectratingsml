strengthen and coordinate the\n            activities of the urban sector's technical and\n            financial institutions; contribute to the elaboration of\n            urban and housing development planning and policies; and\n            introduce new schemes to mobilize private savings for the\n            financing of housing. It will consist of: (i) comprehensive\n            upgrading in four settlements; (ii) a sites and\n            services/housing credit scheme in three of these\n            settlements; (iii) a pilot program of upgrading and\n            reconstruction of the Hafsia neighborhood in the Medina of\n            Tunis; and (iv) technical assistance for project\n            implementation, institution building and pre-investment\n            studies. The Third Urban Development Project for Tunisia\n            will meet 21 percent of the urban poor new demand for\n            shelter in the project sites between 1983 and 1988. It will\n            build up a well coordinated technical, financial, and\n            institutional framework that will allow more effective\n            management and control of the urbanization process."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
