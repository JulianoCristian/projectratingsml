          will help re-establish internal, and external balances in\n            Cape Verde, and alleviate the impact of the oil shock, by\n            creating the conditions for sustained high GDP growth. The\n            project will therefore support the Government's\n            stabilization program, by implementing structural reforms in\n            the petroleum sector, supporting an accelerated\n            privatization program in the transport, and infrastructure\n            sector, and by creating an environment, conducive to private\n            sector development, thus enhancing revenue mobilization, in\n            addition to fiscal strengthening, and balance of payments\n            sustainability. While the main risk of the program is\n            related to policy reversal, it is moderated by the fact that\n            tax reform, and privatization are largely irreversible.\n            Furthermore, the country's track record during most of\n            the 1990s in terms of high growth, and poverty alleviation\n            is good. Nevertheless, there were two instances where\n            macroeconomic slippages occurred, leading to internal debt\n            problems, though the Government responded with effective\n            remedial measures. Hence, based on Government commitments,\n            it is expected that the project will help ease the causes of\n            overruns, such as petroleum subsidies, that the strong civil\n            society support in government stabilization actions, and,\n            the proposed reforms - which will enhance the business\n            environment - will outweigh potential risks."}, "docdt": "2001-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
