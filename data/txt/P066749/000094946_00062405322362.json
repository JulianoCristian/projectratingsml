The\n            project demonstrates the effectiveness of transparent,\n            merit-based allocation of procedures and investigator\n            autonomy in improving the quality and efficiency of\n            scientific research and training. The project has two\n            phases, the first being financed by a Learning and\n            Innovation Loan (LIL). The project has two components. The\n            first builds the capacity of the new Ministry of science and\n            Technology, with technical support to set up national\n            science and technology policies; establishes and operates\n            the Board of directors, Program Committee, and an\n            Implementation and Management Unit; develops a proposal to\n            scale-up and institutionalize the project; and supports\n            monitoring and evaluation studies. The second component sets\n            up a competitive fund for scientific excellence which\n            conducts scientific research, expands doctoral and\n            post-doctoral training programs; and supports networking and\n            outreach as well as special activities to promote scientific\n            excellence. Networking activities include research visits to\n            establish formal and informal connections to high level\n            institutions; coordinates appropriate Initiative-wide\n            activities; supports exchange programs for researchers and\n            students; and designs and delivers international, advanced courses."}, "docdt": "2000-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
