Several lessons were drawn from the\n            project's experience, which featured how to align\n            research with national priorities, and the needs of\n            indigenous people and the poor. Lessons however, highlight\n            that the initial proposal should have contained a plan for\n            the transition to regular activities, given that support for\n            Centers and Nuclei should only be provided based on a clear\n            strategy of how activities will be continued after the end\n            of the grant period. Expecting a follow-up on the project,\n            the Institute of Fluid Mechanics used grants to finance\n            recurrent expenditures on a non-declining basis. As a\n            consequence, the Center faces the challenge of sustaining\n            the investment in the training of highly-skilled\n            researchers. In addition, extra efforts are needed for human\n            resource formation in countries with no critical mass, but\n            faced with university graduates willing to undergo a career\n            in sciences, but where most researchers do not have adequate\n            qualifications. The project however showed that provision of\n            research staff can be attained through adequate training\n            programs. Nonetheless, further lessons outline that\n            investigator autonomy is key to research success, while\n            supporting network and dissemination activities should not\n            be underestimated."}, "docdt": "2005-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
