To that end, the program includes (1) measures to\n            strengthen macroeconomic management; (2) new orientations\n            for agriculture and transport sector policies; and (3)\n            measures to strengthen the incentive framework for the\n            private sector. The program also includes actions to further\n            enhance the trade and tax reforms and export promotion\n            measures taken under the IDA-assisted Industrial Sector\n            Adjustment Program.
