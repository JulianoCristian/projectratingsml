INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMODATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON PROPOSED
DEVELOPMENT AND AFRICAN FACILITY
CREDITS TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
FOR A STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit of SDR 42.2 million (US$55 million equivalent) and a
proposed African Facility Credit of SDR 7_.7. million (US$94.3 million
equivalent, all from IBRD Contribution) from the Special Facility for Sub-
Saharan Africa (the African Facllity), established by Resolution No. IDA-
85-1 of Nay 21, 1985, to the Republic of Zaire. The Credits would be on
standard IDA terms. In addition, I recommend that IDA would a4minister a
proposed Special Joint Financing non-reimbursable contribution of Yen 1.1
billion (US$7.85 million equivalent) from Japan. The proposed financing
aims at supporting the Government's Structural Adjustment Program, designed
to restore financial equilibrium and stimulate economic growth. A
companion Technical Assistance Project for Economic Management is being
submitted to you separately (see Memorandum of the President No. P-4542-ZR,
May 29, 1987).
2.        Part I of this report reviews the characteristics, performance
and constraints of the economy. Part II outlines the Government's
Structural Adjustment Program, while Part III describes in detail the
actions to be supported under the proposed credits. Parts IV and V assess
the expected effects of the Government's Structural Adjustment Program, and
describe IDA's role in the adjustment process, the proposed operation, and
other Bank Group operations in Zaire.
PART I - THE ECONOKfY
3.        An economic report entitled Zaire: Economic Change and External
Assistance was distributed to Executive Directors on March 29, 1985. Its
assessment of the country's economic prospects has been updated by a series
of recent Bank missions and is reflected in the following paragraphs.
Annex I provides basic country data.
A. Background
4.        Zaire is the third largest country in Africa in terms of its area
and the fifth largest in terms of its population, but its GNP per capita
(estimated at US$170 in 1985) ranks among the lowest in the continent.
With a population of about 30 million, Zaire has a low population density
estimated at 12 persons per square kilometer. About a third of the
population lives in urban areas. Although agriculture (commercialixed and
subsistence) accounts for only 30 percent of GDP, it provides employment
and income for more than three-quarters of the population. Mining and
mineral processing account for about one third of GDP, and two-thirds of
overall export earnings. Mining has traditionally been a major source of
public sector revenues.



5.        The years following independence (1960) were marked by violent
political strife and severe disruption of the economy. After the
restoration of political order in 1967, the country enjoyed a period of
relative stability and economic growth Which lasted until 1974. During
this period, GDP grew at a rate of about seven percent per year in real
terms. Between 1975 and 1983, however, the Zaizian economy was
characterized by a series of crises and short-lived recoveries, severe
underutilization and deterioration of productive capacity and
infrastructure, the emergence of significant economic and financial
imbalances, high inflation, and a decline In per capita income. A number
of factors contributed to these difficulties, lncluding: the
sairianization and nationalization measures of 1973-74 which, though
subsequently rescinded, destroyed the distribution network and left behind
a legacy of lack of confidence of the private sector; the heavy external
borrowing of the early 1970., much of it at unfavorable terms and for
projects of low or even negative returns; continuing deteriorations in the
tenms of trade; and deficiencies in economic management. By 1979, GDP had
contracted by about 10 percent from the pre-crisis (1972-74) level, while
inlation soared to more than 100 percent, with chronic shortages of
essential consumer goods, fuel and Intermediate goods.
B.  Past Trends and Recent Economic Develomments
6.        Following a brief period of economic recovery In 1980-81, CDP
again contracted in 1982, largely due to the decline in world copper
prices. The overall balance of payments deficit reached a record high (12
percent of GOP), leading to accumulation of external payments arrears
totalling US$940 million. On tho domestic front, the budget deficit
continra-d to increase, reaching 11 percent of GDP. Both external and
domestic cenfldence were at a low ebbs  a grossly overvalued exchange rate,
pervasivo price controls, and high inflation were the manifestations of
widespread distortions In the economy.
7.        A major turning point for the Zairian economy came in 1983 when
the Government began introducing, within the context of an IMF stand-by
program, a series of far-reaching stabilization and reform measures. These
included: (i) an immediate devaluation of the saire by 78 percent in terms
of the SDR; (ii) the introduction of a transitional dual exchange rate
regime, leading to a unification of the two rates in February 1984 and the
subsequent maintenance of a market-determined exchange rate; (iII) a
substantial liberalization and simplification of the exchange and trade
system, including a revision of tariffs; (iv) the decontrol of most prices,
Including agricultural producer prices and interest rates; (v) tight
expenditure controls, Including limitations on wage increases and
reductions in public sector employment; (vi) a series of actions to reduce
the burden of parastatals on the budget, including the sale of some assets;
and (vii) major increases in the price of petroleum products to make them
mor6 accurately reflect world market prices.
8.        In September 1984, the Government requested the Bank Group to
provide fast-disbursing resources to assist its program of policy reform.
A dialogue was initiated for the preparation of IDA and AP credits in
support of the Government's Industrial Sector Adjustment Program.
Agreement was reached in May 1986, and following a series of discussions



- 3 -
with the Bank and Fund in December 1986 and January 1987 (see para. 22) the
credits became effectiv, on January 12, 1987. Under this program, the
Government has begun to take measures to eliminate long-standing
distortions in the trade regime, with a view to creating a more
competitive, export-oriented manufacturing sector. Specific policy
measures being Implemented include a comprehensive tariff reform, the
adoption of measures to stimulate exports (including the abolition of
export levies on all manufacturing exports), complete liberalization of
industrial goods prices, and revenue-enhancing changes in the tax regime
for industrial enterprises. The second tranche of the credit was released
In April 1987.
9.        The reform and stabilization measures undertaken by the
Government since 1983 have improved considerably the overall incentive
framework, by reorienting the economy towards more efficient productive
activities. In addition to the price liberalization and tariff reform
measures, foremost among these improvements has been the progress in
liberalizing the trade and foreign exchange regimest the introduction of a
floating exchange rate system, along with the liberalization of imports,
has led to a significant decline in both the volume of transactions and the
premium on the parallel foreign exchange market. With the exception of the
difficulties which emerged in late 1986 (see para. 18), the market
determination of the exchange rate has been maintained without interruption
since 1984. Following the 60 percent real depreciation of the saire in
late 1983, the real exchange rate fell a further 20 percent over the
following three years, providing a considerable boost to export-oriented
activities.
10.       Ovorall, financial adjustment and liberalization measures
implemented since, late 1983 have been successful. The maintenance of a
competitive exchange rate helped induce adjustment on the supply side, and
expenditure-switching on the demand side. In the non-copper export sector,
significant export volumes were restored to official channels. Merchandise
exports expanded at annual rate of more than 8 percent, while import
volumes were compressed (declining on average by nearly 2 ptrcent per
year). As a re.ult, the current account deficit in the bala- e of payments
(after rescheduling) declined from 13.8 percent of GDP in 1982 to 4.1
percent in 1985. Substantial progress was also achieved in reducing fiscal
imbalances and inflationary pressurest net financing of the Government
from the domestic banking system decreased from 6.3 percent of GDP in 1982
to 0.6 percent in 1985, while inflation--which as of end-1983 was more than
100 percent--declined to 24 percent in 1985 (Annex I).
11.       These positive signs, however, were not accompanied by similar
progress in a number of key areas. Moreover, the Zairian economy showed
clear signs of the persisting weaknesses in the face of a rapidly
deteriorating international environment. Overall economic growth remained
weak, as real GDP growth in each of the years 1983-86 remained below the
population growth rate, estimated at about 3 percent.
12.       Despite the continuing decline of export prices for Zaire's major
mineral exports--which accounted for most of the nearly one third of the
deterioration in Zairets external terms of trade between 1984 and 1986--the
mining sector remained the main source of growth, followed by agriculture



- 4 -
and services. While there appears to have been a significant supply
response in the agricultural sector to the liberalization measures, oitput
continues to be adversely affected by persisting shortages of necessary
Inputs and spare parts, as well as by transportation bottlenecks and
insufficient availability of crop credit. Continued stabilization of
Internal demand, along with the obsolescence of installed equipment,
limited the contribution to growth of local manufacturing industry, which
continues to be characterized by pi-bstantlal excess capacity In most of its
sectors.
13.       In terms of savings and investment, the results since 1983 have
also been rather mixed. The first complete year of major policy reforms,
1984, was marked by a large increase in total investment -- rising from 11
percent of GDP in 1983 to 14 percent in 1984-- and by a doubling of
domestic savings (to nearly 17 percent of GDP). This, however, could not
continue in the following years as private investment slowed down because
of the tight credit policies and persistent lack of Investors' confidence.
14.       The difficlities of the Zairian economy were exacerbated in 1986
by the continuing deterioration in the international onvironment. The
major factor responsible for the worsening of the economic and financial
situation in 1986 was the sharp decline in export prices. For the year as
a whole, export prices declined by 14.4 percent in dollar terms. Despite
an increase of 19 percent in volume, export earnings reached only US$1,846
million, about the same level as in 1985. The volume increase in exports
was due to a major effort made to reduce the transit time for copper and
cobalt exports on the Voie National, destocking of copper and cobalt and to
the suspension of quotas under the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) for
1986. Earnings from coffee exports increased by 185 percent owing to
higher world prices and to the significant volume which reached an all-time
high of 146,000 tons. Cobalt prices experienced the sharpest drop,
declining by about 59 percent in 1986.
15.       There was a significant change in the composition of capital
flows in 1986. All of the increase ws due to disbursements on medium- and
long-term loans which increased tfom US$157 million in 1985 to US$283
million in 1986. About two thirds of this Increase came from multilateral
sources. Although grant disbursements remained unchanged in nominal terms,
they declined in real terms. Overall net transfers, were positive (US$54
million) in 1986 for the first time since 1983.
16.       The increase in net tranfers was, however, not sufficient to
offset the decline in export earnings. Foreign exchange reserves were
practical'y depleted to finance the balance of payments. While imports of
goods and non-factor services increased by about 10 percent in nominal
terms in 1986, this corresponded to a volume decline of about two percent.
Imports of intermediate goods and spare parts in particular suffered from
Import compression, as many industrial firms had difficulties in obtaining
bank credit to finance imports. Overalls the current account deficit
widened from US$279 million in 1985 to US$470 million in 1986.
17.       In May 1986, Zaire obtained debt reschedulings totalling US$542
million including those from the London and Kinshasa Clubs. Zaire
continued to meet its debt service obligations under these agreements



through November 1986. In December 1986, Zaire suspended monthly payments
to its bilateral creditors. For the year as whole, actual debt service
payments (including the IMF) amounted to US$505 million corresponding to
about 25 percent of exports of goods and services. In April 1987, Zaire
submitted a request for rescheduling to the Paris Club, and a meeting of
the Paris Club was held on Nay 18, 1987. The Government is undertaking
negotiat±ons with the London and Kinshasa Clubs.
18.       Until October 1986, the rate of the zaire via-a-vis the U.S.
dollar was maintained as a result of the Bank of Zaire's large intervention
sales in the interbank market. Although the real effective exchange rate
appreciated, the margin between the official and the parallel rate was kept
within ten percent. The shortage of foreign exchange, and the attempt of
the Bank of Zaire to slow down the rate of depreciution, however, brought
sales on the inter-bank market in the latter part of 1986 to a minimum,
leading to an increacing divergence between the official exchange rate and
the rate negotiated by commercial banks with their customers. In October,
the official rate began to diverge significantly from the parallel rate,
which was about 20 percent above the official rate by the end of the year.
On January 9, 1987, the official rate was adjusted to Z 82 per U.S. dollar.
This was followed by regular weekly depreciations. On May 29, 1987, the
official rate of the zaire, at 116.5 per U.S. dollar, was very close to the
interbank rate.
19.       The balance of payments developments discussed in the foregoing
paragraphs had a significant impact on budgetary developments. Budgetary
revenues as a percent of GDP declined to 13.6 percent from the high level
of 18.6 percent in 1985. This rapid deterioration was due to weak increase
in export taxes and a nominal decline in taxes on goods and services
stemming from the delays in adjusting pump prices of petroleum products,
and to difficulties in implementing new rates of the domestic turnover tax.
The poorer revenue performance was also in part due to absence of
exceptional revenue measures such as the sale of assets that were made in
1985.
20.       The strain on the budget was compounded by the delays in taking
corrective measures and difficulties in maintaining fiscal discipline,
particularly in the second half of the year. The wage bill, which
reflected the salary increases for civil servants in June 1986, was
contained to 23 percent of total expenditures. Interest payments on
domestic and external debt accounted for about 39 percent of expenditures.
Total debt service payments including amortization and arrears repayments
accounted for two-thirds of budgetary revenues in 1986. Since there were
significant overruns in expenditures on goods and services, investment
expenditures from the budget were sharply compressed once again. Compared
with the budgetary allocation of Z 3.2 billion, the actual level of
investment expenditure was only Z 1 billion, representing a significant
reduction (about one third) in real terms compared with 1985.
21.       The resulting 1986 budget deficit was about Z 5.5 billion,
corresponding to 1.7 percent of GDP (compared with a surplus of 1.1 percent
of GDP in 1985). Domestic bank financing reached Z 10.1 billion, after
taking into account the amortization payments on external debt. To
accommodate the rapid expansion in government spending, net domestic assets



Increased by about 60 percent during the year. Credit to the private
sector, which Increased by about a third during the first half of the year,
was crowded out by the massive public sector borrowing in the second half
of the year. Broad money growth accelerated to an annual rate exceeding
100 percent In the last quarter of the year and began to put pressures on
prices in early 1987. Compared with an annual inflation rate of 46 percent
in 1986, consumer prices rose by 19 percent during the first two months of
1987.  Interest rates, determined by the banks, remained high during the
year reflecting the rate of inflation and the shortage of credit to the
private sector. As a result, Zaire was unable to meet the IMF performance
criteria on Government borrowing from the domestic banking system and to
make its scheduled third and fourth purchases under the previous stand-by
arrangement with the IMF.
22.       Growing public dissatisfaetion with the continued slow pace of
economic growth, and the perceived reluctance of external donors to support
more actively the reform process, have created strong political pressures
to reverse the trend towards greater economic liberalisation. At a Central
Coummittee meeting held in October 1986, decisions were announced which
appeared to indicate a reversal of some of the Government's major reform
measures, including its commitment to a market-determined exchange rate,
and to price and interest rate liberalisation. Following lengthy
discussions with the Bank and Fund in December 1986 and January 1987, the
Government reaffirmed its commitment to the process of structural
adjustment and reform which it has been implementing since 1983. This was
subsequently confirmed both in President Mobutu's letter to the Bank of
January 9, 1987 and by the Central Committee following its meeting of
February 7-9, 1987.
C. Development Constraints
23.       Economic development in Zaire has been, and continues to be,
severely constrained by a system, evolved over the years, Witch has
fostered rent-seeking rather than productive activities. This is
compounded by the continuing lack of investor confidence (both domestic and
foreign), and by the tendency of some Zairians to accumulete holdings of
foreign exchange outside Zaire. The Government's commatment to a
comprehensive structural adjustment program will, however, contribute to
transforming Zaire's unfavorable image.
24.       Human resource constraints are also particularly severe, as
general and technical education at all levels fails to provide the quality
of skills required by both enterprises and the public sector. The
situation has been exacerbated by the continuing decline in the real wages
for public sector employees which as of 1986 were only 20 percent of their
level the level of 1975. This has contributed to frequent absenteeism,
steady deterioration in the provision of public services and the inevitable
growth of an underground economy and corruption.
25.       In the agricultural sector, production growth remains slow--
despite the liberalization and privatization measures adopted since 1983--
largely due to persistent infrastructural and institutional constraints,
including inadequate credit and lack of foreign exchange. Lack of



-7-
maintenance of the transportation network have kept transportation costs
high, limiting both the inflow of inputs and the omtflow of products. A
further constraint has been the decline in the qv.ality of the agricultural
research and extension systems, the former at on6 time having been among
the most highly regarded in African countries. Competition from subsidized
and clandestine Imports of agricultural commodities (sugar, meat, maize)
has also been a contributing factor. In the manufacturing sector, capacity
utilization remains low, partly due to the shortage of foreign exchange and
domestic credit, but also to weak domestic demand and lack of
competitiveness of some plants. A further important constraint Is a
financial system which remains overly oriented towards commercial lending
and virtually Ignores the financing needs of medium- and small-scale
enterprises.
26.       Over the medium-term, a major constraint to growth in Zaire will
be the growing burden of external debt, which (excluding lMa) stood at
US$5.6 billion, or about 110 percent of GD?, at the end of 1986. The
average interest rate on the debt has increased significantly in recent
years as a result of a series of reschedulings.1   The economy Is thus
required to service a large external debt without having the productive
capacity which could generate sufficient resources for this purpose. This
situation has been compounded by the deterioration in Zaire's terms of
trade, reflecting the continued slow growth of world demand for Zaire's
primary exports (chiefly copper and cobalt).
27.       The continuing crisis in the external sector also poses major
financial problems fox the domestic economy, in particular the Government's
budget. This has contributed to the continuing decline in the country's
physical infrastructure (particularly in the transport sector) and
productive base. On the revenue side, several factors, In addition to the
contraction of economic activity, limit domestic resource mobilizations
revenues remain heavily dependent (more than 40 percent) on taxes on
minerals and petroleum; the tax base is narrow and covers almost
exclusively (and hence penalizes) enterprises in the modern sector; tax
administration remains weak in the face of widespread tax evasion and
fraud; and taxes and fees collected by parafiscal agencies remain outside
of the budgetary process of the Central Government and are often
uncoordinated or ill-conceived.
D. Nature of the Adiustment Problem
28.       The Zairian economy Is now facing two critical issues: first, to
combine the continued stabilization of the economy with the prompt
resumption of growth necessary to redress the erosion In the living
standards of the population during the last decade; and second, to bring
about a longer-torm structural adjustment of the economy which will be
required to diversify and develop (and In some cases restore) a wider
resource base. Zaire's long-term prospects are favorable, provided that
1/ The average interest rate on previous Paris club reschedulings has been
9.2 percent, raising the overall average interest rate to 7.1 porcent;
this compares with an average Interest rate of 4.6 percent for bilateral
debt not yet rescheduled.



- 8 -
its vast and diverse resources can be utilized efficiently. The major
adjustment policy issues facing Zaire, beyond short-term stabilization, are
to: (i) restore private sector confidencel ({i) create an incentive system
to stimulate exports and efficient-import substitution industries; (iii)
enable agricultural production to respond to liberalization policies; (iv)
restructure public expenditures to rehabilitate the country's
infrastructure and better provide basic public services; and (v) reform and
rationalize public enterprises. These constitute the broad objectives of
the Government's Structural Adjustment Program.
29.       The continued application of the stabilization-cum-liberalization
program carried out since 1983 has been threatened by the inauequate
availability of external resources. About half ok the outstanding external
debt is scheduled to be amortized over the next five years; total scheduled
debt service payments will amount to nearly US$1 billion annually. While
over the preceding decade the Zairian economy has adjusted to a situation
of high debt service payments, and unfavorable commodity prices, primarily
through compressing imports and cutting investment, this has been at the
expense of a decline in per capita real GDP as well as in the country's
productive base. Restoration of satisfactory growth levels in Zaire will
depend both on the Government's ability to implement the Structural
Adjustment Program and on the country's ability to finance the level of
imports which are required to sustain its target for real GDP growth of a
minimum of 3.5 percent per year. This latter element will depend, both on
diversifying exports over the medium-term and, more immediately, on
substantially larger inflows of concessional resources (including debt
reschedulings on liberal terms).
30.       Export diversification is crucial, since prospects for increasing
traditional export revenues (from copper, cobalt, coffee and oil) are not
encouraging. The world copper market, which over the past decade has
experienced slow growth and low prices, is expected to remain depressed in
the next decade, while copper production is expected to continue at its
current level of 470,000 tons. For cobalt, Zaire's second leading export,
world market prospects also remain weak. Even if earnings from non-
traditional exports (diamonds, gold, crude oil and manufactures) increase
more rapidly, their impact on the balance of payments will remain modest in
the short-term. Zaire's terms of trade are not expected to recover to
their 1985 level before the mid-1990s. For all of these reasons, increased
flows of external resources will be critical for the success of Zaire's
Structural Adjustment Program.
31,       Consistency and credibility of Government policies will also be
vital for the success of tLX Structural Adjustment Program. This is
particularly necessary in the case of Zaire, in view of the deep-seated
skepticism--both within Zaire and abroad--about the Government's commitment
to structural change, which has resulted both from the overall poor level
of economic management over the past twenty years and from specific events,
notably the zairianization/nationalization measures of the mid-1970s.
Zaire's persistence in carrying out its program of liberalization since
1983, despite the continued difficult external financial situation, has
begun the process of restoring investor confidence.



-9-
32.        The Government has demonstrated its commitment to the adjustment
process, particularly by resisting strong pressures in late 1986 to
introduce quantitative restrictions and to reverse market-oriented economic
policies in the face a severe foreign exchange crisis.   The full
restoration of investor confidence, and along with it the necessary inflow
of resources to Zaire to allow it to achieve its full economic potential,
is a longer-term process, however--and one whose realization depends on the
Government continuing to send clear signals concerning its commitment to
promote an environment in which the private sector can flourish.
PART II - THE GOVERNMENT'S STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
A. The Adiustment Strate2y
33.       The process of restructuring the economy, and reorienting society
at large, from predominantly rent-seeking to more productive activities has
only just begun to make significant progress. Overcoming the numerous, and
interrelated, constraints facing Zaire's development will be a long-term
process requiring action on a number of different fronts. In order to
achieve the dual objectives of stabilization and structural adjustment, the
Government has drawn up a medium-term Structural Adjustment Program (SAP)
containing a consistent set of policies and targets through 1989.
34.       The first phase of the Structural Adjustment Program focusses on
imediate steps to generate short-term response, in order to strengthen
support for the Program, as well as to establish a strategic framework for
longer-term adjustment. In particular, the initial focus of the SAP is be
on:
(i)    maintaining the key orientations of macro-economic
management (exchange rate, interest rates, price
liberalization, and trade regime);
(ii)   improving the efficiency of credit markets and
strengthening the supervision function of the Central
Bank;
(iii)  improving the performance of key sectors and strengthening
control of public expenditures, as well as changing their
composition in favor of high priority capital
expenditures.
35.       The thrust of Zaire's structural adjustment policy is the
promotion of private sector activities, and the authorities are committed
to pursuing policies to further improve the environment in which private
enterprises operate. This includes revising the investment code, providing
an increasing share of domestic credit to the private sector, and
facilitating private capital inflows through the provision of adequate
guarantees and through the establishment of a debtlequity swap mechanism.
Vigorous pursuit of these measures will also contribute substantially to
redressing the pervasive problem of lack of confidence, both domestic and
external, in the Zairian economy.
36.       The tariff reform being implemented as part of the industrial
sector adjustment program has already begun to eliminate the major



- 10 -
disparities still existing in rates of effective protection, particularly
in low domestic value added industries. By 1990, a more uniform tariff
structure will be in place, with average nominal rates in the rango of 20-
40 percent. Agricultural products will also be protected within the
overall tariff structure. In addition, a corrective mechanism will be
designed for products such as meat and sugar, imports of which are
subsidized by exporting countries, on the basis of the results of an
ongoing study to avoid damage to domestic production. Quantitative
restrictions which were recently imposed on textile and meat Imports will
be ellminated. The series of e"ort promotion measures initiated under the
Industrial Sector Adjustment Program--including measures to simplify export
procedures, abolish export taxes and reduce bureaucratic constraints--vill
also be extended to agricultural exports.
37.       The Government will continue its policy of price and interest
rate liberalization and will seek to ensure full implementation of
liberalization in different parts of the country, especially for
agricultural products. In order to ensure efficient allocation of foreign
exchange, and to promote the development of nontraditional exports and
efficient lmport substitution, the Government will continue to maintain a
free exchange rate system with a market-determined exchange rate. The
Government will also improve the functioning of the interbank market and
seek transparency in the rates offered to customers.
38.       With regard to the public sector, the Government's strategy Is to
rehabilitate the country's basic infrastructure, improve public sector
management, promote decentralization, and lmprove social services whilo
promoting the development of human resources. The Government's adjustment
program includes a major reform of the public enterprise sector (paras. 48-
65). The Government will seek to increase domestic resource mobilization
in both the public and private sectors, the latter to be accomplished
primarily through maintaining a stable economic eavironment.
39.       On the assumption that an adequate level of external financing is
made available to support its program, the macroeconomic framework for the
period 1987-91 is consistent with a gradual aeceleration in the growth of
output.2 Key macroeconomic indicators are shown In Table 1. Real GDP is
projected to increase by 3.0 percent in 1987 (compared to 2.4 percent In
1986), 3.5 percent in 1988-89 and 4.0 percent in 1990-91. In the
agricultural sector, output growth (projected at 3.5 percent) is expected
to come from import substitution in edible oils, meat, cotton, and grains,
and from export crops such as coffee and rubber, reflecting continued
application of price liberalization as well as alleviating distribution
(and supply) bottlenecks through the implementation of the emergency action
program for rehabilitation of rural roads. In the Industrial sector,
resumption of growth will be facilitated by the restructuring of the
incentive structure undertaken under the Industrial Sector Adjustment
Program, as well as through the Increased availability of foreign exchange
to finance inputs of spare parts and raw materials.

Program, see the discussion on effects of the adjustment program, Part

40.      A key element in the Structural Adjustment Program will be a
reversal in the decline in the country's productive base, reflecting both
full  Implementation of the core public investment program and Increased
private investment; the overall investment ratio is forecast to rise from
about 12 percent in 1986 to 18.9 percent in 1990. Domestic savings is
forecast to increase from 12.6 percent in 1986 to 15.2 percent in 1990, due
primarily to Increased savings of the public sector. This in turn will
reflect more effective resource mobilisation resulting from the fiscal
reform measures being Implemented under the SAP,, ncreased efficiency of
the public enterprises, and continued prudent expenditure policies. In
tbhs connection the Goverrment has agreed to a set of budgetary targets
within the framework of the new stand-by arrangement with the IMF, approved
by the Fund's Executive Board on Nay 15, 1987.
41.       Even with the relatively modest targets for output growth, the
external current account deficit (excluding official trAnsfers) Is
projected to increase from US$470 million in 1986 to US$763 million in
1987, and remain at about this level through 1990 on account of the
expected shortfall in export earnings and scheduled Interest payments on
external debt (Table 2). Taking into account scheduled amortisation
payments, and allowing for a minimal build-up In International reserves,
the average annual external financing requirement over this period would be
approximately US$1.8 billiozk. Approximately half of this requirement would
be met by grants and loans already comitted, on the ba"ais of projected
disbursements pipelines of bilateral and multilateral agencies. Other
sources of financing would be the DnF's Structural Adjustment Facility and
scheduled purchases undor the stand-by arrangement from the IN?. The
remaining finacing gap would avorage about US$850 million per year over
the period 1987-90. Ne comitments of extornal resources will thus be
essential to allow Zaire to impleument Its pubUc Investment program and to
allow the private sector to fulfill its Intended rolo as the principal
source of future economic growth. At the meeting of Paris Club hold on May
18, 1987, Zaire obtained rescheduling of it. official debt totalling US$885
million, covering May 1987-April 1988 period. Extensive debt reachedulings
on exceptional terms will continue to be required to alleviate the burden
on both the balance of payments and govornment budget.
42.        The pace at which Zaire would reach 'the light at the end of the
tunnel will, however, depend on the terms and conditions of financing its
external financing gaps in the years to come. Soesitivity analyses
Indicate that if the financing gaps were to bo filled on concessional
terms,3 cumulative financing gap through 1992 would be about US$500
million lower than currently projected. Further sensitivity anlysis shows
that renegotlation of all previously scheduled debt at extended terms and
concessional interest rates would make the financing gap disappear by the
early 1990..
31 With extended maturities and concessional interest rates. Longer grace
periods and maturities would help avoid ballooning of principal payments
In the mid-1990s and maintain the actual debt service ratio within
manageable limits.

B.  The Covernment's Short-Term Financial Program
43.       The Government's short-term financial program under the stand-by
arrangement concluded with the IMF aim at reestablishing domestic and
external equilibria. Monetary and credit policies in 1987 will aim at
reducing inflation which would also stabilise the rapid depreciation of the
currency, while stimulating economic activity by providing the private
sector with a significantly larger share of credit. While the overall
Government budget deficit (after rescheduling) is forecast to Increase
slightly in 1987, budgetary financing through the domestic banking system
will be reduced by half. Consistent with the target for an Increased level
of international reserves (see below), broad money growth is projected to
be held to 35 percent, significantly below the projected increase in
nominal GDP. One of the critical elements of macroeconomic management in
1987 will be reducing the very high level of Inflation observed in the
first quarter of the year. While the average inflation rate for 1987 is
expected to be 44 percent, inflation Is expocted to decelerate
substantially In tho second half of the year--to an annual rate of less
than 25 percent-- with fiscal and monetary restraint during the remainder
of the year.
44.       The implementation of the structural adjustment policies foreseen
under the proposed SAL will be critically affected by the tight external
financial constraint mposed by the projected drop in export revenues and
by the heavy schedule of external debt payments in 1987-88. The end of the
large destocking process -- particularly in coffee and cobalt -- which
accounted for a large part of the 19 percent export volume growth In 1986
is likely to be accompanied by a further decline in the terms of trade,
leading to a further reduction in export revenues in 1987 of about US$130
million compared to 1986.
45.       In 1987, the balance of payments Is expected to show a
significant deterioration, and little improvment is expected In 1988
because of continuing weak export price prospects. The projected current
account deficit of US$961 million (excluding official transfers) accounts
for about half of Zaire's external financing requirements in 1987. The
remaining part of the external, financing requirement comes from repurchases
from the IMF and scheduled amortization payments on external debt. Of the
about US$1.7 billion total financing requiremnt in 1987, US$967 million is
expected to come from grants, MELT loans and the IMF. The disbursement
levels of MELT loans for 1987 and 1988 are based on disbursements on
already coumitted loans (US$431 million and US$281 million) and
disbursements from expected new commitments (US$131 million and US$262
million, respectively)s

46.       For the next two to three years, a la.ger share of new
commitments will have to be in the form of quick-disbursaing balance of
paymeats assistance to finance private sector requirements for capital and
intermediate goods import.. This is In line with Zaire's development
strategy In which the private sector is expected to be the principal engine
of growth. In 1987, disbursements on IDAIAF industrial sector credits and
on the proposed SAL are estimated to be US$135 million. If disbursements
from known commitments of parallel financing from bilateral sources are
added, known quick-disbursing import financing flows would be around US$150
million. For 1988, the need for quick-disbursing flows will be even
greater. To the extent that the remaining financing gap is not covered by
debt reschedulings, the difference will have to come in the form of quick-
disbursing aid both for 1987 and 1988. For this reason, active donor
support of the Government's Structural Adjustment Program will be of
paramount importance in assuring its successful implementation. In this
connection, a meeting of the Consultative Group for Zaire wa held in Paris
on May 21-22, 1987 and favorably reviewed the structural adjustment and the
public investment programs. At the Consultative Group, aid indications
from Zaire's principal donors showed that Zaire would be able to mobilize
most of the external resources to finance its program in 1987 and 1988.
PART III - THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM 1987-88
47.       The Structural Adjustment Program, which the proposed SAL would
support, covers the period mid-1987 to end-1988. The program Is outlined
in the Government's Letter of Development Policy and attached sectoral
policy statements (Annex III) and covers seven main areas: (i) public
enterprise reform; (ii) public expenditure programming and policies; (iII)
fiscal reform; (iv) financial sector policies; (v) agriculture sector
policies; (vi) transport sector policies; and (vis) civil service reform.
In addition, an important element in the successful implementation of the
Structural Adjustment Program is the continued reform of trade and
industrial policies being carried out as part of the Industrial Sector



- 16 -
Adjustment Program. The Structural Adjustment Program will be Implemerted
by the various governmont departments and agencies tivolved In the reform
process, under the coordination of the Minsdtry of Planning. A proposed
Technical Assistance Project, being submltted separately to the Executive
Directors, Is designed speciflcally to assist In the Implementation of
programs initiated under the SAL. Support necessary before the
effectiveness of the Technical Assistance Credit is being finwaced under a
Project Preparation Facility advance for this Credit.
A. Public Enterprise Reform
48.       The parastatal sector In Zaire comprises 53 wholly-owned public
enterprises, of which 30 are engaged In commercial or productive
activities. In addition, there are about 80 mixed oeterpvises with a state
participation varying from less than 10 to over 90 percent of the nominal
capital. The wholly-owned public enterprises domiate key economlc sectors
Including mdning, energy and transport, as well as traditional areas such
as public utilities and communications. Thoy account for nearly 40 percent
of GDP, more than 80 percent of export revenues, and 85 percent of total
public investment. For the mixed enterprises, the State is usually a
passive partner, entrusting management to the private shareholder. The
difficulties of mixed enterprises do not, therefore, stem from state
participation ger le, except for the fact that some are undercapitalised
due to the Government's inability to contribute Its full financial share.
49.       Despite the grest economic Importance of the parsstatal sector,
wholly-owned public enterprises have for a considerable time performed
poorly, both in terms of their financial contribution to the State and as
agents for promoting growth and development. Indeed, heavy losses,
stemming from the misallocation and mism eent of resources by public
enterprises were major factors leading to the severe economic and financial
crisis of the early 1980s from which the country Is still struggling to
recover. While there has been some improvement In recent years, public
enterprises continue to represent a significant not drait on government
resources. With the exception of Gecamlnes, public enterprises pay
virtually no tax and make only a small contribution to the Treasury In the
form of dividendss the StAte received, on average, a return of 0.9 percent
on its registered equity capital In wholly-owd eantrprises between 1983
and 1985. A number of enterprises have failed to cover even their
operating expenses for some years, and their payrolls have been met by
fiscal transfers. These transfors, however, have been insignificant within
the Government's budget. Some of these enterprises are virtually moribund.
Moat of those that do operate are in need of varying degrees of financial,
managerial and structural rohabilitation. Moreover, the sector receives
implicit subsidies from the State through the assumption by the Central
Goverament of a high proportion of public enterprise debt service payments.
In recent years, this has amounted to about 3 percent of GDP and 15 percent
of government revenues.
50.       While the poor performance of public enterprises has been
influenced by the general economic environment, including falling
International prices for key export products, it stem ma=nly from the
veaknesses of the overall policy fromework governing the parastatal sector
and the consequent poor quality of enterprise msnagement. Responsibility



- 17 -
for enterprise supervision Is divided between two and sometimes three
ministries; this makes it difficult to establish and monitor a coherent set
of performance evaluation criteria. The leal definition of wholly-owned
public enterprises, which embraces a wide variety of entities, both
reinforces this difficulty and also reflects the lack of a clear policy
concerning the delineation of those activities in which th. State should be
directly involved. There is no effectively functioning division of
responsibilities between the enterprises, the tectoral ministries and the
core ministries concerning sectoral strategies and objectives.
Consequently, the planning and coordination of enterprise investment is
weak, sometimes leading to the construction and operation of projects which
are financially and/or economically nonviable. The procedures and
principles for the recruitment, remuneration and dismissal of senior
enterprise management provide little, If any, Incentive to Increase
efficiency. Financial and managerial information, both within the
enterprises and flowing between the enterprises and the Government is
inadequate and outdated. Few enterprises have satisfactory internal
accounting procedures or budgeting systems, while corporate planning is in
its Infancy even in the major enterprises.
Reform Measures Taken to Date
51.       The Government has, since the maid-1970's, undertaken a number of
partial initiatives aimed at Improving parastatal sector performance.
These have included the restructuring of the Gecamine group; emoval of
Petrosaire's import monopoly for petroleum products; the privatization of
about 30 state farms and a publicly-owned retail chain; the execution of
management contracts between some public enterprises and private companies
under which tho latter assume full management responsibilities; the
introduction of an automatic rate adjustment mecbantam and regionally-
differentiated tariffs for the power sector; the liquidation of 17 loss-
making enterprises Including agricultural marketing boards, transport
cowpanies, and some commercial and servic, agencies; mportant revisions to
the tariffs of public utilities and some transport enterprises; and the
establishment of planning units in some enterprises and sector agencles.
The limited Impact, thus far, of most of these measures reflects the
continued inadequacy of the overall policy framework and the noed to carry
the process of privatization and liquidation considerably further.
The Government's Reform Program
52.       Given the economic Importance of the parastatal sector and the
magnitude of its problems, parastatal reform is clearly a key element In
tho Government's overall structural adjustment program. The fundamental
objective of the reform effort is to improve the allocation of resources by
placing greater emphasis on private initiative as the driving force of
economic growth, and by creating a framework which encourages greater
efficiency and profitability for those activities which remain in the
State's domain. The strategy for the achievement of this broad objective
has three basic elements. First, the Government intends to privatize,
wholly or partially, a substantial proportion of activities currently
carried out by wholly-owned public enterprises. In addition, the
Government will progressively diminish its share in those mixed enterprises
which it does not consider strategically vital to its interests by



- 18 -
permitting the private partner to increase Its proportion of ownership
through new capital contributions. Second, the Government intends to
rapidly liquidate those enterprises which are unlfkely to ever become
economically or financially viable. Third, for those enterprises remaining
wholly in the public sector, the Government will take a series of measures
to increase their efficiency, including the establishment of a
substantially modified institutional and legal framework for the
supervision of enterprises and the evaluation of their performance.
53.       One of the principal requirements for the success of the reform
effort will be the establishment of an adequate flow of manasLerial and
financial information to enable the Governmont to assess more accurately
the economic Impact of enterprise activities and of alternative courses of
action. UNDP-financed, Bank-executed studies to systematically address the
question of public enterprise finances, including the Identification of all
resource flows and cross debts, as well as to recommend appropriate changes
to the overall public enterprise management environment are being prepared
by a group of consultants. These studies are expected to be completed by
October 1987. Although some policy actions have already been taken, and
others will precede the completion of the consultants' work, the studies
are expected to provide a further, detailed, classification of enterprises
to be either divested or closed down, and general recommendations
concerning the rehabilitation and restructuring of the remainder.
Following the conclusion of the studies, the Government will continue to
maintain and update the information systems put In place.
(i) The Privatization Process
54.       Regarding wholly-owned public enterprises, the Government has
affirmed in its Letter of Development Policy that it will initiate, before
February 1988, the process of privatising appropriately classified
enterprises or activities. The execution of the privatization policy will
be a lengthy process, as many enterprises likely to be privatized may
require some financial -nd managerial restructuring before their assets can
be sold. Moreover, the Government recognizes the importance of preceding
privatization with appropriate modifications to the markets in which public
enterprises operate. All special privileges which these enterprises
currently enjoy, including tax exemptions, legal monopolies and special
tariff protection, will be removed. The enterprises will thus be subject
only to the Investment Code and other liberalized market regulations which
govern the activities of mixed and private companies. By the same token,
these enterprises will no longer be subject to any special obligations
concerning matters such as pricing or employment policy or the construction
and operation of financially nonviable projects.
55.       By September 1987, the Government will prepare a list of those
mixed enterprises in which it wishes, for strategic reasons, to retain its
current proportional shareholding. For the remaining mixed enterprises,
the private partner will be at liberty to progressively Increase to 100
percent the proportion of its ownership through new capital injections.
These measures will not only be beneficial for the individual companies
concerned, many of which are suffering from serious undercapitalization,
but will provide an important boost for private investor confidence
generally. At the same time, the Government will rationalize the situation



- 19 -
of a number of nominally private but de facto public enterprlses,
especially commercial farms, which are still suffering the consequences of
the nationalixationlzairianisation program of the early 1970's. These
entities, or their assets will now be rapidly sold to the private sectorl
the process is expected to be well underway by the end of 1987 and
completed by mid-1988.
56.       To facilitate the privatisation process of both wholly-owned and
mixed enterprises, while at the same time easang the external debt burden,
the Government will, by November 1987, establish a mechaeism for the
promotion of external debt/equity swaps. Holders of Zairian external debt
obligations will have the opportunity to exchange these for equity in
privatised state assets. When a market in such instruments is established,
this is expected to encourage the return of some of the capital held abroad
by Zairian nationals.
(ii) Liouidation of Loss-Making Enterprises
57.       At an Executive Council meeting In late April 1987, the
Government decided to liquidate the following three public enterprises:
Institut Zairois de Management (Zairian Management Institute), Centre du
Commerce International (International Trade Centre) end Office National de
Logement (National Housing Agency). For all three enterprises the
Government will, by September 1987, take the necessary legal steps to
enable the liquidation process to be completed. These will include
provisions for the sale of assets, the compone  ;Ion of dismissed employees,
and the settlement of outstanding debts. The enterprises concerned are
those which the Government considers clear cases for closure without the
need for further study. By October 1987, a further list for liquidation
will emerge from the studies to be undertaken, and the liquidation process
for such enterprises will be begun no later then February 1988.
(iII) Enterprises Remaining in the State Portfolio
58.       For those enterprises which are to remain wholly owned within the
public sector, the Government will pursue policies aimed at increasing
economic efficiency through a wide range of legal and instltutional
measures. Principal among these are:
(a) Establishment of a new institutional framework
59.       After the above mentioned studies have been completed, the
Government will, by September 1987, decide upon the structure and location
of a new supervisory body to carry out the necessary coordinating,
advisory, monitoring and evaluation functions that are not being adequately
performed under current arrangements. The structure will be small and
simple with the necessary professional skills end political backing to
effectively perform its task. It will replace the current Ministry of
Portfolio and will be responsible for coordinating public enterprise
matters with both core and sectoral ministries. The new framework will be
put in place by February 1988.



- 20 -
(b) Rational,&ation of leaoi frgmework
60.       Parallel with this institutional reform, the Government Intends
to modify the existing law governing public enterprises. This modification
will, Inter all& separate comuercial and industrial enterprises from those
entities of a largely admnlistrative naturo which, while retaining some
autonomy, will be governed by a separate Law of Public Establishments. The
draft laws have been prepared and discussed with the lank; they are
expected to be enacted and applied by January 1988.
(c) Enterrrise management incentives
61.       One of the fbundenl1 objectives of the Government's reform
effort is to increase the autonomy and accountability of enterprise
management. This Implies not only a supervisory end monitoring framework
designed to this end, but also the establishment of a now system of
procedures and regulations for the appointment, dismissal ead remunerstlon
of management. While the appointment of company presidents and boards of
directors will reoain th, prerogative of the highest political authorities,
the new supervisory agency will provide advic, on the qualifications of
alternative candidates. The agency will also establish criteria for
evaluating enterpriso and hence management performance. The new procedures
will be defined during the course of the studies and put In place by
February 1988. Once they are fully operational, remuneration of public
enterprise management will be increased to compete with levels prevallng
in the private sector.
(d) External factors affectina enterprise uerformance
62.       The Governmeat will, through the mechanism of the supervisory
agency, clearly define non-comsercial obligations of each enterpriso that
may affect its financial performanee, and devise an adequate system of
componsation. The principal characteristics of this system will be
discussed with the Bank and decided by February 1988. To the extent
possible, such obligations will be eliminated by that date as will all
special exemptions and privileges eccorded to public enterprises which
compete with private and mixed enterprises.
(e) A posteriori financial control
63.       Even a well devised system of supervision and managament would be
inoperable in Zaire in the absence of a substantial improvement In the
quality and quantity of financial information available to both the
Government and enterprise management. Proper accounting procedures will be
gradually introduced in each enterprisel considerable progress has already
been made In recent years In several major enterprises which are Bank or
IDA borrowers. To reinforce the process, the Government will amend
existing laws and regulations to oblige all public enterprises to submit
their accounts to an annual audit by an appropriately qualified agency
outside the public sector. This reform will be included In the draft laws
to be prepared by June 1987, and enactod and applied by February 1988.



- 21 -
(f) Financial rationalization
64.       The Government should, by the end of October 1987, have
substantial Information available on financial flows and cross debts
identified In the studies to be completed by that time. Using this
information, the Government proposes to eliminate all cross debts by
February 1988, at which time a timetablo for the elimination of remaining
outstanding debts will be prepared and discussed with the Bank. The
studies should classify those enterprises which are fundamentally viable
but unable to operate effectively due to a number of internal constraints.
An outline plan and action program for the financial, managerial aad
structural rehabilitation of thes" enterprises will be prepared for
discussion with the Bank by February 1988.
T chnical Assistance
65.      Compliace with this wide ranging and demanding program will
require technical assistance over and above the UNDP-financed/Bank executed
studies of the public enterprise sector. The requirements until February
1988 would be met from the Technical Assistance Project (para. 47) which is
being processed in par*llel to assist In the Implementation of the
Structural Adjustment Program. These include support fors (a) the
establlshment and operation of Information systes, intially In the
Ministry of Portfolio, and subsequently to be used by the ne  suporvisory
agency; (b) preparation of an outline plan for the rchabilitation of
selected public enterprises (c) preparation of the technical aspects of
the liquidation and privatisation processes; (d) preparation of a plan and
detailed timetablo for the elimination of outstanding debts after the
elimination of cross debts; and (e) the establishment of the necessary
legal and technical mechanism  for a debtiequity sap program.
;. Public Kxnenditure Prograuming and Policies
66.      A key component in the improvemnt of public sector management
will be the progressive establishment of a system of public expenditure
programming. Such a system will provide the Government with a
comprehensive view of the resources at Its disposal and help eliminato the
current inadequacies in budgetary allocations and management.
67.      The first phase of such a system is the implementation of a
three-year rolling public investment program (PIP), to be revised oach year
to reflect project implementation and availability of external resources.
The investment program comprises a coro and a stand-by project program.
The core program is designed to reflect the lIkely evolution of financial
resources. The stand-by program includes projects which could be
implemented if additional resources become available. The PIP referred in
this report corresponds to the core program. A PIP for the 1986-89 period
was prepared jointly with the Bank in early 1986 and presented to donors at
the meeting of Consultative Group in April 1986. The Government has
updated the PIP to cover the 1987-90 period, .- assure its compatibility
with the availability of resources, both domestic and external. In view of



- 22 -
the continuing tight external financing prospects, the Government has
decided to reduce (by about one third) the size of the core PIP 'for 1987
and to rephase existing projects over the 1988-90 period to reflect a
slower implementation schedule.
68.       The major focus of the PIP Is on projects, with adequate economic
justification, to rehabilitate Infrastructure in the agriculture,
transport, mining, electricity, water supply, telecommunications, education
and health sectors. Most of these projects are ongoing, and a small number
(mainly in the mining and transport sectors) account for the bulk of the
core program. Investment expenditures for the PIP for projects outside the
sectors listed above, which are justified on other than economic grounds,
will not exceed a ceiling to be determined during the annual review of the
PIP; for 1987, this ceiling has been set at Z 1.5 billion (US$15 million,
at the April 1987 exchange rate).
69.       In 1986, actual spending under the PIP, as well as disbursements
on external loans, was 67 percent of the anticipated level. This shortfall
arose from several factors, including: (i) depressed copper and cobalt
prices which contributed to the reduction of Gecamines' capacity to
iplement its investment program; (it) shortfalls in budgetary receipts,
which led to a substantial reduction in spending under the investment
budget (about Z 1 billion, compared to initially budgeted expenditures of Z
3.2 billion), which finances the major part of domestic expenditures for
projects in agriculture and the social sectors. At the same time, more
than one third of spending under the investment budget was for projects
which were not in the PIP; and (ii) public enterprises in the transport
and power sectors generated smaller than anticipated internal funds, due
partly to delayed increases in tariffs. For the Office des Routes,
domestic resources fell short of expectations because of difficulties in
collecting road tax, as petroleum prices were not adjusted sufficiently to
reflect the depreciation of the zaire.
Comosition of the Public Investment Proaram
70.       Table 3 provides information on the revised PIP for the 1987-90
period, by sector and source of financing. The overall size of the 1987-90
PIP is Z 134 billion (in 1986 prices), or about US$2.3 billion. The PIP
includes Gecamines' 1986-90 rehabilitation program, for which the entire
amount of external financing required (US$260 million) has already been
committed, and major rehabilitation programs in the transport, water
einpply, electricity, education, agriculture and health sectors. More than
half of the PIP is accounted for by Gecamines and investment projects in
the transport sector.

ions)
71.      In the process of updating the PIP for 1987, some new projects have
been added, notably an emergency rural road rehabilitation project to be
financed through the Investment Budget. The Government has also initiated
actions with regard to a number of other projects for which the Bank has
requested clarifications (i) in the energy sector, a decision will be taken
on whether to convert part of the Inga-Shaba power line from direct to
alternating current, replacing several projects for generation and
transmission and thus reducing the overall size of the present power sector
investment program; (ii) in the mining sector, the Government has approached
one of Brazil's largest construction companies to rehabilitate the Kilo Moto
gold mines. However, while the rehabilitation of the Kilo Moto gold mines
is potentially a sound project, it will require in-depth engineering studies
before a realistic calendar and accurate assessment of costs can be
determined.
72.      Approxlmately 70 percent of the external financing required to
finance the 1987-90 public investment program has already been secured. The
remaining financing gap for the 1987-89 period is US$200 million, and an
additional US$200 million in 1990. About half of the financing gap is in
the transport sector, reflecting the large rehabilitation needs of the
Office des Routes, SNCZ and ONATRA.

Institutional Mechanisms
73.     As part of Its Structural Adjustment Program, the Government has
decided to adopt a series of measuros which will facilitate a better
lwplementation of the public Investment program. In particular, the
Governmont will take the necessary actions to coordinate the preparation of
the PIP with that of the budget, so that the investment budget matches the
annual tranche of the Government9s contribution to the PIP. Following Its
joint review with the Bank, the PIP will be circulated each year by the
Prime Minister to all Government departuents in order to facilitate its full
and timely Implementation.  The Government will onsure the timly release of
its part of domestic financing, and for this purpose a special account will
be set up at the Bank of Zaire, to be managed by the Ministry of Plan. The
authorities are also comitted to making appropriate tariff adjustments for
public enterprises to allow them to contribute their expected share to the
domestic financing of the PIP.
74.      To reduce the financial costs, the Gov rnment will minimise
recourse to non-concessional loamn for financing of the PIP. For this
purpose, during the annual review of the PIP an annual ceiling on non-
concessional loans will be determined. For 1987, non-concessional
comudtments will not exceod US$15 million (excluding eport-oriented
projects In the mining sector). The overument will also strengthen the
external financing coordination unit in the Ministry of Planning, In order
to monitor aid disbursements and to Identify problems to be resolved in
consultation with donors in the context of the *Follow-up Comaission
(Cummission de Suivi), a monitoring mechanism consisting of local donor
representatives of the members of the Consultative Group.
75.      The Government will roexamne listitutional arrtangemnts and
procedures within the central ministries and key technical departments and
agencies, in order to move gradually towards a unitary budget structure
combining recurrent nd capital expenditures In the form of a three-year
rolling public expenditure program. For this purpose, and to improve the
allocation of real resources (especially In favor of social sectors which
have been largely neglected in recent years), starting In 1988 the
Government will begin to develop public expenditure program for selected
sectors (agriculture, health and education). As deseribed In the section on
fiscal reform, the Government also Intends to promote greater budget
transparoncy through the elimination of a large numbor of the extrabudgetary
charges and funds which have proliferated in recent years.
76.      In ordor to continue exrting fiscal discipline and Improve the
transparency of public sector accounts, the Cour des Comptes (an autonomous
agency with responsibility similar to those of the General Accounting Office
in the U.S.) will be strengthened. In this regard, Initial recruitment and
training program for the Cour des Comptes staff and strengthening of the
Inspectorate Department of the Ministry of Finance will be given a high
priority.

C. Fiscal Reform
77.      In-depth reform of tax policy and administration ts a central
elment In the Government's overall development strategy. It ls essential
to improve the economic framework within which firms operate, as part of a
concerted effort to eliminate hindrnces to profitable activity and to
generate Investment and growth. While the tax effort (volume of taxes
collected in relation to the size of the economy) is modest (under 14
percent of GDP in 1986), private businesses are taxed disproportionately.
Although exemptions are widespread and a weak administration affords ample
opportunities for evasion and fraud, it is often the more efficient and
dynamic producers that bear the brunt of the tax burden. There io in
addition the very pervasive problem of parafiscal charges -- a wide range of
de facto parallel taxes raised by various authorities outside the central
budget -- which add to the final tax burden on firms and to the lack of
coordination and predictability of overall tax policy.
78.      The solution, however. does not lio simply in a reduction of tax
rates. It is imperative for the Government to find additional revenues,
both to help close the fiscal gap (expected to ex*eod 16 percent of GDP In
1987)4 while at the same time relieving some of the pressure that would
otherwise be placed on public expenditures.
79.      The Government has drawn up a program to strengthen its tax policy
and administration, focussing on three major objectivest
(i)    To broaden the tax base, by ensuring that taxes are
levied on a much higher proportion of private enterprises and
higher income individuals. This will require redefining and
clarifying certain aspects of the system of corporate and
personal income taxation and improving Its administration;
(IL)   To eliminate unnecessary tax distortions, particularly
any taxes or features of taxes that penalise producors generally
(cascading Input taxes; fiscal hindranees to financial
intermediation), or exporters in particular; and,
(iLL)   To harnizLe tax law and policy, eliminating or reducing
inconsistencies and enhancing overall coordination. This
requires mutually reinforcing actions on a number of fronts,
including the collection of the fragmented body of tax
legislation and regulations Into a singl and widely available
tax code; the process of elimination of the fiscal fragmentation
represented by numerous pataftscal charges; and the strengthening
of the Ministry of Finance's informational base and policy-making
capabilities.
80.      The Governmentt progrdm of action for fiscal reform draws on
several PPF-financed studies which have been recently completed. It
reinforces and is complementary to related reform efforts currently
41 Before rescheduling of interest payments on external debt.



- 26 -
underway, In particular the program of reduction In the levels and
variability of protection adopted under the Government's Industrial Sector
Adjustment Program and an ambitious program of operational support to the
administration of the country's Tariffs and Excises Department (OFIDA) which
is be$ng provided by the European Economic Comnunity. The measuros In
question can be descrlbed under four broad areas: (a) parafiscal charges
and fiscal coordination; (b) taxes on production, consumption and trade; (c)
the taxation of company incomes; and (d) tax administretion.
GorLernment measures
a. Parafiscal Charses and Fiscal Coordination
81.      Resolving the problem of the excessive number of parafiscal charges
requires, in the first instance, the elimination or rationalization of those
charges whose effects are most harmful, whether because of their undesirable
effects on producers and exporters, or because of the absence of any
justification for earmarking or separate administration of the revenues in
question.  The Government has decided to take the following imuediate
measurest
Mi)      To consolidate into the central budget and remove the
earmarking of the following Special Funds: Fonds de Convention
de Developpement's 10 percent share in turnover taxes (estimated
at Z 1.3 billion for 1987; used for concessional rural loans),
the Fonds Special du Tresor No. 1 (Z 350 million; for Cabinet
discretionary use) and the less significant taxes raised (but
used mostly for the administration of) the Fonds de Securite z
l'Enertie and the Fonds de Promotion du Tourisme;
(Li)    To eliminate the two percent tax on all agricultural
exports raised for the Fonds Aaricole (over Z 200 million; used
for concessional agricultural loans) as well as nearly 20 minor
but undesirable taxes raised by varlous Government Departments
other than the Ministry of Financeg and
(iii)   To unify the currently-duplicated interventions on coffee
markets of the two quality control boards (OZAC and OZACAF) and
to reduce and rationalize their charges to exporters.
82.      At the same time, the problem of parafiscal charges goes
substantially beyond short-run corrective actions. It is estimated that
Zaire presently has more than 400 fiscal instruments outside the revenue
andlor budgeting control of the Ministry of Finance. Detailed information
on many of these Is not even known, so that their abolition or reform Is
not a simple matter. In particular, for a number of such taxes which are
currently required to meet the needs of local or other authorities, their
inmediate replacemnt would be difficult since alternative revenue sources
are not readily available. To address these problems, the Government has
decided to:
(i)    Create an Inter-Ministerial Committee, headed by the
Minister of Finance, that will receive semi-annual progress and
technical reports and will make recommendations for the



- 27 -
progressive rationalization of all paraflocal charges over a 30-
month period. These semi-annual reports will form the basis of
the Government's dialogue with the Bank concerning the further
implementation of the parafiscal reform;
(11)    Strengthen and expand the technical and analytic
resources of the Ministry of Finance's Fiscal Studies Department,
which will receive and continue to develop the Infonmation-
gathering and policy work that has been conducted for the
Government under PPF financing. This unit will produce the semi-
annual reports and will serve as technical secretariat for the
Inter-Ministerial Committee referred to in the previous
paragraph; and
(iiI) Launch a study of local finance, to Identify and assess
current revenue sources and admntistrative practices and
possibilities and make recommendations for the allocation of
bases to different authorities.
b. Taxes on Production. Consumption end Trade
83.      The second major area of tax policy where Important changes will
be Introduced by the Government is indirect taxation, of both domestic
activities and trade. A progrsam of reduction in the level and dispersion
of tariff rates across different sectors was introduced in 1986 within the
framework of the Industrial Sector Adjustment Program. Thls tariff reform
program and details for further progress have been decided upon by the
Government In the context of the ISAL supervision and SAL appraisal
discussions (as summarized in Attachment 3 to the Letter of Development
Policy). The Government will now extend its attention In the some
systematic manner to the improvement of indirect taxes at the domestic
lovel, seeking to harmonixe and e"tend their coverage, mprove their
elasticity and performance under inflation, and reduce unwarranted
disincentives to producers and exporters.
84.      Specific measures which the Goverment has decided to adopt In
this area include:
(M)    the transformation of the main excises from specific
into ad valorem taxes, at the same time increasing their
implicit rates which have been significantly eroded by Inflation
In recent years
(ii)    the elimination in 1988-89 of the turnover tax (CCA)
currently raised on Interests payments on credit, given that the
latter is an input, not a final service, and that, in times of
high Inflation, the tax falls largely on the principal owed and
not only on the real Interest paid;5 and;
(iII) the Introduction of a system of forfeltary turnover
taxation for small and medium enterprises (SMEb), in ordor to
both expand revenues and spread tax burdens more evenly.
I The CCA on interest payments on agricultural credit will be eliminated
in JUne 1987.



- 28 -
85.      In addition, over the medium term, the 6overnment Intends to
modermise its turnover tax (CCA), which falls mostly on final consumption
but contajns an element of 4ouble (cascading) taxation of inputs. While
the Government intends to retain (and perhaps increase gradually) this tax,
in order to raise revenues from firms who are ablo to evade taxes on final
sales, the undesirabl, element of double taxation will be eliminated
through the Introduction of a a'redlting system for tax paid on Inputs.
Preparatory work for the administration of this change will be undertaken
In the second half of 1987 under the proposed Bank-provided Technical
Assistance Project for Economic Manageent (para. 47), and a program of
action for implementation will be detailed In February 1988.
c. The Taxation of ComDanv Incomes
86.      In view of the its llmited ability to implement tax changes across
the board, the Government has decided that major reform of direct taxation
would need to be carried out In several stages. Only one Important change
was felt to be both urgent and capable of iplementation without major
preparatory work, namely, tho Introduction of corrections, on a regular and
predictable 1asis, for the effects of inflation on the taxablo income of
firms as computed for tax purposes. The detsals of the Inflation
adjustments -- in particular the treatment that will be given to the
inflation component of Interest payments and the corresponding nominal
exchange losses -- are yet to be determined, and will be developed in
further dialogue with the Bank and finalized by February 1988.
87.      The Government has also decided not to introduce into Its next
revaluation law two provisions made in previous similar laws which were
found undesirable. First, the revaluation funds resulting from the
revaluation of assets will not be taxed, as these do not reflect a real
capital gain.  Second, and more importantly, there will be no requirement
for firms to retnvest the revaluation funds, as this would Introduce a
rigidity ln the system which is particularly undesirable duritg a period of
structural change. Another decision In the area of company tax, for
implementation later in 1987, was to introduce foreitary taxation of SWE
incomes, alongside that on turnovers referred to in par&. 84 above.
d. Tax Administration
88.      The need to improve tax administration in Zaire can hardly be
over-emphasized, and has been the subject of detailed reommendations by
the joint IMFB/ank fiscal missions (in both a 1982 report and a 1986
update) and operational ass otance from the EEC (Customs administration)
and, on a more modest scale, from the French Government (mostly training of
tax inspectors). Additional efforts, with support and technical assistance
from the World Bank, will focus prmarily on the improvement of the Tax
Department's collection procedures aIdentification, verification and
complaints. The Tax Department will also be reorganiesd through the
crestion, in the second half of 1987, of a unit specifically chargod with
the administration of forfaitary taxation of SMEs. Technical asistance is
also envisaged In the context of the proposed Technical Assistance Project



- 29 -
for the modernization of excise taxes (in particular to turn them into ad
valorem bases) and for the introductios of the crediting system for the
turnover tax, referred to earlier.
89e      The improvement of tax administration will also require a revision
and strengthening of the overall administrative frtaework. In particular,
Zaire suffers from an enormous fragmentation of tax laws, regulations and
decrees, in such a way that It is often ipossiblo for either tax
Inspectors or taxpayers to know what the latest versdon of the relevant law
or act may be, and hence to ascertain their respective rights and
obligations and be able to plan accordingly. The Government has
consequently decided to collect, roviso and harmanise all tax legislation
and regulations, and transform them into a single, coherent and widely
available tax code. In the same vein, the Government will Improve its
analytic strength on tax policy and admnstration through the
reinforcement of both the Tax and the Fiscal Studies departments of the
Secretariat of Finance.
D. Financial Sector Policles
90.     The financial sector In Zaire consits of the Central Bank, nine
commercial banks, and two development banks: Soci;to Financi4re de
Doveloppement (SOFIDN), a mixed institution with 40 percent Government
participation, which provides risk capital and term loans for Investment
projects, and Banque de Cr&dit Agricole (BCA), owned by the Government.
Seven of the commercial banks have more than 70 percent equity
participation by a foreign bank. The Government has a minority share in
two of them. Of tis remaining two commercial banks, one was declared
bankrupt and placed under temporary state control pending reptivatization
and the other is owned by the Goverament. The non-bank financial sector
includes two subsidiaries of cimercial banks specialized in the financing
of construction and real estate development, an insurance company (SOMAS),
a savings institution (CADEZ&), a postal savings network (CCP), and a
social security fund (INSS). There is also an array of saving cooperatives
(COOPEC) which collect small savings and grant loans to their members.
These cooperatives are not yet accredited by the Central Bank.
91.      The continued oligopolistic nature of the banking system -- the
four major comuercial banks account for nearly 90 percent of deposits and
loans -- along with the strict limits on credits imposed In recent years,
have led to a situation in which the allocation of credit Is far from
optimal in meeting the requirements of an economy undergoing structural
transformation. In particular, the existence of large margins of
unsatisfied demand for credit has provided commerclal banks with the
opportunity to provide credit primarily to low risk and high return
operations. Credit has been generally extended only to clients who can
provide collateral -- often in the form of overseas guarantees -- thus
severely limiting the possibility for extending credit to non-privileged
customers. Reflecting these factors, credit outstanding to agriculture,
manufacturing and tranport declined substantially in real term  between
1982 and 1987, while trade-related credit outstanding more than tripled (in
real terms). Inadequate tern leading also rmains a serious problem, as
medium-term loans are devoted almot exclusively to banks" larger preferred
clients   In addition, all medium-tern credits require the advaced
approval of the central bank on a case-by-case bais.



- 30 -
92.      In September 1983, all lending rates were liberalised with the
exception of the interest rate for non-coffee agricultural credit which was
fixed by the Central Bank at a level below the rates prevailing in other
sectors (it Is now at 32 percent). In order to ensure that commercial
banks lend at this preferential rate, the Central Bank has had to direct
credit to agriculture through the mechanism of project approval outside the
credit ceiling. In practice, loans to agriculture have been used to
finance a variety of activities.
93.      Market-determined interest rates on short-term bank advances
currently range from 32 to 37 percent and on medium-term credits up to 40
percent. In addition, borrowers pay an 18 percent tax and commissions
which raise the cost of term borrowing to about 50 percent. Interest rates
on term deposits, which since 1984 are In competition with treasury bills,
range between 35 and 37 percent. Inflation in recent years has averaged
about 3' percent.
94.      The Central Bank has until now played a relatively minor role in
the supervision over the operations of finanecal institutions. Its prinary
responsibilities have been to monitor liquidity and resorve requirements,
credit cealings, the banks' foreign exchange position and to gather
information through a modest reporting system. The basic legislation and
regulations for adequate supervision exist but have generally not been
translated into clear instructions for banks. There are, for example, no
maximum debt/equity ratios, no clear definitions of a bad debt, nor any
guidelines regarding the constitutions of provisions for bad loans.
95.      Reform measures supported by the Government's Structural
Adjustment Program will focus on improving the efficiency of credit markets
and strengthening the supervision function of the Central Bank. The
Govetoment has taken the following recent measures. To complete the
liberalization of the interest rate structure, the Interest rate for
agricultural credit is no longer fixed. At the same time, the distinction
between allocated and non-allocated credit within the credit coilings has
been discontinued while prior Central Bank authorization for medium-term
loans and agricultural credit is no longer necessary. To promote increased
competition between banks the credit celling ould be reduced in subsequent
periods for any bank which falls to meet its lending targets. These
arrangements will be reviewed periodically by the consultative commission
set up to assess the adequacy of credit supply to agriculture.
96.      As part of the tax reform component of the proposed operation, the
Government has agreed to phase out the CCA tax on interest over a period of
two years, reducing the effective cost of term loans to around 37 percent,
which is reasonable under present macroeconomic conditions in Zaire.6
Furthermore, in order to improve the transparency of the cost of commercial
bank borrowing, banks will required to make public the composition of the
cost of credit including all fees, commissions and other charges.
6I The CCA tax for agricultural loans has been eliminated in 1987, while
for other categories of credits It will be reduced by 50 percent in 1988
and completely eliminated in 1989.

97.      In the area of supervision, the Central Bank has introduced a new
and more comprehensive reporting system for banks with a view to obtaining
better information as a basis for strengthening its superviaion function.
To the same end, the accounting systems used by the banks will be Improved
and standardLzed and changes will be introduced In the treatment of non-
performing assets. Furthermore, specific financial ratios to be followed
by commercial banks will be established.
98.      The savings cooperatives in Zaire constitute a group of
intermediaries which could potentially play an Important role in savings
mobilization, particularly amongst small rural savers, and credit extension
to micro-enterprLses and artisans. Under the proposed operation and s
parallel IDA Credit which supports small-scale enterprises, measures will
be taken to prepare a special law regulating savings cooperatives and to
carry out a special management audlt of the major cooperative networks with
a view to identifying weaknesses in the system and formulating an
assistance program for their reinforcement. By the end of June 1988, when
these actions are completed, a program will be agreed between IDA and the
Government aimed at strengthening the cooperatIves' financial structure and
bringing them Into the formal financial system.
E. Civil Service Reform
99.      Public adminlstration in Zairo has been characterized by weak
personnel management and inadequate remuneration which together have
contributed to low levels of efficiency and Inadequate provision of public
services. Weak management has resulted in overstaUfingl, double counting,
lack of detailed job descriptions and unclear qualification critoria. An
unfavorable incentive structure, particularly low salaries, has led to
frequent absenteeism and has contributed to the growth of the underground
economy. Durlng the 1970s, the Government payroll experienced a rapid
expansion, mainly explained by the decentralization of the civil service
administration among the various regions. The problem. of overemployment
and double-counting were exacerbated during tbls period and contributed to
an inflated and uncontrollable public administration. In addition, the
serious economic and flnancial crisis, dating from 1975 and characterized
by limited budgetary resources and high inflation, has translated into a
continuous decline in the real purchasing power of income of civil
servantsl the 1986 average represented about one-fifth of the 1975 level.
Compared to the 1982 level, the first year of austerity measures under the
Goverrment's stabilization program, the real wage of the civil service in
1986 had fallen by 25 percent, despite a series of wage increases.7   This
compares unfavorably with the real wage in the private sector, which since
71 The erosion in the purchasing power of civil servants' itcome is
demonstrated by the following estimates, based on criteria established
by the trade union (UNTZA)t the minimum monthly budget for a family of
six at the end of 1986 was equivalent to Z12,500, while the average
monthly base salary for the bottom five grades of the civil service ws
Z 2140 -- a ratio of 6:1.



- 32 -
1982 has recaptured part of the purchasing power lost since 1975. In April
1987, the Government granted a salary increase of 70 percent to the lower
seven grades and a 15-50 percent increase to the higher-level grades,
which, compared to the expected 40 percent Inflation rate, would represent
the first real Increase in income for civil servants since 1975.
100.     Since 1981, the Government has attempted to address the
proliferation of civil service employment by various means:8 (i)
systematic ret'rement of eligible employees during 1981-83; (ii)
establishment of a ceiling of 100,000 employees for the civil service in
1981; (Uii) placing a freeze on recruitment and promotions since 1983; and
(iv) starting In 1985, the undertaking of a complete census of the civil
service throughout the country and computerising the results (this
exercise, being carried out with UNDP assistance, is expected to be
completed around the end of 1987). These efforts have succeeded In
stabilizing (and perhaps slightly reducing) civil service employment mainly
by eliminating a number of fictitious and/or redundant employees. As of
the end of 1986, the size of the civil service slightly exceeded 117,000,
out of a total public administration of nearly 500,000, as compared to
114,000 in 1981 out of a total of 446,000.9 Preliminary results of the
ongoing civil service census indicate that roughly 15 percent of the civil
service could be further reduced by eliinating fictitious and redundant
employees, assuming, of course, that strict administrative and budgetary
controls art in place.
101.    To continue its reform efforts, the Goverrment, under the
Structural Adjustment Program, will formulate a strategy for the
rationalization of civil service employment and remuneration policies, and
for the Improvement of personnel management. The Government's action
program for the reform of the civil service revolves around three aspects:
the size of the civil service, the incentive system and planning and
management of personnel. The objectives are tot (i) employ an adequate
anc qualified staff to carry out the various public functions; (ii) provide
a remuneration package sufficient to recruit, maintain and motivate the
personnel required for the different public services, taking account of the
budgetary constraints; and (iii) assure that porsonnel and other resources
are usod efficiently in carrying out the program, services and projects of
each department.
102.     Although the reform of the civil service is a lengthy process, the
Government intends to undertake a number of short-term actions, Including:
(i) a reduction In the number of civil servants by continuing the
elimination of fictitious employees by September 1987 and the retirement of
eligible staff by January 1988. This action lmplies the completion of the
8/ In this report civil service refers to public servants employed in the
central and regional administrations and excludes primary and secondary
teaching personnel, military and security personnel, political party
staff and pensioners.
9/ Data comparisons of public employment should only be considered as
indicative, since large variations exist between sources, particularly
for the period up to 1982.



- 33 -
census and physical control missions begun In 1985, as well as the
computerization of the results, by June 1987;
(1i) improvement in the existing saslry structure, without adding
significantly to the burden of the real public wage bill, by Fobruary 1988.
This measure will be lmplemented in conjunction with (1). A revised salary
structure, which will address the anomalies In the existing one by reducing
the salary differentials between the higher-level grades and the
intermediate grades (e.g., at present the base salary ratio between a
Secretary General and the lowest grade is 13s1), Is being prepared. The
salary reform will also introduce pay steps in each grade of the salary
structure to allow lateral movoments. Under the new salary structure, a
personnel evaluation system, based on performance and merit, will be
designed and adopted by June 1988. In order to avoid the ad hos salary
increases of past years, an appropriate salary adjustment mechanism which
will reflect both cost-of-living and good performance will be designed by
June 1988, In keeping with budgetary realities, and will be applied to the
1989 budget; and
(iiI) rationalization of non-monetary benefits and their
distribution by February 1988. These benefits whiLch amount to at least
half the base salary represent a significant part of the remuneration
package. However, a number of these benefits, including automobiles for
personal use and provision of free gasoline, which are granted to
managerial level staff (cadres de co)mandemet), further distort the lnome
gap between the higher-level cadres and lower-level staff -- with the
supplementary benefits, the remuneration ratio between a Secretary General
and the lowest grade approaches 90:1. Under the Structural Adjustment
Program, the allocation criteria will be clarified and the possibility of
gradually suppressing some of these benefits and replacing them with
monetary allocations will be considered. Moreovor, at present, non-
monetary benefits, especially the vehicle and gasoline allowances, are
distributed under several budgetary itme. In order to improve the
transparency of the transport benefit and thus reduce its abuse, a specific
budgetary item will be introduced for vehicle and gasoline allocations.
103.    For the medium- to long-term, the Governmentto program aims at
improving the planning and  nagement of hum a resources of the public
administration.  To this end, a mapower planning system will be
established In the Department of Public Administration by January 1988; the
management function of the Department in the regions will be strengthened,
begining in June 1988; and the priorities and objectives of each
department in the public administration will be defined (to begin this
procedure, the Government Intends to start in four pilot departments,
Public Administration, Planning, and two technical departments, possibly
Agriculture and Rural Development, by February 1988). These measures would
help define more precisely the qualified mianpwer needs and Improve
programming procedures, budgetary decisions and administrativo control; an
action program will be defined by June 1988 and be implemented by February
1989. The proper Implementation of these measures will require the
strengthening of the Manpower Planning Unit, the Inspectorate Unit and the
Organization and Methods Service within the Department of Public
Administration; an action program will be prepared by September 1987.
Ongoing technical assistance from the UNDP and the proposed Technical



- 34 -
AssistaneC Project for Economic Nanagem_nt are expected to contribute in
these areas. Lastly, in order to meet the Identified manpower needs, the
Government will elaborate an appropriate training program for the civil
service, starting In February 1988.
F. Azriculture
104.    Agriculture provides dire t employment to about three quarters of
the labor force and accounts for one-third of GDP. While it was a major
source of export revenues in the early 19609, agricultural exports now
represent only one-tenth of total export earnings. Agriculture has a great
potential as a source of production, export diversification and gainful
employment. Despite ite vast potential, the performance of agriculture has
been very disappointing in the lat two decades.
105.    The sector suffered from Inadequate resources which led to a rapid
deterioration of the physical infrastructure and public sector institutions
involved in the sector. The measures of sairianization in the 1973,
followed by nationalization in 1974 and the retrocession in late 1976
resulted In a major disruption of confidence and of the distribution
network. Since then the sector has been characterized by a process of
disinvestment. The state of agricultural research has deteriorated due to
weak management, lack of funds, and unbalanced staffing in the Rational
Institute for Agronomic Research (INERA) which used to be one of the
leading research institutes In the tropics. The agricultural extension
service is thinly scattered and largely ineffective due to lack of funds
and mobility, and inadequate staffing. Currently, a large part of
agricultural extension is provided by private companies (in cotton, maize,
sugarcane) and by rural development projects. These services occasioially
duplicate and overlap each other with limited coordination efforts to date.
106.    The sector also suffers from a rural roads network in disrepair,
which along with an inadequate distribution system for petroleum products,
hampers the use of inputs and marketing of agricultural products. Trade
liberalization in 1983 resulted In removal of protection for some
agricultural products which had to face severe competition from subsidized
Imports and dumping. Other problems in the sector arise from an Ill-
adapted agricultural credit system, and a tax system with taxes and
parafiscal charges hampering productive activities. The low level of
private sector participation in agricultural Input distribution has also
contributed to shortage of fertilizers, insecticides, agricultural
Implements and veterinary products In the interior of the country.
107.    Agricultural development policy since 1983 has followed the
general policy of economic liberalization by freeing farmgate and retail
prices for agricultural commodities and by delogating to the private sector
the primary role for production, marketing and distribution in the sector.
Development objectives, set in the recent 5-Year Development Plan, aros
(i) to achieve fooderop self-sufficiency by 1990; (it) to encourage the
increased production of primary commodities used by local industries, e.g.
cotton for the textile industry; (ill) to encourage increased production of
agricultural export commodities; and (iv) to channel development efforts
through an approach a8 yet to be fully defined, concentrating on mfoyers de
developpment' (zones of development).



- 35 -
108.     In terms of broad pollcy orientations, Zaire has been far ahead of
many African countries since 1983 by removing price and marketing
impediments. Most of the constraints that have been hampering the recovery
of the sector are supply-side related. In order to stimulate greater
Investment and expand production, there is an urgent need to improve
support services to agriculture and to pursue further' improvements in the
overall system of Incentives. In particular, the Government recognizes
that there Is a need to find solutions to the problem facing agricultural
research, agricultural extension, the financing of agricultural development
projects, the rehabilitation of rural access roads and storage facilities
and the distribution of agricultural inputs. There is coneorn with the way
that the trade liberalisation policies Introduced In 1983 have opened up
Zaire's markets to Imports of surplus and subsidized agricultural produce
and the potential threat which this poses to local agricultural enterprises
and agro-industries.
109.    In order to redress same of theso shortcomings, the Government, in
Its Policy Statement on Agriculture (Annex SII, Attachment 6) has outlined
the moasures which it intends to implement during the program period. The
Policy Statement emphasizes that the role of the Government remains the
rehabilitation and $mprovement of basic Infrastructure, the promotion of
agricultural research, the establishment of agricultural extension
meehanisms for improved production and the creation of a favorable
environment for agricultural investment, while the private sector's main
role focuses on production.
110.    The program of action in agriculture includes measures on a number
of frontst
(a)   a ricultural credit - As discussed in the section on
financial sector policies (para. 95), more general reforms to the
credit structure will eliminate the distinction between allocated
("reparti) and unallocated (unonrepartil) credits, accompanied by
the elimination of preferential interest rates for agriculture.
At the same time, to encourage lending for agriculture, commercial
banks will be given minimum targets for agricultural credit within
their overall lending cealings. In addition, to improve the
awareness of agricultural credit needs by the banking sector, a
Consultative Committee on Agricultural Credit will be set up, with
representation by all major parties interested (AZB, Bank Of
Zaire, BCA, ANEZA, Department of Agriculture etc.). Subsequent
efforts will focus on strengthening the role and operation, and
expanding the resources, of the Agricultural Bank (BCA);
(b)   fiscal and tariff measures - within the overall context of
unifying import tariffs across the economy (para. 36), there is a
need to redress the imbalance created by the low level of tariff
protection for agricultural commodities introduced in 1983. The
tariffs for certain products will be raised from their present low
level to 10 percent Initially, and subsequently to a minimum of 20
percent. Simultaneously, an adjustment mechanism will be designed
to protect selected products against the effects of dumping or
subsidization. This mechanism will take into account the



- 36 -
conclusions of the ongoin study on the competitiveness of
selected agricultural products, and on the appropriate nature for
SUCh an adjustment mechanisgm
(c)   amricultural research - the Goverment has made the
Implementation of the rec¢omendations of the National C0nisaion
on agricultural reeasrch as defined in its action plan of 1984 a
major objective of its structural adjustment program. These
recommendattons aim to streamline the adminstration and oporation
capabilities of the national agricultural research institute
(INRA);
(d) imnroved rural access roads - a Rational Service responsible
for rural access roads has been established recently under the
Department for Rural Development and a priority program for rural
access roads improvement has been drawn up in conjunction with the
staff of the Office des Routes. Implementation of this program
will be * major component of the structural adjustment program,
with a double objectivo of rehabilltating rural roads and
stimulating local economic activity through the mobilization of
local labor forces and local enterprises (see par"s. 119-120);
(e)  imroved efficiency and codation of the Deoar_Met o
Ltriculture an  Rural DeLoi9men - bigh priority will be given to
strengthn ang and bettor coordinating the Deprtments of
Agriculture end Rural Development and Improving the quality of
staffg
(f) slmolAficatlon of exoort procedures - as part of a general
policy to remove unnecessary impedimnats to exportors, a study is
currently being undertaken to identify those measures specifically
needed to simplify procedures facing agricultural exporters;
(g) production-relsted measures - the Government has begun to
draw up a p'.antation rehabilitation project, based on the
-ec---ndations of a study currently under way on perennial crops.
The Government will also study meavns of applylng the debt lequity
swap procedure (see discussion undor reform of public enterprises)
to encourage private sector particlpation in plantation
rehabilitation. A study is to be Initiated also on ways of
improving storage infrastructure up-country;
(h)   extenslon services - proposals are presently being made in
the context of an FAO study for the reorganization of agriculture
extension at the field level, with the objective of iproving
efficient use of field staff. The future strategy for development
of rural areas will be based on a concentration of efforts in
areas of proven potential where a minimum of infrastructure is
already in place. The Government will be defining this approach
In more detail through the Identification of these so-called
"foyers de developpement; and
(i) agricultural iniuts - in the search for measures to
encourage a more active participation of the private sector in the



- 37 -
distribution of agricultural Inputs, a study hsa been coeaissioned
by the Department of Agriculture.  Reco--^ndations made by the
study team will be pursued under the Structural Adjustment
Program.
111.    Many of the critieal constraints faced by the agricultural sector
are comon to other sectors of the economy. for example, the problem of
counterpart funding of development projects Is not limited to agriculture
alone. Consequently this question has been dealt vith in the overall
arrangements for funding the priority Public Investment Program. Other
common measures tackled under other components of the SAP, which have a
direct bearing on the agriculture sector, include; (a) measures for the
improvement of the civil service, Including the Department of Agriculture
being the pilot Ministry In implementing the civil service reform; (b)
the elimination of the Fonds Agricole tax on agricultural exports,
effective June 1987g and (e) the unification of the intervention of OZAC
snd OZACAF In the coffee sector, with a concomitant reduction in the
charges paid by coffee exporters.
112.    The extent to which the measures for structural adjustment are
effective will be reflected by the relative response of the investing
community in Zaire to increase their activitie in the agriculture sector.
During a major agriculturo sector mission in May/June 1987, an attempt has
been aade to identify criteria by hich this response may be judged.
0. Transuort Sector
113.    By virtue of the country's siso and scattered population and
natural resources, and with Its limited access to the *sea transport costs
are high, and represent an Important element of the final costs of both
Imported goods and domestic production. The backbone of Zaire transport
network Is a raillriver system of about 10,000 in. o! major routes,
complemented by about 145,000 km. of mostly unpaved toads. Although the
basic transport network Is adequate given the country's level of
development and although some improvement have taken place stnce the mid-
1970's, the sector's performance remains unsatisfactory and troanport still
constitutes a serious constraint to the country's economic development and
integration. This is due to the poor condition of infrastructure and
equipment, and the low efficiency in running the transport services,
particularly in the parsstatal sector, which dominates the trassport
market. Three public agencies (SNCZ, ONATRA and Office des Routes) play a
critical role as tb ry are respectively responsible for operating rail and
river transport (at least 60 percent) and for building and maintaining the
main highway network. Efficiency can be signlficantly Improved by
streamlining and rehabilitating these agencies, by ensuring their proper
funding sad by encouraging the private sector to play a more comprohensive
and dynamic role. Finally, improving the rural road network will be a key
factor in boosting agricultural production.
114.    Four main Issues which are critical to the short and medium-term
adjustment process will be addressed by the Government in the context of
Its Structural Adjustment Programs



- 38 -
(i)   Improving the financial situation and the operational efficiency
of SNCZ, ON&TRA through implementation of short-term recovery
measures including substantial tariff lncreases and a revision of
their tariff structure; ensuring the funding of Office des Routes
at a level sufficient to enable it to carry out its agreed
program;
(ii)   Improving the strategic planning and Implementing selective
reorganization of ONATRA and SNCZ, emphasising decentralization,
streamlining and divesting (privatization) of some activities;
'(i1i)  Improving transport planning, programming and budgeting
particularly in the context of the PIP review; and
(iv)   Launching a rural roads improvement program with an appropriately
decentralized institutional framework;
Although the first issue is being monitored under existing IDA projects, it
is further addressed as a part of the SAL because of the critical financial
deterioration of the three enterprises since 1985 and of the need to
Imuediately alleviate this situation.  The remaining three Issues, which
are longer-term ones, will be followed up and fully implemented under new
sector or subsector projects which are now being prepared.
Financial Rehabilitation of ONATRA and SNCZ. and Fundine of OR
115.    The financial situation of both ONATRA and SNCZ has deteriorated
sharply since 1985. Although this Ls mainly due to delays in granting
tariff increases in a highly inflationary onvironment, both enterprises
also suffer from deep-seated structural problems such as a dcreasing, or
at best, stagnating traffic, high admidistrative and social overhead costs,
and a lack of managerial and technical capabilities (see below, para. 117).
In May 1987 the Government announced major tariff increases for both ONATRA
end SNCZ; for most categories these represented the first increase since
May 1985. In order to avoid further erosion of revenues, the Government
intends to design and put in place a tariff adjustment mechanism which will
allow for periodic adjustments to match real cost increases. In parallel,
ONATRA and SNCZ have undertaken tariff studies to ovorhaul their obsolete
tariff structures which are based on ad valorem tarification and on
subsidization of social services. Relating tariff to costs and taking into
account commercial practices will result in a more efficient traffic
allocation between modes and will ensure that revenues fully cover actual
costs of the agencies.
116.     In the road sector, tho local resources for maintenance and
rehabilitation operations are provided by a tax on gasoline and diesel oil.
Under the Sixth Highway Project the Government agreed in 1985 that the
proceeds of the road tax would be allocated to Office des Routes during the
project execution period (1985-88). The recent (April 1987) Increase in
the petroleum price, and along with it the tax on gasoline and diesel
oil -- which had rema£ned unchanged since April 1985 -- was an important
step in assuring that sufficient resources would be made available to the
Office des Routes to allow it to carry out its work program.



- 39 -
Strategic Planning and Selective Reortanization of ONATRA and SNCZ
117.    ONATRA and SNCZ are playing a vital role in Zaire's transport
system, and particularly In the Vole Nationale which links up the ocean
port of Matadi with Kinsasaa and with the mineral rieh Shaba region 2000 km
away. ONATRA's responsibilities to operato an Integrated portlrvivrlrail
transport system and to be the main operator on a navigable river system of
15,000 km are unique. Although these entities will continue to play a
crucial role in the Zairian economy and will require continued support from
the donor community, their mandate and objectives need to be clarified,
taking into account the competition from a dynamic private sector which
needs further incentiveo to grow. While they are generally overstaffed
with underqualified and poorly motivatod stgaff, they lack a cadre of
qualified engineers and technicians. They are overcentralized and burdened
with non-transport activities that compouad their Inefficiency. The
Government Intends to redefine their roles and responsibilities and to
streamline the organization accordingly. Some activities, such as ONATRA's
shipyards, could be subject to privatization while others could be
progressively reduced or eliminated sltogether. Within the context of the
public enterprise reform program (see section A, above), their
relationships with the State and the private sector will be defined more
clearly; and, in the case of ONATRA, Government has agreed to Issue by
Decembor 1987 a 'Contrat Plan" which would define these relationships. For
both ONATRA and SNCZ a comprehensive program for human resources
development will be deigned and implemented. Technical assistance needs
to be reassessed, refocussed as the need arises, and better managed.
Government and the agencies have agreed under this program to carry out
progressively tho above reforms according to an agreed schedule of steps
(as set forth in Attachment 7 to the Letter of Development Policy).
Imorovina Trans,ort Planning. Proarammrng and Budgetina
118.    The transport investment planning, programming and budgeting
mechanism deserves considerable improvement, both at the agency and the
ministerial levels. In many areas the public investment program has not
been satisfactorily updated on the basis of feasibility studies, and theare
exists no mechanism for review, monitoring and intermodal coordination.
GET, the Transport Study Group and intended planning arm of the Ministry,
has been used mainly as an advisory body to the Ministry on operational
matters and has therefore not been able to function as a long term planning
and coordiasting instrument. A reorganization study Is now underway, and
the Government has agreed to review its recommendations and start
implementing them by end of 1987.
Launchint a Rural Road Improvement Proaram
119.    As a result of Zaire's size and geography, the highway network Is
vast (about 150,000 km) but with only a small portion of it (50,000 km)
being regulariy maintained by the Offieo des Routes. On the rest of the
network, entrusted to state and local authorities, minor and sporadic
upkeep work is being undertaken sometimes with local and/or external
project financing and with OR technical assistance. The proposed program
would complment these ongoing activities and establish an appropriate



- 40 -
institutional framework for Its development. As a new mi4nsterial
department (Rural Development Ministry; RDM) has been created with an
Agricultural Road Servlie (SNRDA) officially In charge of all local roads
rehabilitation and maintenance, It has boen agreed that SNRDA woul have
the overall responsrbility for developing the program. However, at the
local level, the program would be executed by local communities and
contractors under the control of (and with the tochnieal assistance from)
the Office des Routes, to which supervision, control and payment of works
would be fully delegated. The responstbilitios of OR, local jurisdietions
and DM have been clearly spelled out in an agreement (Convention-Cadre) to
which the Rural Development and Public Works Ministries are parties. This
agreement would also emphasise the rolo of state-level Feeder Road
Committees in selecting the roasd at the local level, mobilising the local
financing and overseeing the program's execution. Although a financial
contribution from foreign donors and the central budget would be expected,
the local financing share would be Important from the start as the program
is expected to become self-supporting eventually.
120.    Initially, the program is targoted to maintain an additional
10,000 km of rural roads per year with about 3000 km of rehabilitation, to
be subsequently maintained. Most of the work is to be carried out manually
using road brigades (cantonnage umnuel) provided by local entrepreners or
collectivities that have a vested interest In maintsining the road open
under OR's supervislon. This program will be initiated in 1987 at the same
time as a full scale project Is belig prepared with UNDP financing and with
IDA as executing asgency, for Implementation in 1988189 with possible
IDAIUNDP and other donor cofinancing. Government has expressed a keen
interest in this program and has agreed with the plan of action outlited in
Its Declaration of Development Policy (Annex III).
PART IV - TIE PROPOSED OPERATION
A. Backtround
121.    A preliminary outline of are" of policy reform which could provide
the basis for a structural adjustment operation was discussed with the
Government in March/April 1986, and again in September/October 1986. A
preparation mission visited Kiashasa in January 1987. Between April 1986
and September 1986 a number of studies financed by PPF and UNDP funds were
initiated. These itcludeds (i) civil service employment and remuneration;
(tl) indirect and company taxation, parafiscalities, and tax adminlstrationg
(Lit) the financial sector; (iv) the 1987-90 public investment program; and
(v) public enterprises.
122.    During the preparation of the Structural Adjustment Program, the
Government set up an Interministerial Coordination Committee at the
ministerial level under the chairmanship of the Prime naister, with a
Technical Secretariat, chaired by the Minister of Planning representing the
Planning, Finance, 8udget, Agriculture, Portfolio, Civil Service, Economy
and Industry Hinistrios, and the Central Bank. The Committee, and Technical
Secretariat, assumed the responsibility for coordinating the preparatory
work, reviewing the rLcm.sndations for polly refonm, and liaising with the

preparation and appraisal missions, as well as for monitoring the
implemetation of the SAP. This Technical Secretariat will aolo ensure
proper coordination between the implementation of the proposed Credits and
the associated Technical Assistance Project for Economic Managment.
B. Rel_tionshiV between the Proposed Ogeration and Pollcy Reforms
123.    The proposed Credits would finance the first phase (1987-88) of the
Government's medium-term structural adjustment progrm, which has been
discussed ln detail in Part III. The Government has provlded the
Assoclation wlth a Letter of Development Policy (Annex III) which deserLbes
the specific measures that have been or will be taken during this ph&s" of
the adjustment program. These measures aro enumerated in the policy matrix
tables attached to the Letter of Development PolLey. The Credits would etse
Zaire's financial strain to allow for adjustment to take place during this
period, not only with respect to external financing, but also by increasing
budgetary resources.
C. Coortination with the DMF
124.    Zaire has negotiated four stand-by arrangements with the IMF sLace
the initiatiou of its reform program in 1983. In the second half of 1986,
Zaire wa unable to make lts third and fourth purchses under the existitg
stand-by arrangement (which extended from I ay 1986 through March 1988)
becaue of Its failure to meet the perforr ace criteria, due to larger than
anticLpated public sector borrowing from he domestic banking system.
Rather than attempting to revive the arr anement, the Government and the IMF
decided to negotiate a new stand-by agreement  The INF board on May 15,
1987 approved a new stand-by arrangement totalling SDR 100 milllon covering
the period May 1987-May 1988.
125.    Given the nature of the proposed adjustmnt program, and the need
for fiscal and balance of paymets policLes to support structural reforms at
the sector level, there has been close collaboration between Bank and INF
staff in the preparatLon of the Structural Adjustment Program, both In
Washington and durlng overlapping mLssions ln the field. An INP staff
member particLpated In the appraisal mission for the SAL in March 1987. The
Government has also prepared jointly with the IMP and Bank a Pollcy
Frameork Paper (PFP) ia conjunction with its application for use of IDH
resources under the IMN's Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF). The SAY
program ws also approved by the DKP Board, for an amunt of SDR 137
million, with a first tranche of SDR 58 mllion. The PmP was also used as
the Government's principal document for the seeting of the Consultative
Group held on May 21-22, 1987.
D. Effects of the Adiustmnet Prosram
126.    As outlined in Part II of this report, the first phase of the
structural adjustment program undertaken by the Government of Zaire with
the support of the proposed SAL, is part of a longer-term action plan to
restore sustained economic growth and lmprove the very low living standards
of a large part of the Zairian population. The implementation of this



- 42 -
program should set the basis for a substantial restructuring of the Zairian
economy over the next five to ten years. The main changes envisaged Imply
a general reorientation of the economy In favor of private initiative In a
number of vital economic sectors whose potential appears largely
underutilized, including non-Gecamines mini"g, agriculture, and
manufacturing. Other key changes triggered by this program are related to
the public sector, whose relative importance in the economy will be reduced
and whose organization and performanco will be revamped to improve resource
allocation and allow it to make a more effective contribution to the
recovery of the Zairian economy.
127.     The likely impact of the proposed program on the main
macroeconomic variables Is highlighted In two medium-term scenarlos which
summarize different patterns of adjustment of the Zairian economy to the
international environment foreseen in tho next decade, with and without
comprehensive policy reforms. The International environment faced by the
Zairian economy under both scenarios appears to be one of the most binding
constraints to the restoration of sustained economic growth in the near
future. Following the 25 percent drop In international terms of trade
experienced during 1986, price projctions covering the period 1987-1990
indicate for copper, diamonds and coffee - thro  commodittes accounting for
more than 70 percent of Zairian exports - either a modest annual lncrease
(1.9 percent for copper, 4 percent for diamonds) or a substantial decline
(coffee price drops 26 percent In 1987 and Is expected to grow 3 percent
per year thereafter).  Over the entire period 1987-95, terms of trade are
expected to show only a slow  improvement from the 1986 level and to be
still 10 percent below the 1985 level at the end of 1995.
128.    The two scenarios illustrated in the following paragraphs differ
in two basic respects: the level of external assistance provided to
support the Government's adjustment effort and the scope of the adjustment
program . The "with program" assumes a considerable increase In the level
of capital flows to an estimated total of about US$2.6 billion for the
period 1987-90, compared to a total of US$1.5 billion In the *without
program' scenario. These exclude debt reachedulings which, under the "with
program' scenario, would be more favorablo and allow the financing of
larger financial gaps. Overall, the difference In new capital flows
between the two sconarios is estimated at about US$1.6 billion for the
1987-90 period. For the most part, the additional resources mobilised
under the policy case would finance additional imports (US$1.4 billion).
The remainder would go to further build up foreign exchange resorves. The
additional foreign exchange to be provided in the form of quick disbursing
flows and expected increase in credit availability to the prlvate sector
would allow both completion of the Investment cycle started in 1986 -
delayed because of the acute foreign exchange shortage experienced from May
1986 onwards - and significant production Increases in the manufacturing
sector.
129.     In terms of economic policies, the "without program" scenario
assumes the full commitment of the Government to continue and deepen Its
program of economic reforms, along with continued stabilisation. The
"without program" scenario assumes no change In the present structure of
the public sector at large and a partial roversal of past liberalization
policies, resulting In increased administrative controls in the allocation
of foreign exchange and In the determination of the exchange rate.



- 43 -
130.    Tho short- and medium-term effects of the Structural Adjustment
Program will depend on the Its timely implementation with the objective of
reestablishing control over the composition of public expenditures and
accelerating the implementation of the PIP. The change Is the composition
of Government expenditures In the next few years is expected to stimulate
domestic demand without creating inflationary pressures. The progress in
resource mobilization as a result of expected Improvements in OFIDA's tax
collection capability, a comprehensive revision of domestic taxes and
required adjustments in parastatal tariffs combined with a strict fiscal
discipline would help reduce the Government deficit. This would be
critical in terms of monetary policy designed to reduce inflation rates
(from 44 percent in 1987 to 15 percent In 1989) and to slow down the rapid
depreciation of the currency.
131.    The 'with program' scenario illustrated In Table 4 highlights for
the period 1987-90 the following pattern of adjustment: On the supply
side, the largest contribution to growth Is expected to come from local
industry, commercial agriculture and construction sector. The expected
improvement In rural are"s of credit availability and road transportation,
accompanied by the increased protection to agricultural production (from
specific anti-dumping measures or from the follow up of tariff reform under
the ISAL) should also stimulate a slight acceleration ln agricultural
sector growth. Both the international environment and structural
constraints limit the growth rate of mining and metal transformation
Industries.
132.    In contrast, tho overall adjustment pattorn of the 'without
program' scenario would be dominated by the export oriented mining secto;,
in the contest of a generalised stagnation of all other sectors and demand
components. Under those circumstances, more expansionary budgetary and
monetary policy would aggravate internal inflation and require increasing
intervention in the area of exchange rate and price controls, further
broadening the importance of black markets and non-official trade.
133.    In the medium- and long-term (1990-95), the Impact of the
Government's adjustment program becomes fully apparent; the new incentive
framework combined with the changes in the composition of government
expenditures and the reform of the structure and organization of the
Zairian economy, should trigger the following changess
(i) a resumption of sustained export growth through increased
diversification, mainly in favor of the non-Gocamines mining sector and
manufacturing;
(ii) a reduction in Import depondency, mainly in the area of agro-
Industrial raw materials and low-income final consumption goods (food and
non-food), allowing an lmport growth of about 3 percent and a GDP growth of
4.1 percent;

(i11) a positive growth In per capita ingcm and consuption
(approximately 1 percot por an) end a more balanced pattern of regiona:
growth resulting from the more rapid growth in agriculture and non-
copper/cobalt. miningl and
(itv) a substantial Lmprovemnt to the level of public services as
Indicated In the projected groth of public consumption (4 percent
annually) following the major incras  of public investuents of the
previous period (1987-90).                       J
134.    The medium- and long-ter  prospects Ir tie 'wth program"
scenario are also characterized by the Increasing importnce of the
private sector, both In terms of domstic saving  (which increase from 5.
to 11 percent of GDP betwee 1990 end 1995) aWn capital formation,
reflectin  the Mprovemnt In busines enviroment ad the consolidation of
the new Incentive framork. The expected progress towards economic
efficiency and export orientation of tho Zairian economy shuld also
generate an Increasing net flow of extornal resources ad accelerate the
repaymnt of Zairian externl debts the current account deficit Is
expected to decline to around US$500 million by 1995, which represents a
decline of about 8 percentage points of 6DP compared to its 1987 level.
135.    The "thout program" scenario would me  muddling through from
ons year to another and contined strain qn the balance of payments and the
budget.  It is clear from the foregoing discussion that without
comprehensive adjustment policlJes the per capita Incomes and consumption
levels would continue to deteriorate through the next decade.
E. Benefits and Risks
136.    The principal risk of the Credits relates to the capacity end
willingness of the Government to implement such a far-ranging program in
Its entirety. The program Is complex, involving a number of sectors and
reqdiring carrying out of studies, development of program and
Implementation of measures In a timely end coordinated manner. Given the
existing institutional weaknesses end shortage of skilled manpower, this
will place a burden on the Government'. techiceal and administrative
capabilities. The provision of a strengthened technical assistance program
through an IDA-assisted parallel Technical Assistance Project for Economic
Management, should help reduce this risk. Other risks of the program
include delays or slippage In completing the studles and analyses
underlying the structural adjustment program which may cause the Government
to postpone critical program decisions. furthermore, the Gavernment
program for privatlzation of public sector enterprises may also encounter
delays due to the continuing wek International conomic environment. An
additional risk Is that adverse reaction on the part of affected parties
with vested Interests in sustaining the remaining distortions may force the
Government to delay Implementation of key elements of the program. The
success of the program faces also the following risks: (i) the vigor of
economic recovery In Zaire's external markets which will determine the
level of foreign exchange earnis  for traditional exports and the ability
of Zairian industries to expand non-traditional exportas (i1) the capacity
of the private sector which ha produce manufaetured goods for protected
markets to -ake the adjustment required to produce competitively for
international markets a"nd (iIi) the levol of national support to carry out



- 46 -
the program, particularly if it proceeds less rapidly than anticipated.
Some of these risks are beyond the Government's and the country's control.
The Government has, however, demonstrated a willingness to take politically
difficult economic actions and its ability to achieve national support.
Zaire is also aware of its critical need of support from the International
community and that the extent and timely availability of the support will
be dependent upon the continued adherence to the implementation of the
reform program.
137.     The principal benefits of the Credits would be to help Improve the
efficiency of resource allocation and help establish Institutions and
policies conducive to growth in investment and production, particularly in
the private sector. The policy measures and incentive framework are aimed
at improving the investment climate for increased domestic and foreign
private sector involvement. The structural adjustmaet assistance vould
help sustain a public investment program based on increasing the export
potential of the country. The proposed Credits would imprvve Zaire's
access to essential Imports needed to support a program of resumed growth
with movement towards balance of payments viability. Continued successful
implementation of the Government's Structural Adjustment Program would also
contribute substantially to improving Zaire's credibility within the
International donor community.
F. Social Impact of the Adiustment Pro*ram
138.    The Structural Adjustment Program is expected to have an overall
positive social Impact for both urban and rural populations, building on
the areas of progress already achieved during the 1983-86 period. While
negatively affected by the rapid increase in prices following the
liberalization and exchange rate measures in 1983, the urban sector has
benefitted substantially from the increased supply of commodities in
official markets and from the increased competition in the distribution
sector which has led to more uniform, and for some agricultural products
declining, real prices. The resurgence of inflationary pressures during
the first quarter of 1987 largely reflected the effects of rapid exchange
rate depreciation--itself largely a function of the substantial decline in
the terms of trade in 1986--and inflation is expected to subside in the
second half of 1987 as foreign exchange availability increases. A second
area of improvement has been with regard to private sector wages, which
since 1982 have arrested their decline (in real terms) and have recaptured
part of the purchasing power lost since 1975. The domestic financial
constraints facing the Government have not permitted similar results with
regard to civil service salaries, although the decline in real wages since
1975 have now been halted; the most recent salary increase (April 1987)
should lessen the impact on civil servants of the recent acceleration in
inflation.
139.     Following the price liberalization in 1983, there has been some
improvement as well in rural living standards. While partly delayed by
lack of information, and the monopoly power of distributors and
transporters, the price liberalization led to increased producer surpluses
In agriculture and, indirectly, in related artisanal activities. The
structural adjustment program should consolidate these results, leading to
increased purchasing power, and a stimulation of the income-generation
process in rural areas.



- 47 -
140.    The major Impact of the structural adjustment program should be
felt in two ways:
(1) the set of measures addressing the major structural
constraints In the Incentive framework and in key sectors (e.g.,
trasportation, financial) will promote further progress towards more
efficient and competitive markets, as well as the reduction of the main
areas of rent in the distr3bution sector. At the same time, the program is
expected to lead to a change in income distribution in favor of wage
earners In the 'official' economy, while reducing the differential
currently benefitting a small group of economic agents arising from their
intermediating and speculating activities. In addition, the program should
help reduce resource leakages feeding the chain of illegal Imports, tax
evasion and corruption. The emphasis on private sector participation
involving small-scale enterprises is also expected to lead to improvements
in income distribution and employment creation. While some increase in
urban unemployment is expected from implementation of the Government's
public enterprise and civil service reform programs, the effects of this
should be largely mitigated by the increased employment opportunities
arising within the modern private sector. Measures to stimulate production
in the agricultural sector are expected to further Improve the incomes of
small-scale farmers and to reduce the gap between rural and urban incomes.
(IL)  the implementation of an effective system of public
investment (and eventually public expenditure) programming will play an
important role in improving the allocation of real resources, especially in
favor of social sectors (health and education) which have been largely
neglected in recent years.
141.    The Government has requested to participate in a UNDP-financed,
Bank-executed project on the social Impact of structural adjustment in
Africa. The objectives of the project are to: (l) strengthen the
institutional capacity of the Government to develop and maintain, In the
framework of Its national accounting systems, adequate statistical data
bases on the social dimension of structural adjustment; (ii) conduct
studies on the socio-economic implications of structural adjustment; and
(iti) reinforce the institutional capacity of the Government to design and
monitor poverty alleviation programs and projects to accompany structural
adjustment programs. A first Bank mission to assess the availability and
needs of statistical information in this area and to determine the scope of
the proposed study will take place in June 1987.
142.    The Government is conscious of the need to take environmental
considerations into account in formulating its public investmuet program.
To facilitate this task, a series of regional studies of environmental
impacts of investment projects will be undertaken, beginning with the Kivu
region.
G. ProMosed Financina
143.     The financing package, totalling US$165 million, would include a
proposed Development Credit of SDR 42.2 million (US$55 million) an African
Facility Credit of SDR 72.2 million (US$94.3 million, all from IBRD



-48 -
Contribution), and Special Joint Financing, including a Japanese Grant of
Yen 1.1 billion (US$7.85 million) and a Japanese Loan of Yen 1.1 billion
(US$7.85 million). Th. SAL Credits would be disbursed in two equal
tranches. The first tranche of US$83 million equivalent Is expected to be
disbursed soon after credit effectiveness. The second tranche of US$82
million equivalent would become av^llable after It has been determined that
satisfactory progress hab been made with respect to continued
implementation of the first phase of the Government's Structural Adjustment
Program, following a review of perfonmance to be carried out by March 1988
and If the conditions mentioned in para. 154 have been met. Disbursements
for the entire credits are expected to be completed within 15 months of
credit effectiveness, ending In December 1988.
144.    The proposed Credits represent 8 percent of Zaire's total import
requirements (goods and non-factor services) over the next twelve months
and would meet about 5 percent of the 1987188 gross external capital
requirements of the country. These Credits are part of a package of
external balance of payments support from the IMF, quick disbursing non-
project financing from bilateral donors at concessional ternms, official
grants and project foreign concessional borrowings.
H. Disbursement. Procurewent. Administrati  and Audittn
145.    The proposed Credits would finance 100 percent of the foreign
exchange cost of eligible Imports against a nogative list, with the foreign
exckange being sold in the inter-bank market at a warket-determined
exchange rate. Disbursements would cover the CIF cost of eligible lmports,
subject to documentary evidence that they had beon paid for on or after
credit signing. Goods not eligiblo for financing liclude alcoholic
beverages, tobacco, precious metals and stones and military equipment. A
list of ineligible imports is provided in Schedules 1 of the Development
Credit and African Facility Credit Agreements. Imports financed by other
sources would also not be eligble for IDA financing. Financing of imports
of petroleum products and foodstuffs would not exceed 25 percent each of
disbursements under the Credits. Invoices of less than US$20,000
equivalent would not be financed.
146.    The Bank of Zaire, the country's Central Bank, would administer
the SAL credit funds, and would be responsible for the coordination and
collection of relevant documentation from the commercial banks and
submission of withdrawal applications and supporting documentation to the
Association to be aggregated Into mounts of not less than US$5 million
equivalent. For expenditures against contracts or purchase orders of less
than US$100,000 equivalent, statements of expenditures would be used.
Associated documentation, including invoicos, would be retained by the
Central Bank for periodic review by IDA. Full documentation would be
required for all other expendituros.
147.     Procurement would be In accordance with Bank procurement
guidelines, except that for the Japanese SJF funds, sources of procurement
would be limited to Part II members of IDA, and Part I members who have
contributed to the Facility or any country which maintains Special Joint



- 49 -
Financing arrangements with IDA. Both private and public sector £mports
would be eligible for financing. Private firms would follow norml
commercial practices in Zaire, involving contracts of less than
US$1,000,000. Contracts amounting to US$1,000,000 or more wuld be
procured by International Competitive BiddV.ng. Direct Imports by
Government would require Internatlonal Competitive Bidding for contracts of
US$1,000,000 or more and three price quotations for goods under
US$1,000,000 to be oligible.  Procurement of goods is to be governed by the
provisions of Schedules 1 to the Development Credit and Africa Facility
Credit Agreements.
148.    In order to facilitate disbursements, three Special Accounts, one
for IDA funds, One for African Facility funds, and one for the Japanese
Grant funds, wuld be established at the Central Bank on terms  nd
conditions satisfactory to IDA. At offectivaness, IDA would asks initial
deposits Into the Special Accounts of U8$15 million for IDA, US$20 million
for African Facility, and US$500,000 for the Japanes Grant. To the extent
possible, proceeds from the African Facility Credit would be disbursed
first. The Special Accounts would be replenished at regular Intervals
against withdrawal applications aggrogated for a inimuam of US$5 million
each. The Special Accounts and the statements of expenditures would be
audited periodically by an independent auditor.
I. Monitorina
149.    The review of implementation undor tbe Structural Adjustment
Program will cover all of the components of the program as well as the
specific conditions to be met for second tranchb release. The objectives
are the restructuring of the economy and achievement of higher economic
growth through policy and institutional reforms and production Incentives.
The program Is fully complementary with the other Bank Group lending in
agriculture, Industry, mining, trasport and energy sectors and with human
resource development objectives. Bank Group projocts in these sectors soek
to support high-return investments. Future projects aro designed to
reinforce the macro, sectoral an institutional reforms accomplished under
the structural adjustment program and translato them Into longer-term
development goals.
150.    The Structural Adjustment Program would be Implemented by the
various Government departments involved In the reform measures, under the
overall responsibility of the Minister of Planning. An Intermtnisterial
Coordination Committee under the chairmanship of the Planning Minister and
an associated Techniecl Secretariat (para. 122) would be responsible for
monitoring the implmaontation of the proposed Credits and of the overall
Structural Adjustsant Program. Because of the heavy demands of thls
program on the capabilities of the Zairian Government and specifically the
Ministries of Planning, Finance and Budget, a Technical Assistance Credit
to support these ministries has been prepared in parallel with the
Structural Adjustment Credits (pares. 1 and 47).
151.    The specific measures supported by the proposed Credits are
described In the Goveramnt's Letter of Development Policy and Annexes. A
detailed program of monitorable actions under the SAL agreed with the



- 50 -
Government concerning the reforms that take place before credit
effectiveness and specific conditions for release of the second tranche, is
described In the policy matrix tables (Attachment 8 to the Statement of
Development Policy), which provides a schedule and Identifies actions to be
monitored during supervision of the proposed structural adjustment program.
152.    The following major actions have already beon taken by .he
Government under the proposed program:
Agreement on a macroeconomic framework for 1987-90, including the
level and composition of the 1987-1990 PIP presented to the CG
meeting (May 1987); establishment of the special account mechanism
in Central Bank to ensure timely availability of domestic
financing of the PIP;
Reestablishment of the market-determined exchange rate system with
weekly fixings;
Adoption of a new mechanism for periodic adjustment of pump prices
of petroleum products to fully reflect exchange rate movements and
maintain real value of petroleum taxes;
Implementation of tariff Increases for the major public
enterprises (ONATRA, SNCZ, REGIDESO) as needed to preserve their
financial soundness;
Agreement to an initial list of public enterprises to be
liquidated or privatized;
Issuance of decree eliminating (i) preferential interest rates for
agricultural credit and CCA tax on agricultural lending and (ii)
requirement of prior central bank authorization for agricultural
and medium and long term lending; agreement on timetable for
eliminating the CCA on interest for other lending;
Consolidation into the central budget and elimination of
earmarking for the special funds for Agriculture and Treasury Fund
No. 1 and elimination of tax and on all agricultural exports
raised for the Fonds Agricole;
Agreement on the four-year program of rationalization of the
tariff structure and implementation of its first phase; and
Agreement on an action program for 1987 for accelerated
maintenance and rehabilitation of rural roads.
153.    The following actions will be required as the conditions of
effectiveness:
Unification of functions of OZAC and OZACAF in the coffee market;
Elimination of the earmarking of the tax on Interest (CCA) and
completion of legal formalities for Integration of the Special
Development Funds in the central budget;



- 51 -
Initiation of formal legal procedures for the liquidation of
Institut Zairois de Management, Centre de Commerce International
and Office National de Logement; and
Completion of the civil service censw and elimination of the
vacant positions from the payrolls.
154.     Disbursement of the second tranche would be contingent upon
satisfactory progress towards the implementation of the overall program
des4ribed in the Letter of Development Policy and taking the following
major actions in a manner satisfactory to the Associations
Revision of macroeconomic framework for 1988-91, Including the
level and composition of the 1988-91 PIP;
Establishment of an oversight structure for supervision of public
enterprises, and the appointment of its Administrator;
Classification of enterprises to be maintained in State portfolio,
liquidated or wholly or partially privatized;
Finalization of a restructuring and reorganization program for
public enterprises remaining in state portfolio; and
Completion of financial and administrative arrangements for the
retirement of eligible public employees.
PART V - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY
155.    Through March 31, 1987, the Association has made 44 credits to
Zaire totalling US$673.25 million and two Special Africa Facility credits
(US$90 million equivalent). The Bank Group has also extended grants
totalling US$400,000 as contributions towards the cost of two planning
assistance projects. The Bank has approved two loans to Gecamines for
mining expansion (1975) and for rehabilitation (1986) projects,
complemented by a Technical Assistance Credit (1983). There have been six
IFC investments in Zaire, the most recent being an investment in TEXAFRICA.
IFC also has a US$1.3 million equity participation in SOFIDE, the
development finance company. Reflecting the development needs of the
country, Bank Group lending has concentrated on physical and social
infrastructure and on institution building, with agriculture accounting for
about 23 percent, transport 29 percent, mining and industry 24 percent,
energy 16 percent and human resources and social sectors 9 percent. Bank
Group lending operations have benefitted from the focus on and close
collaboration with selected agencies in key sectors of the economy which
have received technical and financial assistance fr.-m the Association.
Such involvement included SOFIDE, the development finance company
established in 1970 with IDA and IFC assistance and supported further with
eight credit operations; the major transport agencies (national transport
authority, railways, river and maritime navigation and roads); the national



- 52 -
water supply authority (REGIDESO); the Agriculture Credit Bank (BCA) g the
National Electricity Company (SIlL). The Metals Production Company
(Gecamines) receivod asistance to restructure Its organization and to
prepare a long term rehabilitation and expansion program. Tho Impact of
IDA projects on Institutional development has been slow, but on the whole
positive. The Baik Group has also played a major role In aid coordination
efforts in helping the Government mobilize additional external financing
through Bank-asslsted operatlons.
156.    Disbursement performane and project implementation In Zaire are
in general similar to the rest of Sub-.Sharan Africa. In FY86,
disbursements totalled US$72 million, compared with new comuitmeats of
US$362 million. The average annal disbursement rat. for the sam. period
was 25.3 percent, which Is comparable to the avorage for the Eastorn Africa
Region. While implementation of lank Group projects has been satisfactory
in goneral, the pace of project implementation has been slow, resulting
mostly from institutional, mnpower and managemnt weaknesses and, more
recently, from the economic crisis. In recent years, fiscal constraints
have made timely release of budgetary contributions difficult, particularly
for the implementation of agricultural projects. In addition, lack of
foreign exchange to finance spare parts and fuel, and the deterioration of
the transport network and marketing system have resulted In severe supply
problem for most projocts. Recruiting and retaining skillod and
managerial staff has also been difficult. Institutional weaknesses were
also a factor In slowing earlier project progress, particularly in
transport, education and agriculture.  Given the institutional
strengthening masures under subsequent projects aod efforts by the
Government to improvo budgetary support for IDA-financed projects, overall
project mplementation has improved.
157.    Past lank Group lending has delt with infrastructure and
institutional development needs and policy Issues In specific soctors.
Following the detorioration of the overall economic situation In recont
years, the emphasis of the Bank Group assistanco strategy shifted towards a
more comprehensive approach aimed at helping the Govermaent in Its efforts
to restructure the economy and to effect tbe transition from stabilization
to recovery. In the past three years, the Bank Group has expanded its
assistance for the rehabilitation of productive capacity and infrastructure
while emphasizing the need for economic and fliancial adjustment and
helping to create the institutional foundation for better mangement at the
sectoral and macroeconomic levels. A strengthened economic and sector work
program focused on asslsting the Government develop a realistic
macroeconomic framework and Investment climate for recovery. This
Involvement, at a time of sharply declinng ODA to Zalre, allowed the
Government to maintain the physical base needed for stabilization and led
to substantive improvements in policelos essential for the formulation of
the structural adjustment program.
158.    Bank Group strategy in Zaire Is to help the Government implement
its economic adjustment program while maintaining a viable economic
infrastructure, and to stimulate economic recovery through the pursult of
further broad-based economic reform, increased mtbilization of quick-
disbursing aid and more efficient use of resources, lncluding external



- 53 -
ssistence.  It inclueds operations delgned to strengthen the sectors,
processes, institutions mad public sector agencies uhich would play a major
role In the SAP. The chievemt of thes- objoctives would be sought
through assistance in definition of appropriate sectoral strategies,
creation of Incentives for private sector involvement and emphsis on
activitios that generate or save foreign exchange, complemented by
development of manpower resources and improvemnts in the social and health
conditions of the population.
159.     In keeping with these objectives, ongoing and planned operations
are directed at assisting in the rehabilitation and development of the
agriculture, industry/mining and transport soctors, in part through the
design and bmplem_ntation of further policy and Institutional reforms. The
Bank Group lending support is also assisting the GovernAmet in improving
the management of the education sector, assessing future manpower and human
resource development needs, defining a more suitable policy In the health
and population, water supply and urban sectors, as well as in defining a
regional development strategy. In addition, furthor support is planned for
the energy sector, to develop least cost supply of energy products (mainly
power and petroleum). To ensure that funds &re available for Investment in
priority growth sectors, particularly industry, agroindustry and
agriculture, Bank financing to contemplated for SOFIDE, through follow-up
operations to the ongoing line of credit. A small scale enterprise
operation has recently been approved (PY87) to encourage development of
this subsector. Finally, to ensuro the timely availability of increased
external financing to support the reform progrsm, the lank Group has
assumed the lead In developing consensus among the donors on priority areas
for external support and on increasing the level of coemitments of
development aid to Zaire through the CG mechanism and related donors'
cofinancing meotings for specific soctors.
160.    To implement the poliey analysis and dialogue related to SAL
preparation work, a strengthened economic and sector mork program
contributes to the modium-term objectives of economic recovery and towards
assessing the long-term constraints, options and thoir policy and financial
implications. The majority of the studies are policy-orionted and aimed at
assisting the Government develop a realistic macroeconomic framework and
viable public investment/expenditure program  required for the adjustment
process. Spocific studies focus on helping the Government define sectoral
policies, on defining an external debt management strategy, and on
improving efficiency of resource use and mobilization of domestic and
external resources. Other major studies planned Include an analysis of the
scope and charecteristics of the underground economy and on the social
impact of adjustment. Analysis of issues related to decentralization and
regional/local administration and financing will also be undertaken.
161.    Bank Group financing accounts for about 9 percent of total
external debt outstanding and disbursed and about 5 percent of debt
service. lank Group shere of disbursements of medium and long-term aid to
Zaire from all sources amounted in 1985-86 to about 25 percent.

ANNEX III
REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
STRCTURAL ADJUSTHT PRGRAM
LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
Mr. Barber Conable
President
The World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Presidentt
1.       In response to the deep-rootod economic crisis of the late 1970.
and early 1980s, the Executive Council instituted, in September 1983, a
rigorous economic reform and stabilization program, the essential a[ms of
which were to curb inflation and reduce the public finance and balance of
payments deficits. The cornerstone of this program was reform of the
exchange system. Zaire's currency was made convertible as of the beginning
of 1984 and has been maintained so ever since; almost all restrictions on
Imports have been lifted and most domestic prices have been liberalized;
fiscal discipline has been strengthened; the external and Internal
Imbalances have been substantially reduced while external debt service
payments (after rescheduling) were made punctually through end-1986. To
support and sustain these reforms, the Executive Council introduced an
Interim rehabilitation program (PRINT) for 1983-85. In 1985, the Five-Year
Plan for 1986-90 was drawm up which identified the structural problems of
the economy and spelled out the orientations to be adopted in order to
bring about the needed structural changes.
2.       The Executive Council has also lnstituted a Structural Adjustment
Program designed to remedy the deep-seated problems that continue to hsmper
economic growth. In the first phase of its adjustment program focussing on
the industrial sector launcbed In the course of 1986, and which is
supported by IDA and the Special Facility for Africa, the Council adopted a
new tariff system and revised the Investment Code with a view to
rationalizing the incentive system. In order to extend this structural
reform to other sectors of the economy, the Council has called on the
assistance of the World Bank through a Structural Adjustment Program, and
that of the IMF, through the latter's new Structural Adjustment Facility.
This Statement of Development Policy sets forth and reaffirms.the basic
orientations of the Executive Councll's StrA&ctural Adjustment Program and
provides details of the programs and policies for the key Tectors.
I.       Recent Developments and Present Economic Situation
3.       The stabilization measures undertaken by the Government have
produced positive results In certain areas. Thus, notwithstanding the fall
in world prices for Zaire 'a main export products, the current account
deficit declined from 14 percent of GDP in 1982 to 5 percent in 1986, wiMle



- 60 -
the overall balance of payments deficit was brought down from US$660
million in 1982 to US$535 million in 1986 (SDR 598 million and SDR 455
million equivalent, respectively). Despite the overruns posted at the end
of 1986, the net financing provided by the banking system for the
Government has been reduced from 6.3 percent of GDP In 1982 to 3 percent in
1986.
4.       These positive signs of economic stabilization have not, however,
been accompanied by a sustained recovery of economic growth. Indeed, in
real terms, GDP growth In 1984, 1985 and 1986 lagged behind the rate of
population growth. This disappointing result Is due in part to the
deterioration in Zaire's external terms of trade, the country's significant
external debt service obligations and the low volume of external
assistance, which has remained well below the level expected, and finally,
to the difficulties in formulating appropriate economic policies for
dealing with the structural problems. External debt service payments,
after rescheduling, amounted in 1986 to 25 percent of exports of goods and
services (and nearly half of the State budget). Since up to the end of
1986 Zaire regularly met its debt service obligations under the Paris and
London Club agreements, the volume of imports has had to be severely cut
back, which has adversely affected the productive capacity of the
industrial and agricultural sectors while investment has fallen to a very
low level.
5.       The economy is now in an extremely difficult situation.  The
success of the economic reform program launched in 1983 is threatened by
the lack of foreign exchange. Nearly half of the US$5.6 billion debt has
to be repaid over the next five years, and scheduled debt service payments
will amount to US$1 bi.llon a year on average. In the past, the Zairian
economy has adapted itself to this difficult situation of high debt service
and steady doterioration of, terms of trade by cutting back imports and
holding down investment. IXt the future, however, the restoration of growth
and diversification will necessitate increasing of the volume of both
imports and investments.
II.      Structural Adiustment Proaram: Orientation of Basic Policies
6.       The Executive Council is determined to put the Zairian economy on
a sustained growth path. Whille prudent monetary and budgetary policies
have to be pursued in order to maintain the domestic and external
equilibria, it is vital to boost the production of certain sectors and to
stimulate domestic demand by noninflationary means in order to revitalize
the economy. The Council will accordingly adopt policies to increase the
output and competitiveness of the productive sectors, including encouraging
investment. In this framework, the Executive Council's policy will be to
foster economic Integration, to ensure the efficiency of Import
substitution and to promote exports.
7.       In the short term, recovery of the economy will depend on
increased mobilization of domestic and external resources and improvement
of the mechanisms for their allocation. Zaire's growth strategy will
continue to be based on a large role for the private sector, leaving
productive activities In the private sector, apart from vital public
services and some strategic activities.  To support the privtat sector



- 61 -
activities, the Council has launched a program of public investment in
order to facilitate rapid rehabilitation of the economic infrastructure,
including a program of rehabilitation of rural roads. The Council has
begun to take measures to Improve the institutional framework and refine
the policies for promoting small and medium enterprises, a sector with high
emtloyment-creation potential that has been relatively neglected up to the
present.
8.       Zaire's economic and social development is still hamp-ured by a
number of constraints, particularly In terms of its physical and buman
resources, together with the persistence of a system that encourages
speculative activities to the detriment of productive activities.
Adjustment and growt;s have been severely constraiued by the low degree of
confidence of the private sector, both domestic and foreign, as manifested
by the unwillingness of Zairiens to repatriate their assets from abroad.
The Executive Council's commitment to Implement its Structural Adjustment
Program and the vigor with which it Is implemented will help to lessen the
country's structural constraints and to enhance Its credibility with a view
to attracting the capital flows needed.
9.       The objectives of the Structural Adjustment Program are to ensure
economic growth (a minimium of 3.5 percent pet annum, In real terms, over
the coming three years with a significant incres"e in the 1990s), to raise
the population's living standards, to bring about over the medium term a
reduction of the external financing requirements and to increase the
country's ability to meet its exiernal obligations. The achievement of
these objectives will require a concerted effort on the part of Zaire and
the international communty. As far as Zaire itself is concerned, the
economic policies descrioed in this statement and which form the basis of
its Structural Adjustment Program are necessary to alleviate the internal
constraints in the medium term and to lay the bases for sustained economic
development over the long torm.  On the other hand, in order for the
productive sectors to be able to respond quickly to these policies, a
considerable inflow of external resources will be needed immediately to
rehabilitate and restructure the country's productive base and
infrastructure.
10.      In all of its activities, the Government is concerned with the
need to preserve the quality of the environment. To facilitate this task,
a number of regional studies focussing on the impact of economic
development on the environment will be undertaken, beginning with the Kivu
region.
Price Policies
11.      The Executive Council will continue to apply its policy of price
liberalization and will ensure a uniform interpretation of the
liberalization measures in the different regions of the country, especially
as regards agricultural products. Should It prove necessary to correct any
imperfections In the market leading to excessive p1Fices for some products,
this will be done by means of measures to increase, competition or by
strengthening the tax system, rather than by introducing ex-ante or 1X:ggst
price controls. The Government will also continue its efforts to



- 62 -
rationalite pricing poliieos of the public enterprises. Furthermore, in
ord{r to fully cover the C08t of Importing oil products and to maintain the
real value of the petroleum tax revenues, periodic adjustments will be made
in the pump prices of petroleum products.
External Sgettr Policy
12.      In order to ensure optimum foreign exchange allocation, the
Executive Council will maintain a free exchange system with a market-
determined rate. This policy constitutes a determining factor in the
development of nontraditional exports and effective Import substitutes.
The Government will Improve the functioning of the inter-bank foreign
exchange market and seek transp4rency in the rates offered to customers.
In this regard, foreign exchange provided by the SAL and other cofinanciers
will be sold at the Inter-bank market.
13.      In order to improve the profile of the external public debt, the
Executive Council intends to strictly limit its recourse to borrowing on
non-conoes*ional terms. An annual oeiling for commitments of all non-
concessional borrowing will be determined and revised in line with the
macroeconomic framework, each year during the annual review of the PIP with
the Bank. For 1987, these commitments, excluding export-oriented mining
projects, will be limited to US$15 million (SDR 12 million equivalent). In
addition, the Council will introduce a program of incentives to encourage
some external creditors to convert a part of this debt into equity in the
privatized public enterprises and idle plantations. The Council will also
take steps to stimulate the inflow of private capital by, among other
things, progressively reducing the remaining restrictions on current
account transactions. In view of its concerns regarding the evolution of
the terms of trade, the Council intends to progressively increase the level
of foreign exchange reserves in order to prevent excessive exchange-rate
fluctuations.
Budgetarv and Fiscal Pollicis
14.      It is recognized that prudent budget management will be pursued in
the years ahead because of the external debt situation and the need to
avoid inflationary financing of the State budget. In the short term, the
Governmeat intends to seek the rescheduling of the debt for 1987 and the
following years effected in such a way as to bring about a significant
eassng of the pressures affecting the budget. In ordor to significantly
wagment the mobilization of domestic resources, the Government has began to
take me"aures to increase the efficiency of collection of tax and customs
revenues, rationalize exemptions and consolidate parafiscal revenues In the
budget. Steps will slso be taken to continue the uniformization of customs
tariffs and to. reform taxation by focussing it much more on consur'ption,
property and incom chan on production and by enlarging its base. A
detailed description of the Government's tax reform program is presented in
Attacbnent 3.
15.     As regards public expenditure, the Executive Council will continue
to follow its prudent policy and will maintain strict fiscal discipline.
In this regard, and also to improve the transparency of the Government's
accoutts, budgetary control mechanisms will be strengthened. Since the



- 63 -
wage bill cannot be permitted to rise faster than budgetary revenues, real
wag, increases In the civil service will be linked to rationalization of
employment in the context of global reform of the sector. This reform
program, described in Attachment 5 to this declaration, will include
reduction of the number of civil service personnel through elailnation of
fictitious personnel, attrition, voluntary retirements and resignations
over a period of several years, and will also include a review of
remuneration policies with a view to rationalizing wage differences by
means of productivity and performance bonuses, while taking increaoss in
the cost of living into consideration.
16.     As is set forth in detail in Attachment 2, the Executive Council
has prepared a Public Investment Program (PIP) covering the period 1987-90,
which is to be transformed into a rolling three-year program and revised
each year in light of the progress of project execution and the constraints
imposed by the macroeconomic framework. The PIP for 1987-90, which builds
upon the PIP for 1987-89 approved at the April 1986 meeting of the
Consultative Group, places the emphasis on rehabilitation of infrastructure
and consists of projects whose economic justification has been
demonstrated. For those projects with consideration other than economic
justification, total expenditures will be limited to a ceiling to be agreed
during the annual PIP reviews. For 1987, this ceiling will be Z 1.5
billion. The 1987 tranche of the 1987-90 PIP involves an expenditure level
of Z 54 billion at current prices. About two-thirds of the financing is
expected to come from the disbursement of external loano and grants. The
remainder would come from the Investment Budget and the financial savinpg
of the parastatals. In order to ensure full funding and execution of the
PIP, the Government will ensure that the parastatals are allowed to make
tariff adjustments to cover their Investment expenditures. The Government
will also ensure that Z 5 billion alloated for the Investment Budget will
be disbursed in a tlmely manner. In this regard, the Ministry of Planning
will assume the responsibility for the financial execution of the
Investment Budget. The external financing for the PIP projects will be
contracted solely on concessional terms, with the exception of certain
projects of the public enterprises for which financing on nonconcessional
terms will be strictly limited (see para. 13).
Financial Sector Policy
17.      In the financial sector, the policies followed will be ained at
boosting the mobilization of resources for the financing of the economy and
will be applied in the context of a monetary policy that will to prevent
further deterioration of the external current account deficit beyond 1987
and to bring the rate of inflation down from 45 percent in 1986 to 15
percent in 1989. In order to encourage growth of production, the
proportion of credit allocated to the private sector will have to be
progressively increased. The basic structure for an interbank money
market, which will facilitate bank intermediation and competition and
strongthen market-determined interest rate system, has also been
established.
18.      The Executive Council Is also studying ways to improve the
efficiency of the financial sector, as described in Attachment 4. In this
context, it Intends to strengthen the supervision of the comercial banks



- 64 -
(including Improved auditing of accounts) in order to ensure that the banks
are taxed appropriately and that the competition among them is
strengthened. Measures will also be taken to Itprove the functioning of
credit markets, together with liberalisation of interest rates on
agricultural credits, elimination of categories within lending ceilings,
the phasing out of the turnover tax (CCA) on interest, and further
development of the interbank money market. Finally, the Executive Council
will take steps to enhance the effectiveness of the nonbank financial
institutions specializing in attracting savings.
Public Enterprises
19.      In line with Zaire's growth strategy, based on the dynamism of the
private sector for the development of productive activities, the Government
intends to rationalize the public enterprise sector. To this end, some of
the enterprises concerned will be privatized and others will be
restructured to make them more functional and competitive in the market,
while others that are inherently unprofitable will be liquidated. The
Government's reform program for the public enterprises is presented in
detail in Attachment 1 to this letter.
20.      As regards the enterprises that will be retained In the State's
portfolio, there will be a general liberalization of markets and removal of
monopolies, special protections and other exemptions. In addition, the
existing system of oversight and control, together with the entire
relationship between the State and the enterprises, will be reviewed to
give enterprise management greater autonomy and more responsibility. The
Executive Council will also strengthen the management and a vosteriorl
control of enterprises by stipulating that they use outside auditors and
developing the training of nationals in the audit profession. Public
enterprises will be required to contribute to the budget by paying taxes
and dividends. Explicit state subsidies will only be made available to
them in exceptional circumstances.
agriculture Policy
21.      Positive results have already been achieved in the agriculture
sector, as a result of the price liberalization policy followed since 1981.
As specified in the Five-Year Plan, the division of responsibilities in
agriculture between the private soctor and the state has been clearly
spelled out. The State's role in this sector will consist of developing
and upgrading the infrastructure, promoting agricultural research, setting
up guidance mechanisms for agricultural production through extension
services and establishing a favorable investment climate, whereas the
private sector will be engaged in production. A detailed description of
agriculture policy is presented in Attachment 6 to this letter.
Policy on Transport Sector
22.      Notwithstanding the efforts made since the mid-1970s, the
perfonmance of the transport sector remains unsatisfactory. This is
reflected both in the deterioration of physical Infrastructure of the
transport network and in the decline In transport volumes since the 1970s.



- 6.5 -
23.      The measures included in the Structural Adjustment Program
regarding the transport sector comprise:
(i)    Reorientation of the strategy of ONATR&, SNCZ and OR,, icluding
decentralization and selective reorganization, simplification
of structures, and progressive disengagement from certain
activities for ONATRA and SNC2;
(il)    Immediate steps to restore the financial situation of ONATRA,
SNCZ and the Office des Routes (OR) in order to Improve their
performance and ensure execution of the programs under way.
Review of the rate structures of SNCZ and ONATRA based on
analysis of their costs and sound commercial management;
(tit)   Improvement of transport planning, strengthening of
coordination and formulation of sector policies through GET;
and
(lv)    Commencement of a program to laprove rural roads In an
appropriate institutional framework utilixing by priority
easily mobilizable existing means (OR for management and
economic operators and local authorities for execution) under
the supervision of the regional and rural development
authorities.
III.     Composition of the Structural Adlustment Proarga
24.      The fundamental orientations of the Executive Council's Structural
Adjustment-Program have been described above. The detailed policy
statements for the key sectors and their execution schedules are presented
in the following attacbmentas
1.  Public Enterprises
2.   Public Expenditure Programming
3.   Fiscal Reform
4.   Financial Sector Policy
5.   Civil Service Reform
6.   Agriculture Policy
7.   Transport Sector Policy
8.   Policy matrix tables (programs of action, and calendar).
IV.      External Financing Requirements
25.      The balance of payments projections for 1987 and beyond give rise
to concern, particularly on account of the uncertainties as to future
prices for Zaire's main exports. Although the Government's objective is to
achieve a faster growth of nontraditional exports, their impact on the



- 66 -
balance of payments in the medium term will re_min modest. To allow the
adjustment process, real growth of imports of goods are projected at an
annual rate of 3 percent. Taking into consideration the tariff reform in
progress that is designed to Improve the structur of imports, the
projected increase represents the minimum necessary to permit real GOP
growth of 3.5 percent per year during the 1987-89 period.
26.      Even with the modest objectives, the current account deficit (not
including official transfers) is expected to jump from US$610 million
(SDR 520 million equivalent) in 1986 to US$963 million (SDR 764 million
equivalent) in 1987 and to remain at about that level through 1990. Taking
into account scheduled payments, together with the need to increase foreign
exchange reserves, annual external financing requirements over the period
would average approximately US$1.8 billion (SDR 1.4 billion equivalent).
About half of this could be covered by grants and loans already committed
on the basis of disbursements programmed by bilateral and multilateral
agencies. Other possible sources of financing include the IMF's Structural
Adjustment Facility and the purchases under the Stand-by Arrangement from
the IMF. The remaining financing gap would amount to US$850 million
(SDR 675 million equivalent) per year over 1987-90, which should be covered
by a combination of debt reechedulings and new commitments from the donor
community. Mobilization of additional external resources is accordingly a
prerequisite to enable Zaire to carry out its public investment program, on
the one hand, and to permit the private sector to perform its role as
principal promoter of future economic growth. A major reorganization of
the debt, Including both rescheduling at exceptional terms and other
arrangements, will also be necessary to oase the pressures on both the
balance of payments and the State budget.
V.       Monitoring of the Structural Ad-iustment Program
27.      During the preparation of the Structural Adjustment Program the
Executive Council formed an Interdepartmental Committee, chaired by the
Prime Minister, with a Technical Secretariat headed by the Minister for
Planning. This committee will continue its work in the future and will be
responsible for: (a) monitoring and evaluating the progress of the reforms
under way and their Impact on tne economy; (b) the preparation and drafting
of recommendations for future structural adjustment measures; and (c)
liaison with the World Bank and other donors for periodic reviews of the
progress of the Structural Adjustment Program.
VI.      Conclusion
28.      As you can see, Mr. President, Zaire has made considerable efforts
both to promote private investment and to improve management of Piblic
sector resources. These efforts ought to be continued. However, the
combination of deteriorating terms of trade and Insufficient resource
transfers has aggravated the already precarious situation of the basic
equilibria. It is thus necessary to increase the level of resocrces
available in order  o cope with the uncertainties and at the same tim
ensure the level of growth desired. In addition, mechanisms for evaluating
the program will have to be established that take into consideration the
factors that are beyond Zaire's control, in order to strengthen
consultation and coordination.

POLICY STATEMENT ON PUBLIC ENTERPRISES
Backtground
1.       The public enterprise sector in Zaire prodominates In ruch
essential sectors of the economy as mining, energy and transportation, as
well as in other traditional sectors like public services and
conmunications. Public enterprises account for 38 percent of GDP, over 80
percent of export earnings and 85 percent of total public investment. The
involvement of the public sector in agriculture and industry Ls, however,
extremely limited.
2.       Despite their importance In the economy, the contribution of the
public enterprises to goverrment revenue has been poor. While accounting
for more than two-thirds of the outstanding external debt, public
enterprises contribute very little to service payments on external debt,
which are largely covered by the central government's budget.
3.       There have been several attempts in the past to rationalize the
sector, vith varying degrees of success. Despite these attempts, the
disappointing performance of the sector stems from both endogenous factors
(institutional setting, poor management) and exogenous factors (the
international economic environment, declining export prices, etc.). For
instance, the oxisting Institutional framework and the division of labor
between the supervising ministries has made it very difficult to introduce
and monitor performance evaluation criteria. Legally defined 'public
enterprises' cover a wide range of entities, some of which are entirely
commercial while others are agencies providing public services. The
interplay of these factors results in a plethora of controls which fails to
maintain any real coordination, and a degree of weakness in the agencies
responsible for designing and evaluating projects that undermines the
investment planning and programming process.
Government Ob oectives
4.       The Government's strategy for the sharing of economic
responsibilities between the Government and the private sector is clearly
defined. For its part, the State will focus on rehabilitating and
upgrading essential infrastructure, while the private sector will be
engaged in production. For the public enterprises, the essential objective
of the Structural Adjustment Program is to rationalize the state's
involvement in the economy, through selective closures, disengagement, and
by increasing the role of the private sector.
Action Program
5.       The Government's public enterprise reform effort will follow four
major directionst



- 68
(a)      clear identification of those enterprises providing publc
services that are administrative In nature, and their removal from
the State portfolio;
(b)     privatisation of certain activities which are currently the
exclusive domain of public onterprisos.
(c)      liquidation of all public enterprises ln the productive sector
that show no prospects for being economically and financially
viable.
(d)      for those enterprises remaining in the State portfolio,
implementation of the following actions, designed to improve their
economic effectiveness:
(i) improve the institutional and legal framework In which they
operate by clearly defining their responsibilities in the spheres-
of supervision, goal setting, policies to be applied, State aid,
staffing and incentives, and by adopting a sound legal definition
that distinguishes them clearly from agepcies providing public
services of an admianlstrative naturel
(ii) strengthen tho system of financial control. I vosterioir by
requiring each enterprise to Introduce regular accounting
procedures and to submit Its accounts annually for examistion by
external auditor.
(iII) reorganize financially, technically and managerially those
enterprises that are essentially viable but currently incapable of
functioning effectively because of internal obstacles;
(iv) Improve the management effectiveness of enterprises by
changin% the rules and procedures of recruitment and compensation
and by giving managers more freedom of action within the
institutional and legal framework described above;
(v) elimiaste the special privileges and specific exemptions now
available to enterprises operating In competitive sectors (e.g.
special protection against foreign and domestic competition, legal
monopolies, special tariffs, etc.); and
(vi) rationalize the financial situation of the parastatal
sector, including settlement of cross-claims.
6.       Implementation of this strategy as a whole cannot be undortaken
until after detailed study, one of the principal results of which will be
to enable the State to determine with greater accuracy what economic impact
the activities of the public enterprises have, and to fonmulate possible
alternatives   The Executive Council has commissioned a UNDP-financed,
Bank-executed study, to be conducted by local and foreign consultants
working in conjunction with the Ministry of the Portfolio and the
parastatal sector, which will carry out a systematic review of the present
position, financial flows and cross-claims of the public enterprises, and
identify the changes that need to be mnde in their overall management.



- 69 -
7.      This study will also make It possible to classify the enterprises
according to whother they should be privatised or liquidated, to formulate
recommeandations for the reorganization and restructuring of those retained
in the state portfolio, and to design Information oystem  that can be
relied upon to undertake the reform of the sector.
a.      A team, comprised of staff frvom both the Portfolio Department and
the Permsnent Council of Accounting (CPCZ) has been working since the
beginning of the second quarter of 1987. The toam' main goal is to carry
out an initial evaluation of the capital asiets of public enterprises in
ordor to determine their value, as well as to fix in a realistic way their
social capital by Presidential Decree, thus resolving the judieial void
that has existed so far in this sector.
9.       In addition, the Portfolio Dpeprtment is curtently classifying
public enterprises In terms of the criteria of profitability and their
contribution to the budget, taki   lnto account tho performance and
remuneration of staff and managers. Thls classlfication will constitute an
Incentive system for staff and managers of enterprises who, through their
performance efforts, will be able to upgrade tho productivity of their
respective enterprises, and their own remunerations, as a consequenco

POLICY STATEMENT ON
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROGRAMMING
Backaround
1.      The programming, budgeting and execution of the public investment
proLram (PIP) In Zaire are now in a transitional phase. The major development
thrusts in the country and the critical role of public investment in ensuring
the transition from stabilization to economic recovery have been formulated in
the framework of the first Five-Year Plan (1986-1990), promulgated in the form
of a law on January 1, 1986. In order to translate the Plan into implementable
programs, reflecting the availability of both domestic and external resources,
the Executive Council prepared a three-year priority public investment program
(PIP) for 1987-89, which constitutes the first segment of the Five-Year Plan.
An earlier version of the PIP, which was approved at the meeting of the
Consultative Group in April 1986, represented a significant improvement over
preceding investment programs, particularly as regards its realistic approach,
choice of projects, sectoral policies and macroeconomic consistency. However,
the magnitude of debt service, which constrains the budgetary resources
available for investment by the State, serious flaws in methodology and the
weakness of the institutions responsible for fonmulating and implementing the
PIP continue to handicap its Implementation. Like the public investment
programs which preceded it, the 1986 tranche of the 1986-89 PIP wms largely
under-implemented.
2.       The principle of investment programming In all departments In Zaire is
that the investment program should give priority to projects under way and only
then to the launching of new projects. This approach assumes, however, that (i)
the financial and physical progress of current projects is sufficiently
monitored; (it) the cost of new projects is estimated correctly; (iiI) the
Government regularly finances a portfolio of projects that have been properly
selected on the basis of their economic and financial viability and (iv)
criteria for selection among new concurrent projects are established. These
conditions are not always met. In some sector departments, project monitoring
is at an embryonic stage and the Ministry of Planning, which coordinates the
monitoring of the PIP as a whole, is barely beginning to set up the mechanisms
needed for realistic monitoring. The information system has not been organized
in the technical departments or the Ministry of Planning in order to allow for
regular updating of data on projects and programs. With limited exceptions,
annual projections of capital expenditures outside the investment budget (budget
dWinvestissement--BI) are still done very Irregularly. The estimated cost of
projects included in the PIP are all too often based on very approximate
calculations. At times the selection of new projects is not consistent with
clearly defined criteria.  Moreover, owing to a limited capacity for analysis,
the role of arbiter that the Ministry of Planning and sector departments should
play is weak as regards public enterprise investments, which represent nearly
three-fourths of the PIP.
3.       Consistent programming of the funds made available under the BI and the
requirements of the three-year investment program still leave a 8reat deal to be



- 71 -
desired. The procedures for formulating the PIP and BI are different and the
three-year program is not yet recognized as a constraint for the budget. The
approved BI is not a final authorization of expenditures, since the allocation
of resources by project is not always in line with initial plans and because
projects not included in the PIP can appear in investment budgets. In addition,
non-respect for BI credit allocations which involve local counterparts for
external financing ultimately prevents a share of available external resources
from being mobilized. In addition, the implementation of the PIP is slowed down
by the cumbersome procedures for expenditures under the BI (commitment of
expenditures and procurement).
Obiectives
4.       In order to stimulate economic growth, the Executive Council wishes to
improve the selection and implementation of public development projects. To
this end, it wishes to:
(i) Institutionalize beginning with the PIP 1987-90 a rolling three-
year public investment program which will be revised annually. The rolling
three-year PIP will Include all investment projects involving State financing,
namely the investments by the Government and all investments by public or quasi-
public enterprises;
(ii) Ensure, through an appropriate mechanism, consistency between the
BI and PIP; it will define and implement a mechanism that ensures that the
implementation of the BI as defined in the PIP is accorded priority;
(iii) Enable public enterprises to take the necessary measures to
ensure the self-financing of projects it has agreed to include in the PIP, in
particular as regards ccunterpart funds committed in the loan agreements it
signs or guarantees;
(iv) Strengthen the programming capacity of the Ministry of Planning
and sector departments;
(v) Minimize the cost of borrowings to finance the PIP.
Proposed Measures
5.       (i) The Executive Council will revise the rolling three-year PIP
annually. The Plf will include all public investment projects and list their
sources and budgetary and off-budget means of financing so that the planned
expenditures are compatible with realistic projections of resources. The
projects included in the PIP should be documented as completely as possible and
will be selected on the basis of criteria and guidelines used for all projects
including, where possible, cost-benefit analysis. To this end, the Government
will decide on the methods and procedures to be used in formulating the three-
year rolling PIP, ensuring the consistency between the PIP and the 8I;
(ii) The PIP will be finalized in consultation with the World Bank in
view of the implementation of current projects, three-year macroeconomic and
resource projections, and the quality of new projects. The Government agrees to
consult with the World Bank on any changes in a given year of the PIP. The
1987-1990 PIP updated by the Government and discussed with the World Bank has



- 7_ -
been distributed to the donors and agreed on at the meeting of Consultative
Group hold on May 21-22, 1987.
(iii) The PIP focuses on the rapid rehabilitation of infrastructure, in
particular In the agriculture, water, tel.communications, education and health
sectors. The PIP projects in these sectors are justified from the economic
standpoint. Capital expenditures for other projects not Included in these
sectors will not exceed a ceiling to be set each year during the annual review
of the PIP. For 1987, that ceiling will be Z 1.5 billion.
(iv) In order to ensure the most advantageous financing of the external
component of the PIP, the Executive Council, with the support of its foreign
partners, will systematically seek to obtain grants or loans on concessional
terms. Loans on non-conceasional terms will be s"cured only as a Ist resort
and in special cases. An annual celling for cammitments under r-n-coacessional
loans will be determined and revised each year durlng the annua review of the
PIP so that It is consistent with roallatic macroeconomic projections. For
1987, such comitments, excluding export-oriented projects In the mining sector,
will not exceed US$15 million.
(v) The Executive Council will take the necessary measures for the
timely impllmentation of the PIP. It will be disseminated as rapidly and widoly
as possible in the form of a circular letter sent by the Prime Minster to the
Ministers responsible for PIP mplementation as well as the President and
Managing Directors of the major public enterprises, requesting them to respect
PIP priorities for the projects for which they are responsible. The PIP will be
attached as an annex to that letter, accompanied by a summary of program
implementation for the preceding year, as well as a brief document explaining
the macroeconomic, sectoral and financial framework of the PIP and the
priorities to which its main projects and program respond. The Executive
Council agrees that projects included In the priority program be given priority
in the allocation of resources under the BI.
(vi) The Executive Council will take the necessary moesures to improve
the monitoring and follow-up the financial status of the projects included in
the BI on a quarterly aid annual basis and for all projects included in the PIP;
the physical progress of projects will be monitored at least once a year.
(vii) The appropriations In the BI will be paid in four equal
disbursements Into a special account opened with the Bank of Zaire. This
acccmnt will be managed on the basis of a mechanism to be formulated, by the
Ministry of Planning.
(viii) The public enterprises will ensure counterpart financing In
local currency to allow timely disbursements of their external borrowings or
borrowings secured on their behalf by the State to the extent they are capable,
on the basis of self-financing, In particular through rational pricing and
tariff policies.
(ix) The Government will begin to develop public expenditure programs
for selected sectors (agriculture, education and health), iAcluding Investment
and current expenditures, in order to promote the development strategy for those
sectors.



- 73 -
(x) The Government will decide on the means of operation and plan of
action for the study fund which Is to replace the pre-investment fund.

ATTACHMENT 3
POLICY STATEMENT ON FISCAL REFORM
I. Bagkaround
1.      A basic concern of the Five-Year Economlc and Social Development
Plan is the preparation of a monetaryt financial and fiscal policy for
promoting private investment. The macroeconomic environment for
enterprises must therefore Improved so as to favor growth and Investment,
and the Executive Council must urgently mobilize additional resources in
order to tackle the budget deficit, thus preventing budgetary pressures
from leading to an excessive reduction in public expenditure. With regard
to taxation, a systematic analysis confirms the presence of several types
of economic and technical distortions, considerable Institutional and
administrative weaknesses, and the lack of effective monitoring mechanisms.
More specifically, the following shortcomings can be identifieds
-   Until the adoption of the tariff reform lu August 1986, the system
of customs duties was providing a high degree of protection for
industry, and a very low degree of protection for agriculture and
agroindustry. At the same time, no correction mechanism was
available to protect the economy from subsidized goods dumped from
the International market. hile progress has been made to reduce
the variations in protection accorded to different Industries, the
customs duty system still provides for a large number of
exceptions (e.g. DPT, CKD, MMD and under provisions of the
Investment Code) all of which favor industries generating
relatively little domestic value added. Despite the efforts
undertaken by the Executive Council for reducing export taxes,
several problems remain, notably as regards parafiscal charges
(e.g., agricultural products). As a whole, the fiscal system
still conflicts with development objectives, notably export
diversification, food self-sufficiency, and economic integration.
-  As regards domestic taxation, numerouq distortions and
contradictions arise from the multiplicity of supplementary taxes
levied under the various public budgets, whose number has rapidly
increased over the last few years. The Impact of these taxes on
the economy is especially harmful because many of them are applied
to the same base. In addition, the dispersion of tax authority
hinders efforts towards rationalization of budgetary options and a
better definition of priorities.
-  Despite its considerable potential for generating substantial
revenues without creating disincentives to production activities,
the turnover tax (CCA) has not provided the desired results for
the following reasonst
(i) Despite the harmonisation undertaken in July 1986, the
coordination between CCA rates (domestic and import) and
excise taxes remains incomplete. The tax bases of different



- 75 -
CCA rates are not fully harmonized and exulse duties, by
virtue of their specific nature, are toither indexed to
inflation, nor linked to the CCA in order to detwnmin. a
rational tax structure.  As a result, the s,stew appears
complicated, limiting its administrative applicability end
reducing substantially its revenue potential.
(ii)  KEfforts to collect CCA are concentrated ou a few large
enterprises, without any reasonable attempt being 'ade to
enforce payment by small- and mediu=-scale enterprises.
(iii) There is a tendency to increase rates in order to compensate
for inefficient tax collection.
(iv) No deductions are allowed, resulting in a cascading
taxation, particularly negative on industrial production.
- Added to all these problems is the lack of a system of inflation
accounting, introducing other types of distortion In company
taxation, penalizing the rehabilitation of existing plants and
creating an incentive to evade taxes.
2.       These distortions are aggravated by weaknesses la the tax
administration, and by the Inconsistencies and complications of the priseLt
tax legislation:
Mi) customs collection affected by fraud and smuggling and with
tax collection facing considerable problems;
(ii) there is no effective application of legal mechanism for
harmonizing the various parts of tax legislation at the
central level, and the monitoring mechanisms are weak.
Obiectives of Fiscal Reform
3.       Fiscal policy and administration must be progressively and
systematically revised In order to solve these complex problems. In
particular, the Government seeks, through its Structural Adjustment P.ogram
to improve resource mobilization and its administration by redi:cing
distortions, and by improving the distribution of fiscal and parafiscal
charges. In the short-torm, the fiscal component of the Structural
Adjustment therefore aims to Identify a series of corrective measures
which: (i) are the most urgent necessary to limit the adverse effects of
taxation on economic development; (IL) can be implemented rapidly; and
(MiL) are coherent with the long-term objectives of the fiscal re%Mors.
II.      ACTION PROGRAM
A. Fiscal Reform Procedures
4.       In order to provide a firm foundation for the fiscal reform
process, the Executive Council will submit all fiscal reform pv*poaale to
the appropriate bodies, particularly the Legislative Council, for their
examination.



- 76 -
B. Establishment of Uniform Customs Duties
5.       As implemented under the Industrial Sector Adjustment Program, the
next stage of fiscal reform consists of the following measures:
- adoption of the plan for the gradual uniformization of customs
duties resulting in a miniumum level of 20 percent and a maximum
of 40 percent by 1990 according to the following schedules
July 1                   Minimum              Maximum
1987                     102                 50%
1988                     10%                 45%
1989                     152                  40%
1990                     202                 40%
The minimwm tariff of 10% will be extended to agricultural and
food products (see attachment on agriculture).
- the establishment of an adjustment mechanism to protect the
Zairian economy against the effects of dumping or subsidized
international markets; this mechanism will be designed on the
basis of the ongoing study on the competitiveness of selected
agricultural products and on the appropriate nature for such a
mechanism. The criteria for application of this anti-dumping
protection (list of products, time horizon1 etc.) will be defined
in consultation with the Bank in order to assure its consistency
with the objectives of the overall tari_.; reform.
- revision of the conditions for exemption and redefinition of
criteria to extend preferential treatment (regimes privilegies),
in order to increase their economic efficiency and bring them more
closely into line with development objectives. By June 1987, the
number of import tariff exemptions under DPT (Dispositions
Preliminaires aux Tarifs des Droits d'Entree) should go from 272
to 136. Moreover, by December 1987, the Investment Commission
will be restructured and the extensicn of exemptions under the
Investment Code strictly limited.
C. Institutional Measures
- Establishment by the Minister for Finance of an
interdepartmental committee for implementing the tax and
parafiscal reforms over a 30-month period.
- Strengthening of the Study Department of the Ministry of
Finance, allowing it to serve as the Technical Secretariat for the
above-mentioned interdepartmental committee. Among other tasks,
this Department will prepare periodic progress reports on the
Implementation of fiscal reforms.
- Strengthening the Tax Revenue Delartment (Direction des
Contributions), in order to assure the coherence of reforms. For
this purpose, the Government will prepare, by September 1987, a



- 77 -
three-year program to be also financed with external assistance,
in order to achieve the following objectivess
- expand the Department's analytical capacity for preparing
economic and legal studies;
- prepare a program to enable taxpayers to have recourse
against government agencies for arbitrary actions;
- strengthen the Department's human and material resources by
improving the qualifications and motivation of its staff and
providing them with adequate resources for data gathering and
processing; and rationalizing procedures for classification,
analysis and inspection;
- restore the powers and capacity of its Regional Divisions.
- The program for rehabilitating OFIDA will be continued with EEC
assistance, the purpose being to Improve excise collection.
D. Tax and Customs Codes
6.       Fiscal legislation and regulations will be revised and combined
into a Tax Code and Customs Code which will be kept up-to-date. Funding
for printing and disseminating them widWely is to be planned.
E. Strengthening Budaetarv and Parliamentary Control
7.       AUl government tax and parafiscal revenue, whether accruing to the
Ministry of Finance, other agencies of the Executive Council or the
decentralized agencies, will be increasingly integrated into the general
budget process, so that it can be systematically brought under the control
of the Legislative Council, the Court of Auditors, and other monitoring
mechanisms. The following funds will also be consolidated into the general
budget:
-   Special Treasury Fund No. 1;
-   the Energy Security Fund;
-   the Tourism Promotion Fund.
8.       As regards the Fonds de, Convention de Developpement (FCD), the
Executive Council will legally confirm that, although it forms part of the
CCA system, its resources are no longer earmarked to the Secretariat of the
FCD.
F. Reduction of Emport Taxes
9.       The number of parafiscal charges will be progressively reduced:
-   An action plan will be jointly prepared by the Ministry of
Finance and the Ministry of External Trade, and the Executive
Council will consolidate the activities of OZAC and OZACAP
with respect to coffee, thus reducing their levies.



- 78 -
-    Effective July i, 1987, the Executive Council Intends to
eliminate the tax on agricultural exports, revenue from which
is paid into the Agricultural Fund (Fonds Agricole).
G. Elimination of all Property and Administrative Taxes Producint
Martinal Revenue and of Doubtful Usofulness
10.      In order to simplify the fiscal system, the Governmont will
reexamine the following taxes perceived by different ministries and, by
September 1987, will issue the list to be either abollshed or consolidated
effective January 1988:
Ministry of Justices
-    tax on registration in the Register of Commorc;
-    tax on company capital increases.
Ministry of the Environment and Real Estate:
-   certificate of approval for restaurants;

Ministry of Public Health and Social Affairst
-   taxes on the establishment of pharmacies, hospitals and
dispensaries;
-    certificate of health-care provider;
-    tax on the import of pharmaceutical products;



- 79 -
-    taxos planned for FONAMES.
Ministry of the National Economy and Industrys
-    tax on company identification numbers.
H. Extension of the Scoue of the CCA sad Introduction of a Tax Creditin*
System
11.      By the end of September 1987, a Committee of Experts under the
coordination of the Ministry of Finances will define a strategy and the
general lines of a medium term action plan in order to:
-    extend the applicability of CCA to Include all excise taxes;
-    establish a tax crediting system for the CCA.
I. Small and Meuium-Scale EnteErnises: Taxation and Forfeitina
12.     A unit will be established in the Ministry of Finance (Department
of Tax Revenue) to be responsible for strengthening and inproving the
administration of the CCA and CCR with respect to small and medium-scale
enterprises. To this end, the Department of Tax Revenue has presented an
action plan in May 1987, to be execured in 1988.
J. Excise Taxes
13.     Ad valorem duties will be introduced to replace the current
specific taxes applied to individual goods (i.e. beer, mineral water,
nonalcoholic beverages, tobacco, ete.). The Executive Council ha&
presented the necessary proposal in May 1987.
K. Duties on Petroleum Product.
14.      The possibility will be examined of replacing the various taxes on
petroleum products with an *4 valo   tax, the rates being determined
accorditg to the following three supply areas: East, West and South.
L. Establishment of Firm Economic Bases for the Taxation of
Decentralized Atencies
15.     The Executive Council will launch immediately an in-depth study
of problems relating to the tax revenues of decentralized agencies and to
seek solutions enabling decentralization to be based on sound economic
foundations.
M.  Establishment of an Inflation Accountina Mechanism
16.      In order to rationalize the company tax regtim  and to provide
additional Incentives to Investments and rehabilitation of fixed assets,
the Executive Council will adopt a system for the periodic rovaluation of
company balance sheets. For this purpose, the MNistry of Financo will
prepare, by January 1988, a system for the determination of company income
correcting It for the distortions created by Inflation.

N. CCA Payments on Interest
17.      The elimination of CCA on interest will be carried out in two-
years, starting in June 1987 with the elimination of CCA on agricultural
loans, followed by a generalized 50 percent reduction in January 1988, and
by the total el4mination in January 1989.

ATTACHMENT 4
POLICY STATEMENT ON FINANCIAL SECTOR
Bsck round
1.       The financial sector in Zaire consists of the Central Bank, nine
commercial banks and two development banks, SOFIDE and BCA (agricultural
credit). The non-bank financial sector includes two subsidiaries of
commercial banks specialized in the financing of construction and real
estate development, an insurance company (SONAS), a savings institution
(CADEZA), a postal savings network (CCP) and a social security fund (INSS),
as well as a number of saving cooperatives (COOPEC). The financial sector
is responsible for mobilizing domestic financial resources to finance
economic growth, with special emphasla co be given to agriculture and
small- and medium-scale enterprises.
2.       Nonetheless, an analysis of activities of the financial sector
indicates that, other than deposit banks, financial institutions remain at
a low level of development. It should also be noted that commercial banks,
whose primary mission remains the collection of deposits and the
distribution of credits, have not sufficiently mobilized savffngs. This has
been due to both exogenous and endogenous factors. Exogenous factors have
included the low levels of incomes, as well as a widespread preference
among the population for maintaining assets in liquid form. Among the
endogenous factors are the inconveniences to the banks associated with the
maintenance of obligatory reserves, the low level of deposit Interest
rates, the lack of discipline in the application of the law on use of
checks, and the preponderance of cash in the payments effected by the
Treasury. Taken together, these factors have led to an Increase in the
level of currency outside banks, estimated to represent more than 50
percent of the money supply.
3.       Given the restrictive nature of credit policy of recent years,
commercial bank lending to the economy has been inadequate and largely
limited to short-term foreign trade financing. Medium-term lending
required Central Bank approval on a project-by-project basis and was
accommodated by a part of the credit ceiling not allocated to the banks.
The cost of borrowing is high: at present, interest rates on short-term
advances rage from 32-37 percent and on medium-term credits around 40
percent, to which an 18 percent tax and commissions should be added. Given
the importance the Government accords the &gricultural sector, preferential
interest rates for non-coffee agricultural credit were fixed by the Central
Bank.  To ensure that commercial banks lend at this rate, the Central Bank
was obliged to channel credit to agriculture through a project-by-project
approval mechanism outside the credit ceiling (credit non reparti).
4.       Central Bank supervision over the management and operation of
financial institutions is limited. Although basic legislation and
regulations for supervision exist, the financial sector is still not
satisfactorily monitored.



- 82 -
Obiectives
5.       In the context of the Structural Adjustment Program, the financial
sector will continue to play an Important role In maintaining stability in
external accounts and in curbing inflation. In order to Improve the
efficiency of the financial sector in the economy, the Government Intends
to: (i) revise the credit allocation system; (ii) increase saving
mobilization by developing domestic financial markets; and (i11) strengthen
the Central Bank's supervision of financial institutions.
Action Pro8rsm
6.       With respect to credit allocation, the Government has eliminated
the distinction between allocated and non-allocated credit within the
credit ceiling, and prior Central Bank authorization for medium-term and
agricultural loans. In the context of its Structural Adjustment Program,
it will (i) introduce a requirement that, during the transition period,
commercial banks extend 20 percent of their total credit to agriculture end
for medium- to long-term loans under the same terms and conditions     all
other credits; (1i) conduct a study on the credit needs of the fishing and
livestock sub-sectors; and (Mi) establIsh an Agricultural Credit
Consultative Commission, responsible for assessing periodically the
adequacy of credit supply to agriculture and examine ways to Increase
access of smallholder farmer to agricultural credit.
7.       In order to fully liberalize the Interest rate structure, the
preferential rates for agriculture credit has been eliminated. Moreover,
to reduce the cost of credit and improve Its transparency, the following
actions will be taken: (1) in conjunction with the fiscal roform of the
SAP, the CCA tax on Interest will be phased out over a two-year period (the
tax on agricultural credit was eliminated entirely in 1987); and (1i)
commercial banks are now required to Issue on a monthly basis the
composition of the cost of credit, including all charges, which will be
published by the Central Bank.
8.       Savings cooperatives, which, at present, are not accredited by the
Central Bank, are potentially important financial inttrmediaries with
regards to savings mobilization, especially in the raral areas and for
small-scale enterprises. In order to strengthen the financial structure of
these cooperatives and eventually incorporate them into the formal
financial system, the Government intends tot (i) prepare a special law
governing cooperatives; and (ll) conduct a management audit to identify
weaknesses in the system and define an action program that would strengthen
their financial structure.  To encourage the use of savings accounts, the
Government plans to lncrease the use of checks as means of payment.
9.       In order to strengthen other means for mobilizing savings, the
Executive Council also intends to pursue measures to facilitate the
reactivation of the insurance and social security sectors, which up to now
have played only a limited role.
10.      Although it has advantages In controlling the money supply, the
compulsory reserve requirement policy deters banks from mobilizing deposits
above the amount strictly necessary (since the reserves are not remunorated



- 83 -
by the Central Bank), reduces inter-bank competition in mobilizing
deposits, and encourages high lending rates. To redress the situation, the
Central Bank under instruction of the Executive Council, will promote the
use of Treasury Bills for satisfying the compulsory reserve requirement up
to a maxiium percentage to be determined. The Central Bank also intends to
take further measures to promote the development of the inter-bank money
market.
11.      Over a longer-term horizon, the Executive Council will also define
the modalities for the creation and the development of financial markets.
12.      In the area of supervision, the Central Bank has introduced a new
and more comprehensive reporting system for banks. To Improv. further the
Bank's supervisory function, the accounting systems used by coamercial
banks will be standardized, changes in tho treatment of non-performing
assets will be introduced, and specific financial ratios to measure the
performance of banks will be defined and applied.

ATTACHMENT 5
POLICY STATEMENT ON CIVIL SERVICE REFORM
Background
1.       The Zairian civil service has been characterized by limited
effectiveness and very low efficiency. The quality of the civil service,
which has deteriorated rapidly, has been adversely affected by management
problems, reflected mainly in the persistence of fictitious employees, poor
definition of job responsibilities and qualification requirements, and an
inadequate remuneration package. The distribution of civil servants among
different ministries and agencies is highly uneven, with excessive numbers
in some sectors and insufficient in others. Given the overall budgetary
constraints the country is facing, the overall size of the civil service is
too large to provide adequate compensation. At present, there are roughly
434,000 active employees in the total civil service, of which 117,000 are
civil servants in the central and regional administration, 180,000 primary
and secondary school teachers and 88,000 military personnel.
2.       Since 1982, the Executive Council has attempted to rectify the
situation by eliminating fictitious employees and freezing recruitments and
promotions. Although it has succeeded in stabilizing (and perhaps slightly
reducing) the number of civil servants and the share of the budget
allocated to their payroll, the decline in the real value of their salaries
has continued, despite its efforts to raise compensation levels. Budgetary
constraints have also affected operating expenditures, accentuating even
further the general paralysis of the public administration.
3.       As a result of the high inflation experienced in Zaire since 1975,
the real incomes of civil servants has deteriorated steadily. The average
civil service salary deflated by the Kinshasa Consumer Price Index
(1975-100) indicates a loss of over 80 percent in the purchasing power of
civil service salaries over the period 1975-85. In 1986 and 1987, the
Government accorded relatively large nominal salary increases -- on average
67 percent and 70 percent, respectively. In real terms, these increases
have helped to arrest the declining trend in the purchasing power of the
civil service, but, in absolute terms, the income levels of practically all
civil servants still remain far below the minimum subsistence requirements
of an average family. In fact, real average salaries in 1987 still
represent about 20 percent of those in 1975. However, the 1987 salary
increase, which was not applied uniformly, did attempt to reduce the
anomalies in the salary structure between the higher and lower grades by
favoring the lower-level staff.
4.       Although the 1987 salary increase benefitted the lower-paid staff,
particularly the intermediate grades who are responsible for the day-to-day
business of the Government, the salary differentials of the existing salary
structure need to be reviewed in order to reduce blatant anomalies between
staff levels. The system of fringe benefits, especially the provision of
automobiles and gasoline allowances designed as incentives for higher-level
staff, has created additional disparities among the categories of the civil



- 85 -
service. At present, with these supplementary benefits, the gap between
the remuneration of the highest civil servant and that of the lowest-paid
e"ployee reaches nearly 50s1, while without these benefits, the ratio is
13:1.
Ob4ectives
5.       Well aware of the seriousness of the situation, the Executive
Council has decided to address the problems of the civil service within the
context of its Structural Adjustment Program. The strategy for the
rationalization of the civil service includes both long-term objectives and
a program of short-term measures.
6.       The restructuring of the civil service over the long term will
focus on three factors: incentives, qualifications and organizational
effectiveness. The goals will be to: (i) provide a remuneration structure
capable of attracting, retaining and motivating the personnel needed to run
the public services; (ii) control and monitor the staff so as to guarantee
its competence and motivation, within the limits of budgetary constraints;
and (iii) ensure that manpower and other resources are deployed so as to
allow implementation of each Ministry's programs and projects.
Action Program
7.       An immediate move toward these goals will be made through a set of
short-term measures as part of the Structural Adjustment Program: (i)
continuing the rationalization drive by eliminating fictitious employees
and retiring eligible staff -- actions which will depend on the completion
of the census and physical inventory begun in 1985 with UNDP assistance, as
well as the computerization of the results by SPIZ. A study on designing a
new payment system for government workers will also be undertaken; (ii)
revising the salary structure in order to correct present anomalies and
reduce the glaring disparity between higher- and intermediate-level staff.
Such a structure will also introduce pay steps within each grade so as to
allow greater incentive for good performance; (iii) improving the
purchasing power of civil servants by introducing mechanisms that reflect
both cost-of-living and good performance and that stay within budgetary
limits; (iv) rationalizing the system of fringe benefits by formulating
clearer allocation criteria. In this connection, vehicle allocations will
be presented under a separate budget heading, so as to limit abuse of this
benefit.
8.       In the medium term, the Executive Council will aim at improving
personnel management by: (i) instituting manpower planning and budgeting
systems in the Ministry of Public Administration; (ii) strengthening the
personnel management function in the Ministry's regional offices; (iii)
introducing procedures for setting priority objectives/tasks in all
ministries (to begin, procedures will be introduced on a pilot basis in
four ministries (Public Admiministration, Planning, Agriculture and Rural
Development).
9.       The definition of goals, combined with the adoption of a manpower
planning, budgeting and monitoring system, will make it possible to assess



- 86 -
the needs for qualifted manpower more accurately and evaluate the
performance, as well as the cost-effectiveness of the public
administration. To this end, a Manpower Planning Unit will be created in
the Ministry of Public Administration; the Corps of Inopectors and the
Organization and Methods Unit of the Ministry will be strengthened; the
criteria of the existing staff evaluation system will be clarified and
reinforced; and a personnel training program to meet Identified manpower
needs will be developed and instituted.

ATTACHMENT 6
POLICY STATEMENT ON AGRICULTURE
Background
1.      Agriculture provides direct employment to about three quarters of
the labor force and accounts for a third of GDP. While it was a mas r
source of export revenues in the early 1960s, agricultural exports now
represent only one-tenth of total export earnings. Agriculture has a great
potential as a source of production, export diversification and gainful
employment.
2.       Despite the vast potential, the performance of agriculture has
been very disappointing in the last two decades. The sector suffered from
inadequate resources which led to a rapid deterioration of physical
infrastructure and public sector institutions involved in the sector. The
measures of zairianization in the 1973, followed by nationalization in 1974
and the retrocession in late 1976 resulted in a major disruption of
confidence and the distribution network. Since then the sector has been
characterized by a process of disinvestment.
3.       The state of agricultural research has deteriorated due to weak
management, lack of funds, and unbalanced staffing in the National
Institute for Agronomic Research (INERA). The agricultural extension
service is thinly scattered and largely ineffective due to lack of funds
and mobility, and inadequate staffing. Currently agricultural extension Is
provided the private companies(in cotton, maize, sugarcane) and rural
development projects. These services occasionally duplicate and overlap
each other with limited coordination efforts to date.
4.       The sector also suffers from a rural roads network in disrepair,
which along with an inadequate distribution system for petroleum products,
hampers the use of inputs and marketing of agricultural products. Trade
liberalization in 1983 resulted in removal of protection for some
agricultural products which had to face severe competition from subsidized
imports and dumping. Other problems in the sector arise from an ill-
adapted agricultural credit systew, and a tax system with taxes and
parafiscal charges hampering productive activities. The low level of
private sector participation in agricultural input distribution has also
contributed to shortage of fertilizers, Insecticides, agricultural
Implements and veterinary products in the interior of the country.
Government Obiectives
5.       One of the objectives of the Executive Council under its
Structural Adjustment Program is the recovery of agricultural production
with a view to achieve food self-sufficiency, expansion and diversification
of exports and lncreased production of cash crops as inputs for agro-
industry. The essential conditions of agricultural recovery aret (i) a
better definition of the role of the Government for supporting agricultural
productionl and (1i) ovorhauling the inentive system to encourage
productive Investment in the sector. For the latter, the Executive Council



- 88 -
continues to face the very difficult task of creating the necessary
conditions for increasing private investment in the sector.
6.       The Executive Council reiterates that the role of the State in
agriculture will continue to be to rehabilitate and improve basic
infrastructure, promote research and provide basic agricultural extension
services and create a climate favorable for private investment. These
measures are expected contribute to private investments in the sector.
Action Program
7.       The action program focuses on two areass (i) incentive framework;
and (ii) public sector intervention in agriculture.
8.       The main action in the incentive framework will be to continue the
integration of the agricultural sector in the process of tariff
uniformization begun in 1986 under the Industrial Sector Adjustment
Program, and following its timetable. This implies that the minimum tariff
will be raised from their present level of 5 percent to 10 percent and the
maximum tariff reduced from 60 percent to 50 percent; this process will
continue progressively until 1990, when the rate will range from 20 percent
to 40 percent. Simultaneously, an adjustment mechanism will be designed to
protect selected agricultural products against the effects of dumping, or
subsidization. This mechanism will take into account the conclusions of
the ongoing study on the competitiveness of selected agricultural products
and on the appropriate nature for such an adjustment mechanism (see also
attacbment on fiscal reform, para. 5.2). Once this mechanism and the
conditions for its application are officially established, the ad hoc
supplementary tariffs currently imposed on selected agricultural products,
as well as quantitative restrictions, will be eliminated.
9.       In line the with measures undertaken under the Industrial Sector
Adjustment Program, the Government will eliminate remaining taxes and
parafiscal charges on exports of agricultural products. Furthermore, the
Government will continue the process of streamlining and simplifying
administrative procedures facing exporters. The Government will seek
alternative financing arrangement for decentralized entities so as to avoid
imposing taxes and parafiscal charges on agricultural production and
exports.
10.      The Government is in the process of preparing a program for
rehabilitation and reconversion of abandoned plantations which offer
positive economic potential. This program which could be based on a
special financing mechanism will also include the debt-equity swap
mechanism.
11.      In the context of its liberalization policy, the Government will
eliminate the preferential interest rate for agriculture, thus allowing the
banks to charge market interest rates on agricultural credit. At the same
time, to ensure acceptable lending levels for the agricultural sector,
floor levels will be established, communicated to the banks and reviewed
periodically by the Bank of Zaire (see Policy Statement on Financial
Sector).



- 89 -
12.      The Government intends to develop support structures to improve
the access of credit to small farmers. To this end, the Government will
seek appropriate mechanisms to increase the level of own resources of the
Agricultural Credit Bank (BCA) and improve its scope of action. In this
regard, an Agricultural Credit Consultative Commission will be set up with
the Identifying agricultural credit needs (including seasonal crop credits)
and making recommendations to the banking sector tor effective coordination
of activities. The Commission will include representstives from the
Ministries of Planning, Agriculture and Rural Development,the Bank of
Zaire, ANEZA and BCA.
13.      The Government will also take the required measures to eliminate
bottlenecks hampering input distribution once the results of an ongoing
study in this area become available.
Public Sector Institutions
14.      A study is under way to examine and propose recommendations on the
ways to improve the efficiency and streamline the extension and field
support agencies. In consultation with the Bank, the Government will take
required measures in this area which would aim at tailoring their programs
to available human and financial resources.
15.     A detailed program for reactivating agronomic research was drawn
up by a National Commission in 1984, in light of recommendations put
forward by a mixed group of Zairian experts and ISNAR, the specialized
international agency in this field. Actions to mobilize the financial
resources required to Implement the first stage of this progrem will begin
as soon as possible and not later than the start of the 1988 budget year.
16.      To stimulate the production and marketing of food products, cotton
and export crops, the Executive Counc l plans to:
-    install the regional agencies of the National Feeder Roads
Service (Service National des Routes de Desserte Agricole);
-    draw up a medium-term program for the rehabilitation of all
rural feeder roads in the agricultural production areas;
-   make an immediate start on an urgent maintenance and
rehabilitation program in the priority areas, including a
personnel training component (see Policy Statement on
Transport).
-    conduct a study for the development of storage facilities and
product conservation and prepare projects with appropriate
financing mechanisms.
17.      The administrative coordination problems at the central level are
particularly acute in the areas of agriculture and rural devolopment. They
concern in particular multiple sources of project financing and the
constraints imposed by the farming calendar. These problems, together with
rationalization of certain training criteria in agriculture, will be



- 90 -
assigned priority among the objectives set for the Ministries of
Agriculture and Rural Development.

POLICY STATEMENT ON
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
Background
1.      Despite efforts made since the 1970s, the situation of the
transportation sector is stAll worrisome. The poor performance of the
sector is compromising other efforts to promote economic development and
integration. The major problems of the sector, iuentified by the Five-Year
Plan and to be addressed under the Structural Adjustment Program, aret (i)
physical deterioration of both transportation infrastructure and equipment;
(i) insufficient coordination of the transportation sector as a whole; and
(iii) management of national companies and offices that results In three
key problems:
- a serious financial squeeze because of inadequate tariff
adjustments which do not fully reflect production costs during a
period of high Inflation (rates charged by ONATRA and SNCZ; road
taxes for the Office des Routes). In the case of the Office des
Routes, this has forced the closing down of certain essential
operations,
- inadequate control of production costs,
- general organisational veaknesses, in particular in the
areas of planning and Investment monitoring
Government objectlves
2.      Although a strategy has to be developed R,or increasing private
sector involvement in transportation, the solution to the problems of
ONATRA, SNCZ and the Office des Routes remains critical for the sector as a
whole. As part of its Structural Adjustment Program, the Executive Councail
vill therefore adopt measures to promote: (i) the financial and
operational recovery, and lmproved management, of SNC, ONATRA and Office
des Routes; (ii) the strategic reorientation of these companies, including
decentralization and selective reorganization, streamlining of structures,
and gradual withdrawal by ONATRA and SNCZ from certain activities; and
(iii) Improved transportation planning, coordination and formulation of
sectoral policies. In addition, to redress the acute shortage of
functioning feeder roads, which is compromising efforts to promote
agricultural recovery, the Council intends to launch a program to Improve
feeder roads and to establish an institutional framework for their
maintenance.



- 92 -
Plan of Action
Financial and operational recovery of ONATRA. SNCZ and Office des
Routes
3.       Financial recovery for ONATRA and SNCZ involves the urgent
establishment of short- and medium-term financial recovery plans requiring
an immediate increase in tariffs and the introduction of cost-cutting
measures.
4.       In addition, as regards the Office des Routes, for which program
implementation is seriously compromised by a lack of available funds, the
Executive Council will immediately increase road taxes to the level needed
for the Office to run properly and will introduce a new system for the
collection of that tax.
5.       In general, the policy will seek to guarantee enough funds to
cover the operating and investment requirements of the companies. This
policy also requires a program to recover costs from the users of
transportation services and infrastructure and the establishment of
appropriate rate structures for ONATRA and SNCZ.
6.       With a view to offsetting the negative effects of inflation on the
revenues of the companies, the Executive Council plans to establish
mechanisms for adjusting the rates and road taxes to reflect both the real
costs ard the impact of inflation.
7.       In addition to these mechanisms, the Executive Council will act
upon the recommendations of studies under way on rate structures and cost
prices for ONATRA and SNCZ.
Strategic reorientation of ONATRA and SNCZ
8.       The strategic reorientation of ONATRA and SNCZ requires a number
of measures to improve productivity:
- For the two companiess decentralization of
responsibilities, gradual withdrawal from certain activities and
streamlining of structures by selective reorganization. This
should in particular lead to an improvement in the management of
human resources and a smaller wage bill through a reduction in
staff, including early retirements.
- For ONATRA: reassignment of responsibilities, including
privatization and/or "subsidiarization' (filialisation) of certain
activities that are not essential to the company's mission,
reworking of ONATRA's role and relationship with the Government
and private sector, requiring the formulation of a program
contract.
- For SNCZ: search for solutions to non-economic lines and
accounting and financial reorganization in view of the
decentralization of services.

9.       This program, which supplements the maintenance of the main road
network by the Office des Routes, will consist of the maintenance by manual
crews of an additional 10,000 km initially of feeder roads and the
returning to service of an additional 3,000 km per year, which will also be
subsequently maintained.
10.      The program will be funded by the State budget and could over the
short term include external financing.
11.      For the sake of efficiency, program implementation will give
priority to existing means which can be readily mobilized and avoid the
establishment of administrative structures with the exception of the need
for central and regional coordination to be assured by the National Feeder
Roads Service.
12.      The institutional framework envisioned is as followss
(a) The setting of program objectives in accordance with
appropriate economic criteria, formulation of geographic
priorities, general coordination and monitoring will be done at
the central level by the Rural Development Department (National
Feeder Roads Service), vhLich will be the Implementing agency for
the program.
(b) The annual selection of roads to be maintained will be made by
the regional farm road commissions on the basis of expected
resources (from the national budget, possibly supplemented by
locally raised funds).
(c) Oversight for the program will be delegated to the regional
delegations of the Office des Routes, which will participate in
programming, decide on the technical content of the works, recruit
the agencies responsible for carrying out the works, supply the
necessary technical assistance, meet any training needs, monitor
Implementation and ensure payment for the works by those agencies,
under the direction of the Regional Administration authorities.
The general provisions for program oversight will be covered by a
model agreement between the Rural Development Department,
Department of Public Works and Regional Development, and
Department of Regional Administration (Administration du
Territoire).
(d).The physical execution of the works will be contracted out (to
companies, economic agents, religious missions, communities) and
will only exceptionally be carried out by the Office des Routes
(for ferry management in particular).
13.      In order to ensure the effectiveness of the program and monitor
its economic effect, a progress report and evaluation of the economic
impact will be made periodically under the direction of the
Interdepartmental Farm Roads Commission.
