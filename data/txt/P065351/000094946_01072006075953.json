objective of the Second\n            Hard Coal Sector Adjustment Loan Project (SECAL2) is to\n            support implementation of the Government's 1998-2002\n            Hard Coal Sector Reform Program. In particular, SECAL2 will\n            support the Government in implementing the Revised Program\n            which contains more extensive mine closures and employment\n            reduction than in the original Program. Specific objectives\n            relate to support for actions to 1) assist workers leaving\n            the industry to find new jobs; 2) improve the industry\n            payment of taxes and fees to government; 3) accomplish\n            further progres regarding preparation for privatization; and\n            4) continue progress to improve environmental performance.\n            From the point of view of society, the immediate\n            beneficiaries of social mitigation measures under the\n            Program, and SECAL2, are the miners and their immediate\n            dependents. There are four major risks: 1) Despite the\n            extensive restructuring being undertaken under the Program,\n            the industry may not become profitable. 2) The employment\n            restructuring targets may not be achieved because of a\n            slow-down in take-up of severance packages by miners. Many\n            of the workers leaving the industry are women. 3) If the\n            industry does not become profitable, then environmental\n            performance may be restrained by a lack of funding. 4) Poor\n            financial performance may also be a barrier to privatization."}, "docdt": "2001-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
