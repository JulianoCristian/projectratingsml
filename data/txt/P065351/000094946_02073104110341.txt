Background and Introduction
Hard coal represents the backbone of the Polish energy sector providing over 60 % of total primary energy
consumption in Poland and about two thirds of power sector fuel supplies, and accounts for almost 4% of
GDP. Poland's hard coal sector has suffered very large and increasing losses during the 1990's reaching
PLN 4.2 billion (US$1.2 billion equivalent) and PLN 3.2 billion (US$0.8 billion equivalent) in 1998 and
1999 respectively, and became a severe drain on the government budget because it failed to adjust to
shrinking domestic demand and sharply declining export sales and prices. Domestic demand declined from



102 million tons in 1997 to 84 million tons in 1999, and export prices declined from PLN 100 per ton in
1997 to PLN 87 per ton in 1999. The sector is also a major polluter that fails to pay its environmental fees
and fines which had reached over US$1billion. To stop these losses and prepare the sector to compete
within the European Union, the Government made reform of the sector one of its highest priorities and put
in place a comprehensive Hard Coal Sector Restructuring Program (the Program).
The Government's Program as approved in June 1998 provided for closure of about 19% (25.5 million
tons) of coal mining production capacity and a reduction of about 43% of the workforce (105,000 persons)
over the period 1999-2002. To facilitate and encourage the work force reduction needed, the Program
provided a significant package of social support measures which was introduced in June 1998. A greater
than expected fall in the demand for coal in 1999 resulted in coal sector losses remaining very high. As a
result the Government revised the Program in December 1999 to provide deeper reforms in employment
and coal production capacity reduction, to reduce costs and address the supply demand imbalance.
Cash costs of the Program are estimated at about US$2 billion over the period 1998 to 2002 consisting of
about US$1.5 billion for severance costs and US$0.5 billion for physical mine closure costs. The
Government has requested the Bank to assist the Government's budget in financing up to half of the cash
costs of the Program. An initial loan (the first Hard Coal SECAL) of EUR 280.13 (US$300 million
equivalent) was approved in June 1999 (Loan 4490-POL) and was fully disbursed to the Government's
budget in September 2000. The Second Hard Coal Sector Adjustmnent Loan (Hard Coal SECAL 2) for a
further US$100 million equivalent was approved on August 2, 2001 and the loan was released as a single
tranche on effectiveness in September 2001. A third loan (US$200 million equivalent SECAL 3) is now
under preparation.
3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project development objectives are consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy for Poland
and comprise: (i) promoting structural reform and helping start the process of privatization in a major
state-owned sector; (ii) rationalizing the role of the State and improving corporate governance arrangements
in the sector; and (iii) helping mitigate the effects of the industry reform on local communities, and
providing support for retraining and improving the employment prospects of workers leaving the industry.
The project development objectives are based on supporting the Government to implement the Hard Coal
Sector Restructuring Program as approved by the Government in June 1998 and revised in December
1999. The overall objective of the Government Program is to restore profitability of the sector in a socially
and environmentally acceptable manner. Specifically, the Program focuses on four key elements: (i)
restructuring and rationalization of the sector's labour force; (ii) reducing production capacity; (iii)
financial restructuring; and (iv) improving management and corporate governance. It also puts strong
emphasis on improving environmental protection and increasing competition consistent with requirements
as defined by the European Union, and introducing privatization. More specifically, the Revised
Restructuring Program, established the following targets which were as outlined below.
*   Coal companies should obtain a positive result from operations, at the latest, by the end of year 2000.
This was revised to the end of 2001 in the Revised Program;
*   Production capacity of the coal mining sector will be reduced by approximately 25.5 million tons of
annual production by the year 2002 (from about 137 million TPY capacity in mid 1998). This was
revised to a total reduction of 35.5 millions in the Revised Program;
*   Employment in the coal mining sector will be reduced, through a voluntary program, to about 138,000
-2-



employees by the end of 2002 (from about 243,000 employees at end 1997 ). This was revised to
128,000 employees in the Revised Program;
*   Environmental management practices are to be improved to ensure that the sector becomes
environmentally sustainable. The Revised Program introduced a time frame of five years for the sector
to comply with environmental requirements; and
*   The Revised Program specifies that the coal companies should be privatized following restructuring.
Specific objectives for SECAL 2 relate to support for actions and measures to (i) assist workers leaving the
industry to find new jobs and thereby keep up the process of labor force down-sizing; (ii) improve the
industry financial performance and, in particular, payment of taxes and fees; (iii) make further progress
regarding preparation of the industry for privatization;  and (iv) continue progress to improve
environmental performance. The SECAL 2 was a single tranche loan that was made to support actions
taken prior to loan approval. The ICR notes the key actions taken in this regard. Table I Provides key
performance parameters for the industry in relation to the targets specified in the original reform program.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives of the Bank project were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The overall objectives of the project were implemented through the following six project components.
1. Employment Restructuring and Social Packages
The core of the Program consists of employment restructuring in the coal mines based on voluntary
departures. The Goverrnent put in place a comprehensive set of financial support measures, active labour
market services and measures to assist all unemployed workers in the mining regions and to encourage the
development of new employment activities outside the mining industry. Central to the restructuring was the
Miners Social Package (MSP) which comprised a range of options designed to encourage workers to leave
the mines including: (i) a Miners Leave Severance Package to encourage voluntary early retirement of
workers nearing retirement, (ii) a Social Allowance Package for workers interested in re-employment
outside of the mining sector, and (iii) an Unconditional Lump Sum departure incentive for workers too
young to retire. The size of these incentives reduces gradually over time. While very considerable progress
was made in implementing employment restructuring in 1998 and 1999 the Mining Companies and MoE
reported that interest in taking MSPs diminished and that not all of the budgetary fumds available in 2000
for MSPs were used. Under the project the MoE prepared a Year 2001 Employment Restructuring Plan
regarding additional actions to be taken by the Mining Companies to reduce employment and MoLSP
prepared a Year 2001 Employment Support Plan containing (a) active employment interventions
(employment counseling and training) to support private sector employment and (b) new initiatives
regarding micro enterprise loans and business counseling to support Upper Silesia regional development to
help workers leaving the industry to find jobs in the private sector. Implementation of actions in these plans
helped reduce employment in the total coal sector to 155,000 workers prior to the loan approval.
2. Capacity Restructuring
Under the original Program, reduction of production to match demand involved liquidation of 25.5 million
tons of capacity (about 19% of total capacity). A further reduction of 10 million tons capacity was included
under the Revised Program, (bringing the total reduction to 35.5 million tons through 2002.) involving (a)
complete closure of 23 mines and (b) shutting down large parts of other mines and uneconomic production
faces and levels. Thus, from 63 mines in 1998, 41 mines remained active by the end of 2001 with I more
-3 -



to be closed in 2002. The Government's target under the Program was supported by actions completed
prior to loan approval including reduction of capacity to 111 million tpy by liquidating 26 million tpy
capacity since the start of the Program.
3. Financial Restructuring
The Program provides for rescheduling or forgiveness of liabilities to Government and government
institutions including environmental funds - but not commercial liabilities. For the mining companies to be
eligible for this debt restructuring they must meet certain criteria including paying current liabilities due to
the Social Insurance Fund (ZUS), the Labour Fund and the Fund for Guaranteed Workers Benefits in a
timely manner. The Program also aims to bring the sector to financial profitability by 2002. Prior to the
loan approval, the draft financial restructuring plans for each mining company were provided for review to
the Inter Ministerial Coal Steering Committee (IMCSC) which helped to ensure that creditors were fully
consulted in the financial restructuring process. In addition, prior to the loan being approved, the industry
improved its payment performance and paid 100% of the charges due to ZUS, VAT and PIT on an
aggregate and cumulative basis for current operations for a six months period (November 1, 2000 - April
30, 2001) net of certain funds that mining companies spent on employment restructuring; (all while
maintaining satisfactory liabilities to suppliers and other creditors and payments to gminas, environmental
funds and the Fund for Rehabilitation of Disabled Workers) in accordance with mining industry cash
management plans as received for Year 2001.
4. Environmental Improvements
The most significant environmental problem is saline water discharges. Other significant issues include
land use damage from surface disposal of mine wastes, land subsidence, and releases of coal bed methane.
To address the above issues, actions were targeted at three levels prior to the loan approval. Firstly, the
mining companies prepared business plans which include environmental management actions. Secondly, the
Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEP) conducted a Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA)
funds. The findings of the SEA were introduced into the mining company operating plans for the Year
2001. Thirdly, The MoEP, reviewed the environmental management plans and action programs, and
provided approval, oregarding the feasibility and effectiveness of the Companies' action programns. In
addition, prior to loan approval, the Ministry of Economy (i) initiated a Subsidence Study under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) initiated an SEA extension study to finalize environmental action
plans for 2001-2005; (iii) issued a Request for Proposal for a Study regarding altemative saline water
management schemes for the Debiensko Desalination Plant under terms of reference satisfactory to the
Bank
5. Privatization
Privatization was specifically identified in the Revised Program as one of the tools to achieve the Program's
longer term objectives. The Govemment has emphasized its commitment to privatization of the industry in
the Letter of Sector Development Policy (LSDP). The Government had previously prepared a Sector
Privatization Assessment (SPA) under the first SECAL in order to develop its privatization strategy for the
mining companies. The Govenmment also undertook to privatize two individual mines (Bogdanka and
Budryk) during the Program. The privatization efforts of the Govemment were further advanced by the
preparation of a Privatization Strategy Framework which was endorsed by the IMCSC prior to SECAL 2
loan approval.
6. Social Monitoring
-4 -



The Government wished to ensure that there was an adequate safety net in place to support all persons who
would become unemployed as a result of the restructuring of the coal sector. The social impacts of the
Program are being addressed through the Miners Social Package, retraining and labour support services,
and through emphasizing the need for a coordinated approach in the context of regional development of
Upper Silesia. To ensure strong coordination with regional authorities, representatives of the Katowice
Voivodship and the local government are members of the Inter-Ministerial Coal Steering Committee.
Multiple approaches are being used to monitor the social impact of restructuring including labour and
social assistance data, follow up surveys of workers taking social packages and general labour market
surveys and divestiture of social infrastructure. In addition, the Government has mounted a Public
Information and Communications (PIC) campaign, including public opinion surveys, to facilitate program
implementation and gauge general public awareness and understanding of the Program. Monitoring takes
place every six months.
3.4 Revised Components:
No revisions were made to the components of the project.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry is considered satisfactory. Project design built on the experience of the first SECAL and
was consistent with World Bank experience in the sector. Ownership of the Project by Government and the
commitment of Government to the objectives of the Project were very strong. Project risks were well
identified at entry and steps were taken to mitigate risks where possible. The main risks to the Program
were (i) the industry not being able to become profitable; (ii) the targets for employment restructuring not
being reached; (iii) environmental performance being restrained by a lack of funding; and (iv) poor
financial performance being a barrier to privatization.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The Project outcome is rated as satisfactory. The loan was disbursed in full compliance with effectiveness
conditions and with no extension of the project closing date. Employment in the Sector continued to reduce
without causing unmanageable social stress. Production capacity was reduced as per expectations.
Financial performance improved dramatically as did payments of current liabilities to Govemment.
Environmental performance improved as environmental management plans were implemented and steps
were taken to prepare plans to address saline water discharges. Privatization remains a priority for
Govemment and steps are being taken toward privatization. However the process is slower than expected.
Further details on each of the above are given in the next section
The main risk that proved substantial was the risk of targets for employment restructuring would not be
reached. While implementation is successful against targets in the original Program interest in the MSP is
declining and the Revised Program employment reduction targets are unlikely to be achieved. Further, the
market for coal is shrinking faster than expected and more restructuring over and above that included in the
Revised Program is likely to be needed to bring the sector in line with demand.

Other actions completed under the first SECAL and SECAL 2 are identified in the Matrix in the Presidents
Report.
1. Employment Restructuring and Miners Social Packages (MSP's)
Under the first SECAL, employment was reduced by 57,000. Under the second SECAL employment was
reduced by a further 31,000 to 155,000 workers - a substantial reduction from 243,000 at the start of the
Program. To encourage workers to leave the sector a new MSP, supported by the EU, of 3.6 months
wages, was made available to surface workers many of whom are women. Previously MSPs were made
available only to underground workers who are exclusively men. In addition to assisting in employment
restructuring this is a major improvement regarding gender equality, a concem raised by NGOs at the Bank
organized Stakeholder Workshop in May 2001 as part of the SECAL I ICR.
2. Capacity Restructuring
Under the first SECAL, 20 million tpy annual production capacity was liquidated. Under the second
SECAL, a further 6 million tpy capacity was liquidated which is in accordance with the Revised Program.
In total 22 out of 63 mines at the start of the Program have been liquidated or have stopped production.
Production capacity has been reduced from 133 million tpy in 1998 to 105 million tpy in Dec 2001, all
- 7 -



without major social disruption. This is also a very substantial accomplishment.
3. Financial Restructuring
Under the first SECAL net financial losses were reduced from 3.2 billion PLN in 1999 to 1.6 billion PLN
in 2000. Under the second SECAL, a small net financial profit of PLN 170 million was achieved in 2001,
but mainly due to financial restructuring process and forgiveness of some past liabilities of the mining
companies. The poor performance in 1999 and 2000 (due to falling coal prices) has limited the mining
companies ability to take advantage of the financial restructuring provisions of the Program due to their
inability to remain current on liabilities to Government in 1999 and 2000, a condition of debt forgiveness.
The payment of 100% of ZUS, PIT and VAT liabilities (net of our financial employment restructuring
costs) for the six months prior to loan approval represents a major improvement and was strongly
supported by SECAL 2. While the companies have been successful in making such payments, they remain
in a sever cash shortage. Unit production costs were reduced by 15% in real terms in 1999 and by 11% in
real terms in 2000.
4. Environmental Improvements
Environmental improvements have continued under SECAL 2. The environmental management plans
introduced under SECAL 1 are being implemented with positive results. In 1999, the saline content of
water discharges and the volume of solid waste disposed on the surface was reduced by about 9% and 12%
respectively compared with 1998. These discharges were further reduced by about 2.5% and 5%
respectively in 2000. The Ministry of Environment continues to be an active partner in the Inter-ministerial
Coal Steering Committee and the project support the involvement of the MoEN. The aggregate amount of
fees and fines assessed on the Mining Companies for solid waste surface discharges were 5% lower for the
2001 compared to those for the same period in 2000.
5. Privatization
Under the first SECAL, the Sector Privatization Assessment was prepared which focused industry and
government attention on privatization and all that it entails, and it outlined the next steps needed to prepare
the sector for privatization. However a main conclusion was that more restructuring would be needed
before privatization could be undertaken. Also, under the first SECAL an information memorandum (IM)
was completed for the privatization of the Bogdanka mine and an IM was started for the Budryk mine.
Under SECAL 2, further industry restructuring was implemented and a sector Privatization Strategy
Framework was prepared and approved by the Inter Ministerial Coal Steering Committee setting out key
steps, targets, actions and timetables for sector privatization. Also under SECAL 2 the Bogdanka mine was
offered for sale to investors and the IM for Budryk was well advanced. A preferred bidder was selected for
Bogdanka but the privatization transaction was not completed due to the failure of the bidder to meet the
terms and conditions of the purchase. The mine is now being re-offered for sale.
6. Social Monitoring
Six monthly social monitoring, which was started under the first SECAL, was continued under SECAL 2
and a streamlined questionnaire was also developed. According to the surveys about 60% of the miners
view the Mining Social Packages positively, for the most of the remainder, lack of altemative employrnent
opportunities causes a negative assessment. Of those seeking to return to the workforce 52% have been
successful and the vast majority of beneficiaries of MSPs (approximately 85%) advise they have sufficient
funds to support their families.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The SECAL and the work of the Bank were instrumental in achieving the inclusiveness and effectiveness of
the Inter-Ministerial Coal Steering Committee. This Committee brought together the Ministry of Economy,
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, Ministry of the Treasury and the Ministry
of Environment as well as local and regional government representatives. Most importantly the Ministry of
Environment is an active member of the IMCSC and environmental issues are now given much greater
priority in the sector. Local Governments (Gminas) have been strengthened by taking responsibility for
social assets and services such as kindergartens and hospitals, that used to be owned and managed by the
mining companies. Regional planning of infrastructure and project development has also been improved
through the inclusion of the new powiats (county governments) in coordinating program implementation.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The main factors outside of Government control are (1) the overall employment market and (2) the market
for coal. While the Government has been successful in encouraging workers to leave the sector and can
help facilitate employment, it cannot control the overall employment market which has been declining in
Poland, generally, and in the Silesian region, in particular, due to a lack of job creation. Unemployment in
the region has increased from 10% at the start of the program to 17% in 2001. The latest data (December
2002) shows, ex-miners account for only 3.1% of all registered unemployed, down from some 4-5 percent
observed in earlier periods. The labor market situation is almost certainly now impacting the
willingness of mine workers to take MSPs. With regard to the Coal market, the Government is
committed to the free trade and pricing of coal as evidenced by their Letter of Sector Development Policy
for SECAL 2. Demand for coal and prices are outside the control of Government and subject to market
forces. Prices have stabilized due to the closure program and the corresponding drop in supply. However
the market is continuing to decline and further restructuring is required if this performance is to be
maintained and if the industry is to be privatized.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
While there was some innovation in MSPs for SECAL 2 to attract more workers to leave the sector these
have not been sufficient and further initiatives are required. A lack of funds for MSPs meant several mining
companies used their own funds to pay workers to leave the sector. But companies re less than enthusiastic
to make such payments because, in a situation of sever cash shortage, it diminishes their ability to stay
current on their payments to government. It would be in the interest of all parties for MSPs to be fully
funded and for indirect subsidies to be made transparent. Government support for environmental
interventions has bee a factor in the positive environmental outcome under the project.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The MoE managed the Program actively with firm pressure on the sector to delver the agreed Program.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
There were no major changes to project costs.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
Sustainability is rated as likely.
-9-



The employment downsizing, mine closures, and environmental improvements are all considered
sustainable. The Government's Restructuring Program involves the permanent severance of coal industry
workers and the irreversible closure of complete mines and parts of mines. Workers who accept a
redundancy package are not eligible for rehire in the coal industry. In addition the industry has a
moratorium on hiring new coal workers except for certain special skills and obligatory hires (such as young
miners returning from military service). The mines to be closed and closure plans have been reviewed by
independent experts who have confirmed the irreversibility of the closures and the closure of capacity is
verified by an independent regulatory authority in Poland. The preparation of mine by mine environmental
management plans and the better information available and increased involvement of the environmental
authorities should help ensure the sustainability of environmental improvements in the sector. By closing
excess capacity and laying off surplus workers, supply and demand can be brought back into balance,
prices strengthened, efficiency increased and costs reduced which should help restore profitability on coal
operations. Financial restructuring provisions will help address past financial liabilities so that by the end
of the program the industry is able to operate on an overall profitable basis with no direct or indirect
government subsidies in a sustained manner. The final step of the reform process is privatization which
should further ensure the sustainability of the reforms.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The Government Program runs from 1998 to 2002. Further reforms will be necessary to close non-viable
mines and reduce the labor force so that the viable mines can be privatized. SECAL 2 continues the same
core objectives and components as the first SECAL with revised targets in accordance with the
Government's Revised Program. As discussed in Section 3 above the Revised Program increased
employment restructuring and capacity restructuring targets but delayed profitability expectations by one
year. Project performance monitoring and social impact monitoring continued in SECAL 2 which also
included improved financial performance and endorsement of a Privatization Strategic Framework (PSF).
A third SECAL is now under preparation. This would help support further employment restructuring and
capacity closure, and implementation of privatization.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Lending performance is rated satisfactory. Following the closure of the first SECAL in September 2000,
the Government requested the Bank to start preparation of a SECAL 2 as a US$300 million two tranche
operation. The Bank moved quickly to prepare the operation and it was appraised in December 2000.
Following appraisal, the Government informed the Bank that, in the light of upcoming elections in October
2001, a decision had been taken to request a single tranche of US$100 mnillion instead. The Bank
responded promptly to revise and re-appraise the loan, and, based on progress made since the first SECAL,
in five key areas, (employment restructuring, capacity restructuring, payment of liabilities to government,
environment and privatization), the single tranche operation was processed.
7.2 Supervision:
Overall supervision is rated satisfactory. Since this was a single tranche loan that was fully disbursed and
closed within three months of approval, opportunities for supervision were limited. Supervision work
focused on further steps regarding employment restructuring and privatization.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall performance is rated as satisfactory. The successful working relationship between the Bank team
and its counterparts contributed to the successful implementation of the Program. During the Country
Assistance Strategy dialogue with the new government following the elections, both the Ministry of Finance
- 10 -



and Ministry of Economy have written to the Bank to express their appreciation for the assistance under the
first two loans and have requested a third SECAL for the Bank to continue support of program
implementation.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower performance in preparing and revising the Hard Coal Restructuring Program and in working with
the Bank on preparing the loan is considered satisfactory. The Ministry of Economy as shareholder
representative placed considerable emphasis on the companies improving the payment of financial liabilities
to government agencies and successfully prepared a Privatization Strategy Framework which was approved
by the Inter-Ministerial Coal Steering Committee. These were key actions to enable the Bank to proceed
with the single tranche operation.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance is considered satisfactory. Implementation of the employment
restructuring, capacity restructuring and environmental improvement has been very successful, although
progress on employment restructuring has slowed. Financial performance has improved dramatically, but
remains very dependent on coal prices which are set in the market place. Privatization has also moved
more slowly than expected, however the preparation and appraisal by the IMCSC of the Privatization
Strategic Framework (PSF) for the sector is an important step forward.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The Ministry of Economy was the lead implementing agency for the program and MoE performance is
considered satisfactory. The MoE, with support from the Bank, closely monitored the performance of the
mining companies to ensure that the plan was well implemented.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Experience in other countries, including industrialized countries such as United Kingdom and transition
economies such as the Russian Federation and Ukraine, indicate that the restructuring, downsizing and
privatization of a large state-owned coal mining industry is an extremely difficult task that takes many
years to accomplish. Closing 23 mines and reducing the workforce by 100,000 workers from 1998 - 2001
without major social unrest is a significant accomplishment. Thus far the Borrower has made substantial
achievements in terms of sector reform and Borrower performance is considered satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
Lessons learned that may help with continued imnlementation of the Coal Sector Reform or
implementation of similar sectoral reforms in Poland or other countries.
1. The Government's comprehensive approach to coal sector reform has been generally successful and
should be maintained.
2. The Program needs to be adjusted to changing market conditions, to ensure the objectives, and not just
the targets, of the reforms are achieved. There are strong indications that further employment
restructuring and mine closure beyond that in the present Program will be needed to get to a fully
viable and privatizable industry. A new plan for further capacity and employment reduction should be
developed during the final year of the present Program.
3. New measures are required to continue successful employment restructuring. It would appear to be
very difficult to continue employment restructuring on a solely voluntary basis.
4. Financial viability is possible but reforms need to continue for this to be maintained.
5. Privatization will be difficult unless further reforms take place.
-1 1-



6. Privatization is required for real competition in the coal sector and should remain a priority.
7. The financial performance of the industry depends very much on coal prices. If prices fall sharply, then
more subsidies will be needed. In this context, the earlier that privatization is accomplished, the more
quickly the government will be able to transfer the price risk to private owners and operators and
protect itself and the taxpayer from the risk of further subsidies.
8. The extensive dialogue between the Government and the Trade Unions was an important part of the
success of the program as employment restructuring and mine closure could be effectively and
successfully implemented. This type of dialogue will also be a key element for designing the
privatization of the industry and any further employment restructuring and mine closures that may be
needed beyond that in the present Program.
9. When coal companies have more of an ability to restructure themselves (eg through involuntary
reductions), companies will be in a better position to be held accountable financially - and thus must
either stay current with Government on their tax and environmental fee liabilities (and their other
creditors), or be subject to bankruptcy or other proceedings to make sure they comply (ie - enforce the
hard budget constraint).
10. The process of liberalization needs to be completed for the sector allowing coal companies the ability to
compete with each other freely on price and to independently set employment policies (employment
numbers, wages, etc).
Lessons Learned which might be useful for future Bank Operations to support coal sector reform in
Poland ( or similar reforms in other countries)
1. A Sector Adjustment operation (SECAL) can be a very useful instrument to support comprehensive
sector reform. Significant resources for both preparation and supervision are required for these
operations if they are to be able to provide in depth coverage of all the aspects involved (typically
social, environmental, technical, financial, managerial and organizational).
2. Bank staff can play a highly constructive role by contributing knowledge of experience of coal sector
restructuring and social mitigation approaches in other countries, by bringing skills that may not be
readily available to government, by carefully scrutinizing the performance of state enterprises, by
helping government to identify and focus on high priority issues  and by helping to build
consensus/resolve conflict between different ministries.
3. To maintain strong support in implementing this type of program and provide the benefits identified in
I and 2 above, requires (a) strong local presence through field office staff; (b) an intensive supervision
schedule; (c) strong team work and sufficient budget to use specialists from several different disciplines
and Bank units (mining specialists, social specialists, environmental specialists, financial specialists
and privatization specialists).
4. The Bank can play an important role in bringing together key stakeholders to focus on important issues
for privatization and assist in building broad based support for Government to prepare and implement a
privatization strategy.

MINISTER OF ECONOMY                         Warsaw, June 25, 2002
DR-I /083 / JS /4035 /1968 in /2002
Mr
Pawel KAMINSKI
Energy Sector Senior Operations Officer
World Bank - Warsaw Office
53, Emilii Plater Street
00-113 Warsaw
Dear Sir,
Further to your letter of June 10, 2002 I am sending comments to the Project Completion Report
for SECAL 2 Loan.
The Ministry of Economy assesses the cooperation with the World Bank as very favourable. The
cooperation in the technical and economic fields exerted a positive influence on the execution of
the Government's programme of reforming the hard coal mining sector. The loan of one hundred
million US dollars enabled partial financing of the costs of restructuring Polish coal mining
conducted under the Government's programme of "Coal mining sector reform in 1998 - 2002".
The intellectual support provided by World Bank's experts and consultants for the Steering
Committee and its individual members contributed greatly to achieving positive results in the
process of restructuring Polish coal mining industry.
During the execution of the programme since 1998 till 31/03/2002, the following results were
obtained:
1 .   31.43 million tonnes per year of loss-making production capacity were eliminated mainly
by means of closing 13 coal mines completely and 10 partially. The loss in production capacity in
completely closed mines amounted to 13.9 million tonnes per year, and in partially closed ones 7.6
million tonnes per year. Further reduction in production capabilities was achieved by means of
closing districts, fields and levels (by 5.19 million tonnes per year) and shortening the length of
mining front in active mines (by 4.74 million tonnes per year).
2.     The employment, in comparison with the end of year 1997, was reduced by 98.5 thousand
- 13 -



miners. The reduction was executed without compulsory redundancies. The Miners Social
Package turned out very effective as it encouraged 66.5 thousand people to leave mines on their
own.
3.    In 2000, the mining industry attained positive unit coal sales results amounting to +2.37
PLN per tonne, whereas the programme assumed negative results. In 2001, we experienced
further increase in unit coal sales results which amounted to +7.04 PLN per tonne. At the end of
the first quarter of 2002, the unit sales result amounted to +8.03 PLN per tonne.
4.    In the period between 2000 and the first quarter of 2002, the tendency of improving the
financial standing of the coal sector, initiated at the end of 1999, strengthened, which was
manifested mainly through regular improvement of coal sales performance and net financial
results. Since July of 2001, the hard coal mining industry has been achieving positive net financial
results amounting to 182.1 million PLN. At the end of the first quarter of 2001 the net financial
result was 77.8 million PLN. It was possible for the coal industry to achieve positive results due to
the debt relief process conducted under the Act of November 26, 1998 as amended.
5.    An environmental analysis has been developed dedicated to the issue of sinking
post-mining areas and desalting plant in the 'Debiensko" mine. The previously conducted
environmental analysis was also updated and completed.
6.    Works have been conducted aiming at the privatisation of mines "Bogdanka" and
"Budryk". An outline of privatisation strategy was developed for the entire hard coal mining
industry.
By presenting these positive results of restructuring I express my hope that the cooperation with
the World Bank will be continued also during the execution of the new Polish hard coal industry
restructuring programme in 2003 - 2006 which is currently being agreed by various parties.
Sincerely Yours,
