Country and Sector Background
The Polish economy is its eighth year of economic expansion, combining strong
economic growth and a gradual decline in inflation. Real growth has averaged
just over 5t over the last eight years, while inflation has declined from 70;
in December 1991 to 10t in the twelve months ending in May 2000.    In 1999,
the worsening external conditions lead to a deceleration of growth and a
widening of the current account deficit. The recovery, however, is now well
on its way, fueled by a sustained growth in investment and a turn around in
export growth. Real GDP growth is expected to reach over 5t this year, while
exports are projected to rise by around 7t, up from a 5t decline last year.
Sound economic management has been key for this recovery, in particular the
government's efforts toward renewed fiscal consolidation. This performance
is expected to be maintained in the future, as next year's budget calls for
further a reductions in the consolidated budget deficit to 2.6w of GDP,
compared to 2.8w of GDP planned for 2000. Also, a further decline in the
average inflation rate to 6.2w is anticipated, down from the 8.0w projected
for this year.
The Hard Coal Sector and its Restructuring Program
Hard coal represents the backbone of the Polish energy sector providing over
60 9 of total energy consumption in Poland and about two thirds of power
sector fuel supplies, and accounting for almost 4t of total GDP. At the start
of the Program in early 1998, the industry consisted of seven joint stock
coal holding companies (operating 58 mines) and ten other coal mines set up
as individual limited liability companies (of which eight were operating and
two closed). The industry had a total employment of 243,000 and a production
capacity of 132 million tons per year. As of end 2000, employment has been
reduced to 155,000, 26 million tpy production capacity has been liquidated
and production has been terminated at 24 mines, leaving 42 mines operational
The Polish coal industry has suffered very large losses in recent years - 3.3
PLN billion in 1997; 4.2 PLN billion in 1998 and 3.2 PLN billion in 1999 (on



a turnover of about 18 PLN billion). For 1999 this is equivalent to losses
of about US$1.1 billion on sales of almost US$4.6 billion. These losses
largely result from domestic demand and sales shrinking more rapidly than the
industry could reduce employment and close excess capacity. The domestic
market difficulties were worsened by declining export sales and prices.
Because of these losses the sector became a severe drain on the government
budget in recent years and built large arrears regarding VAT, social security
taxes (ZUS), environmental fees and fines and occasionally workers income
taxes (PIT). It is also a major polluter that fails to pay its environmental
fees and fines. Thus, the Government has made reform of the coal sector one
of its top economic priorities. Coal sector reform will also be an important
step towards EU accession.
The Government's new Hard Coal Sector Restructuring Program (approved by the
Council of Ministers on July 1, 1998) addresses the sector issues (over
capacity, over-employment; high costs and high debts; environmental problems)
in a comprehensive manner over a period of four years (1998 - 2002). It is
intended to lay the foundation to establish a competitive, privately-owned,
profitable and environmentally sustainable industry.
The Program is based on two main objectives:
- to achieve economic and financial viability of the coal mining companies
under competitive market conditions; and
- to meet the domestic demand for coal and economically justified exports by
the year 2010, while maintaining competitiveness and environmental
requirements under conditions as defined by the EU and in an open market
for all energy carriers.
While the Program has been more successful than expected in reducing
employment, large financial losses occurred in 1999 because the supply-
demand imbalance was not yet corrected. In order to improve the situation the
Program was revised in December 1999 to provide for additional capacity
closures and stronger cost reduction measures. The Revised Government's
Program that was approved on December 21, 1999 continued to aim at the same
goals of the original program and it put much stronger emphasis on
environmental improvements and better implementation and corporate
governance. It reflects the current situation of the hard coal sector
resulting from developments of the first two years of program's
implementation during 1998-1999. It will also more strongly focus on
development and implementation of a privatization strategy.     More
specifically the Revised Program established the following goals:
- Coal companies should obtain a positive result on coal sales, at the
latest, from the beginning of year 2001
- Coal companies will obtain a positive net financial result in the
year 2002
- Production capacity of the coal mining sector would be reduced by
approximately 36 million tons of annual production by the year 2002
(from about 137 million TPY capacity in mid 1998)
- Employment in the coal mining sector would be reduced to the level
of about 128,000 employees by the end of 2002 (from about 243,000
employees in end 1997);
- Environmental impacts of the mining operations will be improved so
that the hard coal sector is to meet environmental protection

standards by the year 2005
- mining companies will be privatized according to Government's
strategy that will be adopted based on the results of a Sector
Privatization Assessment (SPA).
To achieve these objectives, the Government is committed to fund the Program,
to provide strong support for affected workers and communities, and to
maintain effective monitoring and auditing arrangements. It is also
committed to maintain a hard budget constraint on the industry whereby there
will be no non-Program subsidies or guarantees and/or repayments by
Government of commercial debts of mining companies.     These have helped
reduce the losses and the industry made a small profit on coal sales in the
Year 2000. But the industry was unable to stay current on its payments to
government in aggregate for VAT, ZUS and PIT.
The total cash costs of the Program for the budget are estimated to amount to
PLN7.2 billion ($2.0 billion) over the period 1998-2002. In addition,
liabilities to be waived to government, are estimated to amount to PLN7.9
billion (US$ 2.2 billion) to yield a total value to the program of about
PLN15.1 billion (US$ 4.2 billion). The cash cost ($2.0 billion) would be
financed from the state budget. Mechanisms for the flow of funds have been
established such that funds are being used efficiently for the intended
purpose.
The Proposed Loan/Credit
The proposed lending strategy is for the Bank to support the Government's
Hard Coal Sector Restructuring Program as outlined above at a level of up to
50% of the Program's total cash costs i.e. about US$1 billion of lending if
required over the period 1999 -2002. The strategy envisages for the Bank to
provide up to three Sector Adjustment Loans (SECALs), supplemented by a
specific sector investment operation in support of capacity rationalization,
employment support, as well as support of environmental and regional
investments. A first operation Hard Coal SECAL I was approved in June 1999
and is expected to be fully disbursed in September 2000. This provided
budgetary support for half the social costs for CY 1999 and early CY 2000.
The Bank has also provided support for the Government to undertake a Sector
Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Sector Privatization Assessment (SPA).
The Government has requested the proposed second operation (Hard Coal SECAL
II) which will continue to directly support the implementation of employment
restructuring   in the coal industry as well as   The primary objectives of
the SECAL II is to support the Government in implementing the Revised Program
and, in particular, achieve improved financial performance as well as further
mine closures and employment reduction. More specifically, SECAL 2 will
support the continued implementation of the Government's Coal Reform Program
regarding six main areas, namely, employment restructuring, capacity
restructuring, financial restructuring, preparation for privatization,
improvement in environment and mitigation of the social impacts of mine
closure and industry downsizing.
To achieve these main objectives the loan will focus on new initiatives to
support employment restructuring, implementation of further measures to help
move the sector towards profitability, implementation of specific actions
and investments to improve environmental performance, preparation of a
- 3-



privatization strategy and identification and implementation of additional
measures aimed at mitigating the social impacts of the reform.
The loan size of the proposed SECAL is US$ 300 million which will cover about
50t of the cash costs of the Program in 2001 and 2002. The loan will be
disbursed in two tranches.
