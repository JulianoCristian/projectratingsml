"The Programmatic Financial and Public\n            Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL) Project, aims at supporting\n            the Government's multi-year financial, and public\n            sector reform program. While it is proposed that the PFPSAL\n            project, will be followed by a second operation, key project\n            priorities include, in the financial sector: an overhaul of\n            the regulatory framework for banking activity; the\n            institutional development of the new Bank Regulation and\n            Supervision Agency; resolution of bank problems, and\n            failures; and, state bank restructuring, and privatization.\n            In the public sector, priorities call for: structural fiscal\n            policies; public expenditure management; financial\n            accountability, and public liability management; and, public\n            sector governance. The PFPSAL will provide budgetary support\n            to help finance the costs, arising from the crisis, and\n            continue to fund the critical social programs. Although the\n            project will restore confidence in the banking system, and\n            in the Government's ability to sustain fiscal\n            adjustments, numerous risks include, a potential loss of\n            political consensus, and institutional weaknesses,\n            aggravated by the macroeconomic risk, that interest rates\n            will remain higher than estimated, which would affect the\n            sustainability of the public debt, renewing instability.\n            But, tight fiscal discipline, and investor confidence in\n            Turkish sovereign debt instruments will be essential here,\n            to far outweigh the risks."}, "docdt": "2001-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
