The approach of combining\n            financial and public sector reforms into a single operation\n            is well suited to the Turkish context at this stage. The\n            combination provides important synergies, including in terms\n            of ensuring consistency between fiscal adjustment, and the\n            financing requirements of the bank restructuring program,\n            and in demonstrating to investors that Turkey is tackling\n            the core structural weaknesses underlying the country's\n            chronic macroeconomic instability. However, urgency and\n            complexity of the financial and public sector\n            reforms-juxtaposed with real world constraints on the\n            institutional capacity of the Turkish administration-argues\n            for selectivity in determining core conditions, and\n            flexibility with regards to the timetable for the\n            implementation of specific reform measures. In order to\n            tackle the complex policy, and institutional reforms that\n            Turkey is undertaking, the programmatic design of these\n            Programmatic Financial project operations, recognizes the\n            need to sequence measures over time, while taking into\n            account the uncertainties inherent in the crisis conditions\n            that Turkey has faced since early 2001. The programmatic\n            design allows for a reasonable degree of adaptability to\n            unfolding events on the ground, while maintaining overall\n            coherence, and direction of the reforms. Another lesson\n            suggests that unless a realistic assessment of the\n            institutional capacity constraints of counterpart agencies\n            is factored into the program, the program will be vulnerable\n            to constraints, likely to be a serious obstacle to program\n            implementation. These capacity constraints can be\n            alleviated, in part, through timely provision of well\n            focused technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2002-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
