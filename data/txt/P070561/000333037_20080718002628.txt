institutional capacity at the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) and
Saving Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF), (iii) restructuring and privatizing state banks, and
(iv) improving the corporate insolvency regime. Key reform priorities in the public sector
include: (i) deepening of structural fiscal policies in support of sustainable fiscal
adjustment, (ii) implementing public expenditure management (PEM) reforms covering
budget planning and execution, financial accountability, and public liability management,
and (iii) strengthening public sector governance including implementation of the national
anti-corruption strategy and preparation of civil service reform strategy. Priorities for
social spending include: (i) adequate expenditure for health, education and social
protection in the 2004 budget and (ii) better targeting of social protection.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design          1



1.1 Context at Appraisal

Turkey was hit by the worst economic crisis of its history in November 2000 and
February 2001. While the immediate triggers for the crisis were the fragility of the
banking sector, the underlying reason was non-transparent and unsustainable fiscal
imbalances of the public sector. Government's lack of commitment to key structural
reforms further exacerbated the problem in the public sector. These imbalances resulted
in an increase in net public debt stock to 90.4 percent of GNP in 2001.

The spark of the crisis was the surfacing of financial difficulties in some banks that had
borrowed heavily abroad, on short-term maturities, to finance the purchase of high-
yielding local debt instruments. The surfacing of difficulties in one particular bank
worried market participants that the problems might be more widespread. Concerns about
the actual financial situation of Turkish banks led to a drying up of liquidity in the money
market and the ensuing skyrocketing of interest rates at which banks could refinance
themselves. Foreign lenders called in their outstanding loans and foreign exchange
reserve losses mounted, as the Central Bank defended the crawling peg. Additional IMF
and World Bank resources stemmed the crisis temporarily until, in February 2001, a
public dispute between the President and the Prime Minister further eroded the markets
confidence in the sustainability of the reform program and rendered the crawling peg
untenable.

The roots of the crisis went, however, much deeper. Lack of confidence was widespread
in the banking sector н both private and state-owned. Private sector banks had not only
large exposures to exchange rate and interest risk but were also heavily engaged in
lending to related parties and had made only limited provisioning for non-performing
loans. State banks kept accumulating so-called `duty losses' incurred as they were
directed to fund government programs and to provide subsidized lending to certain
borrowers. With limited public information about the extent of these duty losses, and the
widespread perception that they constituted a contingent government liability, the
sustainability of public debt came into question. Large off-budget expenditures of so-
called extra-budgetary funds (EBFs) added to these concerns about the sustainability of
public debt. In addition, the fact that the banking sector as a whole held a large share of
its assets in public debt instruments further intertwined the finances of the public sector
and the banking sector.

series as a whole and includes a separate assessment of the contribution of each
individual operation to the program.




                                              1

In response to the crisis, a major stabilization and structural reform plan was put in place
in March 2001, including implementation of the floating exchange rate regime,
restructuring of the banking system, strong fiscal adjustment in the public sector. As the
exchange rate was left to freely float, the ensuing depreciation exacerbated the banking
crisis, through the un-hedged exposure of Turkish banks to foreign exchange rate risk, as
well as increased the public debt burden.

In such a context, the government's reform program was supported by a new IMF
program of US$16.2 billion н the largest up to that time н accompanied by World Bank
support for the structural reform elements of the package. The program operations were
designed to address medium term second generation structural, policy and institutional
reforms in the financial and public sectors. The program was supported by the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the Progress report endorsed by the Board in July 2001. It
was closely integrated with the other elements of the CAS and was supported by
extensive Economic Sector Work (ESW). The content of the reform drew on the analysis
presented in the 2000 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), and the 2001 Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR). It also drew heavily on the Bank's
fudiciary sector work including the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR)
and the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), both completed in 2001,
as well as the Fiscal Transparency Review prepared by the IMF.

The Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL) program was
designed to support the Government's combined package of financial and public sector
reforms. Reforms in these two areas were closely linked as weaknesses in public finances
had greatly contributed to financial instability. One of the root causes of the crises was
lack of transparency of the budget, in particular the handling of subsidies through off-
budget funding н including the duty-losses of state banks.

In the CAS Progress Report, the World Bank envisaged a total of US$2.45 billion in
adjustment lending under two programmatic financial and public sector adjustment loans
(PFPSAL and the three-tranche PFPSAL II). Subsequently, the Government requested
cancellation of the second and third tranches of PFPSAL II and preparation of a new loan,
PFPSAL III, which would constitute the last operation in this programmatic series (see
Table 1 and further details of changes to the structure of PFPSAL operations in section
1.6 below). PFPSAL III was included in the US$4.5 billion high-case program of the
CAS endorsed by the Board in November 2003. Close coordination with the IMF implied
that a number of reform areas supported by PFPSAL, such as public expenditure
management and state bank's privatization, were reflected in the structural benchmarks
for the IMF program.

In line with the `Guidance Note on ICRs for Programmatic Development Policy
Lending,' this ICR is prepared for the programmatic series as a whole and includes a
separate assessment of the contribution of each individual operation to the program.


1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The main objective of PFPSAL I was to address the Government's immediate financial
and public sector reform priorities in the aftermath of the November 2000 and February
2001 financial crises, while ensuring that social programs continue to be adequately
funded.

The main objective of PFPSAL II was to support the next phase of the Government's
financial and public sector reform priorities in response to the February 2001 financial
crisis, while continuing to ensure that social programs are adequately funded.

The main objective of PFPSAL III was to support implementation during 2004 of the
Government's financial and public sector reform priorities while ensuring that social
programs are adequately funded and increasingly better targeted.

To achieve these objectives, the program was built around three pillars of policy actions:
(a) macroeconomic framework, (b) financial sector reform, and (c) public sector reform.
Each of the PFPSAL operations identified a number of key priorities within the financial
sector reform and public sector reform components (see expanded discussion on policy
areas in section 1.4 below). Key outcome indicators identified at the time of approval for
monitoring performance under PFPSAL are reported in Table 2.

Regarding the design of the program, conditionality attached to PFPSAL operations
became more streamlined over time, as reflected by the decline in the number of
conditions for effectiveness and core conditions for the release of tranches (Table 3).

1.3 Revised PDO (if any, as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

As reflected in section 1.2 above, the main development objective in each of the PFPSAL
operations remained largely unchanged. However, the precise wording used to state the
development objective was slightly updated to reflect the phase of the reform process at
the time of the individual operation. In addition, in PFPSAL III the objective of better
targeting of social expenditures was added to the ongoing objective of ensuring that
social programs are adequately funded. This refinement reflected the concern that the
objective of adequately funding social expenditures referred only to the quantity but not
the quality of the social expenditures.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

The PFPSAL program supported three areas of policy which were seen as closely linked
in the particular situation that Turkey was facing: (i) macroeconomic management; (ii)
financial sector; and (iii) public sector.

The first policy area referred to the overall macroeconomic framework, as
macroeconomic stability was seen as a pre-requisite for the resumption of economic
growth and the reduction of poverty. To achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability, a
prudent fiscal policy that allowed a reduction in public debt was deemed to be essential,
and incorporated in PFPSAL in line with the stand-by Agreement between the Fund and
Turkey. PFPSAL operations provided financing to ensure that, despite the substantial
fiscal tightening required, social programs continued to be adequately funded.

The second policy area supported by PFPSAL was financial sector reform. The banking
crisis of late 2000 and early 2001 had made clear a number of deficiencies in the banking
sector. The prevalence of lending to related parties, excessive exposures to foreign
exchange risk, and inadequate loan loss provisioning all highlighted the need for an
overhaul of the regulatory framework. Such an overhaul called for a strengthened
banking supervisory authority, which had only been recently established as an
independent authority and had only a limited capacity to undertake its mandate.
Resolving the situation of banks in difficulties, by liquidating insolvent banks and
recapitalizing illiquid ones, was another area addressed by PFPSAL. Finally, to avoid the
accumulation of losses in state-owned banks, the program envisaged their reorganization,
operation on a commercial basis, and eventual privatization. A two-tranche Financial
Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) approved in December 2000 had aimed to address these
issues but, following the February 2001 crisis and the implications for banks' balance
sheets of a 40 percent depreciation of the exchange rate, it was necessary to refocus
priorities and timing of the reforms. The second tranche of FSAL was therefore cancelled
and the envisaged reforms subsumed into the PFPSAL and PFPSAL II.

Public sector reform was the third and last policy area supported by PFPSAL. Reforms in
this area aimed at both achieving a sustainable fiscal adjustment as well as tackling the
lack of budgetary transparency which was as an ultimate source of the crisis. Structural



                                             5

fiscal policies, including a tax reform, as well as a cap on public employment, and a
rationalization of the public investment program all aimed at improving the sustainability
of the fiscal adjustment. Within the heading of public expenditure management, the
program addressed the need to increase the fiscal transparency by improving the coverage
of the budget and adopting international standards of budget classification and reporting.
In this context, the abolishment of EBFs was covered in the program. The genesis of the
EBFs, first created in the 1980s as a way to circumvent excessively burdensome prior
approval procedures for budget expenditures, suggested also the need to overhaul the
overall public financial management system. Financial control was to shift from a focus
on ex-ante controls to internal control and internal audit, while the external audit was to
be developed as an independent function within the public administration.

Key priority areas of reform within the financial sector and the public sector were
identified in each PFPSAL operation. These priorities remained largely unchanged
throughout the program, as reported in Table 4. At the same time, the precise wording
used to state these priorities was updated to reflect developments at the time of each
operation. In addition, PFPSAL III expanded somewhat the coverage of the priorities
within financial sector reform to include improvements in the corporate insolvency
regime, on the basis that a better functioning banking sector requires an appropriate legal
framework that addresses creditor rights, insolvency, and restructuring systems.

Support for these priorities within the PFPSAL program was part of an ongoing and
much broader Bank effort to support reform in the financial sector and the public sector,
including the Economic Reform Loan approved in 2000.


1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

The policy areas supported by PFPSAL remained unchanged throughout the program.


1.6 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)

Upon approval of the first PFPSAL in July 2001, it was intended that the series would be
completed with a three-tranche PFPSAL II tentatively planned for December 2001. The
first tranche of PFPSAL II was disbursed but, following the parliamentary elections held
in November 2002, the new Government requested an extension of the closing date of
PFPSAL II from December 31, 2002 to March 31, 2003 in order to determine its specific
plan and timetable for the reform program. During this period the Government prepared a
roadmap for the reform program, issued in April 2003, and the Bank extended the loan
closing date to June 30, 2003.



                                             7

   In the mean time, the nature of the support requested by the Government had changed н
   from crises response support to structural reform support as the economy recovered from
   the crisis. Subsequently, the Government requested cancellation of the second and third
   tranches of PFPSAL II and preparation of a new loan. PFPSAL I and II had been
   designed in the immediate aftermath of a crisis situation and its financial terms were in
   part standard IBRD terms and in part the terms of special structural adjustment loans
   (SSAL). In particular, PFPSAL II included US$ 550 million on standard IBRD terms and
   US$ 800 on SSAL terms. As Turkey moved from a crisis response to a recovery phase
   the Government felt that it no longer needed to draw on the undisbursed funds under
   SSAL terms. Moreover, the approach of canceling the undisbursed tranches of PFPSAL
   II and preparing a new loan allowed the required adjustment of the timetable in
   accordance with actual developments since PFPSAL II had been approved in mid-2002.
   Cancellation of the second and third tranches of PSPSAL II took place in June 2003 and
   PFPSAL III was prepared on standard IBRD terms.

   The first tranche of PFPSAL III was released upon effectiveness in July 2004, with the
   second-tranche expected to be disbursed by June 2005. However, the closing date was
   extended first to December 31, 2005 and subsequently to June 30, 2006 upon the
   Government's request to provide additional time needed to finalize the remaining
   pending actions supported by the loan. In June 2006 the Bank released the second tranche
   granting a partial waiver of one condition regarding the state bank restructuring and
   privatization sub-component.

  The list of prior actions for each operation in the program is provided in Table A.1 in
  Annex 1.

  2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

  Progress in implementing the PFPSAL program has been influenced by three key factors:
  (i) the process of crisis recovery and the complexity of reforms envisaged, (ii) the
  electoral cycle, and, (iii) the EU perspective.

  (i) Moving from a crisis resolution to a post-crisis recovery phase was a factor that
  affected implementation. While in a crisis situation, reforms target the immediate needs н
  such as the need to recapitalize or liquidate failing banks н as the country recovered from
  the crisis more complex reforms became appropriate н such as the reorganization and
  timing for the privatization of state banks. These complexities, more so than a possible
  reform fatigue after recovery from a crisis, seem to be the key factors in explaining the
  delays experienced in this operation.

  (ii) The delay in the preparation of PFPSAL III was also related to the electoral cycle in
  Turkey. The parliamentary elections in November 2002 took place shortly before the
  initial closing date of PFPSAL II. The new Government requested its extension so that it
  could determine its specific plan and timetable for the reform program and prepared an
  Urgent Action Plan in the spring of 2003. Only then could PFPSAL III begin to be
  prepared. While noting this impact of the electoral calendar on the timing of the reform
  program, it must also be stressed that political stability following the November 2002
  elections has been instrumental in further entrenching macroeconomic stability.

  (iii) A final key factor that affected the implementation of PFPSAL was the increasing
  importance of the EU accession process for Turkey. This increasing importance of the
  EU, which reached a high mark in December 2004 when the European Council agreed to
  start negotiations, contributed positively to the implementation of PFPSAL. The
  Government anticipated the eventual EU requirements and focused on ensuring that
  reform areas supported by PFPSAL in issues ranging from public financial management
  to agricultural support, would be as consistent as possible with eventual EU requirements.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The programmatic approach of the PFPSAL allowed for a clear Monitoring and
Evaluation framework built around benchmarks for subsequent operations identified at
the time of the first operation. The approach recognized the need to sequence complex
policy measures over time. It allowed for a reasonable degree of flexibility to respond to
unfolding events on the ground while maintaining overall coherence. The multi-tranche
nature of PFPSAL III, and of PFPSAL II as initially envisaged, provided a way to move
forward with the reform program at a time when the reform progress experienced delays.
Together with the government counterpart, the country team followed closely
developments in implementing the second tranche conditions of PFPSAL III, including
the preparation of a number of analytical notes besides the regular supervision missions.

In addition to the outcome indicators identified at the outset of PFPSAL, additional
quantitative indicators to monitor progress were defined. These additional indicators
helped also in the dialogue with the authorities. They include:
    Financial sector
╖   Number of state bank's branches and employees
    Public sector
╖   Expenditures and balance of Extra Budgetary Funds
╖   Number of employees of consolidated budget agencies
╖   Average completion time of projects in the Public Investment Program

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

Following the closing of PFPSAL 3, a new series of programmatic public sector policy
development loans has continued to build up on a number of reform areas supported by
PFPSAL. While public financial and expenditure management reform and public
administration and governance reform have been supported under the PPDPL program,
financial sector reform agenda has been followed under the CEDPL.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The Program objectives together with its design, and implementation were quite relevant
to achieve the overall outcome from the operation. This relevance was assured through
the strong analytical works carried out before the program design. In the case of the
public sector, the assessment of the issues and required policy actions were led by the
Government through the technical support from the Bank. The 2001 PEIR was a joint
product of the Government and the Bank team.

While much progress has been achieved in all three policy areas (macro framework,
financial sector, and public sector), making further progress in all of them continues to be
highly relevant, as reflected by the extension of the 2003 CAS н in which PFPSAL had a
prominent role н into fiscal year 2007.


                                                12

Macroeconomic performance has been impressive but the current challenge is to sustain
growth and achieve convergence. The recent pick up in inflation and the widening current
account deficit highlight the continued importance of entrenching macroeconomic
stability. Further progress in the structural fiscal policies supported by PFPSAL, as in the
social security reform supported by PPDPL, will result in a higher quality of the fiscal
adjustment, allowing for a more rapid decline in the ratio of public debt to GNP by
boosting growth and lowering interest rates. In the financial sector, the privatization of
the state banks remains to be completed. Improving the regulatory and supervisory
framework of non-banking financial institutions constitutes the next challenge in the
financial sector н as envisaged at the outset of PFPSAL and reflected in the financial
stability assessment work of the Bank. Finally, the current reform agenda on the public
sector continues to build up on the progress made with support of PFPSAL, as evidenced
by the inclusion in PPDPL of elements of the public sector reform such as public
financial and expenditure management reform and public administration and governance
reform.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

This section provides, for each of the three policy areas (macro-framework, financial
sector, and public sector) in turn, a review of outcome indicators and a discussion on the
extent to which the observed outcomes can be attributed to actions supported by the
program.

(i) Macro-framework

Outcomes
The results in terms of economic recovery, disinflation, and debt sustainability over the
last five years have been remarkable. Growth rebounded strongly after the sharp
contraction in 2001 and has remained above 6 percent since. For the first time in three
decades Turkey achieved single-digit inflation in 2005. Interest rates and public sector
debt have both come down substantially (see Table 7).

In addition to the indicators identified in program documents we can also turn to third-
party assessments of Turkey's macroeconomic stability as well as those derived from
financial markets, which show remarkable improvements (Table 8).

of a country's ability to pay its way by financing its official, commercial and trade debt obligations. Risk
points are assessed for each of the component factors of foreign debt as a percentage of GDP, foreign debt
services as a percentage of exports, current account, net liquidity as months of import cover, and exchange
rate stability.

Attribution
Many factors besides actions supported by the PFPSAL have contributed to the result of
an improved macroeconomic framework. The overall positive global economic
environment since 2002 with ample liquidity in global markets and progress in the EU
accession process are two such factors which are unrelated to PFPSAL. In addition,
conditionality attached to the IMF program required many of the macroeconomic policies
supported by PFPSAL н most notably with regard to the primary surplus. Therefore,
assuming the overall stabilization program had been in place, the results in terms of
macroeconomic stability should not be attributed mainly to PFPSAL. In contrast, the
contribution of PFPSAL to the safeguarding of social expenditures can be established
with greater certainty. In the absence of PFPSAL it was less likely that social
expenditures would have been kept at the pre-crisis levels and, hence, this outcome can
be reasonably attributed to the program.

(ii) Financial sector

Outcomes
The results in terms of improved confidence in the banking sector have been impressive.
Following the credit crunch after the banking crisis, Turkey's banking sector has
strengthened while expanding its activities, as reflected by increasing banking assets as a
share of GNP. Following a process of consolidation the remaining fewer banks are more
profitable and are less exposed to credit risk (as evidenced by lower non-performing
loans), foreign exchange risk (lower open positions), and liquidity risk (liquid assets
higher). In terms of shock absorbing factors н besides the banks' profitability н they are
now better capitalized and have increased their loan loss provisioning (Table 9).

A notable development since 2005 has been the increased strategic foreign investment in
Turkish banks. This reflects the improved prospects of the banking sector but also, due to
the strength of the acquiring foreign banks, contributes to the stability of the banking
sector. Rating upgrades for the Turkish banking sector as a whole have ensued. Table 10
reviews the outcome indicators identified at the outset of PFPSAL.

In addition the Government agreed to monitor the progress in the financial sector
component through a number of other indicators. In particular, the number of branches of
employees of state banks was monitored as an indicator of the restructuring of those
banks. The combined number of employees for Ziraat, Emlak and Halk, which stood at
around 60 thousand in July 2001, had come down to around 34 thousand as of mid-2002
and has remained around that figure since н the latest available data for the first quarter of

2007 indicated 32 thousand employees (including temporary personnel). The combined
number of branches also declined from 2,478 in July 2001 to 1,585 by end-2002 (as of
the closing of PFPSAL in June 2006 the combined number of branches had increased to
1,737 reflecting in part the merging of Pamuk into Halk in 2004). Interest in the state
banks has increased and, following a failed attempt to sale a stake in Vakif, stakes in both
Vakif and Halk have been sold н the latter, in May 2007, attracted bids 8-times the shares
offered.

Attribution
Given the cross conditionality with the IMF program, the attribution of PFPSAL for the
financial sector reform is not straight forward. However, PFPSAL made a distinct
contribution in the reform of the financial sector. In particular, the program made a
difference with regard to a much improved regulatory and supervisory framework that
follows international best practices regarding issues such as connected lending, as well as
in strengthening the institutional capacity of the regulators. In addition, the involvement
of the Bank also helped to move forward in the complex process of reorganization and
privatization of state banks. Third-party assessments provide some evidence of the
positive contribution of the restructuring of state banks supported by PFPSAL. Capital
Intelligence, a credit analysis company specialized in rating emerging market banks noted,
when explaining the rationale of a rating increase for Halk Bank in June 2006, that the
bank's financial profile had "improved over the last couple of years due to the
restructuring program surrounding both the banking sector in general and the state banks
together with an improved operating environment." Speaking of Ziraat, the same rating
company considered that "Ziraat is now operating largely on a commercial basis" which
was the precise outcome that was supported by PFPSAL.

meet the requirements of the Code.

As mentioned above, together with the counterpart, the country team also followed a
number of additional indicators, such as those regarding the public investment program
and the role of extra-budgetary funds (Table 12). While the reduction in completion times
alone does not ensure the rationalization of the public investment program, the fact that
the decline in completion times has taken place recently in a context of increased actual
investment and fewer projects gives us more comfort as to its use as a quality indicator.
Table 12 also shows that the expenditures accounted for by extra-budgetary funds have
been more than halved, in terms of GNP, compared to 2000.

Attribution
PFPSAL was the cornerstone of the public sector reform aspects of the reform program
launched in 2001. In the absence of the program it is unlikely that the policy actions
supported would have (i) been part of the conditionality of the IMF program, and (ii)
been implemented as timely as they were with the support of PFPSAL. The program
made a distinct contribution in bringing international best practice and in helping design
appropriate reform steps in a range of issues regarding public financial management and
control: appropriate budget coverage and classification, public accounting and auditing,
strategic planning, medium-term budgeting, and liability management. By contributing to
progress in areas where past weaknesses had led to unsustainable public finances, the
program also indirectly contributed to mitigating the risk of future crises.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

PFPSAL I
Rating: Satisfactory
Justification:
PFPSAL I supported key elements of the stabilization program launched in May 2001
that signaled to the market the Government's determination to achieve and maintain
macroeconomic stability. As the first Bank operation following the crisis, the
contribution of PFPSAL I towards that signal was significant, thus supporting the
Government's efforts, being the first manifestation of the plans announced by the Bank in
March 2001 to support the Turkish stabilization program with US$3.5 billion in new
commitments in fiscal 2002 н an increase of US$2 billion over the high case in the 2000
CAS. The relevance of the objectives, as well as the extent to which they were achieved
and the efficiency of the operation were all substantial.

PFPSAL II
Rating: Satisfactory
Justification:
The second operation made further progress along the lines envisaged at the time of
PFPSAL I. A number of key reforms began to materialize, such as the enactment of the
Public Financial Management Control law, which represented a landmark change in the
approach towards public expenditure management and financial accountability in Turkey.
While the second and third tranches of PFPSAL II were cancelled the actions which they
meant to support were either accomplished before PFPSAL III or incorporated as part of
the PFPSAL III.

PFPSAL III


                                             19

Rating: Moderately satisfactory
Justification:
Notwithstanding the achievements made towards meeting the development objectives,
progress was slower than envisaged in a few areas, most notably in launching the
privatization of state banks and in the approval of the Agricultural Framework Law. The
closing date of the loan, originally June 30, 2005, was extended twice, first to December
31, 2005 and subsequently to June 30, 2006 to provide additional time needed to finalize
those pending actions supported by the loan. Eventually, the release of the second tranche
took place after a partial waiver on the launch of a privatization strategy for Ziraat bank.
In the context of a fast disbursing loan, it can be argued that these delays negatively
affected the efficiency of the operation in achieving its objectives. However, since the
nature of the last operation in the series was more oriented to reform support rather than a
crises response, addressing the long standing structural issues was more important than
the timing of the disbursement.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

In the absence of the program it is likely that social expenditures would have been cut in
order to achieve the required fiscal adjustment needed to achieve public debt
sustainability and the restoration of macroeconomic stability. Such a reduction in social
expenditures would have aggravated the negative impact of the 2000-01 crisis on poverty
and social development.

In addition, the PFPSAL has contributed to important social benefits through restoring
growth, job creation, and reduced economic vulnerability н although the existing data
cannot provide a comparable assessment year-by-year on the evolution of poverty during
the crisis and the first years of the program (Turkey' State Institute of Statistics and
World Bank Joint Poverty Assessment Report, 2005).

Some elements of the program necessarily implied a short-term social cost, most notably
the reduction of over-employment in state economic enterprises. The Government
worked to mitigate these social costs through the provision of social benefits. Workers
affected by the reduction in public employment (a total attrition of 59,000 from 2002 to
mid-2004) were eligible for pensions and other insurance benefits. Workers laid off from
SEEs in the portfolio of the Privatization Administration benefited also from a special
compensation benefit. In addition, all workers meeting the minimum contribution history
requirement of 18 months were also eligible to benefit from the new unemployment
insurance scheme introduced in 2000.

It must also be noted that the resumption of growth has not been accompanied by
substantial increases in employment (World Bank's Labor Market Study, 2006). Still,
the incidence of poverty, after stagnating for a number of years, is now receding rapidly
(Figures).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening




                                             20

Some sub-components of PFPSAL aimed directly at contributing to the development of
capacity of institutions, most notably the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency,
the Savings and Deposit Insurance Fund, and the Turkish Court of Accounts (TCA). The
available information suggests that the program had a modest but positive impact on
developing the capacity of the above-mentioned institutions. In the case of the TCA,
however, the still pending approval of the new TCA law carries with it the risk that the
capacity built up at the TCA may be eroded as it cannot be put in practice.

Besides these cases, an unintended consequence of the implementation of the reforms
supported by PFPSAL in the area of direct income support for farmers was an
improvement in capacity at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Evidence of
this increased institutional capacity was the relatively favorable screening of the
agriculture chapter in the context of the EU negotiations. Also the institutional capacity
among the state banks to deal with market participants and potential investors and
advisors has improved over time, partly as a result of the preparation of privatization
plans supported by the program.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

A number of tools used to monitor PFPSAL performance have now become part of the
standard policy toolkit of the Government:

i) the national farmers' registry in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs
    established to monitor direct income support under PFPSAL and which is now the
    basis for other policies administered by the Ministry;

ii) public employment data, which started to be collected as part of the PFPSAL program
     to monitor one of its conditions, has now become a standard reporting item by the
     Statistical Office, thus helping to increase the transparency of the budget;

iii) social expenditures by the government also started to be monitored by the
     Government as part of the PFPSAL program, and has been continued after the closing
     of PFPSAL III, helping to increase the transparency of the budget.

In addition, the strategic plans of the SDIF and BRSA, which were part of the
conditionality attached to the second tranche of PFPSAL III, have become useful for
other government agencies' own efforts to develop their strategic plans (required by 2010
as part of the Public Finance Management Control law) serving de facto as unintended
pilot projects of government agencies developing strategic plans.

All rated equally as they contribute to the same development outcomes and are being
rated, on the basis of the assessment of risks at the time of writing.

Rating: Moderate2
Justification:
The reform program has delivered strong economic performance and, hence, the risk
posed by possible shocks has been reduced to a considerable extent. Nevertheless, Turkey
still remains vulnerable to both internal and external shocks. The ability of Turkey to
withstand turbulences in financial markets such as that observed since June 2006
demonstrated improved resilience of the economy. Turkish markets' relatively fast
recovery from volatility in financial markets showed the economy's improved resilience
to such shocks. At the same time, the impact on domestic markets was not negligible,
indicating Turkey's continued vulnerability to external shocks. A change in global
liquidity conditions and risk appetite for emerging markets remains an important external
risk factor.

Political stability and support for the program remain key factors to ensure the
sustainability of the results achieved. In this regard the risks have also been mitigated to
some extent by the very reforms that PFPSAL supported, as they have helped to increase
budget transparency, consolidate independent regulators, and brought in commercial
practices and private sector interest into state banks.

Rating: Satisfactory

Justification:

Despite the challenge of a very difficult crisis environment and country context, and the
limited time taken to prepare the loan (three months), the PFPSAL addressed the key
issues at the root of the crisis. The fact that the policy areas supported by PFPSAL I have
remained unchanged and relevant throughout the operation and beyond, is further
evidence of the satisfactory quality at entry. The in-depth country and sector work
conducted prior to the operation was, in this regard, a key factor. The Public Expenditure

and Institutional Review conducted in 2000-01, in particular, is still widely regarded
among counterparts in the Government of both being an excellent analysis of the key
policy issues affecting the public expenditure management as well as an example of how
to build ownership and consensus in support of a difficult set of reform issues. Technical
assistance in the form of a Public Financial Management Project in 1995 had already laid
down the analytical groundwork but, without a lending operation, it had made only a
limited contribution. It was the bundling of knowledge and lending that proved to make a
difference. During 2001 a Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) and a
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) were also completed and served
to underpin the program.

Given all this pre-existing dialogue and analytical work, which included also a Country
Economic Memorandum in 2000, it was possible to prepare the PFPSAL program in a
short period of time, three months. In a crisis environment, this short preparation time
was particularly important.

PFPSAL II

Rating: Satisfactory

Justification:

The design of PFPSAL II followed on the key reform areas identified in PFPSAL I as
benchmarks that would trigger PFPSAL II in a smooth manner. Progress made permitted
also a streamlining of the conditionality attached to PFPSAL II so that, while PFPSAL I
envisaged 37 benchmarks for PFPSAL II, in the event the release for the first tranche of
PFPSAL II was linked to a total of 23 conditions.

Quality at entry for PFPSAL II was rated satisfactory by a Quality Assurance Group
(QAG) panel in August 2002.

PFPSAL III

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Justification:

The design of PFPSAL III was built around the areas envisaged in the second and third
tranches of PFPSAL II that were cancelled. All of the conditions in those tranches were
added to the PFPSAL III operation, which moved beyond the scope of PFPSAL II in a
number of areas. These changes were fully in line with the thrust of the reforms supported
by the program and reflected mainly the need to update the timetable to keep up with
developments. Among the changes introduced, a prior action for PFPSAL III was the
enactment of the Public Financial Management Control Law (which was only to be
submitted in draft under the final tranche of PFPSAL II). Similarly, PFPSAL III contained
as a second tranche condition the enactment of the agricultural framework law which
moved beyond the requirements in PFPSAL II by locking in the reductions in agricultural
subsidies channeled through the direct income support mechanism. Finally, PFPSAL II did
not tackle the steps needed to start the privatization of the two largest state banks, Ziraat and
Halk. Those steps needed for their privatization became conditions for the release of the


                                             23

second tranche in PFPSAL III. Given the size, complexity and political sensitivity of
privatization and restructuring of the state bank, following a phased out approach --
observing results of the privatization of Halk Bank prior to proceeding with the sale of the
much larger Ziraat Bank -- was a sensible decision.         However, the Bank should have
assessed the likelihood of privatization more candidly.

(b) Quality of Supervision

PFPSAL I

Rating: Satisfactory

Justification:
As a single-tranche operation supervision by the Bank implied the preparation of a
project status report following the closing of the loan.

PFPSAL II

Rating: Satisfactory

Justification:
The Bank undertook the appropriate supervision missions and completed project status
reports until the closing of the operation.

PFPSAL III

Rating: Satisfactory

Justification:
In addition to the appropriate supervision missions and project status reports, the Bank
proactively identified areas where there was a risk that the momentum for reforms may
be weakened to which it paid particular attention through dedicated monitoring notes on
issues such as budget implementation and the PFMC law (as discussed under section 2.3
above).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance


PFPSAL I

Rating: Satisfactory

Justification:

The Government agencies participated actively in project preparation, working jointly
with the Bank in the analysis that provided the underpinning for the operation. In
particular, the effective collaboration between the Undersecretariat of the Treasury,
Ministry of Finance, and State Planning Organization together with the Bank in the PEIR
provided a strong basis for preparing the public sector component of the program.
Implementation was swift as called for to address the crisis situation in early 2001.


PFPSAL II

Rating: Satisfactory

Justification:

While some delays occurred in 2002 the Government remained committed to the reform
program, which moved into the implementation phase in a number of areas. Government
counterparts further developed productive relationships and the Government agencies
involved in implementing the policy measures in PFPSAL II remained focused.

                                           25

Rating: Satisfactory

Justification:

As discussed under the section covering factors affecting implementation, the electoral
cycle and the change of government in late 2002 resulted in a delay in finalizing this
operation. Despite these delays, the Government remained committed to the objectives of
the PFPSAL program and progress was made to implement most of the envisaged
reforms, while a waiver was requested and agreed to regarding a second tranche
condition relating to the launch of a privatization plan for Ziraat bank. The Government
decided that learning from the Halk Bank offering before proceeding with the sale of
Ziraat Bank, the largest (state or private) bank in Turkey, would be a realistic approach. .
In addition, the authorities were concerned with attempting to sell two of the largest
banks in the country simultaneously while also issuing shares of Vakif Bank н another
state controlled bank.

6. Lessons Learned


The experience of PFPSAL provides a number of insights that speak to four distinct
issues: (i) critical role of country leadership; (ii) the importance of bundling knowledge
and lending in Bank's operations; (iii) the appropriate balance of the Bank's focus on
supporting design and implementation of a program; and (iv) the specifics of programs in
crisis situations.

i) Critical Role of Country Leadership:

╖   High degree of up-front political leadership, ownership of the strategy and the
    program by the Government including key ministries, and consensus behind the
    program      were   important    preconditions    for  the   successful  adoption  and
    implementation of reforms especially in the case of public sector reforms.

╖   Full engagement of the counterpart during the design process of the program was a
    crucial factor that contributed positively to the success of the program. This strong
    engagement of the Government was secured through full involvement of the
    counterpart in the preparation of analytical documents including PEIR, which set the
    base of the reform program

╖   Political stability since November 2002 through a single party government has
    contributed positively to the country ownership to the Program.


ii) Bundling of knowledge and lending

╖   PFPSAL provides a good example of the importance of in-depth analysis and
    continued engagement as the basis for a sound program. Such an analysis and
    dialogue was key for identifying the underlying sources of the crisis, as well as to
    ascertain the Government's ownership of specific reform proposals. The faster
    progress made in the public sector component of the program compared to the
    financial sector can be seen partly as a result of more in-depth analysis in the




                                              26

     preparation stage. In this regard, the limited information available regarding state
     banks' operations was a serious constraint in the design of the program.

╖    The program can serve as an example of how lending operations provide ample
     opportunities to engage with the authorities. At the same time, as the positive
     experience with the economic and sector work underpinning the public sector reform
     component, the program demonstrates that much of the groundwork for such
     engagement can effectively take place under non-lending operations. It proved,
     however, more difficult to have an effective non-lending engagement regarding the
     state banks, reflecting perhaps the very different nature of the two sectors and the
    sensitivity of information that нin the absence of a lending operationн counterparts
     are likely to feel comfortable sharing.

iii) Design vs. implementation

╖    Numerous counterparts considered that the Bank was more effective in the design of
     the program than in helping its implementation. The comment was widespread, being
     made about diverse areas such as strategic planning, performance-based budgeting,
     and the preparation of medium term expenditure frameworks. Although the option of
     using grant money to support the implementation was under consideration, due to
     some ownership problems from the counterpart side, this alternative could not be
     realized. Moreover, support needed during the implementation could not be addressed
     through technical assistance provided under the development policy loans, which
     requires continuous involvement with the counterpart. Moreover, not having an
     investment lending to support the implementation leaves the Bank to support the
     implementation in a limited manner. Without entering into a broader discussion as to
     the appropriate role of the Bank in supporting implementation, the experience of
     PFPSAL suggests that: (a) the activities of the World Bank Institute could be better
     linked with existing lending operations; (b) support for implementation was limited in
     part by the lack of borrowing for technical assistance projects by the Government н
     leaving the Bank with limited ability to support implementation. This last point
     prompts a question as to how the Bank could emphasize more the need to accompany
     the reform program supported by a development policy loan with sufficient technical
     assistance.

iv) Crisis programs

╖    Getting at the underlying roots of the crisis, the link between lack of public finance
     transparency and financial sector vulnerability, was key for the success of the
     program. This underscores the usefulness of designing PFPSAL as a multi-sector
     program. At the same time, as the experience with the differing pace of
     implementation of the two components under PFPSAL III shows, separation into
     different programs may be called for at some point in time.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


         General Comments

1.       Third Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL III)
is the third in a series of programmatic loans since 2001 in support of the Government's
comprehensive reform of the financial and public sectors. The main objective of PFPSAL
III is to provide support to the Turkey's financial and public sector reform priorities while
ensuring that social programs are adequately funded and increasingly better targeted.

2.       Our comments about the implementation of the structural reform program
supported by PFPSAL III are as follows:

         Macroeconomic Framework

3.       Satisfactory macroeconomic program has been conducted under the PFPSAL III
program. We have implemented sound economic and structural policies so as to provide
economic stability and high growth in the last five years.

4.       Social spending trends have been consistent with the target set by the program.

5.       With the High Planning Council Decree on 30.11.2004 No: 2004/92; Agricultural
Strategy Document covering the period 2006-2010 was issued. In this document, it was
stated that the share of direct income payment in agricultural budget would be decreased
from 78 percent to 45 percent by the end of 2010. Besides, it was declared that area based
payment criteria of direct income payment would not change. Agricultural Strategy
Document was prepared by a technical committee led by SPO.

6.       Agricultural Law No: 5488 was put into force on April 18th, 2006. Direct income
payment has also been mentioned among the agricultural support instruments in Article
19 of this Law. According to the Law, the amount of payments would be decided
according to the unit area payment criteria facilitating the adaptation of agricultural
producers to the objectives of agricultural policy and environmental conditions and the
other issues about direct income support would be arranged by implementation rules.

         Banking Sector Reform

         A. Regulatory Framework for Banking Activity and Institutional

         Development of the BRSA/SDIF,

7.       A new and advanced Banking Law No: 5411, coherent with European Union
principles came into force as of October 19, 2005 and published in the Official Gazette
No: 25983 dated November 1, 2005, while the secondary regulations, brought forth in
accordance with the Banking Law within one year, since 1 November 2006. The
enforcement procedures are effectively carried out by relevant departments of the
independent and autonomous Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency. With the
enactment of the Banking Law, regulatory and supervisory framework was rearranged in


                                             41

a more systematic way and reinforced through the use of new tools and approaches in the
light of international best practices. Among others, incorporation of the non-bank
financial institutions into the regulatory and supervisory domain of the BRSA, the crucial
importance attributed to the corporate governance rules, elaboration of protective
provisions, defining financial holding companies as a new financial entity and new
mechanisms for efficient cooperation between the related public authorities were the
main features of the new legislation. Regarding inter agency cooperation and information
exchange, the establishment of the Coordination Committee, and Financial Sector
Commission which consist of related public institutions can be considered a significant
progress in terms of institutional capacity. Furthermore, coordination and integration
between audit and enforcement functions have been improved via Banking Law.

8.      The BRSA Strategic Plan (2006н2008) which has outlined mission, vision, main
values and strategic goals of the Agency is a milestone towards enhancing institutional
capacity and transition to the strategic management culture. Following the adoption of the
Plan the BRSA has entered into the implementation phase. In the context of the five
strategic goals and 13 related targets set out in the Plan:

        ╖       Efforts to review and update the "Risk Focused Audit Guidebooks" of
                BRSA in the light the recently published sub-regulations are about to be
                finalized.
        ╖       Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP н Turkey) jointly organized
                by the IMF and World Bank has been finalized.
        ╖       The activities of Financial Sector Commission as a mechanism of routine
                coordination, collaboration and sharing of information among functional
                supervisors and other agencies have gained momentum. The frequency of
                meetings has been enhanced, and the Commission has focused its efforts
                on improvement of exchange of information, cooperation and coordination
                among institutions and developing joint policies regarding the matters that
                relate to the financial sector.
        ╖       Human resources of the BRSA were reinforced through training programs
                and recruitment. In this context:
        ╖       Training programs regarding Basel II have been organized in order to
                develop human resource capacity of BRSA. The future trainings focused
                on Basel II have been planned.
        ╖       32 assistant sworn bank auditors and 35 assistant banking specialists with
                bachelor's degrees in economics and administrative sciences, law,
                mathematics-statistics and engineering have been recruited.
        ╖       In order to develop efficiency of BRSA staff:
        ╖       Preparation of the "BRSA Job Descriptions Handbook" is about to be
                finalized.
        ╖       The "Collection of BRSA Regulations" has been prepared and distributed
                to the personnel.
        ╖       E-capacity of the BRSA has been improved via new website. The new
                website, in the light of the BRSA values such as "transparency and
                accountability", "sensitivity" and "customer focused service", has been



                                               42

               designed to enable all the related parties to get information in a more
               systematic, efficient and user-friendly manner.
       ╖       Procedures and principles regarding the "BRSA Seminars" through which
               prominent BRSA specialists and outside speakers will participate and
               address critical topics in the supervisory and regulatory domain of the
               BRSA have been established.

9.     Based on the fact that reporting and assessment are inseparable parts of strategic
management, implementation results have been addressed in the BRSA Annual Report
2006. Moreover, a performance evaluation study for internal purposes has been just
completed.

10.    Several actions have been undertaken so as to strengthen the Saving Deposits
Insurance Fund (SDIF). Governance of SDIF has been strengthened. Besides, removal of
the current blanket guarantee has been removed and transition to a limited deposit
guarantee scheme has been started as of July 5, 2004. Long term financial sustainability
strategy for the deposit insurance fund taking into account operating budget and
performance plans have been developed as well.

11.    Overall, it is possible to state that the PFPSAL III process has played a supportive
and catalytic role for the efforts towards a more efficient and independent regulatory and
supervisory system, which have been in place since 2001. The content and timing of the
Program, and flexibility provided to the responsible institutions are considered fair and
reasonable.

       B. State Bank Restructuring and Privatization

12.    State owned Ziraat Bank and Halk Bank, and state-controlled Vakif Bank
represent about 30 percent share of total banking system assets. These banks are
operating under market conditions. The government approved specific strategies for
Ziraat Bank and Halk Bank in June 2005. Based on the High Privatization Council
Decree enacted in November 2005, financial and legal advisors to Halk Bank regarding
privatization were appointed as of April 2006. Ziraat and Halk Bank have been
substantially restructured in terms of staffing and branch networks in preparation for their
privatization. The advisors submitted their reports at the end of June 2006 and Treasury
shares at Halk Bank were taken into privatization portfolio and program in accordance
with High Privatization Council Decree No: 2007/8. An Initial Public Offering (IPO) was
held for the Halk Bank's 24,98 percent shares and the shares started trading on Istanbul
Stock Exchange on May 10, 2007.

13.     In 2005, Mc Kinsey&Company was mandated to exercise an analysis for
determining the appropriate method on how to increase the private ownership within
Vakifbank. As an IPO was decided to be the best method, and consequently a very
successful IPO was conducted on November 2005.

14.    The strategy for Ziraat Bank is envisaged to be prepared drawing on the
experience of Halk Bank.



                                               43

        C. Execution and Bankruptcy Act

15.     We recognize the crucial role of Execution and Bankruptcy Act (EBA) for
sustaining financial sector stability. We modernized the Execution and Bankruptcy Act
(EBA) in accordance with international standards and EU best practices in order to
provide transparency and preserve debtor and creditor rights. There has been several
amendments to the Execution and Bankruptcy Act dated July 17, 2003 in order to adapt
changing social and economic circumstances and expedite judicial procedures on July 30,
2003, February 12, 2004, March 2, 2005 and May 31, 2005. The regulations for the
amended Execution and Bankruptcy Act (EBA) were published respectively on July 30,
2003, February 21,/2004, March 18, 2005, June 1, 2005.

        Public Sector Reform

        A. Structural Fiscal Policies

16.     As a requirement of the economic program, public sector primary surplus of 6.5
per cent of GNP was targeted and significantly high amounts of primary surpluses were
achieved. However, keeping the primary surplus target, which is the main performance
criterion of the fiscal policy, constantly every year caused fiscal consolidation relying
mainly on revenue increasing measures rather than expenditure rationalization.

17.     In April 2003, the Parliament approved the first legislative package under the
direct tax reform designed to simplify and consolidate the direct tax regime in line with
OECD standards and international best practice. This legislation: (a) harmonizes tax rates
on income from financial investments at the declaration stage; (b) simplifies and
harmonizes the system of investment incentives; (c) reforms the system of income tax
credits, and (d) simplifies taxation of corporate earnings and dividends. Key provisions of
the legislation became effective immediately and the remaining articles became effective
in January 2004.

18.     In scope of the policy of restructuring the Turkish Revenue Administration, it has
been reorganized as a semi-autonomous unit affiliated to the Ministry of Finance and
restructured according to functionality. Also, a large payer unit (LTU), which became
operational as of January 2007, has been formed. These developments will absolutely
strengthen the Turkish tax system and will help in struggling against the unrecorded
economy and developing the taxpayer services.

19.     But there are some tasks that should be completed. Such as;

        ╖       Revenue Administration should cover the entire country. Today, local tax
                offices are operational in only 29 cities (and LTU). In other cities, local
                taxation   units   are   operating     under the   Ministry   of  Finance
                (Defterdarliklar).
        ╖       Tax audit system should be developed. Number of both provincial and
                central tax auditors is not sufficient.
        ╖       Technological and human resource capacities of RA should be developed.




                                              44

20.    We had comprehensive public sector employment policy in 2002 and 2003 and
we sustained and strengthened it in 2004. The policies for 2004 include: (a) a cap on the
total number of civil servants in the central and local government-the ceiling on new
hiring in the consolidated budget was set at 40,000 workers; and (b) a limit on
replacement hiring in the SEEs equal to 10 percent of attrition and no replacement hiring
for budget-financed SEEs. A system of quarterly monitoring for public employment
across the general government has been established in 2002. A committee chaired by
MOF monitors the employment figures of the consolidated budget agencies, SEEs, local
administrations, state banks and social security institutions.

21.     Reducing over-employment in the state economic enterprises is a key element of
our public employment program. At end 2001/early 2002, approximately 15,000 workers
were retired, notified of their retirement, laid off or converted to private contract status,
following the lifting of restrictions on the ability of managers to require public sector
workers over 50 years of age to retire. In addition most of the unfilled positions in SEEs
were eliminated. The overall attrition from SEEs between February 2002 and mid-March
2004 has reached to over 59,000.

       B. Public Expenditure Management (PEM): Budget Reform

       Objective/Policy Reform Area: Strengthen credibility of budget preparation

       process and rationalize PIP.

22.    Turkey modernized the legislation concerning the budget process. The crucial
improvement was the introduction of the Public Financial Management and Control Law
(PFMC Law), adopted by the Turkish Parliament in December 2003 (Law No. 5018).
This law replaced the General Accounting Law of 1927, which was outdated in many
respects. The PFMC Law will have been fully implemented in December 2007.

23.    With the help of PFMC Law, mechanisms to strengthen plan-program-budget
relations were established, the budget preparation process was redefined and the
budgetary scope was expanded to be compatible with the international standards and EU
best practices.

24.    The official documents like 3-year Medium Term Program, Medium Term Fiscal
Plan, Budget Call and the Budget Preparation Guide, the Investment Circular and the
Investment Preparation Guide and the dates that these documents must be prepared and
published in the Official Gazette, responsibilities of the institutions in the budget
preparation process and basic rules are described and determined in the PFMC Law.

25.    The budget formulation process starts in May when SPO prepares and presents
the 3-year Medium Term Program (upcoming budget year and following years) to the
Council of Ministers. The Medium Term Program includes a macro-economic forecast
and sets the main priorities and objectives. The objectives include an inflation target for
the medium term. The program also presents estimates for general government
expenditures, revenues and borrowing for the next three years. The document is in the
form of a Cabinet Decree and is published in the Official Gazette.



                                             45

26.     According to the PFMC Law, general government operations are covered by: (i)
the central government budget; (ii) the budgets of social security institutions; and (iii)
local government budget. Central government budget is composed of general budget (List
No. I), special budgets (List No. II), and budgets of the regulatory and supervisory
agencies (List No. III).

27.     In this context, 25 organizations, which have autonomous budgets and receive
transfers from the consolidated budget before the year 2006, are covered as special
budget administrations and included into the List No. II. Furthermore, 8 regulatory and
supervisory agencies, which were excluded under the scope of the consolidated budget in
the old system but transfer their revenue surpluses, are included under the List No. III.

28.     Moreover, health, social and cultural centres, which were excluded in
consolidated budget according to the old definition and operated in connection with the
universities started to be included among the special budget administrations.

29.     In order to ensure effective acquisition and efficient use of public resources,
accountability and financial transparency, the structure and the operation of the public
financial management, implementation of the budgets, accounting and reporting of
financial transactions and financial control were reorganized as well. As the budget scope
expands, the right of budget used by the Parliament is broadened.

30.     After that process the new PFMC Law was amended with the Law No. 5436,
which redefines the structure and functions of Strategy Development Departments and
Head of Departments, financial service experts and their assignment and training process.
Secondary and territory legislation to implement the PFMC Law are still being
developed.

31.     In July 2003, the High Planning Council issued a decision announcing the launch
of the strategic planning initiative on a pilot basis in eight agencies representing various
parts of general government. With guidance and support from SPO, the eight agencies are
expected to finalize their strategic plans very soon. Based on the experiences of these
pilots a phased program to expand strategic planning to the rest of government will be
prepared and implemented.

32.     Besides, the internal audit perspective foreseen in the PFMC Law is not fully
implemented in the public domain and the assignment process of internal auditors has not
been fulfilled yet.

33.     Within this context, it is evident that structural reform program has positive
consequences which are stated above. Nevertheless, before starting a structural reform
program, considering to establish and impose more flexible conditionalities instead of
strict ones might be more useful.

34.     It is envisaged in the Eighth Five-Year Development Plan and the corresponding
annual programs that the effectiveness in the planning and implementation of the public
investments be increased and the contribution of the public investment projects to the
economic development and social welfare be maximized. In this context, a rationalization


                                             46

process was initiated in which the projects constituting the year - 2001 and the year -
2002 investment programs were reassessed taking into consideration the sectoral,
regional and project-specific priorities, and the projects that lost their significance were
identified accordingly.

35.     In year 2001, a total of 1,002 projects that either lost their priority and feasibility
or could not be initiated due to insufficient allocation were eliminated from the year-2001
investment program. The eliminated projects consist of 353 major projects and 649 sub-
projects all of which sum up to an investment total of 12.4 million YTL (year -2001
program prices). Hence, the number of projects in the resulting year-2002 investment
program turned out to be 4,414. Another consequence was that the average completion
time of the existing projects in year 2002 has been set to 8.5 years, which is about a 9.1%
decrease with respect to the year-2001 programmed completion time (9.4 years) and
about a 32% decrease with respect to the completion time after the year-2001crisis (12.5
years).

36.     Keeping within the same context in year 2002, a total of 600 projects (230 major
and 370 sub-projects), which sum up to an investment total of 4.9 million YTL, were
eliminated from the year-2002 investment program. The number of projects in the
resulting year-2003 investment program was out to be 3,851, which is far less than that in
year-2002 investment program (4,414 projects). Similarly, the average completion time
of the public investment stock in year 2003 has fallen to 7.6 years with an 11.2%
decrease when compared to that in the preceding year.

37.     Rationalization process has included not only the project elimination procedures
but also some other improvement operations for the investment program. In this context,

        ╖      Some multi-year projects of various institutions have been restructured as
               single-year projects;
        ╖      The finished tasks and the tasks that would not be able to be contracted in
               the very near future have been eliminated from the project scope of some
               projects;
        ╖      The projects which were deemed adequate for public service with their
               already completed tasks have been removed from the investment program;
        ╖      Several projects have been removed from the implementation stage and
               repositioned in the feasibility preparation stage in the investment program
               so as to have their feasibility studies be revised;
        ╖      The existing projects are re-prioritized to identify those:
           o that have low-levels of physical realization,
           o that have no urgency,
           o that have a lower-level priority.

38.     The projects that carry features mentioned in the bullets preceding this paragraph
have been halted with trace allocations, and the available funds have been redirected to
those that are urgent and that carry higher priorities.




                                              47

       ╖        Within the Government's Urgent Action Plan (UAP) and the Higher
                Planning Council's macro framework decision no: 2003/2,
            o Vehicle procurement is halted with the exception of those that are used for
                health, defense and security purposes such as ambulances and fire
                brigades;
            o Constructions of public service buildings with realization ratios less than
                75% are halted with trace allocations;
            o Except for absolutely urgent cases; new investments for social facilities
                such as public housing, camping, nursery and guest housing are prevented,
                and the continuing investments in these areas are halted with trace
                allocations.

39.    The rationalization process has been carried on in the following years' programs
as well during the implementation stages of the projects in the investment program. The
number of projects in the year-2007 investment program has turned out to be 2,710 while
the average completion time of the public investment stock in year 2007 has fallen to 5.8
years. The results which have been obtained after rationalization process are very
sufficient and 2007 investment program is much more rational, sustainable and feasible
than 2001 investment program.

40.    We published Extra Budgetary Funds Law in the Official Gazette in July 2004,
and it was started to be implemented in January 2005. The rationalization of the off-
budget activities by reducing the number and increasing the transparency of extra
budgetary funds and revolving funds is well underway. The extra budgetary funds except
5 of more than 60 were closed and their previously earmarked revenues and expenditures
were moved into the budget starting in 2004. The number of revolving funds was also
reduced from about 2,650 in mid-2001 to around 1,000 by end-2005. We are aiming to
restructure all revolving funds within general government by the end of 2007. Quarterly
financial statistics for the revolving funds and projected fiscal balances of the revolving
funds as an annex to the budget proposal for the central government have been published
in order to bring transparency of fiscal balances.

41.    Consistent economic and functional classification of GFS that was applied for
consolidated budget starting with the 2004 budget extended to cover the rest of the
central government social security institutions in the 2006 budget preparation. Through
this way, the policy analysis of public spending would be improved satisfactorily.
Projected aggregate expenditures and revenues of revolving funds and extra-budgetary
funds for 2006-2008 have been submitted to the Parliament during the central
government budget approval process.

       C. Financial Accountability

42.    We published the new accounting regulation for general government in
compliance with GFS requirements in the official gazette on November 19, 2003.

43.    Government Accounting Standards Board responsible for transforming the
framework standards included in the accounting regulation into full-fledged accounting



                                             48

standards over time has been established. Regulations about working principles of the
Board was published in the Official Gazette dated 13 May, 2005.

44.     The Public Financial and Management (PFMC) Law which was enacted in
December 2003, provides a new framework for modern public expenditure management
and accountability and introduces a performance-oriented public sector management and
is being implemented satisfactorily.

45.     We submit Turkish Court of Accounts (TCA) Law to the Parliament in February,
2005. We aim to empower The TCA to audit entire general government and to carry out
financial and performance audits.

46.     Reform of the public accounting system is well underway. The say2000i
automated accounting system is now fully operational in all Ministry of Finance
accountancies.

D.      Public Liability Management

47.     The Law No. 4749 on Public Finance and Debt management, enacted in March
2002, has established a comprehensive risk management framework in Turkey. By this
law, the Middle Office (MO), organized as a Deputy General Directorate at the
Directorate of Public Finance is mainly responsible for formulating risk based debt and
receivables management strategy, monitoring the associated market and credit risks and
reporting them to the Debt Management Committee (DMC) for decision making. The
MO employs well-trained human resources with a high level of technical expertise in
order to conduct both market and credit risk management analyses.

48.     One of the main tasks of the MO is managing market risks associated with public
debt. In this context, MO is mainly responsible for assisting the DMC in formulating the
benchmark policies taking into account costs and possible risks. To this end, medium and
long term analyses of the cost and risk structure of the public direct liability portfolio are
conducted. Currency, interest rate and maturity composition targets of public debt are
proposed to the DMC. The tolerable levels of deviation from these targets, the risk limits
are also evaluated. The realizations in execution of the borrowing policies and the risks
that arise as a result are monitored and reported. The risk and cost analyses are revised
according to the realizations and the market conditions. In order to perform the
mentioned analyses and formulation of the benchmark strategy, "Cost-at-Risk" (CaR)
methodology, which is applied by many other debt offices, is adapted. In general,
benchmark policies aim to reduce interest rate and currency risks by emphasizing
issuance of fixed rate local currency securities and to mitigate liquidity risk through
extension of maturities and maintenance of an adequate level of cash reserve.

49.     The MO also monitors and evaluates the functionality of primary and secondary
markets and makes suggestions for the improvement and comments on the new
borrowing instruments, issuance techniques etc.

50.     For credit risk management, the Law No. 4749 and consequent communiquщs
introduced measures such as the risk account for undertaken guaranteed debt, a guarantee


                                            49

limit covering the reimbursement and investment guarantees, partial guarantee scheme
and a guarantee fee of up to 1% in order to increase fiscal discipline and to limit and
control the explicit contingent liabilities arising from government guarantees in line with
international practices.

51.     In order to address the above mentioned issues, the MO has developed analytical
models to evaluate these liabilities and to estimate the potential costs to the Treasury. In
this respect, a Credit Risk Model was used to prepare a preliminary valuation of Turkey's
guaranteed debt portfolio. The study estimated the expected loss and the maximum
probable loss for different institution categories as well as for the portfolio on a
discounted/undiscounted basis. In addition, for a more comprehensive contingent liability
and receivables management, another consulting service was used to assign credit ratings
to institutions which have outstanding Treasury reimbursement and investment
guarantees, on-lent credits and receivables due to the Treasury. This study determines the
credit rating of the institutions taking into account quantitative and qualitative
information and calculates the expected loss for each of them.

52.     The review of the government guarantee portfolio has been completed with these
two main analytical tools. In this respect, some measures are taken according to the credit
risk of each institution in the portfolio. Based on the findings of the models and other
research, the level of annual Treasury guarantee limit, guarantee fees and the
appropriation for the risk account are determined and proposed in the budget process.

53.     Additional responsibilities of the MO are to conduct research regarding debt
management issues and to monitor the Central Government Budget. For the budget
monitoring activities, the MO is responsible for preparing the reports regarding budget
financing, analyzing and forecasting the developments in the government budget and
conducting studies on issues that would have a direct or indirect effect on budget
indicators.

54.     Given the importance of high public debt burden in the economy, the MO also
started to perform public debt sustainability and sensitivity analyses in 2002. In the
course of this time, the methodology of sustainability analysis has been developed in
terms of both scope and calculation technique. In this process, the establishment of the
Risk Account enabled the MO to take contingent liabilities into account and extend
public debt stock projections accordingly. Thus, current medium term public debt
sustainability analysis covers Treasury's explicit contingent liabilities.

55.     Moreover, the Public Debt Management Report is published monthly. This report
includes the financing program and public finance statistics such as budget realization,
domestic, external and Treasury guaranteed debt flow and stock, risk account
performance and receivables stock.

56.     As a result of the progress in risk management, together with sound fiscal and
monetary policies and political stability, debt stock ratios have declined subsequently
improving the economic indicators of the Turkish economy. Thus, the net public debt to
GNP ratio fell from 90.4% of GNP in 2001 to 44.8% in 2006 with an average 7.6 point



                                              50

decline each year. The past five years proved that reducing the public debt ratio and
maintaining the economic growth primarily depend on strict control of public finances.

57.     In addition to the decline in the public debt stock ratio, interest and foreign
exchange sensitivity of the stock has declined as a result of prudent debt management
policies in recent years. The share of floating rate and foreign currency denominated debt
in total public debt has decreased significantly. The share of floating rate debt among
total central government debt stock has fallen to 44.6% as of April 2007, from the level
of 55.0% in 2002 and the share of foreign currency denominated debt ratio dropped to
34.7% as of April 2007, from 58.1% at the end of 2002. In addition, the payments
undertaken due to Treasury guarantees declined from $1.1 billion in 2002 to $337 million
in 2006 and the guaranteed debt stock dropped from $6.3 billion in 2002 to $4.2 billion in
2006. As a result, the structure of debt stock has become more resilient to possible
financial shocks.

E.              Public Sector Governance

Objective/Policy Reform Area: Adopt a systematic approach to combating

corruption and improving governance throughout the public sector.

58.     We realize that, corruption is an obstacle to economic and social devolopment in
many countries in the world. Therefore, we are implementing a number of substantive
action that have been envisaged in the Urgent Action Plan. One of the comprehensive set
of substantive actions was the enactment of the law on "freedom of Information for
Citizens" in October 2003. Following the enactment of the law regulations were made in
public in April 2004. Furthermore, the law on the establishment of an Ethic Board for
civil servant was established in April 2005. Also, the regulation on the Code of Conduct
for civil servants was issued.

Lessons Learned

59.     Adjustment and Development Policy Loans should have few disbursement
conditions. Such loans should focus only critical actions in order to achieve outcome
foreseen under the program. We welcome the dramatic decrease in the number of
disbursement conditions of the Bank's adjustment and development policy loans.
Disbursement of PFPSAL III completed after two years after Board approval because
second tranche had 20 disbursement conditions. Difficulty seen in disbursement of
PFPSAL III shows the importance of focusing on critical actions. We are glad to see that
recent adjustment and development policy loans have been focusing on critical actions.

60.     We recognize that country ownership has fundamental role to overcome political
difficulty in the envisaged program. Building ownership for the actions entailed under the
program require flexibility and collaboration with key reform leaders when developing
analytical underpinning of the reform.




                                             51

61.   We observe that macroeconomic stability is the strongest pre-condition for sound
development program. The success of the recent programmatic loans confirms the
importance of ownership and macroeconomic stability when implementing the
development programs.
