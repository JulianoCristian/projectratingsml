with the addition of four\n            heat recovery boilers and two steam turbo-generators of\n            about 100 MW each as well as the construction of about 104\n            km of 220 kv transmission lines from Kot Addu to Multan and\n            the addition of connecting bays at these grid substations.\n            The station is expected to operate on high speed diesel oil;\n            however, provision is being made for the use of alternate\n            fuel (gas, furnace oil, crude oil) if and when this is\n            available. The fuel will be supplied through an existing\n            pipeline from Karachi to Gujrat, which will be extended to\n            Kot Addu with a 30 km spur pipeline."}, "docdt": "1986-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
