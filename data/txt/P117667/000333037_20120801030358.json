"Ratings for the First, Second, and Third\n            Development Policy Loans (DPL) Project for Romania were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was significant, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: there is often\n            tension between a short-tem, crisis-driven government action\n            agenda and the longer-term policy horizon for systemic\n            reforms. Consonance with the borrower's strategic\n            priorities facilitates ownership, commitment to reforms, and\n            political acceptance. A stable government and steady\n            parliamentary support help sustain reform momentum. Dialogue\n            with the political opposition ensures that reforms are more\n            sustainable. The country office and continuity in the\n            country team are critical to project design and supervision.\n            Awareness of the political environment can help identify\n            vested interests opposing reforms and devise mitigation\n            measures. The DPL must recognize fiduciary risks related to\n            governance shortcomings in terms of the rule of law, abuse\n            of power, insufficient transparency, minimal accountability,\n            and corruption."}, "docdt": "2012-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
