Borrower                 Romania

Implementing Agency      Ministry of Public Finance

Financing Data           IBRD Loan of Euro 300,000,000 (US$ 380,500,000 equivalent).

Operation Type           Second Development Policy Loan (DPL2)

Main Policy Areas        Public finance, social sectors, and financial sector.
Program Development      The objective of the proposed operation is to support the government's
Objective(s) and         reforms in fiscal management, social protection and the financial sector,
Contribution to CPS      and position Romania to emerge from the economic and financial crisis on
                         a stronger footing, so as to be able to resume and sustain convergence to
                         the living standards of more advanced EU economies. These reforms aim
                         to: (i) strengthen public expenditure management, a key weakness and root
                         cause of Romania's vulnerability to the financial crisis; (ii) cushion the
                         impact of the crisis on the poor and vulnerable by enhancing the efficiency
                         and targeting of social assistance, and improving the fiscal sustainability of
                         pensions; and (iii) minimize risks of a domestic financial sector crisis by
                         addressing current and potential vulnerabilities as well as strengthening
                         regulation and supervision for a more resilient and well-functioning
                         financial sector in the longer-term. The Country Partnership Strategy
                         (CPS) that was presented to the Board with DPL1 (the first operation in
                         this DPL series) focuses on three pillars: i) economic growth and
                         competitiveness; ii) public sector reform; iii) social cohesiveness. The
                         focus of this DPL series on public finances, the social sectors and the
                         financial sector is fully aligned with these pillars.
Key Outcome Indicators   Reforms in public finance:
by end of DPL series     a) Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) implementation
                         More strategic allocation of budget resources and stronger budget
                         execution controls. Measured by a reduction in variance between approved
                         budget and actual expenditures for major ministries/functions.
                         b) Public Sector Pay
                         More transparent and performance-based system of public pay. Measured
                         by base salary comprising at least 70 percent of average total
                         compensation among public servants in all occupational categories.
                         c) Health
                         Better fiscal management and increased efficiency in public expenditures
                         to provide better services and greater equity in access. Measured by lower
                         public expenditure on drugs, a lower share of public expenditures on
                         ambulatory care and a lower rate of admission to acute care facilities.
                                                  iii
                 d) Education
                 Better fiscal management and increased efficiency in public expenditures
                 to provide better services and greater equity in access. Measured by an
                 increase in the average class size.
                 Reforms in social protection
                 e) Social Assistance
                 Strengthened social assistance through the best targeted program
                 (Guaranteed Minimum Income--GMI). Measured by a 30 percent increase
                 in the number of paid GMI beneficiaries.
                 f) Pensions
                 Greater sustainability of pillar 1 pension scheme. Measured by reduction
                 in fiscal deficit by 0.5 percent of GDP relative to baseline in 2012.
                 Reforms in financial sector
                 a) Strengthened contingency planning to reduce potential vulnerabilities
                 and improve resilience and functioning of the financial sector over the
                 longer-term. Measured by systematic increase in the percentage of
                 corporate insolvency cases handled through reorganization proceedings.
                 b) Improved resilience and functioning of the financial sector through
                 regulatory and supervisory changes. Measured by the completion of joint
                 supervision of financial conglomerate groups by the relevant regulators.

Risks and Risk   Romania was hard hit by the global economic crisis. The large fiscal
Mitigation       deficit at the onset of the crisis increased the magnitude of adjustment at a
                 time when the severe economic downturn heightened the difficulties of
                 adjustment. The Government's program, supported by International
                 Financial Institutions (IFIs), rests heavily on strong macroeconomic policy
                 adjustments supported by a large package of external official financial
                 resources to stabilize the economy and support external debt rollover/debt
                 service without excessive pressures on the exchange rate that could
                 weaken the banking sector further.
                 Economic risks that could affect the proposed operation include regional
                 financial market turbulence which could result in lower debt rollover rates
                 or larger capital outflows. Destabilizing exchange rate depreciations could
                 also harm the financial sector. Further RON depreciation could increase
                 bankruptcies and hamper growth. A protracted downturn in the Romanian
                 economy could have a serious impact on the domestic banking sector
                 through increased corporate and household distress. Delays in reform
                 would have a negative impact on market confidence.
                 Political risks stem from an embattled coalition government and coming
                 elections in 2012. Fiscal austerity measures have increased social tensions.
                 These risks are mitigated partially by the size of the multilateral support
                 package, which provides some cushion by allowing reserves accumulation.
                 Higher reserves help counter a worse-than-expected case scenario of
                 capital outflows and prolonged financial sector distress.
                 The content of the program also mitigates risks. In the banking sector, the
                 program supported by the Fund includes in-depth examinations and
                 recapitalization requirements in the event of capital shortfalls, as well as
                 the strengthening of regulatory and supervisory powers. Under the
                                         iv
                         proposed DPL program, these measures are reinforced through
                         contingency planning reforms. These include the preparation of a strategic
                         action plan to govern potential interventions from NBR and MoPF to
                         sustain financial sector stability and the establishment of a framework to
                         facilitate debt restructuring, implemented under DPL1, and encouraging
                         adequate restructuring of viable impaired loans, supported under DPL2.
                         Finally, the fiscal reforms envisaged under the overall program will reduce
                         fiscal pressures both in the short run and over the medium term and
                         contribute to lowering external financing needs.

1.      This program document describes the proposed second loan in a program of three
possible Development Policy Loans (DPL) to Romania for a total amount of  1 billion. The
first DPL (DPL1) disbursed 300 million in September 2009. This second DPL (DPL2) is also
for 300 million. A third DPL (DPL3) for 400 million is tentatively targeted for CY2011. As
outlined in the program document for DPL11, this DPL program supports the Government's
structural reforms in three key areas: a) improving fiscal sustainability and management of public
finances, including at sectoral level in health and education; b) enhancing social protection
systems to address the immediate needs of the poor and vulnerable while ensuring more
sustainable social protection over the longer-term; and c) strengthening contingency planning in,
and the resilience of, the financial sector. The proposed Bank operation reinforces and
complements existing programs by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European
Commission (EC). This document does not discuss the general features of the program to be
supported by the DPL series, which were covered in the DPL1 document mentioned above, but
focuses on developments under the DPL2.

2.      The DPL series is central to the Bank's engagement in Romania as described in the
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) that was presented to the Board on July 16, 2009,
together with DPL1. While financing a relatively small share of the 20 billion package agreed
by the Government with the IMF and the EC, the DPL targets structural reforms which will
considerably improve Romania's medium to long term outlook for sustainable development.

3.       Short term economic and political risks are significant, but the staff considers them
to be manageable. The Government recognizes and addresses these risks. Despite a slower-
than-expected economic recovery, an ambitious fiscal adjustment equivalent to 4.6 percent of
GDP implemented by the Government in July 2010 has put Romania on track to reach the fiscal
targets for the remainder of the 2010-2011. The structural reform agenda is also progressing
satisfactorily, with notable steps on pensions, public wages and labor market reforms.
Commercial banks remain well-capitalized in spite of the increase in non-performing loans
(NPLs), and impact from the turmoil in other EU member countries has been limited. The IMF
Board approved the fifth review of the SBA with Romania on September 24, 2010 and released
the respective tranche. The next review has been tentatively scheduled for January 2011. The EC
has also declared that the program it supports is on track, released its third tranche in September
2010, and will review progress in January 2011.

4.      Since the beginning of the program, the Government has shown strong commitment
to the reform agenda. The Government has pledged publicly and in meetings with the IMF, EC
and the World Bank (hereafter referred to as IFIs) its firm intention to continue to implement its
program of macroeconomic management and structural reforms. The President has issued
numerous public statements in support of the Government's reform program and endorsed
publicly the programs with the IFIs.

                                      II.       COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                  A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

5.      Romania entered the global crisis of 2008 with high growth rates, but also large
macroeconomic imbalances. Real GDP grew at over 6.5 percent per year on average during
2003 to 2008. At the same time, the 2008 external current account deficit reached almost 12
percent of GDP, the trade balance almost 14 percent, and the fiscal deficit almost 5 percent of
GDP. The 2008 inflation stood at almost 8 percent (Table 1).

6.      In 2008 Romania faced major economic and social challenges. From a 9 percent
growth in the third quarter of 2008, the economy had contracted by almost 13 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2008. As a result of the global financial crisis, financial markets faced potential
disruptions arising from liquidity problems in commercial banks. Fiscal revenues plummeted and
Romania faced the prospects of a fiscal deficit in the double digits for 2009.

2009 Developments

7.      In 2009 the economy went into a recession. Growth and demand contracted sharply.
Entering the crisis with the largest structural deficit in the EU of almost 9 percent of GDP in
2008, Romania was forced to impose strict fiscal targets. Economic activity contracted by 7.1
percent. Both consumption and investment declined. Gross domestic investment declined in real
terms by 29.1 percent. Household consumption shrank in real terms by 10.8 percent reflecting the
drop in consumer and mortgage credit and the reduction of households' disposable incomes.

8.       The rapid decline in domestic demand helped ease inflationary pressures in 2009.
Core inflation2 fell from a peak of 8.1 percent in mid-2008 to 2 percent in December 2009. The
decline in headline inflation lagged mostly because of significant hikes in tobacco excises during
2009, and second round pass-through effects of the 15 percent RON depreciation in early 2009.
Still, for 2009 as a whole average headline inflation eased to 5.6 percent, from 7.8 percent in
2008.

 Core inflation figures refer to a measure of CPI which excludes administered prices, volatile prices (especially energy
and food), and prices of main excisable products (i.e., alcohol and tobacco).

9.      The Government adopted strong measures to contain the 2009 fiscal deficit. As
discussed in the DPL1 Program Document3, the 2009 budget included revenue increases and
expenditure cuts totaling 3 percent of GDP. Inter alia, it: (i) increased social contributions by 3.3
percent; (ii) increased property taxes; (iii) eliminated VAT reduction for the purchase of a first
dwelling; (iv) eliminated 137,000 public sector vacancies; (v) reduced non-wage benefits for
public sector employees; and (vi) reduced expenditure on goods and services.

10.     Notwithstanding these measures, the 2009 fiscal deficit reached 7.4 percent of GDP.
Revenue declined by over 8 percent in real terms compared to 2008 to under 32 percent of GDP.
There were significant shortfalls in collection of the VAT, social security contributions and non-
tax revenues. Above all, expenditure increased by 1.5 percent in real terms compared to 2008 to
more than 39 percent of GDP. The rise in expenditure was partly due to social protection
spending to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis, which represented around 10 percent of
GDP in 2009 compared with 8.4 percent in 2008, and which financed mainly general increases in
pensions in 2008 and 2009, a generous inflation indexation of pension benefits, and additional
increases to certain groups of retirees. Revenue shortfalls and expenditure overruns led to
accumulation of arrears by both the central and local governments, primarily to private suppliers
and in particular health sector suppliers.

11.      The current account deficit narrowed to 4.2 percent of GDP, as the fall in domestic
demand reduced the trade deficit from 14 percent of GDP in 2007-2008 to less than 6
percent in 2009. At the same time, the capital account went from a surplus of 15 percent in 2007-
2008 to a deficit of 2 percent in 2009. Private sector flows went from a surplus of almost 9
percent of GDP in 2007-2008 to a deficit of almost 6 percent in 2009. There was less than a full
rollover of maturing debt: rollover of external debt was about 82 percent in the first half of 2009.
However, following agreement on the international program of support, rollover rates stabilized
in the second semester of 2009.

12.      Both external and public debt increased markedly. IFIs, mainly the IMF, provided
over 18 percent of the 48 billion in gross financing requirements for 2009. Almost two-thirds of
the financing requirements were for short-term debt service, and half of financing came from new
short-term borrowing (Table 2). Financing requirements boosted external debt to 219 percent of
exports (over 69 percent of GDP, up from 51 percent in 2008). Public debt increased by almost 9
percent to over 28 percent of GDP, and the public sector debt to revenue ratio increased by almost
50 percent to about 89 percent (Table 3).

13.      Financial markets weathered well the stress in 2009. The three-year Credit Default
Spread (CDS), which stood at an average of 624 basis points in January 2009 declined to 210
basis points by early October 2009. The private sector took the brunt of financial sector
difficulties: domestic credit to the private sector contracted by 2.6 percent in 2009 (year-end at
constant exchange rate) compared with an average growth of over 41 percent in 2007-2008,
largely due to lower demand by enterprises and households, stricter lending standards due to
worsening asset quality and rising provisioning requirements, and crowding out by the rapid
increase in credit to the public sector ­ almost 160 percent higher than in 2008.

14.      The National Bank of Romania (NBR) and the Government took strong measures to
safeguard the stability of financial markets, which helped reassure markets. These measures
included: (i) capital increases in a number of banks; (ii) a broader range of acceptable collateral
for refinancing operations at the central bank; (iii) strengthening of the Deposit Guarantee Fund
including improving the funding regime to increase the actual and targeted coverage ratio; (iv)

 breakdowns by currency; and (vi) NBR review of emergency lending arrangements available to

 15.     The Government took discretionary measures to contain the increase in
 unemployment in 2009. The rise in unemployment was partly contained due to a strong labor
 hoarding effect aided by the Government through a generous "technical unemployment" subsidy
 to companies. The overwhelming majority of the unemployed came from the private sector, as the
 public sector was slow to implement personnel attrition. As a result, registered unemployment4
 increased only from an average of 4 percent of the labor force in 2008 to 6.3 percent in 2009.

 16.     Romania has one of the highest poverty rates in the EU in spite of impressive strides
 in poverty reduction. The poverty rate5 has declined dramatically since 2000, from 36 percent in
 2000 to 5.7 percent in 2008 and 4.4 percent in 2009. Poverty declined in 2009 due to increased
 social protection and insurance spending. The 2009 Household Budget Survey (HBS) reported

that 81 percent of households were receiving at least one social protection benefit, while 51
percent were having benefits from social insurance. The share of social protection beneficiaries is
higher in rural than in urban areas (87 percent versus 77 percent), mainly due to the farmers'
pensions. The 2009 pension increases reduced the rate of poverty among pensioners to 2.9
percent (from 4.2 percent a year before), compared with 5.6 percent for non-pensioners (6.9
percent in 2008).6

2010 Developments

17.     The economic and financial crisis continued throughout 2010, and the Government
was required to take more aggressive steps to address these challenges. The GDP and
domestic demand continued to contract, inflation picked up, and the fiscal deficit remained
unsustainably high in spite of strong adjustment measures taken by the Government. The stress in
financial markets abated and solvency levels improved, but the financial sector remains
vulnerable to the turmoil in international markets and the risk of contagion from Euro zone
member countries. The Government and the National Bank of Romania (NBR) are implementing
strong measures to prevent financial sector problems.

18.      Growth and demand contracted further in 2010, albeit at a slower rate, while
inflation accelerated. GDP decreased by about 2 percent (of which about 0.5 percent due to
flooding), gross domestic investment is estimated to have contracted by 12-15 percent for the
year (after declining by 18.7 percent in the first half), and household consumption declined by 3.5
percent. Inflation will exceed 8 percent in 2010 in spite of declining demand, due to higher food
prices because of flooding and higher world market prices, the 5 percent increase in the VAT rate
to 24 percent, and increases in administered prices. At the same time, there are some indications
that the recession may be coming to an end; the industrial sector, in particular, has grown by 5.2
percent during January ­ September 2010.

19.      The 2010 fiscal deficit remained almost as high as in 2009 at about 7 percent of
GDP, in spite of strict austerity measures taken by the Government. The fiscal deficit could
have exceeded 9 percent of GDP, had the Government not implemented an unprecedented
austerity package on July 1st, 2010, consisting of tax increases and expenditure cuts estimated to
yield savings of 4.6 percent of GDP on an annual basis. Revenue boosting measures, in addition
to the mentioned increase in the VAT rate, included the introduction of a turnover tax on medical
suppliers, significant increases in property taxes, and the reintroduction of taxes on bank deposit
interest and capital gains. In addition, measures to improve tax enforcement included, in
particular, the introduction of indirect control methods and of electronic filing for large and
medium-sized tax contributors. Expenditure cuts included a 25 percent nominal reduction in
public sector wages, the elimination of most public sector wage supplements, a further reduction
in public sector staffing, a reduction in untargeted transfer payments, and cuts in outlays for
goods and services. The cuts in personnel compensation have wiped out in good part the 2005-
2008 pay increases, and public employment is 5 percent lower than at end-2008. These measures
notwithstanding, revenue continued to decline in real terms by 0.5 percent (32.5 percent of GDP).
Expenditure was reduced by 2.4 percent in real terms, but remained above 39 percent of GDP.
Moreover, the Government could not meet its targets for reducing arrears, although it reduced
them sharply in September 2010 when arrears to health sector suppliers were reduced by RON1.9
billion (440 million, or 0.4 percent of GDP). The weak performance is due not only to the
prolonged recession, but also to the inability of State-owned enterprises (SOEs) to meet
obligations to the budget (including contributions to health and social insurance), as well as to the
lax fiscal management by local administrations.

20.     The current account deficit has widened to 6 percent of GDP in 2010, driven by a
further decline in workers' remittances. The trade balance is about the same as in 2009, but
with a positive trend: both exports and imports are higher (21 and 16 percent, respectively) than
in 2009, pointing to an incipient recovery of economic activity. The increase in exports is
particularly encouraging, and may indicate increased competitiveness due to lower costs of inputs
and labor. At the same time, workers' remittances declined further from 2009: current transfers
balance is estimated at around 2.8 percent of GDP, down from 4.2 percent in 2009. The FDI
balance in 2010 is lower than in 2009 at under 3 billion (2.6 percent of GDP).

21.      Balance of payments financing requirements have remained considerable in 2010,
though lower than in 2009. Gross requirements are estimated at about 35 billion, of which 52
percent is for financing short-term debt. Over 60 percent of financing is coming from short-term
borrowing and 20 percent from IFIs. External debt is about the same as in 2009 at 218 percent of
exports, while public debt increased markedly from 28 percent to 34 percent of GDP, and the
ratio of public debt to revenue reached almost 105 percent.

22.     The stress on financial markets has eased in 2010. The turmoil in the financial
markets due to the Greek crisis has resulted in an increase in Romanian CDS again but, at an
average of 285 basis points for November 2010, the CDS remains well below its peak in late
2008-early 2009 (780 basis points on February 24, 2009) and has declined by around 80 basis
points since September 2010. Funding costs of Banks have also eased in domestic and external
markets. Since the agreement on the international support package the exchange rate has
remained broadly stable. The stock market has also improved, up over 150 percent in November
2010 from February 25, 2009. In light of the strengthening of Romania's external position, EBCI
lowered the floor for the exposure commitment of the banks to 95 percent.

23.      Capital adequacy ratios7 remain relatively high, but credit to the private sector
remains low. The capital adequacy rate was 14.6 percent in September 2010, about the same as
in 2009. All banks have a capital adequacy rate of over 11 percent, compared to a statutory
minimum of 8 percent. After declining (at constant exchange rate) in 2009, credit to the private
sector has increased in 2010 by more than 7 percent, although the increase is more modest than
that of credit to the public sector, which increased by a further 15 percent after the 160 percent
increase of the previous year, and represents now 20 percent of total bank loans, compared with 8
percent at end-2008. Non-performing loans (NPLs, representing loans and interests classified as
doubtful and loss) rose to 20.2 percent at end-September 2010, up from 4.7 percent in June 2008
and 11.7 percent in 2009.

24.      Prudential regulations have been strengthened to address the risks of contagion
from the turmoil in European financial markets. The contingency plans mandated by the
Strategic Action Plan for strengthening the financial sector are being reviewed by the NBR
supervision department to verify the credibility of the assumptions and the robustness of the
banks' emergency funding arrangements. The reporting framework that the NBR has put in place
monitors exposures that do not appear in the local banks' balance sheets (such as parent group
direct exposure to Romanian entities).

25.     While an estimate of the poverty impact of the crisis and of the measures supported
by the DPL is not yet available, it is likely that overall impact will be modest. In 2009,
poverty scored a decade-long minimum, with 4.4% of the population living in absolute poverty,
compared to 35.9% a decade earlier. Strong redistributive policies during 2009 have pushed
poverty down despite the economic crisis. The prospects for maintaining progress in poverty

reduction in 2010 are comparatively more favorable than in 2009, since the rate of economic
decline slowed.       There are a number of factors that could contribute to decrease in living
standards in 2010, such as: (i) high unemployment levels, though declining from over 8.3
percent in early 2010 to around 7 percent currently; (ii) unfavorable climatic conditions which
have affected rural population; (iii) higher inflation, reducing real incomes across the board; (iv)
massive cuts in the compensation of public sector employees, who lost not only 25 percent in
basic salaries, but also numerous other benefits; and (v) cuts in untargeted social transfers. But
this decline in living standards is distributed primarily among middle- to upper-income
households.

26.     The impact of the cuts in public sector wages and untargeted social transfers on the
poor is mitigated by several factors: First, the incidence of poverty among public servants is
very low. There is a minimum wage floor of 600 RON per month that is high enough to maintain
the living standards of civil-servant households above the poverty line. Second, the social
assistance programs that have been reduced are programs with low targeting performance that
affect mostly middle and upper income households. The main measures include the reduction in
the "child raising" allowance by 15 percent, the elimination of the new family allowance and the
package ("trusou") and allowance for new born babies. Third, the policy to top-off low-pensions
to a minimum of RON350 continued during 2010; this measure had the largest poverty reduction
impact in 2009. And fourth, the budget of the GMI was protected, and the family allowances
program was redesigned to have a greater poverty alleviation impact.

                 B. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

27.      The overall macroeconomic framework is deemed satisfactory to proceed with the
proposed DPL, although the medium term outlook continues to be subject to uncertainties
and risks. The resumption of growth in 2011 hinges on the pace of recovery in Western Europe
and successful implementation of the reform program. Risks include a more protracted than
expected downturn in the Romanian economy with consequences for government's fiscal position
and a negative impact on bank balance sheets, and exchange rate volatility. Political and social
risks are also significant. These risks are discussed in detail in Chapter V.

28.     Growth is expected to resume in 2011 though at low rates, and to pick-up further in
2012. Economic growth is projected to resume in 2011 at 1.5 percent, accelerate in 2012 to 4.4
percent of GDP, and continue at 4.0-4.5 percent per annum over the medium term, driven by the
recovery of the global economic environment, renewed investor confidence, and steady increase
in domestic demand at 4-5 percent per annum as of 2012. The output gap due to the crisis would
close by 2015. Year-end inflation would gradually decline to 3.7 percent in 2011 and 3 percent in
2012.

29.      Bringing the fiscal deficit down in a sustainable way while ensuring a resumption of
growth remain the principal medium term challenges for the Government. While the
policies currently in place should enable Romania to meet both the 2011 and 2012 fiscal deficit
targets, there are significant implementation challenges to key elements of the reform program.
The containment of current spending in the medium term depends on the ability of the
government to retain the bulk of the wage cuts throughout 20118, a continued reduction in public
employment and the implementation of the new pension and unitary pay laws as planned.
Healthcare reforms will have to address the formidable pressures for expenditure overruns as in
the past. The government will also need to resist the temptation, especially in the run up of the

2012 elections, to reduce taxes or social contributions or to delay the rationalization of the social
assistance programs. Also, successful implementation of the revenue-enhancing measures
requires addressing the capacity constraints of tax administration.
30.     The Government is committed to enhancing revenue performance through tax
policy reform, measures to improve tax collection, and faster absorption of EU funds:
         Ad hoc changes to the tax system will be strictly limited, with a view to ensuring
         predictability and stability, and promoting growth and competitiveness. Once firmly on
         track to meeting deficit targets, the Government will undertake a comprehensive review
         of the tax system with a view to its revenue-neutral optimization and simplification ­ in
         consultation with, and with the assistance of, the IMF and the World Bank. Contingent on
         fiscal space, they will consider a gradual reduction in labor taxation with a view to
         enhancing competitiveness.
         Efforts to enhance tax collection will focus on the 25,000 largest taxpayers (who provide
         80 percent of revenue), increased taxation of high net wealth individuals, strengthened
         auditing of unreported income, introduction of compulsory electronic filing for medium
         and large taxpayers, and measures in customs administration to reduce tax evasion.
         To improve mobilization of EU funds, the Government intends to strengthen the
         administrative capacity of units managing them, modernize the legislative and regulatory
         framework for public investment and other expenditure eligible for EU financing,
         encourage public-private partnerships, and give priority to public investments co-
         financed with the EU.

31.     The Government is also planning to continue in 2011 expenditure restraint, reduce
the drain of SOEs on the budget, and prevent further accumulation of arrears:
         To contain expenditure, the 2011 wage bill is projected to decrease by 4 percent in
         nominal terms (0.7 percent of GDP), the reduction of public employment will continue,
         there will be better control of expenditures, and health and education sector reforms will
         seek to improve service delivery while achieving financial savings. A health sector
         restructuring plan is being implemented, limiting wage spending on physician service and
         drug costs escalation, and reducing hospital costs through better hospital management.
         To reduce the drain of SOEs on the budget, the Government intends to take steps to
         reduce the losses of the ten largest loss-making SOEs, continue SOEs privatization
         program and divestiture of State minority share in firms, and reform the transportation
         sector to reduce losses and clear arrears of major railway and road transports SOEs.
         To reverse the accumulation of payment arrears by the central government, the
         Government is planning to integrate the accounting reporting system with the Treasury
         payment system by end-March 2011, use budget appropriations as commitment ceilings,
         require line ministries to monitor their subordinated units in observing ceilings, and
         enforce sanctions against institutions and individuals who breach the ceilings.
         Performance criteria for the stock of the general government arrears have been introduced
         in the ongoing SBA for December 2010, as well as an indicative target for April 2011.To
         prevent further build-up of arrears by local governments, as of 2011 they will be required
         to include arrears repayment in budget execution and will not be able to commit to new
         expenditures or contract loans until previous obligations are repaid.9

  The relevant amendments to the Local Public Finance Law were enacted in June 2010. A Government ordinance has
also been issued allowing local governments the use of swap agreements to offset mutual debts and partially clear
arrears.
                                                       9
32.     The Government aims to meet by 2012 the Growth and Stability Pact fiscal deficit
target of 3 percent of GDP. This requires a vigorous pursuit of the adjustment and structural
reform agenda. The 2011 fiscal deficit is projected at 4.4 percent of GDP. The economic recovery
and continued expenditure restraint will make the achievement of the Maastricht fiscal target of 3
percent of GDP feasible by 2012. Following the recent enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility
Legislation, the Government approved a medium-term Fiscal Strategy for 2011-13. The strategy
commits to observing the 3 percent fiscal deficit target by 2012, giving priority to investments co-
financed by EU funds, and allowing wage increases in accordance with the unitary pay law to
recoup the recent wage cuts. The fiscal deficit is projected to continue to decline to 1.4 percent of
GDP by 2015.

33.     The external balance is projected to stabilize over the medium-term, subject to
addressing bottlenecks affecting competitiveness and recovery in EU-15 countries. Structural
reforms pursued in the public and financial sectors, as well as the measures to enhance labor
market flexibility such as the ongoing revision of the Labor Code and the removal of barriers to
doing business will help ensure a stable external balance in the medium term, with a current
account deficit in the 6 percent range in 2011-2013 and declining to 5 percent by 2015, well
below pre-crisis levels. This stabilization would benefit from the anticipated economic rebound of
the EU-15 member countries, dynamic exports growing at historical highs, moderate import
growth contained by the real exchange rate depreciation that has taken place since mid-2008, and
the pick-up in workers' remittances. FDI flows are expected to reach 3.7 percent of GDP over the
medium-term, providing the bulk of the financing of the current account deficit, although they
will remain well below their pre-crisis levels of almost 7 percent of GDP.

34.     Romania's financing needs in 2011 will be lower than the previous two years. Gross
external financing needs in 2011 are estimated at 33 billion, 2.2 billion less than in 2009, due to
smaller claims on the build-up of reserves and increasing FDI (Table 2). The projections assume
rollover rates for amortizing debt of 100 percent for banks and 116 percent for corporates.

35.      External debt will continue to rise in 2011 but by 2015 will gradually return to the
pre-crisis levels of under 50 percent of GDP, while the ratio of public debt to revenue will
stabilize at slightly over 30 percent of GDP. (Table 3). External debt is projected at almost 75
percent of GDP and over 217 percent of exports in 2011. Public debt will also be higher though
manageable at over 36 percent of GDP, and its ratio to revenue will exceed 111 percent in 2011.
The Government will seek to extend the maturity of public debt and consolidate the financial
buffers.

                           III.     THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

36.     Romania's overarching objective to achieve convergence with the EU in terms of
income and living standards is articulated in the National Reform Program (NRP). With a
GDP per capita of 45 percent of the EU 27 average, Romania must close a large gap. The pursuit
of the convergence agenda has been articulated in the NRP which is promoting sustainable and
equitable economic growth in the context of the European Lisbon Strategy. The NRP, updated
annually and reviewed by the European Commission, complements the four themes of the Lisbon
Agenda ­ investing in people and modernizing labor markets, unlocking the business potential,
especially of SMEs, investing in knowledge and innovation, and energy and climate change ­
with the need to improve the quality and management of administrative capacity and government
expenditure in the context of prudent macroeconomic policies. As of 2011 the NRP will be
aligned with the objectives and targets of Europe 2020 Agenda, the successor of the Lisbon
Agenda.

37.     The agenda of the governing coalition is formulated in a Government program for
the period 2009-2012.10 The objectives of the program are twofold: first, dealing with the effects
of the crisis by stimulating confidence in the economy and mitigating its adverse impact in
general, and on the poor and vulnerable in particular; and second, anchoring short-term measures
in a medium-term structural reform agenda that would support economic growth and resume
progress towards convergence with EU living standards, social cohesion and eventual entry into
the Euro-zone. The Government recognizes the need to re-focus the policy attention on the large
unfinished structural reform agenda.

38.     The DPL is aligned with the measures proposed by the Government for the 2009-
2012 Program and which cover three broad categories: (i) improving fiscal sustainability and
management of public finances; (ii) strengthening social assistance and social protection; and (iii)
enhancing the resilience of the financial sector. These measures are detailed below and to the
extent possible linked to each phase of the DPL program.

                                     A. IMPROVING PUBLIC FINANCES

Strengthening the medium-term expenditure framework

39.      The non-functional medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) hampers sound
fiscal management. Medium term expenditure projections have had so far little impact on
planning and budgeting. Annual budgets are revised frequently during the year to accommodate
ad-hoc measures ­ resulting in low predictability of the budget and poor fiscal discipline, and
impeding the ability of ministries to plan and manage effectively. In particular, staffing decisions
and agreements to increase wages often exceed approved budgets, leading to reallocations and
large discrepancies between budgets and actual spending. Multiannual capital investment projects
suffer from weak programming, delaying implementation and increasing costs.

40.     Under the 2009-2012 Program the Government is committed to gradually
consolidate the MTEF implementation over the medium-term. The MTEF will enhance
aggregate fiscal discipline and improve the allocation of resources. A more disciplined budget
process is critical in the current environment of severe fiscal constraints:
            In phase 1 the MTEF was approved by Parliament and submitted in the 2009 annual
            report on the EC Convergence Program. It included actual spending for 2008, detailed

10
     www.gov.ro/programul-guvernare-2009-2012.
                                                 12
         estimates of expenditures for 2009 and broad fiscal aggregates for 2010-11. Within
         expenditures, it included a breakout by type of budget (e.g., state, local, etc.), and
         expenditures by main economic classification, i.e., personnel, operations and
         maintenance, transfers and subsidies, capital (fixed and non-fixed), and debt service.
         In the current phase 2 the Parliament approved the MTEF for 2010-2012 and the
         Government submitted it to the EC. As of 2011 the MTEF includes fiscal risks analysis
         and binding aggregate expenditure ceilings under the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL),
         with strict rules enforcing the ceilings, rigorous monitoring, and severe penalties for
         failure to comply with the approved ceilings. The FRL requires approval of the MTEF
         by the Parliament prior to voting on the annual budget, and prohibits new measures
         during the budget year that increase aggregate expenditures beyond the limits agreed
         under the MTEF. Collective bargaining agreements on public sector wages will be
         subject to MTEF ceilings for personnel costs and will be valid only within that
         framework. An annex to the MTEF will allocate capital expenditures across existing
         projects to ensure their timely completion, articulate the policy rationale for the
         allocations, and propose fiscal scenarios for years 2 and 3. Projects that could not be
         completed within the period due to funding limitations will be prioritized for redesign,
         cancellation, or new funding authorization. The Government also drafted a Fiscal
         Strategy for the period 2011-13 with technical assistance from the Bank.
         In the next phase the Government will enact the MTEF for 2011-2013, with ceilings for
         major ministries that use at least 70 percent of the budget subject to consultations with
         the newly created Fiscal Council. The 2011-2013 MTEF has been submitted to the
         Parliament after the Fiscal Council declared it to be in line with the fiscal strategy, and is
         consistent with the FRL guidelines. The Parliament has scheduled the debate on the
         MTEF for end-December 2010.

Reforming public pay and employment

41.      Personnel costs consume a large component of the consolidated budget and are not
anchored in performance objectives. Aggregate personnel spending expanded by 66 percent in
real terms from 2005 to 2008. The growth of expenditure stems from both increased staffing and
higher salaries. The number of approved employment positions increased at all levels of
government, including the central level (20 percent), local governments (17 percent), and other
public institutions (35 percent). Salary adjustments were granted across the board following
negotiations with public sector unions, rather than being performance-based.

42.      Romania's public pay system has changed little over the years and falls short of
modern systems: i) non-wage compensation represents a disproportionate share of total
compensation and undermines transparency and equity; ii) large pay disparities among positions
with similar responsibilities distort rational deployment of skills; iii) compressed salary scales and
over reliance on seniority undercut incentives to acquire new skills and assume new
responsibilities; and iv) compensation decisions are not linked to private sector compensation and
are based on the bargaining power of trade unions, and/or arbitrary assessments made by
decision-makers. Staff opinion surveys highlight a widespread belief that hiring, compensation
and promotion policies and practices undermine the integrity, and hence effectiveness of the civil
service, and do not respect the principles of merit-based recruitment and advancement of staff.

43.      The public pay reform agenda under the Government's 2009-2012 Program fosters
fundamental changes to enhance the capacity of public administration to attract and retain
critical skills, and reward performance. The new pay and grading system for the public sector
is based on well-established principles: (i) a grade structure that promotes equal pay for equal
                                               13
work using a modern job evaluation methodology based on occupation and job responsibilities;
(ii) assignment of all positions within a grade to a job family based on the content of the actual
work responsibilities; (iii) a single, unified pay-scale for all public institutions, defining base rates
for all jobs in all grades; (iv) incentives for staff willing and able to assume greater
responsibilities in any grade or job family; and (v) unified control of the public service.

44.      The 2009-2012 Program will gradually implement the new pay and grading system:
         In phase 1 the Government eliminated or reduced as of April 2009 some non-wage
         bonuses and allowances, enacted a Unitary Pay Law (UPL) in October 2009, and
         established a Pay Commission to ensure that the design and implementation of the
         reformed pay system respect the structure and principles laid out in the UPL.
           The April 2009 Ordinance began reducing the share of the non-wage component in
           total compensation in order to enhance the transparency of the pay system.
           The UPL sets out the structure and principles behind a new pay system and a strict
           timetable for introduction of subsidiary legislation on specific implementation
           procedures and schedules: i) it limits non-wage personnel expenditures and bonuses
           for non-military personnel to 30 percent; ii) sets a salary grading structure based on
           job responsibility and qualification; iii) sets salary grades that align pay in the
           public sector for selected benchmark positions to actual labor market conditions
           (through a salary survey); iv) reduces disparities in pay between similar performing
           positions; v) enhances career advancement for high-performing public servants; and
           vi) articulates an implementation plan for the introduction of the new pay system
           fully costed and consistent with the medium term budget projections. An
           implementing law was submitted to the Parliament in October 2010.
           Implementation will take place over several years and its pace is contingent on the
           mobilization of the necessary fiscal resources. The proposed procedures mandate
           quarterly reports on the effectiveness of the new human resource management
           policies (e.g., turnover by position, qualified applicants for positions, etc.).
           The Pay Commission issued a Pay System Reform report in June 2010, to aid in
           drafting the implementing legislation of the UPL.
         In current phase 2 the Framework UPL will be implemented as of 2011, together with
         measures to monitor the application of civil service policies on merit-based recruitment.
         In the next phase the Government will introduce subsidiary legislation and procedures to
         enhance compliance with new personnel policies.

45.      The reform of public pay and employment is complemented by Functional Reviews
(FRs) of the Ministries. The FRs will help the Government identify needed reforms in the area
of strategic management, organizational structures, budget and human resources management,
performance management, and client orientation. The EC has taken the lead role in the FRs,
financed them, and assessed their implementation. The Bank is the executing agency: it
submitted in October 2010 to the Government FRs for transport, agriculture, public finance center
of Government, and competition; by March 2011 it will analyze six more sectors, including
health, economy, environment, regional development, labor and social policy, and higher
education, research and development. The Government is preparing action plans for reforms
based on these reviews which will become part of their core program in the coming period (and
see paragraph 65).

Improving public finances in health services

46.     Increased expenditure on health has not translated into better health standards and
improved patient satisfaction. Health financing comes from contributions to the National Health
Insurance Fund (CNAS) and taxes. Expenditure increased from 2.9 percent of GDP in 1990 to 3.7
percent of GDP in 2007. However, and in spite of a significant improvement in health indicators
since the 1970s, Romania's health status remains poor compared to other European countries.
Moreover, as discussed below, there are major inequities in access to, and quality of medical care.

47.     CNAS cannot meet adequately the demand for health services due to important
deficiencies: i) co-payment mechanisms do not fully cover the cost of the benefits package,
forcing providers, especially hospitals, to shift the costs of drugs, medical supplies and food to
patients and denying poor patients critical care; ii) escalating drug costs consume an increasing
proportion of resources. iii) purchasing and payment methods favor expensive hospital care.; iv)
the performance of primary care providers and their role as gatekeepers are not well monitored;
and v) Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) rates are generally too low to recover the hospitals' costs.

48.     The hospital infrastructure is fairly large, poorly managed, and financially unsound.
Progress with hospital reform has been limited to the introduction of new payment mechanisms.
The number of hospitals has increased since the 1980s (416 hospitals in 1980 and 447 in 2007, of
which 425 public) while population declined. Romania had 6.4 beds per 1,000 people in 2007,
compared with the EU average of 5.7. Many cases are treated in hospitals even if they could be
handled on an outpatient basis, due to dysfunctional referral links between primary care,
ambulatory services and hospitals. Many Romanian hospitals have incurred financial debts in
recent years despite a substantial increase in health insurance collections and an expansion of the
health service budget, due to poor management systems, weak fiscal discipline, and perverse
incentives. Fiscal constraints in 2009-2010 have led to a further increase in hospital arrears.

49.    The Government's 2009-2012 program supports health sector reforms aimed at
mobilizing resources and improving the efficiency and equity of service provision. On the
demand side, the reforms include measures to move away from expensive hospital based services
towards less costly outpatient and primary care services, as well as the introduction of co-
payments differentiated according to the amount and level of health services required, to replace
informal payments with transparent fees.11 On the supply side, the program would support the
Government's efforts to rationalize hospital infrastructure, improve the mechanisms governing
the use of new drugs and technologies, and review the package of benefits insured by the
Government, to exclude coverage of costly non-essential health services:
            In phase 1 the Government implemented ahead of schedule legislation to increase the
            excise duty on tobacco with a view to mobilizing additional resources for the health
            sector, and new cost-saving regulations governing drug pricing and promotion of generic
            drugs in the framework contracts concluded by CNAS with service suppliers.
            In phase 3 the Government will enact legislation to introduce co-payments (including
            exemptions for the poor), and revise provider payment mechanisms.




11
     In 2008, 60 percent of patients hospitalized declared having paid some amount without receipt.
                                                            15
Improving public finances in education

50.      The quality of general education can benefit from more efficient use of resources.12
Coherent and sustained policies and programs for curriculum upgrading, teacher training, and
learning tools would make possible better learning outcomes. The resources needed to finance
such programs are drained by the priority allocation to financing salaries and school investment
and maintenance. The evolution of the number of classes and teachers has not reflected the steady
decline in school-age population13. Local authorities and school principals have had little
financial incentive to rationalize the class size and teachers' load by merging classes and closing
down under-utilized schools, because until now public financing of general education has been
tied to inputs ­ primarily the number of teachers ­ rather than to outputs ­ the number of students
enrolled or graduating. The end result has been low efficiency of spending and lack of resources
for improving the quality of education.

51.      The Government's program supports the rationalization of the school system and
better use of resources through the use of per student financing. The reform will provide
local authorities and schools with financial incentives to use resources more efficiently and take
the reallocation decisions needed to address quality enhancement objectives. The introduction of
per student financing will also mark progress towards performance-based budgeting and enhance
the transparency of the allocation process, and the accountability of budget management:
          In phase 1 a Government decision in December 2009 (subsequently modified in April
          2010)14 set the standards for per student financing formula and per county budget
          allocations for 2010 based on these standards. The number of classes was reduced in
          2009-2010, increasing the average class size from 20.6 to 21.7.
          In the current phase 2 the law of education establishes the principle of per student
          financing and the next steps for implementation, and per student financing mechanisms
          will be implemented nationally. The Law has been adopted by the Parliament in
          December 2010.

52.       The Government needs to build strong consensus towards the education sector
reform, and manage potential risks. School closures are usually met with negative reactions
from parents, representatives of the community, and local authorities. Providing incentives to use
resources more efficiently also carries risks. For instance, to lower costs, principals may opt for
less-experienced teachers who command lower salaries, at the expense of the quality of teaching.
The Government must encourage beneficiaries and suppliers of education to work together. It
would also need to take urgent steps to enhance the capacity of local administrations and school
officials to manage these new responsibilities. Once the per student formula is in place, the
Government will implement measures to ensure the effectiveness of per student financing, in
particular greater autonomy granted to local actors, including school principals and municipal and
district education officers.


12
   The quality of education as measured by international tests such as PISA (2001 and 2006) and TIMSS (1999, 2003
and 2007) has worsened over the past ten years, in spite of a constant trend towards smaller classes and lower
student/teacher ratios, and notwithstanding a tripling of per student expenditure (in constant price terms).
13
   At the primary level, where comparable data exists for a long time period, Romania's pupil teacher ratio has fallen to
less than 15.9 in 2008, compared to 24.1 in 1990 (i.e. a 34 percent drop) (Source: World Bank Edstat).
14
   The initial program projected piloting this reform in eight counties, to enable per student financing in September of
2010 (i.e. at the beginning of the 2010/11 school year) (DPL2) and enact legislation to allow schools in these counties
to receive their budget according to a per capita finance formula (DPL3). The Government decided to move ahead
faster than initially envisioned in the program and introduced per student financing for the entire school system on
January 1, 2010 (Government Decision no. 1618/2009, modified by Decision no. 369/2010).
                                                          16
                                B. STRENGTHENING SOCIAL PROTECTION

Targeting social assistance

53.      Increased social protection spending since late 2008 to mitigate the impact of the
crisis helped reduced poverty, but has been costly. The poverty rate decreased from 36 percent
in 2000 to 5.7 percent in 2008 and 4.4 percent in 2009, although Romania still had 1.2 million
poor in 2008 and over 900,000 in 2009. The 2009 decline in the poverty rate during a difficult
economic crisis has been due in part to increases in the minimum pension that trickled down to
many poor households, but which proved to be costly and not well-targeted. As mentioned
before, social spending rose in 2009 to 10 percent of GDP, compared to 8.4 percent a year before.

54.     The targeting efficiency of family allowances-- the largest social assistance benefits
in terms of coverage and spending-- is at the lower end of international comparators. There
are four main family allowances programs15: i) Universal Child Allowance (UCA), a non means-
tested cash transfer for children up to 18; ii) Complementary Child Allowance (CCA)--an
income-tested cash transfer for families whose children reside with both parents; iii) Lone Parent
Allowance (LPA)-- an income-tested transfer applicable to families whose children reside only
with one parent ; and iv) Child Care Leave/Child Raising Benefit--a non-means tested cash
transfer paid to mothers of children under two. The income-tested benefits (CCA and LPA)
perform relatively well, although there is room for improvement. Their targeting accuracy
(percentage of total benefits going to the poorest 20 percent of the population) stood in 2009 at 51
percent for CCA and 52 percent for LPA, compared with 82 percent for the Guaranteed Minimum
Income (GMI), the main social assistance program.16

55.      The effectiveness of social assistance is undermined by several constraints: (i) lack of
coherence and overlapping objectives due to the numerous, fragmented social assistance
programs; (ii) inadequate targeting to poor families with children, as 80 percent of the
expenditure on child and family benefits goes to universal programs; (iii) insufficient coverage of
the best targeted program, the GMI; and (iv) flawed financing and administrative arrangements of
the GMI, causing partial and/or delayed payments to beneficiaries.

56.    The Government program supports the increase of the GMI eligibility threshold
and improved GMI funding and administrative arrangements:
         In phase 1 GMI funding increased and the LPA and CCA were spared budget cuts. The
         2010 State budget earmarked GMI funding and assumed its integral financing,
         eliminating the 20 percent contribution of local governments, which sometimes resulted
         in partial payments if local governments were fiscally constrained. In the first semester of
         2010 the resources allocated to the GMI increased by 19 percent relative to the first
         semester of 2009. During the same period, the number of families benefiting from the
         GMI went up by 15 percent in gross terms and 3 percent in net terms17, to reach 222,176
         families. Stricter enforcement of eligibility conditions led to discontinuing GMI
         payments for about 12 percent of recipients.



15
   The total expenditure on family allowances in 2009 was about 1.06 percent of GDP, with the UCA accounting for the
highest share (0.59 percent of GDP), followed by child raising allowances (0.35 percent of GDP) and income tested
benefits (about 0.12 percent of GDP).
16
   GMI has a targeting accuracy comparable to that of the food stamps program in the US.
17
   The gross number of beneficiaries increased by 15 percent but 12 percent of the initial recipients lost benefits
following tighter eligibility controls.
                                                        17
         In current phase 2 the emergency ordinance protecting GMI funding was enacted into
         law. The Government has initiated legislation aimed at improving the targeting of the two
         income-tested child allowances--the Complementary Child Allowance (CCA) and the
         Lone Parent Allowance (LPA).18 The flat family benefit is replaced with a per-child
         benefit and provides larger benefits for the poorest decile. The new benefit schedule: (i)
         reduces the eligibility threshold of the income tested family programs to RON 370
         (limiting benefits to the first three income deciles); (ii) provides higher benefits to
         families with incomes below RON 200 (effectively families in the first decile); and (iii)
         uses a per child benefit formula up to the first four children.
         In the next phase the GMI budget will be transferred to the Ministry of Labor, Family and
         Social Protection (MoLFSP) and administered through the National Agency for Social
         Benefits (NASB). Payments to beneficiaries will be executed through banks and post
         offices. Local governments will maintain entitlement and recertification attributions. The
         administration of the GMI budget by MoLFSP and its payment through NASB is in the
         process of being legislated with a view of becoming effective on January 1, 2011. The
         transfer of the GMI budget will increase the predictability and transparency of the benefit
         payments and reduce the potential for errors and fraud. Local governments would no
         longer have the discretion to allocate among various expenditure categories, as was the
         case in 2009, when the GMI was financed from a conditional block grant.

Pursuing the financial sustainability of the pension system

57.     The Romanian public pension system (Pillar 1) is no longer self-financed.
Comprehensive reforms since 2001 combined with better revenue collection supported by steady
economic growth helped achieve a fragile surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2006 and 0.2 percent
of GDP in 2007. These gains were reversed in 2008 and 2009, when the Government increased
the general level of pensions relative to the average wage (the pension point value19) and granted
pension increases to certain groups of beneficiaries. The system ran a fiscal deficit of 1.3 percent
of GDP in 2009 and 1.8 percent in 2010, in spite of a pension freeze at the end of 2009.20
Without strong measures the deficit will continue to increase.

58.     The fiscal pressure on the public pension system stems from a number of structural
weaknesses: i) generous indexation rules, linking pension benefits to wages; ii) a low retirement
age, especially for women, in spite of the 2001 reforms which gradually increased the retirement
age through 2014 from 55 to 60 for women and from 60 to 65 for men; iii) relatively weak
disincentives for early retirement21; and iv) lax eligibility criteria for disability pensions.

59.      The Government program supports reforms addressing the fiscal sustainability of
Pillar 1 over the medium- to long-term:
         In phase 1 the Government tightened controls on pension expenditures. Based on the
         actual expenditures in the first few months of 2010 pension expenditures for the year as a

18
   The legislation reduces the eligibility threshold from 470 RON per month per capita to 370 RON, provides higher
benefits to households earning below 200 RON and single parent families, and maintains the nominal value of the UCA
benefit in 2010 at the same level as in 2009.
19
   Romania has a point-based public pension system. In a point system, a working individual accumulates points for
every year of contributions based on the ratio between his wage and the average wage. At the time of retirement,
accumulated points are divided by the total number of years of contributions. This gives an average number of points,
which is then multiplied by the point value to calculate the pension to be offered to that particular person.
20
   Pensions expenditure was projected to increase marginally, by 0.04 percent.
21 The penalty for early retirement is 0.45 percent of the full-length pension for each month of early retirement. Once
retirement age is achieved, the full pension is restored.
                                                         18
          whole would have increased by 5 percent in the absence of adjustments. The main reason
          for this was the doubling of the number of new beneficiaries in 2009 compared with
          2008, due to a sharp increase in disability and early pensioners. The Government is
          conducting a rigorous review of the eligibility of disability pension beneficiaries and
          recalculating higher-end pensions for certain categories of retirees.
          In current phase 2 a new pension law will change the indexation rule to link adjustments
          in pension benefits to inflation (while maintaining the existing wage valorization22 and
          the link between contributions and benefits.23, and gradually increase the retirement age
          for women. These reforms will generate significant fiscal savings in the longer term.
          In the next phase the Government will design and implement measures to improve social
          protection for the elderly poor.

60.      The Government program also supports the restoration of scheduled contributions
to Pillar 2. The second pension pillar was enacted in 2006 in order to address future fiscal
constraints. Its contribution rate, starting at 2 percent, was projected to increase by 0.5 percentage
points per year until it reached 6 percent. However, the increment planned for 2009 was
suspended, potentially threatening the viability of the scheme and jeopardizing the government's
long term objective of reducing the fiscal impact of public pensions. In the current phase 2 the
Government is restoring the projected pace of contributions to Pillar 2, although not making up
for the 2009 shortfall.

                    C. ENHANCING THE RESILIENCE OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR

61.     Contingency planning to maintain the stability of the financial sector and enhance
the resilience and functioning of the financial sector over the medium term are central to
the government's crisis management agenda:

          In phase 1 the Government approved a Strategic Action Plan addressing potential
          stability risks in the financial sector. This plan includes a dynamic classification of banks
          by their importance and a methodology of potential interventions of the National Bank of
          Romania (NBR), the Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF) and other financial supervisors
          in the resolution of illiquid or insolvent banks according to their systemic importance and
          other relevant parameters (e.g., the quality of governance, the capacity of shareholders to
          raise capital, etc.).
          In current phase 2 the Government supports restructuring of viable impaired loans and
          corporate debt, regulatory and supervisory reforms enhancing the political independence
          and the autonomy of sector regulators, and Basel II implementation: (i) Consumer Debt
          Restructuring Guidelines facilitate debt restructuring to avoid judicial action and the
          foreclosures of residential properties whenever possible24; (ii) an amended insolvency

22
    Valorization is the process of adjustment of past contributions to account for the changes in the value of
contributions between the time they are paid and the time pension is claimed or calculated. In a point system,
valorization is analogous to the procedure used to update the pension point value.
23
   Indexation of existing pensions is based on the indexation of the point value which will be gradually linked to
inflation. The point value is set at 43.3 percent of gross average wage and adjusted by inflation and 50 percent of real
wage growth during 2012 and 2020 (following a continued pension freeze in 2011). Full inflation indexation will be
reached by 2028.
24
   The guidelines establish principles for the restructuring of mortgage loans addressing, inter alia, rules of engagement
for all parties and elements of proper restructuring. They are voluntary and do not alter the rights and obligations of the
parties under the original contract, but aim to promote out-of-court negotiations and loan restructuring between debtors
and creditors
                                                           19
          law and Guidelines for Corporate Debt Restructuring allow pre-packaged reorganization
          plans and remove impediments to out-of-court corporate rehabilitation and restructuring;
          and (iii) a robust policy and decision making process is being introduced for the
          assessment and accreditation of Basel II advanced models.25

          In the next phase the Government will enhance the supervision of financial groups across
          sub-sectors. Supervision is now largely sub-sector-based, with little coordination between
          the various supervisors, despite the existence of financial groups whose activities span
          several sub-sectors. While there is an MOU among the supervisors on collaboration, in
          practice this collaboration has been limited. For instance, there are no joint inspections of
          financial groups by the various supervisors and little supervisory attention seems to be
          devoted to intra-group transactions and risk concentrations. The NBR will take steps to
          review and update as needed the definition of financial groups, and adapt supervision
          arrangements accordingly.26 The Government is also updating the legislation on the
          political independence and financial autonomy of financial sector regulators.

                                   D. CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION

62.     The Government is consulting stakeholders periodically and informing the public
on proposed reforms and measures. Public consultation is guaranteed by required posting of
new legislative policy initiatives on the internet for 30 days of consultations and feedback, with a
background note justifying them and discussing their expected social and economic impact.
While policies introduced through emergency ordinances are exempt, such ordinances must be
endorsed by the Parliament upon effectiveness, and must thus comply with public consultation
requirements. The Government holds public consultation meetings for important projects.

63.     The Government has carried out extensive consultations with stakeholders on the
specific reform measures under DPL2 which has resulted in greater understanding and
ownership. Draft legislation and strategic policy documents which are prior actions and
benchmarks for the DPL have been posted on the websites of the initiating line ministries for
public debate. For most, consultative sessions were organized with the concerned stakeholders.
For example, consultations took place with trade unions on the draft Unitary Pay Law. The trade
unions were invited and accepted to join the Bipartite Commission to oversee pay reform, and
participated in the elaboration of the methodology for the new pay system with technical
assistance from the Bank. The Ministry of Labor drafted the new pension law in consultation with
trade unions, pensioner representatives and employer associations. In health, the Government met
with professional associations such as the Association of Hospital Administrators, the College of
Physicians, the Association of Mayors, and the Association of Primary Healthcare (PHC)
Physicians to discuss the hospital rationalization strategy and identify exemptions for co-

25
  The NBR will establish an internal governance structure for Basel II policy and accreditation decisions. The
implementation process of Basel II is a major prudential policy decision, which can have a significant effect on the
resilience of the banking system. Hence, a robust assessment process for all advanced models (IRB/AMA), as well as a
governance structure is needed as part of the NBR's Basel II implementation. Basel III implementation stretches
through 2019, and Romania has yet to decide on an implementation schedule.
26
   The NBR will compare the existing financial groups operating in Romania with the definition of Ordinance 98/2006
to mitigate the risk that certain financial groups are exposed to material intra-group risks not covered by this definition.
Following an assessment of intra-group risks (e.g., contagion risk across sectors), the NBR will consider whether the
application of the existing definition of financial conglomerates is adequate, and will amend it as needed. If such
groups are identified, the regulators will ensure that all material intra-group transactions and risk concentrations are
monitored under joint supervision arrangements. Where this is currently not the case, the relevant regulators should
establish appropriate regulation and supervision arrangements and, if necessary, amend the relevant MOU.

                                                            20
payments. In education, the Government together with the Bank consulted mayors, principals,
school inspectors, and teachers during field trips in the counties of Ilfov, Prahova, Brasov and
Covasna which led to the design and adoption of the student per capita formula adoption at
national level.


         IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                     A. LINK TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

64.     As discussed in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) presented to the Board
with the DPL1 operation in July 2009, the proposed DPL program is central to the Bank's
engagement in Romania. The Bank's strategy during this CPS period (2009-13) is to help
Romania mitigate the impact of the current financial and economic crisis, while implementing the
fundamental structural reforms needed to put the country onto a sustainable economic growth
path. The main pillars of the CPS are: i) economic growth and competitiveness; ii) public sector
reform; iii) social and spatial cohesion. The focus of this DPL program on public financial
management, the social sectors and the financial sector is fully aligned with these pillars.

65.      The DPL series constitutes so far the only new lending under the current CPS.
Given the severity of the crisis and the exceptional need for large-scale budget support, all new
lending in the first two years of the CPS, 2009 and 2010, consisted of the DPL series. The
existing portfolio of investment loans is being restructured to provide a better fit with the
Government's current priorities and absorption capacity. The CPS Progress Report, scheduled for
presentation to the Executive Directors in September 2011, will include proposals for the next
phase of Bank support to Romania. The CPS had not specified activities beyond the current two
year period. The proposal is likely to include continued Development Policy Lending and
selective new project lending. Discussions with the Government are underway on two potential
investment operations, designed to improve development outcomes in social assistance and in the
health sector, building on the policy reforms support through the first two DPLs.        As noted
earlier, the Government is formulating action programs based on the results of the Functional
Reviews which will be designed to change the role of the Romanian state as it moves forward,
and it is likely that the Bank's financial and technical support for these reforms will be sought,
including through some adjustment of the DPL3 content.

          B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

66.      The Bank has collaborated closely with the IMF and the European Commission
(EC) since the start of the program. The DPL program supports and complements an overall
multilateral financial package amounting to 19.95 billion, of which the IMF would contribute
12.95 billion, and the EC 5 billion. The Bank would contribute 1billion to the package, of
which DPL1 and DPL2 account for 600 million. The measures under the proposed DPL
program have been discussed and closely coordinated with both the IMF and the EC to ensure
that the reform measures envisaged reinforce and are complementary to the measures under the
IMF and EC operations (Table 4). Quarterly monitoring of the program is carried out in close
collaboration with the Fund and the EC. It had originally been envisaged that the DPL series
would be completed by the time that the current IMF and EC programs will conclude in early
Spring 2011. However, structural reforms have taken longer than anticipated due to the severe
fiscal crisis and the political challenge the government has faced.



                                               21
67.     The Government expects to meet all IMF structural benchmarks through end-
December 2010 and is making steady progress on the program as a whole. All end-
September 2010 quantitative performance criteria under the IMF program were observed, with
the exception of that on general government arrears. The next IMF Board review of the Stand-by
arrangement is tentatively scheduled for January 7, 2011. The EC also considers the program to
be on track, released its third tranche in September 2010, and plans to review progress and
disburse its next tranche in January 2011.

                         C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

68.      The current economic and political context provides a window of opportunity for
making progress on the structural reforms agenda. The DPL continues reforms launched
under the 2003-06 programmatic adjustment loan (PAL), a series of three loans designed to
support Romania's EU accession and integration by accelerating economic growth and promoting
social inclusion. The PAL supported a wide range of reforms in public finance management,
education, health, social assistance, pensions, judiciary, and private sector development.
Following the successful implementation of PAL1 (rated Highly Satisfactory by the Bank's
Quality Assurance Group--QAG), the subsequent PALs were canceled, as reform fatigue set in
after EU accession in 2007 and the Government sought to diversify its sources of financing.

69.     The DPL agenda is complemented by reforms and activities undertaken in a series
of investment operations, as well as the substantial technical assistance provided under the
Public and Private Institution Building Loan (PPIBL) which closed in December 2008 (Table 5).

                                         D. LESSONS LEARNED

70.     The DPL1 Program Document (PD) highlighted several lessons which guided this
programmatic series: (i) the Bank's effective role in helping with transition challenges; (ii) the
importance of the knowledge acquired by the Bank over the years through investment lending
programs across sectors; (iii) the ability of political parties to collaborate when national interest
prevails, such as was the case with EU accession; (iv) the weak Government capacity to design
and implement coherent policies; (v) need for flexibility in program design and implementation
given the fluid economic and political situation; and (vi) the importance of leadership from the
center of Government. Support from the Prime Minister's office and Presidency is crucial for
successful implementation of reforms, especially when politically sensitive.

71.        The design of DPL2 also reflects lessons from implementation of DPL1:
      Successful implementation of a complex policy reform agenda stretching over several
      years hinges on anticipating and managing political transitions. The Bank underestimated
      the post-accession reform fatigue and the impact of potentially substantial EU grant funds
      under the Structural and Cohesion Funds. The Bank must enhance the dialogue with
      stakeholders across the political spectrum, the civil service and other relevant stakeholders.
      The program must build on the Bank's comparative advantage. Romania's unfinished
      reform agenda is large and the IFIs may be tempted to broaden the coverage of the programs
      beyond what can be realistically managed and delivered. The DPL focuses on areas where the
      Bank enjoys a comparative advantage and is able to leverage other IFIs' support.

                               E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

72.      The DPL is anchored in past and ongoing analytical and technical assistance work.
In addition to past analytical work (as reported in the DPL1 Program Document, table 6), recent
activities include the following: (i) the 2009 Public Expenditure Review (PER), which examined
opportunities for efficiency gains in the major expenditure areas of the public budget and
analyzed aggregate and sector expenditure patterns, the effectiveness and efficiency of spending,
and the policy and institutional challenges faced by the government, including in education and
health; (ii) technical notes prepared since November 2009 to assist the Government plan reforms
of public sector pay and medium-term budgeting; (iii) ongoing work on the impact of the crisis on
poverty and social policy monitoring; (iv) training provided in October 2009 on pension
modeling and technical assistance for projecting the impact of planned pension reforms; and (v)
technical assistance to prepare corporate and mortgage restructuring guidelines and revise the
insolvency law. The DPL also draws on the EC de Larosiere report on Financial Supervision in
the EU. The Bank will continue to support implementation of reforms by providing upon Client
demand analytical notes addressing punctual questions.



                         V.      THE PROPOSED OPERATION

                                 A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

73.       The proposed operation is the second of a programmatic series of three DPLs that
was originally envisaged to span the 24 months of the IMF Standby Arrangement and EC
budget support. DPL2 (as was the case for DPL1) focuses on structural reforms in three areas of
critical importance for Romania's medium- to long-term prospects: public sector finances, social
assistance and social insurance, and the financial sector.

74.    The Government remains committed to the overall DPL program presented to the
Board of Directors on July 18, 2009.

75.      Notwithstanding some changes in the actions supported by the DPL (Table 6),
partly in response to the crisis and to reflect changes in the IMF and EC programs, the
most important reforms supported by the program have made significant progress. Of the
DPL2 triggers stipulated in the DPL1 program document, four remained unchanged, three of
them were met in a modified form, one was postponed for later action and one action was
dropped (Law on the Political Independence and Financial Autonomy of Financial Sector
Regulators). As the IMF and EC programs will be closing soon, and new programs of support are
likely to be requested by Romania, the Bank will also have to assess in what ways it can best
support Romania's reform efforts. The Government remains committed to completing the reforms
started under this DPL series and which had been envisaged for support under DPL3 as stated in
the Letter of Development Policy attached to this loan and the triggers specified in Annex 2. The
dialogue will continue in these areas and, indeed, a number of the previously envisaged reforms
are expected to be completed in the first half of 2011.

76.     The following discussion summarizes DPL-supported actions and results to date. Their
content and underlying issues are detailed in the Government's Program (Chapter III).

                               B. IMPROVING PUBLIC FINANCES

77.      The proposed reforms will improve the management and predictability of public
spending, and foster better quality of public services. The cross-sector reforms concern the
Medium Term Public Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the public pay system. For the
former, the objective is to strengthen the quality of the annual budgeting process progressively
and anchor it in a credible medium-term framework. For the latter, the objective is to improve the
transparency and fairness of the public pay system and enhance its capacity to attract and retain
critical skills in public administration. The health sector measures seek to improve the
mobilization of resources and the efficiency and equity of service provision. Likewise, the
education sector measures aim to improve the efficiency of resource use while enhancing the
quality of general education. The specific measures agreed under the DPL are:

MTEF
            DPL1 supported the approval by the Government of a budget framework (MTEF)
            with spending limits by major economic classes prior to budget instructions being
            sent to line ministries. The purpose of the measure was to guide the strategic planning
            processes in the line ministries and foster prioritization of expenditures within
            realistic resource envelopes.
            The Government submitted the MTEF 2010-2012 to the European Commission
            through the Convergence Program 2009 - 2010, including fiscal risk analysis and has
            incorporated provisions on MTEF into the Law no.69/2010 on Fiscal Responsibility
            including binding aggregate expenditure limits (DPL2 prior action).
            The MTEF (2011-13) to be enacted (prior to the annual budget law) with ceilings for
            major ministries that collectively comprise at least 70 percent of the spending (DPL3
            trigger).

Public Sector Pay
            DPL1 supported the introduction of legislation to reduce non-wage personnel
            expenditures and achieve fiscal savings, by eliminating or redefining some
            allowances and bonuses. The goal was to contain the spiraling out of control of the
            wage bill in the public sector.
            Framework Unitary Pay Law no 3330/2009 that sets out the principles and timetable
            for the introduction of subsidiary legislation for a reformed pay system enacted
            (DPL2 prior action).
            Pay adjustments in 2011 to be made in accordance with targets specified in the
            Unitary Pay Law (UPL); subsidiary legislation introducing the reformed pay system
            to be presented to Parliament and new procedures will be introduced to enhance
            compliance with personnel policies (DPL3 trigger).




                                                28
Health
               DPL1 supported two reforms. First, the adoption of legislation to increase the overall
               tobacco excise duty and thus help mobilize additional resources for the financing of
               health services; and second, the implementation of new regulations governing drug
               pricing and promotion of generic drugs in the framework contracts between CNAS
               and service providers, with a view to containing the escalation of public spending for
               drugs.
               Ministerial order issued on drug pricing and joint order issued to promote generic
               drugs in framework contracts with service providers (DPL 1 prior action).
               Enact the legislation regarding the introduction of co-payment (amending Law
               95/2006) and exemption mechanisms for the poor (e.g. a targeted voucher system)
               (DPL3 trigger).
               Legislation to be enacted for revised provider payment mechanisms (DPL3 trigger).

Education
               Legislation enacted to allow all schools in eight counties to receive their budget
               according to a per capita finance formula (DPL3 trigger ­ but already completed).27

                                  C. STRENGTHENING SOCIAL PROTECTION

78.     Social assistance reforms seek to increase the coverage of the most efficient and
well-targeted programs to provide greater support to poor families. Pension reform aims to
enhance the fiscal sustainability of the public pension system and protect the elderly poor.
The specific measures agreed under the DPL program are:

Social Assistance
               DPL1 supported the introduction of legislation to improve the coverage and financial
               stability of the well-targeted GMI poverty mitigation program, by increasing the
               eligibility threshold of GMI by 15% and financing it entirely from the central State
               budget.
               Legislation has been enacted on GMI ratifying the provisions of EO 57/2009 (DPL2
               prior action).28
               Submit to the Parliament the amendments to Law no 416/2001 on GMI (DPL2 prior
               action).
               Enact amendments to the legislation (Law 416/2001) to transfer the program budget
               to the Ministry of Labor, Family and Social Protection and transfer the benefits
               payments attributions from local governments to the NASB while keeping the
               entitlement and recertification attributions with the local governments (DPL3
               trigger).


27
  As discussed in section III, legislation introducing per capita financing at national level in 2010-11 has been enacted.
28
   In addition to a 15 percent increase in the number of beneficiaries (see section III), legislation indexes the eligibility
threshold with inflation annually, and finances the entire GMI budget from the State budget, in order to avoid potential
shortfalls due to the local governments' financial difficulties.
                                                            29
             Legislation has been submitted to the Parliament on income-tested family allowances
             (DPL2 prior action).
             The nominal value of the universal child allowance benefit in 2010 has been
             maintained at the same level as in 2009 as stipulated in the Governmental Decision
             no 1662/2008 (DPL2 prior action).
             Enact Legislation on income-tested child allowances (CCA and LPA) that reduces
             the maximum eligibility threshold from 470 RON per month per capita to 370 RON,
             and offers higher benefits to households earning less at or below 200 RON and to
             Single Parent families (DPL3 trigger).

Pensions
             Legislation has been enacted on the public pensions unitary system which gradually
             links pension benefit adjustments in pillar 1 to inflation (and maintains the existing
             wage valorization) and increases retirement ages for women in a manner satisfactory
             to the Bank (DPL2 prior action).29
             Measures to be designed and implemented to deal more effectively with the social
             protection of the elderly poor (DPL3 trigger).30

                   D. ENHANCING THE RESILIENCE OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR

79.     Financial sector reforms seek to bolster contingency planning and improve the
resilience of the sector over the longer term through strengthened regulation and
supervision. The specific measures agreed under the DPL program are:
             DPL1 supported the approval by NBR and MoPF of the Strategic Action Plan for
             financial sector strengthening, to address potential challenges under adverse plausible
             scenarios impacting sector stability.
             Necessary amendments to the Insolvency Law no 169/2010 have been enacted; (ii)
             Mortgage Debt Restructuring Guidelines have been issued by MoPF and published
             by MoPF and NBR; and (iii) Corporate Debt Restructuring Guidelines have been
             issued and published by MoPF, MoJ and NBR (DPL 2 prior action).
             An internal regulation governing the decision making process and methods for Basel
             II implementation has been issued and adopted by NBR (DPL2 prior action).
             Assessment and amendments to be made as necessary on a) the adequacy of the
             definition of "Financial Conglomerate" in Ordinance 98/2006 in capturing all
             financial groups operating in Romania with material operations across more than one
             financial sub-sector and b) the adequacy of supervisory arrangements in the
             Memorandum of Understanding between the financial regulators for financial groups
             in Romania (DPL3 trigger).

                                    E. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

80.    Poverty is monitored by the Government and the Bank. The Ministry of Labor,
Family and Social Protection (MoLFSP) jointly with the National Institute for Statistics,
29
   As discussed in section III, the Law passed in the Parliament has been sent back by the President with the
recommendation to increase the retirement age for women only to 63 by 2030, instead of 65.
30
   This would be a "zero" or non-contributory pension pillar or an additional component to GMI, depending on the
results of AAA work currently being undertaken and further consultations with the Government.
                                                      30
calculates and monitors poverty figures based on a methodology developed together with the
World Bank. In 2008 and 2009 the Bank validated the poverty figures produced by the two
institutions on the basis of Household Budget Surveys (HBS). The distributional impact of the
reform measures will be monitored annually based on the HBS data and administrative data
provided by MoLFSP.
81.    The DPL-supported reforms will have in general a positive impact on the poor. Any
adverse impact will be transitory and mitigated by support measures (including those
mentioned under DPL 1):
              The cross-sector reforms in public expenditure management and introduction of the
              Unitary Pay Law (UPL) will not affect the poorest segment of the population. They
              will benefit the entire population by enhancing fiscal and macro stability, and the
              predictability and transparency of public expenditure. The UPL implementation will
              also help contain inflationary pressures.
              In health, the poverty impact of the introduction of co-payments will be marginal.
              When health expenditures are netted out of household consumption31 the proportion
              of poor households was 4.9 percent in 2009, half a percent higher than the overall
              poverty rate of 4.4 percent. This is the appropriate baseline for assessing the impact
              of co-payments. About half of the insured (9.4 million individuals) will be exempt
              from co-payments.32 Introducing the co-payment system without exemptions would
              increase the poverty headcount by 0.5 percent, to 5.4 percent. With exemptions, the
              increase in poverty headcount would be 0.2 percent, to 5.1 percent.
              The expanded coverage and adequacy of the GMI program supported by DPL is
              expected to have a significant poverty reducing impact (see section III-B for more
              details).
              The DPL-supported reform of Complementary Child Allowance (CCA) and Single
              Parent Allowance (LPA) will increase benefits for the poorest decile and improve
              targeting. Simulations suggest that the reform measures discussed in section III-B
              will improve the targeting accuracy of these programs to the lowest quintile from
              around 51 percent to 60 percent. The generosity (benefits received as a percentage of
              post benefit household consumption) also increases for the poorest quintile (Figures 1
              and 2).
              DPL2-supported reforms aim to protect future generation of retirees, by enhancing
              the fiscal sustainability of the Pillar 1 pensions and the financial viability of Pillar 2.

   Current out-of-pocket expenditures on health.
32
   Exempt categories include children under 18, some youth 18 - 26 years of age out of the labor force, patients with
diseases included in the national health programs, and retirees with pensions below 700 RON/month.

                                 F. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

82.      As noted in the DPL1 PD the specific policies supported by the DPL program are
not likely to have significant positive or negative effects on Romania's environment, forests
and other natural resources. The measures contemplated under the loan are geared primarily
toward ensuring stability and future financial system solvency as well as to allow a resumption of
economic growth, and do not have significant links to the environment. Moreover, Romania has
adequate environmental safeguards. Environmental legislation and regulation is reinforced by EU
environmental directives, including the EU guidelines on the adoption of environmental
assessments at the planning and programming level (June 2001) and the EU's Environmental
Liabilities Directive setting out liability for damage to properties and natural resources (April
2007).

                   G. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

83.      The implementation of the loan requires close coordination between the Bank and
the national institutions responsible for implementation, as well as the leadership of the
Prime Minister's Office and the Presidency. The Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF), the
National Bank of Romania (NBR), and the Ministries of Labor, Family and Social Protection
(MoLFSP), Health, Education, and Justice will provide the requisite baseline data from which to
measure outcomes by the end of the program. MoPF will coordinate reporting on the program's
monitoring indicators. These indicators will be tracked, discussed and assessed among the Bank
team and implementing agencies both by staff based in the field and by HQ staff during field
visits. As discussed in section IV-D, leadership provided by the Cabinet of the Prime Minister
and the Presidency is essential for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the program.

                                     H. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

84.    The Bank deems fiduciary risks to be moderate overall. A Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was completed at the end of 2003, a Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) was done in 2005 and a Public Expenditure and Institutional Review
(PEIR) was issued in 2006. Regular updates of Public Financial Management (PFM) reform were
                                              32
carried out and the overall fiduciary risk associated with the PFM system is deemed to be
moderate. The risk is considered: i) significant in the areas of accounting, reporting and internal
control; ii) moderate in the fields of budgeting, treasury, cash management and external audit, and
parliamentary oversight; and iii) low with regard to Bank investment operations. In addition to
the measures highlighted in the DPL1 PD on PFM improvements, Romania adopted in 2010 an
updated Local Public Finance Law, to become effective in January 2011.

85.     The Government is addressing the challenges highlighted by the DPL1 in 2009 : full
development of the MTEF and of a well-integrated financial management information system;
introduction of pre-budget statements, accrual-based budgets, formal mid-year budget reviews,
in-year audit reports, and citizens' budgets; completion of computerized accounting and
bookkeeping; decentralization of ex-ante internal control and audit functions; and further
strengthening of external audit.

86.     NBR can be relied upon to hold proceeds from development policy operations. The
August 2009 IMF safeguards assessment concluded that safeguards in place at NBR generally
appear adequate. The previously identified weaknesses (mentioned in the June 2005 safeguards
assessment) were addressed. Based on the IMF's safeguards assessment, NBR can be relied upon
to account for the Bank's loan proceeds from development policy operations, assuming that the
arrangements are otherwise in accordance with the Bank's policies and with specific mutually
agreed terms for the operation in question, and the Bank takes no further action in this area.

                               I. DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITING

87.      The proposed loan will follow the World Bank's disbursement procedures for
development policy loans. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases, and evidence
will therefore not be needed to support disbursements, nor will procurement requirements be
necessary. The front end fee will be covered from the Borrower's own sources. At the request of
the MoPF, the Bank will deposit the proceeds of the loan into a foreign exchange deposit account
at the NBR as part of the general foreign exchange reserves. If loan proceeds are used for
ineligible purposes as defined in the Loan Agreement, the Bank, upon notice, will require the
Borrower to refund such amount promptly, and such amount shall be cancelled.

88.      MoPF will be responsible for the administration and accounting of loan proceeds.
The standard country rules will be followed by Treasury for administration and accounting. The
proceeds of the Loan deposited at the NBR will be used to cover the budget deficit and/or public
debt refinancing. MoPF will be responsible for preparing withdrawal applications along with
maintaining the deposit account as required. With the assistance of NBR it will maintain records
of all transactions under the deposit account in accordance with sound accounting practices. The
Borrower will report to the Bank within 30 days after receiving the loan amounts by sending a
confirmation letter on the loan amounts deposited in the foreign currency deposit account.

89.      The proceeds of the loan will be deposited in a single tranche by the Bank in an
account chosen by the Borrower at the NBR and an audit of that account will not be
required. The currency of the NBR account will be the loan currency. Given the positive IMF
assessments of the NBR, the unqualified NBR audit reports for 2005-2008, as well as the
satisfactory audit compliance under the previous PAL and PSAL-2 development policy lending
operations (disbursed in 2005), an audit of the NBR account for the proceeds of the loan is not
considered necessary.

                                  J. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

90.      The proposed DPL program entails political, social and economic risks:
         Political risks concern in particular the inherent uncertainty which is characteristic of any
         coalition government facing a strong and vocal opposition, and the approaching 2012
         local and parliamentary elections. The discussion and adoption of legislation
         underpinning reforms is often challenged by the opposition both on the floor of the
         Parliament and in the Constitutional Court, delaying action and sometimes modifying
         Government's intent. The 2012 elections may lead to the relaxation of public spending
         objectives, as the ruling coalition will try to shore up support for re-election by increasing
         financing for local projects, and may delay reforms which affect the electorate and
         require sacrifices in the short-run. Fiscal and policy slippages may undermine market
         confidence and increase balance of payments pressures.
         Social risks are associated primarily with parts of the multilateral support program
         covered by other IFIs, such as the fiscal austerity package agreed with the IMF. They
         could, however, impede the implementation of the DPL program since this program is
         part of the multilateral package.
         Economic risks are linked to the specific context of the crisis in Romania: (i) the large
         fiscal deficit of 2008 which forced fiscal austerity and increased the scope of adjustment
         at a time when the severity of the economic downturn made this difficult; (ii) the impact
         of regional financial market turbulence which could result in lower debt roll-over rates or
         larger capital outflows, destabilizing exchange rate depreciation, and negative feedback
         effects between the real and financial sectors; and (iii) balance-sheet effects arising from
         a further RON depreciation beyond the current program assumptions (and the resulting
         higher than expected inflation), which could compress Romania's growth prospects and
         affect the domestic banking sector due to increased corporate and household distress.
         Some reforms supported by DPL (e.g., implementation of the MTEF and the UPL) are
         contingent on budget resources or on technical inputs provided by the IMF.

91.      The above risks are partially mitigated by Government actions supported by the
IFIs:
         Political risks have been managed well so far by the Government, with the support of the
         President. Given the tensions between the ruling coalition and the opposition, the
         constant dialogue of the Bank with the parliamentary opposition to explain the necessity
         and the thrust of reforms and inform it on progress in implementation could help mitigate
         a potential change of direction or halt of reforms in case of significant changes in the
         governing coalition.
         Social risks are mitigated by the acceleration of social assistance reform and the
         provision of funding. Increases in pensions and unemployment and social assistance
         benefits prior to and, during the crisis have helped the vulnerable to better withstand the
         consequences of the economic decline, contributing to a reduction in poverty in 2009.
         The DPL has supported the increase in funding to the well-targeted GMI program. The
         Bank has also expanded communication efforts with the social partners, such as the main
         trade union confederations, emphasizing the costs of continuing with the economic status
         quo and the long-term benefits of reforms. Better dissemination of the findings of Bank-
         supported analytical work has been an important vehicle of the enhanced communication
         effort on the necessity of reforms.


                                                  34
   Economic risks are mitigated by the multilateral support package, proactive actions of
   State institutions, and the design of the program: (i) the IFIs leverage macroeconomic
   policy adjustments with a large package of external official financial resources. The
   external assistance package aims to help stabilize the economy and support external debt
   rollover/debt service without excessive pressures on the exchange rate that could further
   weaken the banking sector. The package provides considerable cushion in building up
   reserves that would help deal with a worse-than-expected case scenario of capital
   outflows and prolonged financial sector distress; (ii) NBR has so far managed well
   pressures on the national currency; and (iii) the design of the program supported by the
   Fund in the banking sector included in-depth examinations and recapitalization
   requirements and the strengthening of regulatory and supervisory powers. The DPL
   program added additional contingency planning reforms including the preparation of a
   strategic action plan for the banking sector to address potential interventions, and the
   establishment of a framework to facilitate private and corporate debt restructuring. Fiscal
   reforms will reduce the fiscal pressures both in the short run and over the medium term
   and contribute to lowering external financing needs.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation and Fourth Review of the Stand-By
Agreement with Romania
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 10/97
July 23, 2010


The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth
review of Romania's economic performance under 24-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)
approved on May 4, 2009 and concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation with Romania.1 The
completion of this program review enables the immediate disbursement of SDR 768 million,
bringing total disbursements under the program to SDR 9.031 billion (about 9.32 billion or
about US$12.60 billion.

Background

Before the current crisis, the Romanian economy was characterized by high growth rates,
associated with the build-up of external and internal imbalances. Large capital inflows
stimulated domestic demand, while labor constraints and rising public sector wages generated
wage inflation. Fiscal policy was pro-cyclical, exacerbating the overheating of the economy
despite tight monetary policy to counteract price pressures. The rapid development of the
banking system came with vulnerabilities to outside liquidity shocks and foreign exchange risks.
The global economic and financial crisis hit Romania hard in late 2008 and 2009. Capital
inflows dried up, exports plunged, and country risk indicators skyrocketed. As a result of the
sharp contraction in domestic demand, GDP plummeted and the current account deficit fell
markedly. Although banks generally entered the crisis well capitalized, they faced rising NPLs,
a dried up interbank market and limited access to external sources of funds. The country's large
fiscal deficit constrained the fiscal policy response to the crisis.

In early 2009 authorities put together a policy package supported by financing from the Fund,
the EU, and the World Bank. The program included (i) fiscal consolidation accompanied by
structural reforms to restore fiscal sustainability and boost market confidence, (ii) steps to
further strengthen the resilience of the financial sector and to obtain commitments from foreign
parent banks to maintain their Romanian subsidiaries capitalized and liquid, and (iii) prudent
monetary policy management to reduce inflation. The program has contributed to stabilizing the
economy and alleviating financing pressures. Economic activity remained weak throughout
2009 (declining by 7.1 percent), but exchange rate pressure eased, the country risk premium
narrowed significantly, and financial sector stress eased. While for 2010 as a whole growth is
forecast to be slightly negative, a gradually recovery is expected in the second half of the year.
Domestic demand will remain subdued, as unemployment continues to rise and real wages
adjust to the recession with a lag, while investment will pick up slowly. The contribution of net
exports is forecast to remain positive but limited in 2010. Beyond 2010, GDP should recover,
with growth forecast to rise to around 3½ percent in 2011 and to the range of 4-4½ percent per
year in the medium-term.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted that despite one of
the largest economic downturns in Europe, the Romanian authorities have made significant
strides toward restoring macroeconomic stability and achieving an orderly adjustment of pre-
crisis imbalances. They noted, however, that important challenges remain in ensuring that the
economic and policy adjustments are sustainable. They encouraged the authorities to carry
through with planned structural reforms to secure a sustainable fiscal position, boost potential
growth, and reinforce the economy's resilience to shocks.

Directors commended the authorities' strong adjustment effort this year as an appropriate
response to the near-term challenges posed by the sharp deterioration in the fiscal position. They
agreed with the authorities' approach of balancing the adjustment between expenditure cuts and
tax increases, by way of cushioning the social impact of the adjustment while decisively tackling
the large public wage bill. . Directors also supported the proposed relaxation of the 2010 deficit
target to accommodate the cyclical deterioration in the fiscal position since the last review.

Directors stressed that the sustainability of the targeted fiscal adjustment can only be secured if
supported by structural reforms. They welcomed the recent approval of the fiscal responsibility
legislation, and encouraged the authorities to complete the reforms of the pension and the public
compensation systems. Other important reforms are the planned reductions in public
employment, reforms of the healthcare system and of the local government finances, and efforts
to boost tax collections. These reforms would ensure that the deficit remains on a downward
path in the medium term.

Directors also emphasized that structural reforms in other areas, such as labor and product
markets, are also crucial in building the economy's competitiveness and resilience. They would
also help prepare Romania for an eventual euro adoption by ensuring that the economy can
handle shocks without the support of monetary and exchange rate policies.

Directors commended the authorities for vigilant monetary and financial sector policies. They
viewed the moderate pace of monetary easing as appropriate in striking a balance between the
need to support the economy and to contain exchange rate pressures. They agreed that, while
there may be room for further easing in the near future, a cautious approach remains warranted
given inflation risks and regional uncertainties. Directors welcomed the authorities' proactive
approach towards banking supervision and regulation, and called for continued vigilance in view
of the unsettled regional situation and the deteriorating quality of the loan portfolio.
