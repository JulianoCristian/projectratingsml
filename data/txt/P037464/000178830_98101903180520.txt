INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
GOVEENMENT OF NEd ZEALAND
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount, in various currencies, equivalent to US$16.0 million
to the Government of New Zealand for a railway project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        New Zealand joined the Bank in August 1961. While it is not
a member of IDA, the Government recently undertook to make a voluntary
contribution to IDA of NZ$5.0 million (US$5.6 million) payable in equal
annual installments in the years 1971 to 1975.
3.        During the period 1963-65 the Bank made four loans to New
Zealand totalling US$96.0 million (after cancellations of US$6.8 million),
but thereafter lending was discontinued in view of New Zealand's relatively
advanced stage of economic development. In 1968 a Bank economic mission
which had been requested by the Government to consider the measures best
suited to establish a sound basis for a long term economic policy for the
nation submitted its report to the Government. It advised restructuring
the economy with a view to developing new export markets and rationalizing
the hitherto heavily protected manufacturing sector to enable it to compete
in world markets,thus reducing New Zealand's dependence on the export of
pastoral products. In furtherance of this policy the New Zealand Government
convened the National Development Conference in 1968 which published the
National Development Program, an indicative plan for all major sectors of
the economy. The achievement of the growth targets proposed in this Program
requires capital investment in amounts that would exceed New Zealand's already
high level of domestic savings. Restrictions on lending imposed by all the
principal capital exporting countries, especially those whose capital markets
are traditionally used by New Zealand, have limited its ability to raise the
capital required abroad. A request for assistance was therefore made to the
Bank and I agreed in late 1969 to consider a limited lending program in an
amount of US$30 to US$ho million over three to four years which would be
directed to the restructuring of the New Zealand economy.
4.        The proposed loan would be made to the Government of New
Zealand and would be the second for the New Zealand Railways. Negotiations
were held in Washington from January 11 to January 20, 1971. The Govern-
ment of New Zealand, the Borrower, was represented by Mr. Jack Lang,
Assistant Secretary to the New Zealand Treasury and Mr. J.W.P. Cook,
Economic Counsellor at the New Zealand Embassy. The New Zealand Railways
was represented by its General Manager, Mr. Ivan Thomas, C.M.G.

of US$16.0 million.
Purpose:                  To finance the foreign exchange cost
of part of the investment program of
the New Zealand Railways for the three
years to March 31, 1973 and of an
overall transport study.
Amortization:             In 15 years including a 2½ year period

PART III - THE PROJECT
7.        A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Railway Project - New
Zealand" (PTR-67) dated February 10, 1971 is attached.



- 3 -
8.        New Zealand's transport system consists of an extensive road
and rail network, a growing commercial aviation service and a small but
modern coastal shipping fleet. Road transport has for many years been
subject to Government regulation through restrictions on the commodities
carried and routes served by trucking firms; this regulatory framework
was introduced in the depressed conditions of the 1930ts and was main-
tained thereafter to support the underinvested, and therefore vulnerable,
position of the Railways. The Railwfays modernization program begun in
the 1960's removed this rationale and some relaxation of the restrictions
has been made.  The existing regulations, however, have been modified
piecemeal and have not always led to least cost solutions. In order to
develop an efficient and economical national transport policy a general
transport study will be undertaken by the Ministry of Transport, with the
help of consultants, as part of a program of long-term research. The
proposed Bank loan would cover the overseas cost of consultants to execute
this study, which will be sent to the Bank for comment.
9.        The New Zealand Railways is run as an autonomous department of
the Government with capable and technically qualified staff. It is the
prime carrier of freight over longer distances, including interisland
traffic.  In recent years the pressure on costs, particularly wages,
has had its effect on financial results. In 1965 the Railways agreed
that it would aim at a progressive improvement of its financial situation
and at achieving a ratio of operating expenses to revenues of 85% by
the fiscal year 1971. In fact in 1970 this ratio was 94.4% and it is
now expected that the ratio would be significantly higher in 1971, owing
to increases in costs. Nevertheless, the Railways efficiency and com-
petitiveness have improved and it has been able to meet all its financial
obligations. Uneconomic branch lines have been closed, traction has
been modernized, linkage of the islands through the interisland ferry
service has led to greater integration of the rail networks on the North
and South Islands, and improvements in operations have been made. As
a result the Railways was able to handle 19% more net freight ton miles
in 1970 than in 1965, with 12.5% less staff. Tariff increases were also
made in 1967 and December 1968, but the magnitude and timing of these
adjustments had to take into account competitive conditions. While it
may be that railway rates could have been raised somewhat more in the
past five years, overall financial management has been sound.
10.       Currently the Railways is responding to the conversion of
seaborne trade to containers by an investment in flatcars, in order to
continue to provide a competitive service for export industries to the
ports. The management is also concentrating on bulk traffic in unit
trains, particularly serving the dynamic forest products industries.
U.        The 1965 Bank loan to the Railways financed procurement of
rolling stock and a ferry boat, which were part of the Railways' invest-
ment plan for the six years to March 31, 1971. The project, part of
which the Bank would now finance, consists of the first three years,



April 1, 1970 to March 31, 1973, of the six-year investment plan to
March 31, 1976 and of the study described in paragraph 8. The first
three years of the investment plan call for expenditures equivalent
to US$87.80 million on specialized rolling stock, workshop and sig-
nalling equipment and a third ferry boat; and it includes progress
payments on a fourth ferry boat to be delivered in the year to March
31, 1974. The rolling stock to be financed by the Bank will include
490 flatcars for the transport of containers. The remaining 1,310
freightcars for which financing would be provided from the Loan are
intended for the transport of pulp and paper, steel, timber and other
bulk traffic; in addition, certain workshop equipment and the moder-
nization of signalling equipment on two lines are to be financed. Of
the flatcars 610 are to be manufactured in the Railways workshops using
Bank-financed imported components. The cost of these flatcars is est-
imated to be 5% over that of imported wagons, but local manufacture will
ensure full utilization of existing workshop facilities. No retroactive
financing is proposed, but a few items included (valued at the equivalent
of US$183,680) have already been contracted for. All items included in
the proposed loan will be bought after international competitive bidding.
12.       A covenant has been included in the Loan Agreement (Section
4.05), setting target rates of return. It provides that the Railways
should break even in the year to March 31, 1972 and earn 3.5% on net
fixed assets in fiscal 1973, 4% in 1974 and 1975 and 5% in subsequent
years. Reaching these targets would enable the Railways to meet all
obligations, replace renwable assets and make a reasonable contribu-
tion to the modest expansion of capacity that may be needed in the
future. The calculations take into account an increase in tariffs
from February 15, 1971 at the termination of a general price freeze
that had been imposed by the Government.
13.       The foreign exchange cost of the Railways' investment during
the three years to March 31, 1973 is estimated at NZ$42.69 million
(US$47.81 million), of which the proposed Bank loan would provide
NZ$13.84 million (US$15.50 million). NZ$2.36 million (US$2.65 million)
was met by drawings on Bank Loan No. 438-NZ. A further NZ$12.80 million
(US$14.34 million) of the foreign exchange cost will be provided in the
form of suppli ers credits and the balance by the New Zealand Government.
The foreign exchange cost of the study referred to in paragraph 8 is
estimated at NZ$466,000 (US$500,000).
14.       The project is economically justified, with a weighted average
economic rate of return on investments of about 18%. It is not designed
to increase the size of the Railways in relation to other modes of trans-
port but to equip it to meet demands arising from the changes in New
Zealand's economic structure called for in the Government's development
plans. The items financed should promote the efficient handling of ex-
port merchandise and the growth of competitive manufacturing industries,
in particular forest products.

PART IV - LEGiAL INSTRUY-NTS AND AUTHORITY
15.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and New Zealand,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed Loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The Loan Agreement is substantially in the same form as the corresponding
agreements relating to other recent transport projects.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
16.       An economic repcrt dated February 10, 1971, entitled "Recent
Development and Prospects of the New Zealand Economy" (EAP-20a) is being
distributed separately. This report updates the report on the "Economic
Position, Program and Prospects of New Zealand"(EAP-6a) dated August 20,
1969. A basic data sheet is annexed.
17.       New Zealand's future remains uncertain so long as it is vul-
nerable to fluctuations in the prices of its leading export commodities
and to the uncertain conditions of the international capital markets.
In recognition of this, and to achieve its objective of a 4.5% real
annual growth in GNP, the New Zealand Government has embarked on develop-
ing manufacturing to increase export earnings. This requires capital
investments in industry and the infrastructure which serves it on a
scale which cannot be satisfied by domestic savings only, even at the
high savings rate of 24% projected by the Government. In fact, the
Bankts recent economic report on New Zealand estimates the net official
capital inflow required up to 1976 to be in the region of US$100 mil-
lion per year, if the Governmentts targets are to be reached. Such an
amount of new borrowing in the international capital markets is obvious-
ly difficult to achieve for a small country like New Zealand, although
during the period 196%4-68 New Zealand managed to raise around US$70
million a year abroad.
18.       These difficulties would be increased with the disturbance
of New Zealandts agricultural export markets which would take place
if the EEC were enlarged to include Norway, Denmark, Ireland and the
U.K. In fact, the likelihood of this enlargement reinforces the pro-
bability that financial assistance from the Bank will be needed along
with that of other foreign lenders. Disbursements under the modest
lending program of $30 to $40 million over three to four years would
roughly maintain the present level of Bank loans outstanding to New
Zealand through the mid-1970's.
19.       Debt service on incurred government and government guaranteed
debt is currently around 5% of total export earnings,with a possible
peak of over 6% in the year to June 30, 1973. New Zealand is clearly
creditworthy for Bank lending.

PART VI - COMPLIAN!CE  ITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMEThT
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMNENDATION
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the pro-
posed Loan.
