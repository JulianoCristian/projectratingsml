the preparation of the\n            Second National Communication of the Argentine Republic to\n            the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention\n            on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Following are some of the\n            project components: National Greenhouse Gases (GHG)\n            Inventories - The main objectives of this component are to\n            upgrade national inventories of GHG emissions and to develop\n            indicators for evaluation of national emission trends.\n            Vulnerability Assessment and Institutional Strengthening for\n            Adaptation - This component complements previous work and\n            consists of vulnerability studies to assess the impacts of\n            climate change on the water resources of humid region of the\n            country, where the large majority of the population is\n            concentrated and where most of the economic activity of the\n            country occurs. Vulnerability of the coastal zone - The\n            study will assess the relative impact of climate change and\n            human action on the degradation of the coastline of the Rio\n            de la Plata. Vulnerability of the Pampa Bonaerense - This\n            study is directed at evaluating the impact of climate change\n            on the water resources of the Pampa Humeda. Vulnerability of\n            agriculture production in the Pampa Humeda. This study will\n            analyze the effects of climate change on the productivity\n            and the vulnerability of crops in the region and erosion in\n            the higher part of the relevant tributary basins.\n            Vulnerability of the water resources in the\n            Litoral-Mesopotamia. The objectives of the study are: (a) to\n            determine how climate change, and more specifically higher\n            precipitation rates are likely to affect the major rivers of\n            the area; (b) to estimate the extent of the damages that may\n            occur as a result of the changes; (c) to determine the\n            socio-economic impact of the flooding on the region and the\n            effects on its economic growth; and (d) to propose\n            mitigation and adaptation strategies to decrease future\n            damage. Vulnerability of the Patagonia - This study will be\n            conducted to assess the potential impacts of climate change\n            in the region. Overall socio-economic impacts of climate\n            change - One of the objectives of the vulnerability\n            assessments conducted is to make predictions of how the\n            impacts of climate change on natural resources may affect\n            the socio-economic development of the regions in question.\n            Vulnerability of the energy system and energy infrastructure\n            - This study will provide support for the evaluation of\n            climate change. Preliminary National Adaptation Program and\n            regional adaptation plans - This activity will draw from the\n            results of the other studies with the objective of\n            incorporating adaptive capacity to climate change into\n            national and regional development plans. Estimates of\n            regional climate change scenarios through Regional Climate\n            Models - The focus of this activity will be to support the\n            generation of regional climate change projections using\n            high-resolution atmospheric circulation models. Formulation\n            of National Mitigation Program (NMP). A NMP will be\n            formulated, which will include proposals for measures aimed\n            at reducing national GHG emissions."}, "docdt": "2003-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
