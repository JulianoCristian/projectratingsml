A.      PROJECTDEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
1.      Project Development Objective: (see Annex 1)
The primary objective of this project is to support enabling activities for the preparation of the Second
National Communication of the Argentine Republic to the Conference of the Parties to the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).                 This Communication will enable the
Government of Argentina (GOA) to satisfy requirements under Art.12.1 of the UNFCCC, in accordance
with decisions 10KP.2, 11KP.2 and 8KP.5, and following the new guidelines for the preparation of
National Communications accorded in CP.8. The Government of Argentina submitted its First National
Communication in 1997 and a revised version in 1999.

This project will complement ongoing activities undertaken by the Government of Argentina to
implement the UNFCCC requirements and consists of five major components. First, studies will be
carried out to update and improve national inventories of greenhouse gases (GHG). Second, the project
will assess the vulnerability of various ecosystems to climate change and will formulate possible
adaptation strategies. To this end, studies will evaluate the impacts of climate change on: (a) coastal
zones and water resources indifferentregions of the country; (b) agricultural production; (c) precipitation
patterns; (d) energy system and infrastructure; and (e) socio-economic sector. Third, the project will
contribute to the formulation of a National Mitigation Program, which will include measures to reduce
national emissions of GHG. Fourth, activities will be conducted around the country to promote capacity
building and public awareness. Finally, the fifth component of the project will assist inthe drafting of the
SecondNational Communication to the UNFCCC.


2.      Global Objective: (see Annex 1)
The global environmental objective of this project is to contribute to the development of country policies
that will be a part of global efforts to mitigate climate change. This objective will be achieved by
financing incremental activities aimed at assessing the vulnerability of Argentine ecosystems to climate
change and contributingto the development of a national mitigation plan aimed at reducing current levels
of GHGemissions.

B.       STRATEGIC CONTEXT
1.       Sector-Related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Goal Supported By The Project:
Date of latest CAS: June 27, 2000
Document Number: R2000-0116 [IFC/R2000-0120]
Date of discussionfor CASProgress Report: July 19,2001
Document Number: R2001-0127 [IFC/R2001-0155]

The 2000 CAS highlights the need for Argentina to take measures aimed at promoting sustainable
growth.     It recognizes pollution reduction as a strategy to attain sustainable growth and measures
performance in this regard in terms of GOA'S fulfillment o f its commitments to global environmental
agreements. One such agreement i s the UNFramework Convention on Climate Change -UNFCCC. The
communication will report on strategies, plans, and programs in place to implement the Convention's
objectives: a) the stabilization of concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere at levels that would prevent
dangerous interference with the sustainability of economic activities; b) the promotion of adequate impact
assessment of climate change in ecological and economic systems; and c) support of adaptation policies
that address changes inclimate already observed, as well as those contemplated for the next century.

In general terms, and outside the context of the UNFCCC, the project fits well with the Bank's overall
Energy and Environmental Strategies, since issues related to climate change are relevant to both sectors.
The 2000 CAS further identifies management o f water resources as a development priority for Argentina,
with financial support envisioned for funding of projects in water supply and sanitation, ground water
management, flood control, drainage, and irrigation.

In addition to complying with international commitments, the 2000 CAS further stresses the need to
expand the use of GEF resources to complement nationalprograms and to buildcapacity on global issues.
It identifies continued building of the GEF pipeline, including global warming objectives, as an integral
feature of its strategy.

A new CAS will be presentedto the Board of Executive Directors on December 18,2003. The objectives
of this project continue to be inline with the sector priorities outlined inthe new CAS.

2.      Main Sector Issues And Government Strategy:

Sector Issues

2.1     Climate Change, Sources and Impact
The projected impacts,of climate change, or in more specific terms of global warming, include increasing
temperatures, sea level rise, and changing precipitation patterns. Although there i s a significant level of
uncertainty concerning the causes of climate change, it has been recognized that global climatic patterns
have changed considerably during the last century. It i s also well known that the impacts of severe
climatic events have become increasingly damaging to natural resources and infrastructure, as well as
threatening to human life.

The concentration o f greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been increasing steadily for the past
century. It i s nowadays widely accepted that GHG are, at least to some extent, responsible for the global
warming trend. A reversal of this trend i s therefore related to the management and the abatement of
greenhouse gas pollution, both of which depend on the type o f source of the emissions. Increasing
emissions o f GHG mainly result from: 1) combustion of fossil fuels (i.e. oil, coal) that occur, among
others, during power generation and industrial and transportation activities; 2) reduction o f carbon sinks
through, for example, deforestation activities; and 3) methane emissions originating from organic matter
decomposition related to human activities.

Studies have shown that the capacity to adapt to relatively short-term climatic change i s not distributed
evenly amongst different societies and that in fact, the impacts of climatic change are more severely felt
in developing countries, amongst the poorest fractions of the population. Furthermore, the ability to
manage and to control GHG emissions and pollution, and therefore the ability to reduce the impact of
climate change, requires an institutional, technological and financial framework that may not exist in
these countries.

2.2     GHGEmissionsinArgentina
The 1997 inventory o f GHG emissions revealed that between 1990-1994 and 1994-1997, GHG emissions
increased by 13.7% and 6.2% respectively, a cumulative increase of 20.7%.          (Figures do not include
emissions from changes in crop management or from silviculture). The economic context during 1990-97
can be used to justify trends o f emission production. Indeed, in 1990 the economy was undergoinga deep
recession. A period o f rapid recovery started in 1992, manifested by increasing economic activity and
consequently rising GHG emissions. 1997 marked the peak o f economic activity for the decade, but the
decreasing trend of emissions was already evident.           A combination of factors contributed to this
decreasing trend o f emissions, of which the most influential were: i)increased power generation from
clean energy sources; ii)replacement of public transportation fleet with cleaner vehicles; and iii)
reduction o f total heads of cattle with a resulting decrease inenteric emissions.

GHG emissions inArgentina mainly originate from: 1) combustion of fossil fuels, consistently releasing
approximately 90% of the COzemissions and around 42% o f the total GHG emissions o f the country in
1997 (power generation (30%) and transport (33%) account for most o f the energy-related GHG
emissions);    2) enteric fermentation, releasing 62% of methane emissions and 19% of total GHG
emissions in 1997 (mainly cattle); and 3) management of agricultural land, releasing 95% o f total nitrous
oxide emissions and 21% o f total GHG emissions in 1997. Annex 13 contains a detailed breakdown of
GHGemissions.

2.2.1   National circumstancesand impacts of climate change
A series of physicalcharacteristics and of cultural traits make Argentina particularly vulnerable to climate
change. The following sections provide brief descriptions of national priority issues that need to be
addressed in order to reduce potential impacts o f climate change.

2.2.1.1 Water resources
The wide range of climatic conditions in Argentina result in complex water resource management issues.

                                                        4

Argentina i s repeatedly subjected to periods of extreme drought in the dry regions and to inundations in
the more humid zones. It i s to be expected that the various regions have considerably different water
resource issues concerning their surface water bodies, groundwater supplies, and irrigation practices.

2.2.1.2 Landresources
The lack of effective land managementpolicies in Argentina is a contributing factor to the severity of the
impacts from climate change-related events. Unsustainable land use (e.g. substitution of pastures for
crops), soil degradation (e.g. salinization) and deforestation contribute to the degradation of the natural
vegetation cover, a factor that ultimately leads to erosion. Erosion of extensive productive areas i s not
only a devastating economic event, but in the context of this study, it increases the vulnerability of a
region to the damaging effects of extreme climatic incidents

2.2.1.3 Humansettlements
Inadequate zoning regulations in urban areas of Argentina and the incomplete access to water and
sanitation services are partly to blame for the expansion of the cities towards flood-prone areas.
Settlements grow along the banks of major waterways, without consideration to the risks of flooding.
The infrastructure is, in many cases, precarious, aggravating the extent of the damages andthe number of
people affected duringflooding events.

2.2.2    Integrationof climate changeintonationalplanning
Despite the heightened level of attention given to climate change issues in international circles, linkages
between the facts regarding climate change and preventive decision-making in Argentina remain weak at
national, provincial, district, and private levels. Contributing factors include the prevalent dichotomy
between policy and science, a weak institutional capacity, and the lack of collaboration between public
and private institutions on climate change issues. Efforts have been made by government agencies to
sponsor interactions between private and public sectors on issues related to climate change, such as
promotional activities, workshops and studies sponsored by the Secretaria de Ambiente y Desarrollo
Sustentable (SayDS). However, the severity of the impacts of climatic events of the past two decades
have emphasized the need to strengthen linkages between climate change issues and national planning.
The contributionto the development of a National Mitigation Program, the design of a national pilot plan
to promote public awareness to adaptation and mitigation strategies, and the development of an
institutional framework to carry out public awareness activities are critical to encouraging the formulation
of priority plans for mitigation and adaptation to climate change.

GovernmentStrategy

2.3      FirstNational Communicationto the UNF'CCC
The Government of Argentina submitted its First National Communicationto the UNFCCC in 1997. The
project was led by the Secretaria de Ciencia, Tecnologia, e Innovacidn Productiva (SECyT) and the
executing agency was the Programa de las Naciones Unidaspara el Desarrollo (PNUD).

Theareas coveredby the study and the mainfindings are summarized as follows:
      1. An inventory of GHG was compiled, following IPCC procedures
      2. The overall vulnerability of water resourcesto climate change was investigated. It was concluded
         that:
            i.AdecreaseintheamountofprecipitationintheSouthernConewouldreducetheavailable
               volumes of water usedfor irrigation inthe arid and semi-arid regions of the country
           ii.Higherprecipitations wouldinturnincreasetherisks offlooding andinundations inthe
               humidregions of the country.
      3. The vulnerability to climate change of two specific ecosystemswas evaluated:
            i.Oasesbetween29"Sand 36's -TheseOasesare locatedat the foothills ofthe arid
               provinces of La Rioja, Sun Juan and Mendoza, the water resources of which depend on
               snow melt from Andean mountain tops. Increasing temperatures resulting from climatic

                                                      5

              changes would decrease minimum levels of snow cover and would therefore have impacts
              on summer meltingconditions.
           ii.Oceanlevelsalong theArgentine coastline-Two areaswerefoundtobeatriskfrom
              flooding due to increasing ocean levels: a) Bahia of Samborombdn, innorthem BuenosAires
              province, where economic losses would be significant; and b) Bahia Blanca and the Rio
              Colorado delta inthe south of Buenos Aires province.
     4. The vulnerability to climate change of the following two economic sectors was considered:
            i.Agriculture-Itwasfoundthatcropswouldbemoreaffectedthanlivestockactivities. The
              net impact on crops andpastureswas found to be negative.
           ii.Energy-Areductioninthevolumesofwaterfromsnowmeltwasfoundtohavesignificant
              repercussions for the electricity sector. Indeed, many hydroelectric facilities in the north-
              eastern region of the country operate using water from local rivers, the flow of which i s
              dependent of snow melt.
     5. Finally, the impact of climate change on public health was investigated, and results showed that
         higher temperatures could lead to increases in the number of the vectors of certain diseases (e.g.
         dengue, malaria, etc.)

GHG inventories were updated in 1999, and a revised version of the FirstCommunication was submitted
to the UNFCCC.

2.4      MitigationStrategies
Several projects have been implemented that have contributed to mitigating air pollution by the Argentine
energy sector, which have placed the country in the forefront of clean energy production. These include:
1) the construction and operation of several hydropower plants and two nuclear power plants; 2) the
replacement of coal and petroleum derivatives by natural gas for thermoelectric plants; 3) the promotion
of compressed natural gas (CNG) as motor vehicle fuel; 4) the adoption of specific regulations to abate
gas-flaring; and 5) the reduction of natural gas flaring at its source.

There have been pilot or sporadic measures implemented such as: (1) initiatives of co-generation of
electricity and heat in industry; (2) programs for energy-efficient drying of seeds and crops; (3) programs
of efficient street lighting; (4) energy saving initiatives in public and commercial buildings; and (5)
energy-saving residential heating systems. In spite of the fact that these measures present large saving
potentials, they were not supported by policy initiatives and other measures aimed to overcome existing
marketbarriers and, consequently, were not adoptedby either energy suppliers or consumers.

In addition, GOA has recently adopted a new set of policies aimed at reducing future GHG emissions,
which include: 1) the promotion of wind and solar energy through programs of temporary subsidies that
have been recently enacted as national law; 2) the promotion of co-generation projects and Rational Use
of Energy (RUE) programs; 3) the implementation of the Efficient Lighting Initiative (ELI), an IFC-GEF
project developed through ENDESA-ENDESUR (Argentina) and ELECNOR (Ped), which promotes the
sale of efficient lamps to residential users around the country; and 4) the implementation of the
Renewable Energies in the Rural Market project (PERMER), supported by the World Bank and GEF,
aimed to supply modem energy basedon renewable sources to dispersedrural populations.

Efforts have also been made to reduce emissions from deforestation.              Several afforestation and
reforestation programs are developing increasing interest, particularly within the framework of the Joint
Implementation (JI) and Clean DevelopmentMechanism (CDM). Technical cooperation programs, from
Germany and France for instance, have evaluated the participation of NGOs and other institutions in
projects that would improve carbon-sink capabilities in Argentina. The SAyDS i s actively participating
in CDM initiatives and has establishedthe O$cina Argentina del Mecanismo para un Desarrollo Limpio
(OAMDL), with the purpose of promoting projects that can be implemented within the context of the
CDM. The OAMDL was amongst the first non-Annex ICDM offices to formulate detailed guidelines
for project preparation and is conducting a series of workshops to advance in the formulation of
LULUCF-CDM projects.

In 1999, with the support of the Government of Canada and of the World Bank, the GOA publishedits
first National Strategy Study (NSS). These types of studies promote market-basedinstruments for GHG
reductions within the framework of the CDM. The results of the first NSS helped Argentina define its
position in global climate change negotiations. A second NSS is currently being conducted, funded by
the Bank, with the main purpose of identifying a portfolio of GHG mitigation projects that can be
implemented through the CDM. This activity is tightly related to the development of the National
Mitigation Programunder the presentproject

Initiatives currently existingfor the achievement of the Convention

2.5      Monitoring Systems
The occurrence of flooding events related to climate change led to the establishment of Inter-Province
Boards, which are responsible for the implementation of coordinated measures to address adverse effects
of heavy precipitation and flood events. Other mechanisms have been institutedat the national level to
coordinate responses to emergency situations. The Sistema de Alerta Hidroldgico del Rio Paranti, for
example, is managed from the Znstituto Nacional del Agua (INA), and is charged with the monitoring and
prediction of impacts from extreme climatic events


2.6      Programs Related to Public Awareness

Outreach activities to promote public awareness of climate change issues within Argentina are routinely
conducted by both public and private sector entities as well as by national and international NGOs. These
activities are mainly conducted by the SAyDS and the Federal Council on the Environment (COFEMA).
During the last two years, the SAyDS organized several workshops, seminars and public audiences on
climate change issues.       Other Secretariats, such as Science and Technology, Agriculture, Energy,
Transport, and Industry frequently participate in these activities. On the international front, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs was involved in discussions on membership of global agreements on climate change.
For example, the Ministrytook an active role in the negotiation and adoption of the Kyoto Protocol and
the elaboration of its implementation plan in Argentina, OECD environmental issues, and the bodies
derived from the international and regional agreements dealing with the Global Change Issues. The
Ministry established the Expanded Working Group on Environmental Issues (Grupo de Trabajo
Ampliado sobre Cuestiones Ambientales - GTACA) in early 1989, which meets regularly to inform
national stakeholders of relevant international discussions. The GTACA consolidates stakeholder inputs
anddefines anationalpositionon issuesunder debate at international fora.


3.       Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices

Constraints to the implementation of project activities
A series of issues exist, as described inthe following sections, which may difficult the implementation of
activities associated with the Second Communication. These constraints include technical, financial and
institutional issues that need to be addressedin order to guarantee the adequate execution of the project.
Provisions have been taken and incorporated in the various components, to overcome problems raised by
these issues.

3.1      Lack of Institutional Capacity to Produce GHGInventories and Upgrade Methodologies
Information and methodologies for producing GHG emission inventories have been limited to NGOs and
universities hiredon an ad-hoc basis. Local factors of emission are typically not available and therefore
international factors are used and adapted to local conditions. The project will help to institutionalize
practices for data collection and processing to maintain updated GHG emission inventories. Also, the
project will coordinate and harmonize methodologies to produce the GHG inventories and energy
balances.


                                                     7

3.2      Lack of Coordinationof InfrastructureInvestment Plans with Measures for Adaptation to
         Climate Change
Cross-sectoral coordination is needed to minimize investment costs, as rising water levels generally
require sound land-use policies and practices not only at the preventive but also at the corrective levels.
Settlements and human activities in general require adequate regulation by all affected sectors so that
climate change effects can be minimized.

3.3      Lack of Institutional Coordination on Policies, Programs, and Projects Related to
         Mitigationof GHGEmissions
A set of strategies needs to be developed to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficiency, energy
savings, substitution of fuel and energy sources, changes in transportation modes, and carbon
sequestration and substitution programs. A National Mitigation Program (Nh4P) will help drive
institutional coordination at all levels.

3.4      Low Electricity Prices and Institutional Weakness for Promoting Energy Efficiency
         Measures
Without a program in place to promote energy efficiency, considering the relatively clean production of
energy, and with very low energy prices, the incentives to adopt clean technologies are few.      Previous
experience in Argentina has shown that in the absence of a solid institutional framework, energy
efficiency, regardless of its economic benefits, is not perceived as a priority by energy consumers. Any
NMP that attempts to reduce emissions from the energy sector by promoting energy efficiency must do so
by introducing a balanced combination of market oriented EE programs, supporting policies and
regulations, public dissemination activities, and capacity-building activities aimed at main stakeholders.
Initiatives that will be considered to overcome barriers to energy efficiency include: (a) development of a
national EE strategy and design of enhanced EE policies and regulations, (b) implementation of public
awareness programs to support organized participation of civil society and key stakeholders; (c) support
to emergent Energy Services Companies (ESCOs); (d) establishment of a standardsand labelingprogram
for appliances, equipment, and building envelopes; and (e) capacity building activities aimed to support
implementingagencies, regulators and policy makers.

3.5      Lackof Incentivesto PromoteRenewableEnergy
As with energy efficiency, low energy prices provide a disincentive to new ventures in this field. The
NMP needs to introduce mechanisms that promote the use of renewable energy resources. Examples of
these mechanismsinclude: (a) temporary and targeted subsidiesto new technologies; (b) tax deductions to
companies at the development stage; (c) regulatory intervention to ensure the presence of renewable
technologies in the energy market; (d) technical assistance for fuel switching (e.g. biomass); and (e)
technology transfer to increasethe availability of suitable equipment.

3.6      Lack ofa CoordinatedTransportationPlanLinkingEnvironmentandLand-UsePolicies
Initiatives that may be considered to promote modal changes in travel behavior include: (a) construction
of segregated bus lanes; (b) construction of bicycle pathways; (c) education and promotion initiatives; (d)
monitoring of activities to inform users of the benefits of the mitigation programs; and (e) regulatory
intervention in freight shipping to promote changes in distribution of transportation modes (e.g. trucks,
navigation, railroad)


3.7      Lack of Governmental Commitment for Long-Term Plans that Favor Forestry and Bio-
         EnergyProjects
Programs that would increase the development of carbon sequestration projects are: (a) increased
promotion of the environmental benefits of the programs and of the financial gains that may be generated
from CDM-funded projects; and (b) government programs that support the formulation and promotion of
CDM-funded projects addressingsustainableforestry and bio-energy       .

1.1     NationalGHGInventories
The main objectives of this component are to upgrade national inventories of GHG emissions and to
develop indicators for evaluation of national emission trends. The following four tasks will be completed
as part of this component: (a) GHG inventory update, which will consist of a methodologicalrevision and
update of 1997 inventories with data from the year 2000. National GHG inventories will be estimated
and reported using the Revised 1996Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelinesfor
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as specified in the new guidelines for the preparation of National
Communications accordedin CP.8; (b) comparative analysis of previous and current GHG inventories, in
order to identify current trends of GHG emissions and main drivers of their changing patterns; (c)
development of own emission factors; and (d) harmonization of National Energy Balances with GHG
EmissionInventories, which involves the evaluation of modifications neededby existing National Energy
Balancesin order to make them compatible with Inventory Emission Source Categories (as defined by the
Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC).


1.2     VulnerabilityAssessment andInstitutionalStrengtheningfor Adaptation
This componentcomplementsprevious work and consists of vulnerability studies to assess the impacts of
                                                      10

climate change on the water resources of humid region of the country, where the large majority of the
population is concentrated and where most of the economic activity of the country occurs. These studies
will give a pathway to the future development of a long-term adaptation plan. Specifically, studies will be
conducted in the following areas: (a) the north western section of the Rio de la Plata coastline; (b) the
Gran Buenos Aires region, where the variable water levels of the Rio de la Plata and the seasonal
flooding of the Parana' river cause persistent flooding and inundations; (c) the Pampa Hcimeda, where
seasonal wet-dry cycles cause flooding and drought, respectively, and where the exploitation of ground
water resources i s not sustainable; (d) the Litoral-Mesopotamia region, where precipitation-induced
flooding of the major rivers i s a widespread and recurrent event; and (e) Patagonia, one of the arid
regions of the country.

1.2.1   Vulnerabilityofthe coastalzone
The study will assess the relative impact of climate change and human action on the degradation of the
coastline of the Rio de la Plata. In particular, focus will be put on assessing the impacts on the coastline
from: (a) changes in the river's water level caused by climate change; (b) flooding of the Rio Parana';and
(c) the expansion of the Parana' delta. All of these phenomena are likely to cause significant damages to
human settlements that have grown along the shores of the estuary. The socio-economic consequences of
these events and their repercussions on the development of the region will also be evaluated.

1.2.2   Vulnerabilityof thePampaBonaerense
This study is directed at evaluating the impact of climate change on the water resources of the Pampa
Hcimeda. The following aspects will be considered: (a) characterization of the region's water resources
(surface water and groundwater) to precipitation fluctuations; (b) evaluation of the effectiveness of flood
protection infrastructure existing in the area, including future effects if higher tides; (c) assessment of the
level of soil degradation in the region; (d) evaluation of socio-economic impact of climate change on the
Pampa Hcimeda ; and (e) suggestions of measures to mitigate damages and to adapt to future climatic
changes.

1.2.3   Vulnerabilityof agriculture productioninthePampa Hhmeda
This study will analyze the effects of climate change on the productivity and the vulnerability of crops in
the region and erosion in the higher part of the relevant tributary basins. The study will: (a) evaluate the
effects of the new measures on the drainage capacity and soil degradation potential of the region; (b)
assess whether the current productivity levels of the region can be maintained under expected climatic
conditions; (c) estimate the socio-economic impact of changes in productivity; and (d) propose mitigation
and adaptation strategies.

1.2.4   Vulnerabilityof the water resourcesintheLitoraLMesopotamiu
The objectives of the study are: (a) to determine how climate change, and more specifically higher
precipitation rates are likely to affect the major rivers of the area; (b) to estimate the extent of the
damages that may occur as a result of the changes; (c) to determine the socio-economic impact of the
flooding on the region and the effects on its economic growth; and (d) to propose mitigation and
adaptation strategiesto decrease future damage.


1.2.5   VulnerabilityofthePatagonia
This study will be conductedto assess the potential impacts of climate change inthe region, inparticular:
(a) determining how the surface and groundwater resourcesmay be affected; (b) proposing mitigation and
adaptation strategiesto reduce impacts from climate change; and (c) assessingthe socio-economic impact
climatic changes may have on Patagonia and on regional development.


1.2.6   Overallsocio-economicimpactsof climatechange
One of the objectives of the vulnerability assessments conducted i s to make predictions of how the
impacts of climate change on naturalresourcesmay affect the socio-economic development of the regions

                                                      11

in question. This study will compile results from all the studies performed for the Second National
Communication, as well as those from the First National Communication, and will help inthe assessment
of social and economic impacts of climate change. This involves: (a) compiling baseline scenarios (i,e.
present vulnerability of a system to a given climatic condition); (b) making assumptions on adaptation
capacity to climatic impacts; (c) makingprojections of future climate scenarios; (d) buildingconsensus on
potential policy scenarios and courses of action in response to climatic conditions; and (e) providing
support for the estimation of the costs andthe social implications of the various scenarios.


1.2.7   Vulnerability of the energy system and energyinfrastructure
This study will provide support for the evaluation o f (a) how climate change affects the electric
generating capacity of the country, considering the impact of snowpack reduction; (b) how climate
change affects the overall energy supply; (c) how climate change will affect the demand sector; and (d)
the adequacy of the existing energy infrastructure to supply future energy demands given the potential
impacts of climate change on the sector.

1.2.8   PreliminaryNationalAdaptationProgramand regional adaptationplans
This activity will draw from the results of the other studies with the objective of incorporating adaptive
capacity to climate change into national and regional development plans. Based on assessments from
previous components, this component will contribute to the development of a Preliminary National
Adaptation Program to: (a) identify climatic vulnerabilities; (b) help in the identification the most cost
effective and socially acceptable measures to prevent, or to adapt to, the negative impacts of climate
change; (c) give support in the identification of adequate policy measures and institutional framework to
implement the measures; and (d) contribute to proposals of resource allocation for the implementationof
adaptation programs.

1.2.9   Estimatesof regionalclimate change scenariosthrough RegionalClimateModels
The focus of this activity will be to support the generation of regional climate change projections using
high-resolution atmospheric circulation models. Models for Argentina have beendeveloped at the Centro
de Znvestigaciones del Mar y la Atmdsfera (CIMA I CONICET I UBA) and the Centro Nacional
Paragdnico (CENPAT / CONICET). Projections will cover the period from 1970 to 2050 and will be
based on a "business as usual" emission scenario. The information obtained will include predictions of
local circulation pattems and estimates of temperature and precipitation scenarios. This information will
subsequently be used in the assessment of the vulnerability of various regions to climate change and in
the planningof mitigation and adaptation strategies.

1.3      Formulationof NationalMitigationProgram(NMP)
A NMP will be formulated, which will include proposals for measures aimed at reducing national GHG
emissions. The NMP will help identify opportunities for mitigation of emissions through measures that
promote energy efficiency, energy savings, and renewable energy sources, through programs aimed at
reducing emissions in the transportation sector, and at promoting carbon sequestrationand substitution
programs. It will also consider options to reduce methane emissions from both waste and enteric
fermentation. The NMP will primarily concentrate on identifying measures aimed at removing currently
existingbarriers to these types of initiatives.

1.3.1    Energyefficiencymeasures(EEM)
The NMP will address current obstacles to the adoption of EEM, such as: (a) low prices of traditional
sources of energy; (b) excess generating capacity; (c) lack of incentives for distributors; (d) absence of
shared economic costs for EEM; (e) limited supply of energy efficient services; and (f) absence of
regulatory and financial frameworks to promote energy conservation. The NMP will promote the
introductionto programs that encourage energy efficiency and supporting regulation.

This sub-component will: (a) provide support in the identification of energy efficiency measures that can
be implemented as part of emission mitigation strategies; (b) contribute to the evaluation of the
                                                    12

applicability of EEM measures to the Argentine energy system; (c) assess the need for government
support of EEMinitiatives; and(d) identify programs that can be implemented through the CDM.


1.3.2    Transportationsector
The NMP will contribute to the promotion of measures that reduce GHG emissions from the
transportation sector, focusing on reductions of travel demand and on increases in travel efficiency.
Current barriers to these measures include, among others, consumer preferences and behaviors that are
not in line with environmental concerns. Institutionalizedmeasures therefore need to be implemented to
ensure the effectiveness of emission reduction initiatives. This study will: (a) update GHG emissions data
from all segments of the transportation sector; (b) evaluate the impact of the economic crisis on emissions
from the transportation sector; (c) assess the extent of regional and national emission mitigation strategies
in the transportation sector; (d) evaluate the impact of recent infrastructure developments on GHG
emissions; (e) perform cost-benefit analysis and feasibility studies of various types of emission reduction
initiatives (e.g. modal shifts versus technological improvements) in all segments of the transportation
sector; and (f) identify candidatecities where emission mitigation strategies may be implemented.

1.3.3    Renewableenergy(RE)
The NMP will include provisions to promote the use of renewable energy sources, which are currently
under-developed, in spite of their abundance and extensive potential. Obstacles that contribute to the
limited use of RE in Argentina, including among others: (a) its competitive disadvantage relative to the
electricity market; (b) a mismatch between demand and adequate supply locations; (c) constrained
demand; and (d) financing barriers. The project will (a) identify potential emission mitigations through
the development of renewable energy projects that can be implemented through the CDM; (b) promote
capacity-building on issues related to the use of renewable energy; and (c) identify policy and regulatory
options to facilitate the use of renewable energy, inparticularin areas without access to electricity grids.


1.3.4    Carbonsequestration
A number of obstacles exist to the development of carbon sequestration and substitution projects,
including: (a) the lack of suitable technical guidelines for the development of carbon sequestration and
substitution projects; (b) the uncertainty of the international framework for monitoring and validation of
LULUCF projects under the CDM; (c) the lack of technical and financial resources for the collection and
interpretation of bio-energy data; and (d) the lack of specific norms and incentives for the implementation
of actual carbon sequestration and substitution projects.

This component will (i)provide support in the evaluation of carbon sequestration and substitution
potential through LULUCF projects and policies; (ii)     encourage capacity-building for the assessment of
carbon sequestration and substitution potential from afforestation and reforestation projects; and (iii)
identify carbon sequestration and substitution projects that could be implemented through the CDM. To
that end, the study will help in the generation of information related to geo-referenced forest, classified
according to their carbon sequestrationpotential, to potentialities for afforestation and reforestation, and
to associated costs per additional sequestered carbon ton. Also, it will evaluate and assess on carbon
sequestrationfactors.

1.3.5    Reductionof entericmethaneemissions
The NMP will address the needto assess, and subsequently reduce, enteric methaneemissions from cattle
in Argentina. Current enteric methane figures have been estimated using emission factors developed
abroad, which may not be representative of local cattle raisingpractices and conditions. The objectives of
this component of the NMP are: first, to make provisions to determine local enteric methane emission
factors; second, to evaluate and adjust, if necessary, current national methane emission figures; and third,
to develop programs for the reduction of methane emissions from enteric fermentation.

1.4      PromotionofPublicAwareness
The objective of this component is to encourage the development of education plans and outreach
programs centered on the issue of climate change. The program will consist of two major sub-
components, as follows.

1.4.1    Trainingprogram
The focus of this sub-component is to promote the development of training programs for government
officials and general members of the community interested on climate change. The program seeks to
provide authorities at the national and regional level with methodology and background on climate
change issues.     The program also aims at encouraging individual and collective civil actions that
ultimately lead to reductions of GHG emissions and climate change impacts. It will be performed mainly
through the preparation and dissemination of training information and the organization of workshops,
seminars, web-based discussion groups and public audiences on climate change issues. These activities
will be targeted at specific audiences such as public servants, members of the private sector, NGOs,
academics, students, professionals, civil organizations, media personnel, civil society and community
leadersto encourage exchanges of informationand collaborations.

1.4.2    Promotionalcampaign
A promotional campaign will be organized to disseminate information on climate change, as well as to
promote the activities of the training program. The objective of the campaign is to raise the level of
awareness on the topic at a national level. Promotional material for all ages, consistent to that prepared
for the training program, will be distributed around the country. A leading role of the Secretariat of
Environment is expected. Other Secretariats, such as Science and Technology, Agriculture, Energy,
Transport, and Industry will also participate inpromotionalactivities.


1.5      DraftingofSecondNationalCommunicationto UNFCCC
This component addresses the actual generation of the SecondNational Communicationto the UNFCCC.
The document will compile results from the various project components and other publicly available
information, such as national statistics on population, social and cultural characteristics, economic
indicators, and institutional settings. The Second National Communication will be drafted, translated if
necessary, published, and ultimately distributed.

1.6      Project Management
Project management be the responsibility of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) that will be hosted at
the Fundacio'n Bariloche (see Section E below). Periodic progress reports on all project components will
be routinely evaluated to assess the adequate advance of the overall project. Four workshops have been
projected with participationof all coordinators, experts, and assistantswith the objective o f (a) launching
the project; (b) monitoring and evaluating progress; (c) exchanging information and results from the
various subprojects, particularly the development of the NMP; and (d) emitting a final assessment on the
outcome of the project. Lectures from experts have been envisioned as one additional method to verify
advances in the completion of objectives.


2.       Key Policy And Institutional Reforms Supported By The Project:

Mainstreaming climate change into national planning. This project seeks to ensure that appropriate
policies for adaptation and mitigation to climate change are incorporated into national planning. To this
end, vulnerability assessments of several ecosystems and economic sectors will be conducted. Adaptation
initiatives will subsequently be developed, and these will be integrated to the country's development plan.
The project will produce a National Mitigation Plan, which will involve active participation of
stakeholdersin its development and implementation.



                                                    14

Cross-sectoral Coordination. The project will strengthen coordination among the various institutions and
groups dealing with climate change related studies, by the formation of a Steering Committee, which will
include representatives from all relevant authorities and by a small group of recognized and prestigious
individuals. This committee will have the last word not only with respect to the project implementation,
but also to implement and monitor the national mitigation, and adaptation plans.

Public awareness and behavioral changes. The project will strengthen institutional capacity in terms of
promotingand sustaining public awareness and participation, as cultural and behavioral practices interms
of rationaluse of energy, transport, water, and land will definitely contribute to mitigate climate change.



3.       BenefitsAnd Target Population:

4.       Institutional And Implementation Arrangements:
4.1       GrantRecipientandProjectImplementation
The recipient of the grant will be the Fundacidn Bariloche (FB), which was selected for its trajectory,
institutional capacity and experience related to climate change topics to execute the project. It was
decided that an independent NGO could better achieve the project objectives without any institutional
bias and independent from the constant political cycles present in Argentina. F B will not only compile
the results from the different studies in order to produce the Second National Communication to the
Convention on Climate Change, but it will also directly implement Component A (Update of GHG
emissions inventory), given its experience and participation in previous inventories. All other studies will
                                                     15

be done through contracts to third parties, following the World Bank procurement procedures.

4.2     GeneralGuidance
The execution of the project will be directed by a Steering Committee that will be created with
representativesfrom the main federal authorities, as well as relevant members of academiaand the private
sector. The Steering Committee is the link between the Funducidn Buriloche, the Government and
stakeholders. Since the project involves strategic studies leading to the adoption of national policies, the
Steering Committee i s necessary to ensure proper ownership, while keepingimplementationand financial
responsibilities under FB's control.

The functions of the Steering Committee will be to direct the planning, implementation, and monitoring
stages of the project, by: (a) reviewing and definingterms of reference; (b) approving final structure of
project documents; (c) overseeing the selection of consultants; (d) defining the procurement and
implementation plans; (e) reviewing studies and implementation progress; and (f) setting strategic
orientation for the project outputs.

Representatives from the following government agencies, designated by the top official of each agency,
are acting membersof the Steering Committee:
 0   Secretariatof Environment and SustainableDevelopment, from the Ministryof Health

 0   Ministry of ForeignAffairs, International Trade, and Worship
 0   Secretariat of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation, from the Ministry of Education,
     Science andTechnology
 0   Secretariatof Energy and Secretariatof Transportation from the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public
     Investment and Services
 0   Under Secretariatof Water Resourcesfrom the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and
     Services
 0   Secretariatof Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, and Nutrition and Secretariat of Industry,Commerce
     and Small and MediumEnterprise from the Ministry of Economy and Production
The President of the Steering Committee will be the Secretary of Environment and Sustainable
Development.

The Steering Committee will have a Managing Committee, formed by its President and by the
representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the secretariat of Science, Technology and
Productive Innovation. The role of the managing committee i s to preside over the entire Committee,
overseeingits course and actions.

The Steering Committee will periodically report to the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs from Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship, on progress accomplished in the preparation of the
SecondCommunication. Likewise, the final version will be presented, by the Steering Committee, to the
Ministryof Foreign Affairs, International Trade andWorship.

4.3      ProjectImplementationUnit (PIU)
A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be establishedto carry out the different tasks associatedwith
the implementation of the project. The PIU office will be located in the Institute of Geochronology and
Isotopic Geology (INGEIS) of the Buenos Aires University (UBA). The PIU will provide logistical and
administrative support both to the Steering Committee andto FB. The PIUwill also act as a link between
the Steering Committee and the consultants contracted for the project studies. This unit will have a
Project Coordinator, a procurement and contract analyst, two technical experts with knowledge in
mitigation and vulnerability topics, and one generaltechnical assistant.

4.4.     Procurement
The PIU will be staffed with a procurement specialist who will be directly responsible for producing the
Project's procurement documents and overseeingcontract processing.

The Bank's Procurement Specialist (PS) has conducted a Procurement Capacity Assessment of the PIU.
                                                      16

Terms of reference for the PIUwere accordedduring the appraisal and negotiation mission that took place
from December 9 to 11,2002. A satisfactory revised Procurement Planfor the first year of execution was
a condition of effectiveness for the project,

4.5     FinancialManagement
Within the FB, the PIU will maintain adequate financial management systems-including          accounting,
financial reporting, and auditing systems-to   ensure that they can provide the Bank accurate and timely
information regarding project resources and expenditures, in accordance with:           (i)the Financial
Accounting, Reporting and Auditing Handbook (Washington, D.C.: World Bank, 1995), (ii)the
Guidelines and Terms of Reference for Audits of Projects with Financing by the World Bank in Latin
America (World Bank, May 1999), and (iii)     the Bank's Operational Policy (OP) and Best Practice (BP)
10.02, dated July 1996.

A Financial Management Assessment of Fundacidn Bariloche was conducted by the Banks Financial
Management Specialist (FMS). The terms of reference were agreed upon and results are expected to be
available duringthe appraisal and negotiation mission scheduledfor December 9-11, 2002

4.6     Auditing
The FB will maintain the records, accounts, files and project documentation, and will produce standard
financial statements according to International Accounting Standards (IAS). Project operations will be
audited on an annual basis following generally accepted auditing standards (compatible with IAS and
satisfactory to the Bank) and procedures consistently applied, by an independent qualified auditor (based
on applicable Bank guidelines). The audit and statements will be submittedto the Bank four months after
the end of the fiscal year. A section providingdetails on the audit will be includedinthe Project Manual.

4.7     Fundaci6nBariloche
The Fundacidn Bariloche was created in 1963, as a non-profit private organization engaged in scientific
and economic research, and education. It is associated to the United Nations University (UNU); to
UNESCO; to the International Federation of Institutes for Advanced Studies (IFIAS); and to the
Association of Ibero-american Education Televisi6n (ATEI). The FB has ample experience in dealing
with energy and environment, and in particular with climate change related topics.            In 1990-91
participated in elaborating a regional document with UNDP and IADB in preparation for the Rio Summit.
Later in 1994 participated with discussion papers for the Summit of the Americas. It has produced
technical documents for GEF and participated in the making of the national GHG emissions inventories,
undertaken for the FNC to the Parties to the Climate Change Convention, its revision in 1999, and in the
World Bank study on Flexible Mechanisms established under the Kyoto Protocol. With programs in
energy economics, and environment, the FB has a working relationship with prestigious international
organizations suchas WRI, UNDP, CEPAL, IISD, RISO, and the European Union.

In coordination with the RIS0      - UNEP Center, the Fundacidn Bariloche produced a study on the
Economic Aspects of Greenhouse Effect Gas Mitigation, which examined methodological aspects and
conceptual approaches to evaluation of mitigation actions. Within the same framework, the project
entitled "Energy and the Environment in Argentina: Past and Future Evolution" was also developed by
the FB for the RIS0 National Laboratory / UNEP and completed in March 1994.               The project on
EnvironmentalImpacts of the Latin American Energy System 1970 - 1990/ 1990 -2010, was carried out
by FB for OLADE and completed inAugust 1993.

There have beendifferent projects related to energy efficiency, both at domestic and the regional levels,
including the Study on the Rational Use of Energy in Argentina, carried out by Fundacidn Bariloche
within the framework of the COPED network, with partial financing from DGXVII / European Union.
Another study, "Confronting Climate Change. Economic Priorities and Climate Protection in Developing
Nations, Argentina Case Study", demonstrated that developing countries have taken significant steps to
reduce GHG emissions with far fewer technological and capital resources than developed nations. This
study was carried out with support from the National Environmental Trust and with the participation of a
network of NGOs and academic institutesof several developing countries (including the FB).

 D.       PROJECTRATIONALE

 1.       Project Alternatives ConsideredAnd Reasons For Rejection
 Government Execution. An alternative to the project design was the implementation by the Government
 of Argentina, with the support of a third party financial agency. However, it was decided that the
 implementation of such a cross-sectoralproject would better be in an unbiased institution detached from
 the government. This would not only avoid inter-institutional friction but potential bias towards a
 particular set of policies or priorities defined by any of the governmental agencies. Also, the FB offers an
 alternative way to routing the resources through the federal budget, in view of the current financial and
 fiscal difficulties. Argentina i s contributing with in-kindcounterpart resources, and the use of an NGO
 also facilitates full disbursement(100%) of the approved GEF grant.

 Limited geographical coverage. The project is only focusing at some key geographical areas when
 studying vulnerabilities to climate change. The Pampa Hu'meda, the coastal zone south of Buenos Aires,
 the Litoral-Mesopotamia and Parana' Delta, and Patagonia are the areas to be studied which will
 complement studies in the Oases area undertaken by the Enabling Activity to prepare the First National
 Communication to UNFCCC. These areas were selected for their contribution to the federal GDP; other
 areas inthe country will be studiedinfuture projects. Of particular interest are the basins near the Andean
 range, where much economic activity depends on the melting of snow pack. Climate change has a great
 impact in the hydrologic balance in these areas, which also host relevant productive activities such as
 wine and fruits, and winter tourism.

 Regional vs Federal participation. Regional participation in project coordination was considered, but at
 the end it was decided that the Steering Committee should only include representatives of federal
 agencies, as obligations under UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol fall under the responsibilities and
 functions of national agencies.Nonetheless, regionalparticipationat the implementationlevel will be key
 to ensure proper institutional ownership and first hand data and information sources.

 The only Bank projects financed with GEF resources under the Climate Change Operational Programs are
 PERMER and ELI (IFC project).           PERMER provides rural areas with reliable electric supply in a
 sustainable manner, using renewable sources (where feasible) in order to reduce Argentina's dependence
 on fossil fuels; the project also aims at removing market barriers to application, implementation, and
 dissemination of renewable energy sources. The province of Jujuy, for instance, was one of the first in
 which PERMER began implementation.                 The worlds first and most advanced rural off-grid
 concessionaire began providing rural off-grid electricity services to Jujuy in 1995. The concessionaire
 now serves a total of 3,050 rural customers, 1,333 of these with individual or collective photo-voltaic
 systems. The initial success of PERMER however, has been slowed down considerably given the current
 economic difficulties of the country. Studies involving the availability of markets for renewable energy,
 which were planned components of the project, have for instance not yet begun. The RE and EE studies
 to be conducted as part of the Second National Communication will therefore be used to produce an
 initial diagnostic of the RE market in Argentina. Results from these studies will later be used as a
 baseline for more specific characterizations envisioned by the PERMER. Coordination between energy
 experts from the two studies has been in effect, ensuring that results produced by the Second
 Communication are compatible with the objectives of the PERMER.

 ELI is a private sector project, which promotes the growth of markets for energy-efficient lighting
 technologies, aiming at reducing energy costs and resulting GHG emissions. The response to ELI-
 promotedprojects in Argentina has beenvery positive and includes, among others, the creation of the first
 ESCOs, the participation of electricity distribution companies in DSMprograms, and the development of
 educational programs that promote energy efficiency.

 Forestry projects are directly linked to the net emissions of GHG, as forests affect the global carbon
 balance by acting as carbon sinks. The Native Forests and Forestry Development projects promote
 conservation and adequate management of national forests.           The projects have contributed to the
 generation the first inventory of Argentine forests, which has resulted in a quantified the carbon sink
 capacity of the country.

 Bank projects that focus on flood prevention and water resource management offer more direct links to
 the vulnerabilities and adaptation components. The Flood Protection and Drainage Infrastructure
 Management projects, for instance, directly address issues related to the reduction of impacts from
 flooding in vulnerable areas of Argentina.            The Drainage Infrastructure Management project in
 particular, has contributed to the determination of flood-prone areas around the major rivers of the
 Litoral-Mesopotamia and has promoted creation of monitoring systems. The rural development projects
 focus, among other things, on promoting sustainable agricultural practices, which increase productivity
 and ensure the preservation of natural resources.

 National Strategy Studies (NSS), two of which have been funded by the Bank, promote market-based
                                                         19

instruments for GHG reductions within the framework of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
NSS primarily focus on the identificationof projects inthe forestry, transportation, and energy sectors.


Linkages to Other GEFImplementing Agencies' projects

UNDP implemented both the Country Study to prepare the First National Communication to the
UNFCCC; and also the project to revise the First Communication, and presented at Buenos Aires'
Conference of the Parties (COP). The first study centered in the Oases area as with respects to studying
climate change impact on vulnerability; other work was undertaken to identify opportunities for
mitigating GHG emissions. The revised version presented in 1999, centered its efforts in devising a way
for Argentina to acquire voluntary commitments regarding GHG emissions. This communication aims at
complementing preceding studies, so that policy making can benefit from the studies.



3.       LessonsLearnedAnd ReflectedInProjectDesign

The First Communication of the Parties was performedby UNDP in 1997. A revisedcommunication was
produced in 1999. Later that year, the Bank sponsored the first Argentine NSS, a study on opportunities
under the flexible mechanisms recently established by the Kyoto Protocol. Lessons learned from those
involvements can be summarized as follows:

0   Participation o f political stakeholders and decision makers in the development of policies and
    strategies i s o f critical importance, as this will ensure ownership of the project and commitment for
    the implementationphase. Since the project will help develop cross-sectoral strategies and programs,
    joint participation from all relevant governmental agencies since the project inception and during its
    development and implementation will ensure proper implementation and adequate mainstreaming at
    the different sectors.


0   A close coordination and supervision of the studies is needed, in particular with relation to the
    vulnerability assessments implemented by local institutions. This will ensure coherence in the
    approach of the strategies devised under the study.


0   Development of local emission factors and carbon sequestration coefficients i s important, as
    Argentina presents particularities not easy to standardize with general approaches.


0   Development o f regional circulation models i s important to better estimate vulnerability o f fragile and
    critical ecosystems.


0   A strong consultative process with the general public will ensure that whatever voluntary
    commitments are assumed or ratified are fully endorsed by the general population and stakeholders.


4.       IndicationsOf BorrowerCommitmentand Ownership
Art.41 of the Constitution of Argentina enshrines the main principles o f the national environmental
policy. International agreements approved by the Argentine Legislative branch have a high hierarchical
level inthe legal system, second only to the Constitution itself.

The GOA has shown a consistent commitment to the topic o f climate change and has demonstrated
leadership in the advancement o f current global policies that address this issue. In accordance with the
UNFCCC and COP decisions, GOA carried out the Project Study on Climate Change, and as a result, the
First National Communication of the Argentine Republic to the UNFCCC was submitted in 1997.
Argentina was amongst the first non-Annex Inations to submit a National Communication to the
UNFCCC. The GOA had an active participation in the negotiation o f the UNFCCC and the Kyoto
                                                        20

Protocol, contributing at the same time to the establishment and functioning of GEF and to the activities
of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), of which Bureau is a member. In November 1998,
Argentina hostedthe UNFCCC Fourth Meetingof the Conference of the Parties (COP-4), and contributed
to the understandingsreachedinBonn and Marrakech inJuly and November 2001 for the implementation
of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA). Under the BAPA, parties set a two-year deadline for
strengthening UNFCCC implementation .and preparing for the future entry into force of the Kyoto
Protocol.

Argentina, as member of IPCC's bureau, holds key posts in the preparation of the IPCC Special Reports
(application of Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol). More than 20 Argentine scientists are engagedas leading
and contributing authors as well as review editors of the IPCC Assessment Reports and, some of them,
were involved inthe preparation of the IPCC TAR Synthesis Report. Argentina's specialists are currently
contributing to the development of IPCC Technical Papers, such as that on Climate Change and
SustainableDevelopment, Climate Change and Biodiversity, and C02concentrations involving dangerous
effects to natural systems.

GOA has shown commitment to the project by establishing the Steering Committee, which not only will
guide project implementation, but also will be key to developing strategic plans for mitigating climate
change andlong-termadaptation plans.

5.       ValueAddedOfBank's Support For This Project
The Bank offers a multi-sectoral approach through on-going operations in Argentina and the rest of the
world related to climate change and its impact. Thus, preparing and implementing the project allows the
participation of seasoned experts already managing or involved with project related activities in the
country. This not only ensures a coherent and comprehensive view of the problem, but also favors the use
of existing information and local resources. Of particular interest are the Bank-supported projects in
Argentina on flood prevention, water resourcemanagement,urban transport, reduction of ozone-depleting
substances, native and commercial forestry, renewable energy, and ruraldevelopment.

Furthermore, the Bank i s implementing the second phase of a National Strategic Study on Climate
Change, aimed at developing institutional capacity for dealing with the flexible mechanisms originated in
the Kyoto Protocol, and leading to potential operations for the Bank's Prototype Carbon Fund.


E: SUMMARY PROJECTANALYSIS
(Detailed assessments are includedinthe project file, see Annex 8)

 1.       Economic (see Annex 4)
Other (specify) NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)

The economic loss in Argentina associatedto climate change is difficult to determine, due to the lack of
data andthe complex linkages amongst sectors. Costs could be structured into two categories:

 (i) Productivity losses derived from climate changes. Weather changes affect temperature and hydrologic
balance, and have influencein floods and economic activities such as agriculture and tourism. Argentina
 i s one of the 14 countries of the world most affected by flooding events, reaching economic losses greater
than 1.1% of GDP. Impacts on agricultural production derived from climate change are difficult to
 ascertain, as production practices may help exacerbate or diminish climate impact; soil salinization, and
 erosion are linkedto poor irrigation and land managementpractices.

 (ii) Economic costs associated to cleaner production of energy, and energy use, resulting from emission
 standards and regulation. High upfront costs, and market and regulation barriers prevent investments in
                                                      21

energy saving activities. Clean transport technologies involve higher costs not necessarily recoverable in
the short term.

2.       Financial(seeAnnex 4 andAnnex 5)
Argentina is in the throes of economic recession characterized by a plunge of the peso (by as much as
60%) since it was devalued and allowed to float inearly January 2002 following years of beingpeggedto
the U S dollar. In an effort to curb the rapid devaluation of its currency, Argentina recently imposed
restrictions on foreign exchangeholdings in domestic and foreign accounts. NationalBanks were ordered
to limit their dollar holdings and restrictions on bank transactions were imposed.           Additionally,
restrictions on cash withdrawals known as the "corralito" were created, as a means o f 1) protecting the
financial system from bankruptcy due to insufficient liquidity; and 2) to act as a pseudo-monetary policy
instrument.

Considering the current fiscal constraints, the grant recipient will be Fundacidn Bariloche, who will
implement the project without the need of passingthrough the national budget. Beingan NGO, the Bank
disbursementsfor the project expenses for all categories will be 100%

Fiscal Impact

The project will not have fiscal impact. Argentina's counterpart will be "in-kind", and derived from the
costs of representativesfrom the members of the Steering Committee involved in preparing, guiding, and
monitoring the implementation of the project. Also, from the costs of offices and other operating
resourcesutilized to that end.

3.       Technical
The project has been prepared with the inputs and participation of local and Bank experts involved not
only with climate change related on-going and past operations in Argentina, but also with access to
information about programs, experiences and priorities inthe areas of urban transport, rural development,
forestry, agriculture, energy, flood control, and water resource management. The project draws from the
results of the country studies undertaken to prepare the First Communication to UNFCCC, and from
previous and on-going studies aimed at estimating marginal cost from climate change mitigation
measures, and at identifying potentialCDM projects.

As per the geographical areas selected to conduct the vulnerability analysis, it is important to signal that
additional work with relation to the snow packs and their influence on the national hydrologic balance
may be necessary in the future to ensure a good assessment of the regional vulnerabilities, and adaptation
possibilities. This might be conducted as a bi-national project, incorporating the Chilean Andes into the
analysis.

4.       Institutional
Argentina's institutional framework for managing climate change issues and policies is relatively weak
and lacks coordination mechanisms. The only existing coordination mechanism with respect to climate
change is the Office for the Clean Development Mechanism of the Secretariat of Environment and
SustainableDevelopment, limited to developing and coordinating potentialCDM projects.

Climate change i s a complex issue that links different sector policies and programs. Human activities and
economic development usually entail GHG emissions resulting from energy use, organic matter
decomposition, and from changes in land's vegetal cover. Therefore, preventing climate change, or
adapting to it i s a matter that concerns all stakeholders, public and private. At the governmental level,
promoting the prevention and abatement of GHG emissions from energy use, involves the participation of
the Secretariats of Energy, Transport, Environment, and Industry; and the regulatory bodies on energy
(ENRE) and gas (ENARGAS) at the Ministry of Economics. Land-use related policies and programs,
which directly affect carbon sink capacity, fall under the Secretariats of Agriculture, Environment, and

                                                    22

Industry, and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Housing. Institutions dealing with climate change impacts
and adaptation programs include the National Institute on Water; the Subsecretariat of Water Resources;
the Secretariats of Health, Environment, and Agriculture, and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Housing.
National Meteorological Service, and the Secretariat of Public Works, are charged of monitoring impacts
and coordinating emergency responses in case of floods.

The agencies dealing with climate change from a cross-sectoral perspective are the Secretariats of
Environment, and Science and Technology; and the Ministry of ForeignAffairs, which not only leads the
negotiations and representation at international bodies and forums, but also performs as official focal
point for GEF. The leadership for conveying stakeholders and establishing nationalpositions with respect
to the on-going international negotiations has over the years movedfrom one Secretariat to the other. The
first communication to UNFCCC (1997) was led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and locally
coordinated by the Secretariat of Science and Technology. The revision to the First Communication
(1999), was led by the Secretariat of Environment. Today, the leadership i s back at the Ministry of
ForeignAffairs, who has not only requestedthe Bank support to implement the EnablingActivity project,
but also has already as focal point endorsedthe project and the designation of Fundacio'nBariloche as the
grant recipient.

The project will strive for strengtheningthe inter-agency and stakeholder coordination on climate change,
which will help to ensure project ownership, implementation of resulting policies by stakeholders, and
sustainability. To this end, a Steering Committee will be created, which will ensure coordination at the
government level; this will be a condition for effectiveness. To coordinate all other stakeholder
participation, the project will have open workshops, in addition to the mechanismsto be developed under
the Public Awareness component.

4.1     Executing Agencies
The FB will execute the project (for a full description of FB please refer to section C.4.7). A letter to this
effect has been sent by the Ministry of ForeignAffairs and Focal Point for the GEF on October 10 2002.
The FB will be responsiblefor entering into legal agreements with the Bank and will act as official liaison
for the project. The FB will be assistedas follows:

Steering Committee
The Steering Committee will oversee monitoring and evaluation of the project, including the coordination
of the overall audit, to ensure that it i s in compliance with the agreement entered into with the Bank. The
Committee will include representativesfrom the agencies in charge of climate change related issues (See
section C.4 for further details). Its Rules of Procedure will be agreed on its first session and incorporated
into the Manual of Operation of the project.

Proiect ImplementingUnit
The FB will establish a Project ImplementingUnit (PIU), whose core staff will be a Project Coordinator,
two technical experts, one procurement and contract expert, and one technical assistant. The PIU will
respond both to the FB, and to the President of the Steering Committee. The Project Coordinator will be
responsible for day-to-day operations of the project such as planning and report writing, procurement,
financial management, and technical monitoring and evaluation. The PIU will also be in charge of
preparing and implementingworkshops to exchange views about the project implementationwith relevant
stakeholders, and to advancethe preparation of the National Mitigation Program.

4.2     Project Management
Successful project management will be contingent on: (a) adequate coordination between the Steering
Committee and the FB; (b) timely financial evaluations; (c) adequate information for decision making
processes; (d) participatory processes with all relevant actors and stakeholders; and (e) timely response to
changes during project implementation.


                                                       23

Manual of Operations: The functions and responsibilities of the project management would be governed
by the Manual of Operations (MOP), which would include, among other aspects, a full description of
project activities, functioning of Steering Committee, and project procedures, financial guidelines, criteria
for selecting consultants, staffing, and assignment of staff responsibilities, project supervision, flow of
funds, special account, budgeting, auditing, reporting, as well as procurement and disbursement
procedures. MOP will be a condition of Grant Effectiveness.

4.3     Procurement Issues
Procurement arrangements and plans have been discussed with FB and are included in Annex 6 of the
PAD. The Manual of Operations will also include a full section on procurement procedures and
arrangements, and a two-year Procurement Plan for the project. The PIU will be responsible and will
follow StandardBank Proceduresfor all project procurement. Procurement includes consultant services,
goods and equipment.

The PIUwill be supportedby a procurement specialist who will be directly responsible for producingthe
Project's procurement documents and overseeingcontract processing.

A Procurement Capacity Assessment was conducted by the Bank's Procurement Specialist (PS) during
the appraisaland negotiation mission. The Overall Procurement Riskwas considered highdueto the lack
of experience of FB in contracting consulting firms under Bank Guidelines. The PS's recommendations
for improving FB's capacity and for mitigating risk included: a) the review and no objection by the Bank
of the specific agreement between the Government of Argentina and FB regarding the implementation of
this project would be a condition for grant effectiveness; b) the review and no objection by the Bank of
the Project Operational Manual would be a condition for loan effectiveness. The Operational Manual
shall indicate that contracts with local individuals shall be nominated in local currency; c) one
experiencedProcurement Specialist should be hired before the first Request for Proposals i s submitted to
Bank review; and d) all contracts with firms under every selection method should be subject to Bank prior
review. As for individuals, all contracts to be defined in the Operational Manual should also be subject to
prior review. Details of this assessment are includedinAnnex 6.

4.4     Financial ManagementIssues
Funduci6n Buriloche will have experienced accountants to maintain adequate financial management
systems-including     accounting, financial reporting, and auditing systems. In addition, PIU will also be
staffed with an accountant, to ensure that they can provide the Bank accurate and timely information
regarding project resources and expenditures, in accordance with:           (i)the Financial Accounting,
Reporting and Auditing Handbook (Washington, D.C.: World Bank, 1995), (ii)        the Guidelines and Terms
of Reference for Audits of Projects with Financing by the World Bank in Latin America (World Bank,
May 1999), and (iii)  the Bank's Operational Policy (OP) and Best Practice (BP) 10.02, datedJuly 1996.

A Financial Management Assessment of the FB was conducted by the Banks Financial Management
Specialist (FMS) during the appraisal and negotiations mission.          On the basis of the assessment
performed, the financial management team concludes that upon completion of the proposed action plan
the financial management of the FB, would satisfy the Bank minimum financial management
requirements.

Disbursements:A special account will be established in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. The
account will be managed by the FB, which will be responsible to regularly submit withdrawal
applications, supportedby the appropriate documentation according to Bank disbursement procedures.

Auditing: The PIU will be responsible for preparing combined financial statements for the project as a
whole. The project will be audited annually; an annual audit report of project accounts, and a separate
opinion with respect to the Statement of Expenditures and the Special Account will be prepared by
independentauditors acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and
the guidance provided inthe "Guidelines and Terms of Referencefor audits of Projects with Financingby
the World Bank inthe LatinAmerica and Caribbean Region". The auditors will be selectedbefore the end
                                                     24

of the first year to be audited. The PIU will send to the Bank a certified copy of the agreedaudit report no
later than four months after the end of each year. TORS for all audits should obtain the Bank's no
objection.

5.       Environmental

F.      SUSTAINABILITY AND RISKS
1.      Sustainability
[Note: Flagthe factors critical for the sustainability of project benefits.]
The project will promote integration of climate change concerns into sector policies and programs, while
promoting cross-sectoral coordination. This will help influence the investments of the country,
complementing and redirecting resources towards mitigation and adaptation options. Joint financial
efforts from different sectors will ensure a synergetic effect towards reducing GHG emissions and
adaptationrelated costs.

Active participation from all stakeholders inthe formulation of policies, programs and projects oriented to
both mitigating and adapting to climate change will ensure ownership and sustainability. Many of the
measures oriented to reduce GHG emissions also offer economic savings and local environmental
benefits and rational policies to avoid floods, erosion, and salinization will avoid future corrective and
expensive measures. Sustainability is therefore linked to achieving win-win results, geared by a
participatory andcoherent approach.

The project will aim at identifying investment options to be financed under the Clean Development
Mechanism, GEF, or the Carbon Prototype Fund.

Also, the project will identify barriers to measures contributing to reduce GHG emissions, such as energy
efficiency, use of renewable energy, or a rational transport system integrated to land-use policies; and to
sound adaptation measures involving land-use planning and enforcement, and adequate infrastructure
investment.

Argentina being part of UNFCCC i s obligated to continue to produce National Communications to the
convention, showing advance and policies oriented to comply with its objectives. National adaptation
plans will be necessary to minimize the impact of climate-influenced events such as flooding, hurricanes,
salinization, drought, and the associatedproductivity loss.

Finally, to ensure a sustained Government policy towards consistent goals and objectives in terms of
climate change mitigation and adaptation, the institutional layout will have to be strengthened. Not only
will a good and sustained coordination of policies have to be pursued through the Steering Committee,


                                                      27

but also it will be necessary to train officials at the institutional level to enhance the national capacity to
produce subsequent National Communications.

OverallRisk Rating:




Risk Analysis:
The overall risk associated with this project i s high because of a possible lack of government
commitment, especially after elections. The project requires a sustained participation of the Steering
Committee, which will depend on the political commitment of the different agencies involved.
Relationships between some of the key agencies have not been smooth in the recent past, as institutions
tendto compete for taking the leadingrole.

In order to mitigate this risk, the project has conditioned presentation to the World Bank Board of
Executive Directors on the establishment of a functioning Steering Committee, involving all key
authorities. Also, the government has shown a relatively consistent commitment to the issue of global
climate change; the active participation of the GOA in key positions of the P C C and COP, for instance,

                                                       28

indicates the level o f commitment o f this administration.

As to the participation o f stakeholders, the project also has the risk o f changes with respect to a
participatory approach with the community. A National Mitigation Program can only be effectively
implemented if developed with the participation o f stakeholders, usually responsible for effecting lhe
changes (behavioral and technology changes).

PROJECT COMPONENTS

A.       NationalGHG Inventories

Inaccordancewith Articles 4 and 12oftheUNFCCC, andtherelevant decisions ofthe COP, allParties
to the Convention must submit national Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventories to the Climate Change
secretariat. Inventories compile data on emissions of carbon dioxide (Cop), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide
(N20),as well as Non Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs), CO, and NOx. Emission
estimates are presented in accordance with the source categories of the Intergovemmental Panel on
Climate Change guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (1996) and following the new
guidelines for the preparation of NationalCommunications accordedin CP.8

The inventory focuses on emissions from the following sources: 1) energy use, and more specifically
relatedto the following category of use (i) residential; (ii)
                                                           commercial; (iii) (iv) industrial; and (iv)
                                                                             public;
transport; 2) power generation; 3) land use change, including(i)  agriculture; (ii)  forestry; and (iii)
                                                                                                      native
forests and vegetal cover; and 4) waste (i.e. solid waste, wastewater, and sewage). Guidelines are given
by IPCC on the manner inwhich emissions totals are to be estimated and reported.

The activities producing the largest shares of emissions correspond to: 1) combustion of fossil fuels,
consistently releasing approximately 90% of the total Copemissions and around 42% of the total GHG
emissions of the country; 2) enteric fermentation, releasing 62% of methane emissions and 19% of total
GHG emissions in 1997; and 3) management of agricultural soils, releasing 95% of total nitrous oxide
emissions and 21% of total GHG emissions in 1997 (see Annex 13 for the most recent information on
GHGemissions).

The main objectives of this component of the project are to: 1)upgrade inventories of GHGemissions; 2)
develop own factors of emissions; and 3) harmonize methodologies for developing energy balance and
GHG emission inventories. The following four tasks will be completed as part of this component:


a) GHG inventory update
The existing inventories of GHG emissions publishedin 1999 with data from 1997 will be updated with
data from the year 2000. National GHG inventories will be estimated and reported using the Revised
1996 Intergovemmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories. This will involve: i)gathering informationfrom all relevant sectors; ii)processingdata using
IPCC methodological tools, using bottom-up and top-down methodological approaches; iii)reviewing
and adjusting to national emission factors; and iv) analyzing evolving GHG emission trends and cross
sector evaluation.


b) Comparativeanalysis of previousand current GHGinventories
Argentina is one of the few countries in the world that will have performed four inventories of GHG
emissions covering the period 1990-2000. Consequently, a detailed assessment and analysis of the
evolution of emissions, by sector, will be conducted. This analysis aims at identifying current trends of
GHG emissions, as well as main drivers of their changing patterns.

Using pertinent socio-economic data, a series of indicators will subsequently be generated. These
indicators will reflect the evolution of emissions by economic activity, relative to population. Resultswill
illustrate the evolution of emissions duringthe period 1990-2000.

e) Developmentof national emissionfactors
The project will help develop own factors of emissions, which will allow a more accurate GHG emission
inventory. Up till now, most emissions have been calculated using either IPCC or EPA factors, adjusted
to localconditions.


d) Harmonization of National Energy Balancesand GHG Emission Inventories
This activity involves the evaluation of modifications needed by existing National Energy Balances in
order to makethem compatible with IPCC's categoriesof emission sources. Currently, the energy balance
structure groups energy consumption for commercial, public, and residential sub-sectorsunder one single
category, while the GHG emissions inventory separates it into the three groups. Since the methodology
for building the energy balance has been applied for years, the study proposesto identify any adjustment
and modificationthat should be incorporated in the elaboration of the National Energy Balances, in order
to makethemcompatible with the emissions inventories.


B.           VulnerabilityAssessment andInstitutionalStrengtheningfor Adavtation
This project will enable Argentina to expand on a series of vulnerability assessments that was conducted
as part of the First National Communication, which addressed potential impacts of climate change on
various regions of the country (see Annex 14 for a Table comparing activities implemented for the First
Communication and activities planned for the SecondCommunication). A second series of vulnerability
studies is proposed as part of this project, following guidelines accorded in CP.8. These studies will take
advantage of the development of a high resolution Regional Circulation Model (RCM) by the CIMA -
Centro de Znvestigucidn del Mar y la Atmdsfera, at the Scientific and Technological National Center.
This new RCM simulatesthe effects of climate change on hydrological conditions around the country and
suggests adequate adaptation strategies. Nine independent vulnerability studies will be conducted, as
describedinthe following sections. Terms of referencefor all of the studies are included inAnnex 12.

a) Vulnerability of the coastalzone

The leading role of the region in a national context, both politically and economically, is unquestionable,
The Rio de la Plafa basin generates approximately 89% of the gross domestic product of the country,
covers more than one third of the territory and i s home to about 79% of its population. The area i s
vulnerable to the tidal floods produced by storms over the Rio de la Plafa or over the nearby Atlantic
Ocean. The whole basin has historically undergone periodical occurrences of flooding and drought,
caused by, among others, a combination of rainfall patterns, topography, and soil conditions. However,
flooding patterns in recent times have noticeably changed and during the 1980s and 1990s floods were
large, repetitive, and resulting damages were extremely costly.

The impact of changing climatic conditions on the region is severe. The problem is particularly critical if
it is considered that, although the development of population centers in the basin concentrates in flood-
prone areas, infrastructure and services are designed for dry zones. More than 14 million people have
settled along the shores of the Rio de la Plata for instance, which implies enormous investments on
coastal areas. This type of investment is growing with time, without consideration to the potential risks
and consequences of rising ocean levels. Equally alarming i s the occupation of coastal areas for
precarious housing by impoverished population, with minimal infrastructure development, which
intensifies the social and economical impacts of the flooding events.

Given the impact on the coastal environment that a changing climate entails, this specific study
component will focus on the response of the coastline of the Rio de la Platu. The study will focus on two
areas: 1) Gran Buenos Aires; and 2) the Parund delta. It will focus on three objectives: 1) the impacts of
climate change on the water resources of the area, giving particular attention to the effects of the water
level of the Rio de la Plata on the coastline of the Grun Buenos Aires region; 2) the pervasive flooding of
the Rio Parand and its effect on the increasing water levels along the coastline of the Rio de la Plata; and
3 ) review of the relationships between climate change and the expansion of the Parund deltu, and the
                                                     38

resulting effects on the coastline of the Rio de la Plata.

These three events have the potential to cause major damages to the human settlements that have
developed along the shores of the estuary. This component of the project will thus assess the social and
economic effects that climate-change related events might have on the Gran Buenos Aires area. The
project will further evaluate the need to take remedial action in order to protect the settlements from
further climate change impacts, and to prevent additional environmental damage the coastline of the Rio
de la Plata.

b) Vulnerability of the Pampa Bonaerense
Since the beginning of the 1970s the Pampa Hdmeda has been subjected to a "Humid Cycle",
characterized by an increase in the frequency and the magnitude of precipitation events, as well as by
higher mean temperatures. Because of these climatic pattems, the area undergoes periods o f drought
followed by periods of flooding. The impact o f these climatic cycles, and particularly of the flooding, i s
aggravated by the flatness of the region. It i s clear that climate change events, and particularly the
occurrence of the "wet-dry" cycles, may drastically affect the surface water and the groundwater water
resources of the Pampa Bonaerense. It i s also to be expected that human intervention, through changes in
land use, deforestation, and other practices has worsened the capacity of the region to adapt to the
changing climate.

Given the economic importance of the area and the large number of people who may be at risk from
climate events, it i s of critical importance to develop adaptation strategies and mitigation measures to
reduce as much as possible the impacts of global warming. This component of the project will therefore
focus on the following areas: 1) characterization of the sensitivity of the region's water resources to
climate fluctuations. This assessment will partly build on results from other vulnerability studies that will
be conducted as part o f this project (i.e. components a and c). A particular emphasis will be given to the
evaluation of the status of current ground water resources; 2) evaluation of the effectiveness of drainage
and flood protection infrastructure works that have been constructed in the region; 3) assessment of the
level of degradation of soils in the Pampa Bonaerense;and 4) socio-economic impact of climatic changes
on the Pampa Bonaerense.



c) Vulnerabilityof agricultureproduction in the Pampa Hdmeda
The Pampa Hdmeda occupies approximately 18% of the country's total land area and produces
approximately 80% of its annual agricultural output. The region produces a variety o f temperate crops,
including most grains and oilseeds. Over 90% o f Argentina's soybean production, between 80 and 90%
of the corn, wheat, sorghum, barley, and sunflower production of the country take place in the region.

The livestock sector, traditionally strong in Argentina, i s also present in the Pampa Hdmeda, where it
occupies a portion of the available land. In fact nearly 90% of country's total beef production i s grass-
fed, and therefore depends on the existence o f pastures. The region can thus be divided into three zones
according to the predominant form of landuse: cropping, mixed cropAivestock, and livestock.

The introduction of new crops and new land management methods to the agricultural practices in the
Pampa Hdmedamay have causedchanges inthe area's ability to withstand the effects of extreme climatic
changes. In particular, the local drainage and soil water retention capacities, as well as the soil's
degradation potential may have been altered. This component of the project will focus on the potential
effects of climate change on the productivity and the vulnerability o f crops. The study will: 1) evaluate
whether the current productivity levels of the region can be maintained under projected climatic
conditions; 2) estimate the economic impacts o f a potential decrease in productivity; 3) assess the social
implications of lower regional productivity; and 4) propose adaptation measures to reduce the negative
impacts of climate change.

                                                                                                    Annex 2



d) Vulnerability of the water resources in the Litoral-Mesopotamia
This component of the project will evaluate the impacts of climate change on the water resources of the
Litoral-Mesopotamia. This region includes the provinces of Misiones, Corrientes,Entre Rios, Formosa,
Chaco and Santa Fe. The Litoral-Mesopotamia has a humid climate, comprises most of the Rio de la
Plata basin, and is the richest of the country in terms of its hydrologic resources. The study will focus on
some of the most prominent surface water resources in the region, such as the Bermejo and Pilcomayo
rivers, located on the northern part o f the Litoral-Mesopotamia region, and the Parand, Paraguay and
Uruguayrivers.

Climate effects on climate have shown great impact in this region, and streamflow values in the
Paranflaraguay     basin have increased leading to flooding. Besides, human activity has had marked,
detrimental effects on the hydrographical characteristics of the region of study and i s also blamed for
aggravating the conditions of the region and contributing to the dramatic flooding events that have
occurred in recent years. Examples of the negative human intervention include, among others: a) gradual
replacement of natural vegetation for foreign species; b) changes o f land-use from pastures to agricultural
land; c) non conservational practices of land clearing; d) changes in phreatic surface levels due to poor
irrigation practices; e) groundwater contamination from agrochemical use; g) use of river banks for
agricultural purposes during dry cycles; and h) development of infrastructure (i.e. roads, housing, etc.)
that forces the diversion of rivers and streams. These activities alter natural drainage and surface runoff
patterns, contribute to erosion processes, and are partly to blame for the extent of the damage caused by
flooding of the past three decades.

The purpose of this project component i s to evaluate the impact o f climate change on the water resources
of the Litoral-Mesopotamia. Pervasive flooding events and the magnitude of the damages make it critical
to understand how climate change i s affecting the hydrological characteristics of the region. The study
will: 1) assess if the observed changes in precipitation patterns are sufficient to cause such disruption of
hydrological regimes, or if human action i s also partly responsible for the observed behavior; 2)
determine how climate change, and more specifically higher precipitation rates are likely to affect the
major rivers of the area; 3) estimate the extent of the damages that may occur as a result of the changes;
4) determine the socio-economic impact of the flooding on the region and the effects on its economic
growth; and 5) propose mitigation and adaptation strategies that may contribute to decreasing future
damage.


e) Vulnerability of the Patagonia
Overgrazing has caused irreparable damage to the natural ecosystem, where it i s estimated that 80% of
the surface of the region presents some level of degradation.              The area has undergone partial
desertification, and the potential exists for a more widespread degradation.        Other factors that have
contributed to the occurrence of desertification, include deforestation, misuse o f water resources and
irrigation that have caused salinization, forest fires, mining, and petroleum exploration. Also, the glaciers
located in the highareas of Patagonia present signs of melting affecting the hydric and snowpack balance.
Agricultural activities in the Argentinean plains are maintained through irrigation and therefore, snowfall
fluctuations will likely have strong impacts inthe region.

The objectives of this project component are to: 1) estimate the impacts of climate change on the various
natural resources of the region; 2) estimate the effect of current land and water management practices on
the sustainability of the region's water resources; 3) propose mitigation andadaptation plans to reduce the
impacts of climate change; and 4) identify and evaluate the potential for socio-economic development of
the Patagonia inlight of possible climate change impacts.

f ) Overallsocio-economicimpactsof climatechange
Estimating the socio-economic impacts of climate change involves assessing the present and future
vulnerability of a sector or a community to the various climatic conditions. This, in turn, involves malung
estimates and projections of the evolution of the socio-economic system. These projections are strongly
dependent on assumptions about the adaptive capacity of the sector or the community, since the ability to
adapt to climate change may considerably reduce its negative impacts. The capacity to adapt to climate
change varies among regions and socioeconomic groups, and with time. It depends on existing scientific
and technical knowledge, information, infrastructure, skills, institutions, and funds. The poorest regions
and communities, which often lack all of these adaptation tools, are therefore those that are the most
vulnerable to climate change.

This component of the project aims at identifying the socio-economic impacts associated with climate
change and the range of options available for communities and institutions to respond to the changes.
Enhancing the adaptive capacity of these regions may be the best alternative to reducing future impacts of
climate change.

The study will build on results from vulnerability assessments conducted for the Second National
Communication on the Gran Buenos Aires area, the Pampa Hu'meda, the Litoral-Mesopotamia and the
Patugonia regions.     In addition, results from vulnerability studies conducted for the First National
Communication will also be used, namely those for the coastal areas of the country and for the Oasis
regions.    Estimating socio-economic impacts consists of various tasks, among which: 1) establishing
baselines, which involves assessing current environmental conditions and identifying vulnerabilities; 2)
determining projected emissions scenarios and estimating associated climate patterns; 3) assessing the
environmental impacts under the assumed climatic conditions; 4) evaluating system's adaptability to new
climatic and environmental conditions; 5) developing series of policies to address the various impacts;
and 6) determining the economic costs of the proposed policies and the effects they may have on the
development of the region

g) Vulnerability of the energy system and energy infrastructure
The impact of climate change on the energy system in Argentina must be evaluated in two stages, first on
a short-term basis, and later at a longer scale. On a short term, and the time horizon for this evaluation
must be determined based on estimates from climate change projections, the impacts of climate change
will primarily consist in changes of the role of the various energy sources in meeting the energy demands
 of the country. This short-term scenario can be illustrated by assuming that climate change leads, for
example, to shortages of water in certain regions of the country. To mitigate these impacts, water use i s
partly diverted from electric power generation to consumption, resulting in a decrease in the electricity
 generated. Other sources of energy must then be used to compensate for the loss of hydropower, altering
the patterns of consumption of energy sources. If this change in patterns o f consumption continues for a
 sufficiently long period o f time, then the impacts o f climate change need to be considered on a longer-
term scenario, at which point infrastructure changes may be needed to meet the changes in demand.

T h i s component of the project will focus on evaluating climate change impacts on the Argentine energy
 system. The demand for energy i s dominated by the transportation and industry sectors, which, in general
terms, primarily consume natural gas and derivates from petroleum. Interms o f energy supply, primary
 sources consist, again, mainly of petroleum products and natural gas. The share of hydro power to the
total electricity generated however, i s a factor of two larger than that of all the remaining sources.
Climate change i s not likely to affect exploitation of petroleum and natural gas, and therefore the direct
impacts of climate change will only be significant to the electricity sector. Impacts to the hydroelectric
 generating capacity of the country, however, will be felt across the energy system, since other sources
will have to compensate for any disruptions in energy supply. This study will evaluate: 1) how climate
change can affect the electric generating capacity of the country; 2) how this impact affects the energy
 supply; 3) how the demand sector will be influenced; and 4) the adequacy of the existing energy
infrastructure system.

                                                                                                    Annex 2



h) NationalAdaptation Program and regional adaptationplans

Based on the premise that adaptation strategies have the potential to significantly reduce the vulnerability
to climate change, this component of the project will build upon results of the previous components to
promote the development of adaptive capacity in Argentina. This objective can be approached from a
national development policy perspective, recognizing that many of the activities that promote adaptation
to climate change are in line with those that promote sustainable development. In fact, many o f the
communities who are the most vulnerable to climate change impacts also face problems of natural
resource depletion, and therefore climate adaptation and sustainability objectives can be pursuedjointly.
Itwill thereforebebeneficial to address issuesof adaptation capacity at the policy development stage.

Based on results from previous studies, this component will develop a framework o f adaptation policies
that may be incorporated either in the national development plan or in regional development initiatives.
This adaptation framework involves: 1) identification of climatic vulnerabilities; 2) choice of the most
cost effective and socially acceptable measures to prevent or to adapt to negative impacts of climate; 3)
assessment of adequate policy measures and institutional framework to implement the adaptation
initiatives; and4) allocation of resources for the implementation of adaptation programs.


i) Estimatesof regional climate changescenarios through Regional Climate Models
This component is aimed at contributing to the climate modelingefforts being carried out inArgentina, so
that simulations on future regional climate episodes can help develop regional and national climate
change mitigation strategies.

Results from separate GCM models are considerably different when they are used for predictions of
regional climatic patterns.   The reason for the discrepancies is that regional distribution of climate
variables, such as precipitation and temperature, are often strongly influenced by local features (i.e.
topography). The spatial resolution of G C M i s typically not sufficiently refined to capture these features,
and consequently the uncertainty of the predictions increases. GCM results are typically statistically
downscaled in order to obtain regional data. Another method that exists to refine model resolution i s that
of using limited-area models nested in global circulation models. This i s the methodology which will be
used by this project for the development of regional climate scenarios in Argentina. Regional scenarios of
climate change for Argentina will be based on an increase in greenhouse gases according to the IPCC
"business-as-usual" emission scenario.       T h i s scenario i s used to predict how emissions and the
atmospheric concentration of GHG might evolve in the absence of global efforts, in the present time, to
limit emissions. Predictions of climate for South America will be made over the period 1970 - 2050.
The information obtained will include predictions o f local circulation patterns and estimates of
temperature and precipitation scenarios.


C.       Formulationof NationalMitigationProeram

This project will promote the development of a National Mitigation Plan (NMP), which will include
measures for the reduction of national GHG emissions levels. The Plan will identify opportunities for
mitigation of emissions through measures inthe following areas, among others:

a) Energy Efficiency Measures (EEM)
The energy sector i s the largest emitter o f GHG in Argentina, in spite of the country's long trajectory
usingclean energy sources. Significant reductions to the amount of GHG emissions can be achieved by
increasing the efficiency of energy consumption. To that effect, government measures to promote the
Rational Use of Energy (URE) were first introduced, by law, during the 1985-89 period. The impact of
the initial phase of UREwas however limited, largely due to economic turmoil inthe Region at the end of
the 1980s, and to the short duration of the programs, which were not sufficiently long to accomplish

                                                       42

                                                                                                     Annex 2

significant changes inthe patterns of energy use.

Estimates of potential energy savings for Argentina reach values greater than 25% of the total national
energy consumption and it i s therefore clear that a NMP for GHG emissions must include mitigation
measures for the energy sector. However, several obstacles are currently in place that difficult the
effectiveness of these measures and the NMP must introduce initiatives that specifically address some of
these barriers. These barriers include: 1) low prices of energy; 2) excess generating capacity; 3) lack of
incentives for distributors; 4) absence of shared economic responsibility; 5) limited supply of energy
efficient services; and 6) absence o f regulatory and financial frameworks to promote energy conservation

Previous experience in Argentina has shown that in the absence of a solid institutionalframework, energy
efficiency, regardless of its economic benefits, is not a priority of energy consumers. It i s therefore clear
that any NMP that attempts to reduce emissions from the energy system by promoting energy
conservation must do so by introducing a combination of programs that promote efficiency, as well as
regulation that accompanies those programs. This component will (i)           develop portfolio o f energy
efficiency measures that can be implemented as part of emission mitigation strategies; (ii)      evaluate the
applicability of EEM measures to the Argentine energy system; (iii)        assess the need for government
support of EEMinitiatives; and(iv) identify programs that can be implemented through the CDM

b) GHGEmission Mitigation in the Transportsector
The contribution of the transportation sector to the GHG emission balance in Argentina i s considerable,
making it an important factor in any emission reduction strategy or climate change mitigation plan. Well-
known measures to reduce transportation emissions essentially address two issues, namely a reduction of
travel demand or an increase intravel efficiency.

The first type of emission mitigation measures, those aimed at changing transportation patterns and at
reducing the demand for traveling, include initiatives such as: 1) promoting shifts in modes of travel from
automobiles to public transportation; 2) promoting emission-free modes of transportation (Le. bicycles);
3) instituting road pricing programs, which charge drivers for the use of particularly congested roads
duringpeak hours; 4) promoting travel blending initiatives, which consist of programs aimed at reducing
private car use by modifying travel behavior; 5) introducing zoning regulations; 6) establishing location-
efficient mortgages; 7) implementinglocation-dependent development costs; 8) encouraging substitutions
of communications for traveling; and 9) adjusting automobile insurance policies according to average
distances traveled.

The second type of measures can be achieved by improving vehicle efficiency. Examples of measures
that can be implemented include: 1) programs that eliminate old, inefficient and polluting cars; 2) system
of taxes on the sale of inefficient vehicles; 3) programs that charge taxes on vehicle fuels; and 4) fuel
conversion programs, a measure that has already been implemented in Argentina, where approximately
12% of private automobiles and 47% of the taxis have converted from gas to compressed natural gas
(CNG).

The NationalMitigation Program will address the need to introduce measures such as the ones mentioned,
to control GHG emissions from the transportation sector. To that end, current strategies will be assessed
andmeasuresto reduce GHGemissions will beevaluated usingcost-benefit analysis.

c) Renewable energy sources (RE)
The generation of renewable energy has a large potential in Argentina. Several commercially proven
technologies are available to make use of existing resources such as: 1) small-scale hydropower; 2) solar
energy; 3) solar thermal power; 4) wind power; 5) biomass power; 6) biogas power; 7) geothermal power;
and 8) wood energy.

The NMP must include provisions to promote the use of renewable energy sources. Given the extensive
potential of resources of Argentina, an emphasis should be put on the inclusion o f these energy sources
into the mainstream of power generation options. However, with the exception of large-scale hydro-
power, most of the renewable energy resources in Argentina are under developed.

                                                      43

                                                                                                   Annex 2

Several obstacles contribute to the limited use of RE in Argentina, including: 1) a mismatch between
demand and adequate supply locations; 2) constrained demand; and 3) financing barriers for RE projects.
However, the most significant barrier to the development of the renewable energy sector and in the future
role it may achieve in Argentina involves its competitive disadvantage relative to the current, liberalized
electricity market.

The NMPtherefore needs to introduce mechanisms that promote the use o f renewable energy resources.
Examples o f these mechanisms may include, for instance: (a) temporary subsidies to new, targeted
technologies at the research, development, demonstration, or commercialization stage; (b) temporary
subsidies that cover the cost difference between renewable and less costly options; (c) tax deductions to
suppliers of RE; and (d) regulation covering both supply and demand of RE. The project will identify
potential GHGemission reductions due to RET use; and identify policy and regulatory options.

d) Carbon dioxide sequestration
Land-use, land-use change, and forestry activities (LULUCFs) reduce GHG emissions and may evolve
into programs that qualify for emission trades under the provisions o f the Kyoto Protocol.             The
development o f forests is an example of LULUCFs, and an effective mechanism of sequestering carbon
dioxide (C02) present in the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration by forests can be achieved in two basic
ways: 1) by maintaining existing sinks of C02, which can be achieved, for instance, by conserving and
sustainably managing existing forests; and 2) by expanding sinks of C02 through, among others,
expanding planted forests. Additionally, the forestry sector can contribute to decreasing GHG emissions
by promoting a reduction in the use of disposable forestry goods. The potential for development of carbon
sequestration and substitution projects in Argentina i s extensive. The N M S will therefore promote the
implementation o f these types o f projects and provide guidelines and methodology for identifying
potential sites.

This study will aim at: a) evaluating carbon sequestration and substitution potential through LULUCF
projects; b) building capacity for the assessment of carbon sequestration and substitution potential from
afforestation and reforestation projects; c) identifying carbon sequestration and substitution projects that
can be implemented through the CDM; and d) developing policy options to promote carbon sequestration
through afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation prevention measures.

e) Reduction of methane enteric emissions
The 1999 revision of the 1997 GHG emission inventory provides the most current figures available on
GHG emissions from the agriculture and livestock sectors in Argentina. According to the report, the
livestock sector alone i s responsible for approximately 35% of the total GHG emissions, which are
primarily methane but also, include nitrous oxide. More specifically, approximately 68% of the total
methane emissions in Argentina are released by the agriculture and livestock sector. Cattle release
approximately 92% o f the total methane emissions liberatedfrom enteric fermentation.

Current enteric methane figures have been estimated usingemission factors developed abroad, which may
not be representative of local cattle raising practices and conditions. The objectives of this component of
the NMP are: a) to perform monitoring and sampling o f Argentine livestock emissions in order to
determine local emissions of methane by enteric fermentation processes; b) to compare these measured
factors with those used in the prediction of methane emissions in the country; c) to adjust emission figures
included in GHG inventories if significant differences exist between measured and estimated factors; and
d) to develop programs that reduce methane emissions from enteric fermentation


D.       Promotionof PublicAwareness
The objective of the public awareness program i s to develop education and outreach programs that focus
on the issue of climate change. This project component will consist of two sub-components, namely a
communication campaign and a training program. These two components will be designed in accordance
to guidelines agreed inCP.8.

                                                      44

                                                                                                  Annex 2

a) Communication campaign
The public awareness program will promote the climate change training program, raise awareness on the
topic, and will encourage individual and collective actions aimed at reducing practices that contribute to
climate change. The promotion of public awareness on climate change issues will focus on encouraging
environmentally responsiblebehavior through five key concepts. The program will foster: i)awareness -
sensitivity to climate change and overall global warming issues; ii)knowledge - understanding of the
causes and consequences of global climate change, the impacts it may have on the population, and of
potential measures that can be implemented to reduce its impacts; iii)attitudes - concern for the
environment, personal motivation and commitment to participate in activities promoting environmental
improvement and protection; iv) skills - ability to identify and investigate climate change issues and to
contribute to their solution; and v) participation - active involvement in working towards the reduction of
climate change. The promotional campaign will be conducted at the national level, through newspapers,
radio, andtelevision, and will target a widespreadaudience. No institutionalprovision has yet beenmade
regardingthe implementation of the public awareness program.


b) Trainingprogram
The project will develop a pilot training program for community leaders, as well as for all members of the
community interested in the topic. Inorder to reach a widespread audience, the project will involve the
media, educational institutions, NGOs and any other organization that could contribute in any way to
climate change outreach. Audiences need to be specifically targeted in order to maximize the efficiency
of the education campaign. All population groups, both urban and rural, must be taken into account,
including all students andteachers, professionals,parents, senior citizens, community leaders, etc.

The project will focus on building capacity and on assisting for planning and conducting future public
awareness campaigns. Following i s a series of activities suggestedas a way of implementingthe climate
change training program: i)review, evaluation, and update of current public environmental information
programs, such as those currently implemented by the SAyDS; ii)information exchange on climate
change challenges and opportunities of involvement for leaders and representatives from stakeholders'
institutions; iii)development of grade school and informal education materials such as booklets, manuals,
brochures, interpretive displays, training manuals, and slide shows; iv) coordination of seminars,
workshops, and public audiences; v) improvement of the OAMDL web site to host the "National Climate
Change Web Site". A plan for evaluating the success of the pilot program and for the establishment of a
continuous awareness and training program must be implemented.              After any outreach product is
distributed to the intended audience, follow-up monitoring activities will be instituted such that the
effectivenessof the product can be assessed.



E.       Draftinp of Second National Communication to UNFCCC

This component addresses the actual generation of the SecondNational Communication. The document
will compile results from the various project components and other publicly available information. This
information includes national statistics on population, social and cultural characteristics, economic
indicators, and institutional settings.

The Second NationalCommunication will includethe following sections: i)national statistics; ii)national
inventories and emission factors; iii)methodological review and comparative analysis of previous and
current GHG inventories (1990-1994-1997-2000); iv) study on the possibilities to increase consistency
between National Energy Balances and the Inventory Emission Source Categories; v) vulnerability
assessment and institutional strengthening for adaptation; vi) preliminary formulation of a National
Mitigation Program; vii) development of circulation models and climate change scenarios; viii) statement
of financial needs; ix) promotion of public awareness. The Second National Communication will be

F.       ProgressReportsand Workshops

Periodic progress reports on all project components will be routinely evaluated to assess the adequate
advancement of the overall project. Four workshops have been projected with participation of all
coordinators, experts, and assistants with the objective o f (i)
                                                              launching the project; (ii)

The table below summarizes the preliminary project procurement plan. Procurement arrangements result
from the technical complexity of the studies to be delivered and from the tight available budget. The
project team has intensively reviewed these arrangements and agreed on the need of using most of the
available selections methods in view of the above-mentioned complexity and budget constraints.

2\ Justification for the use of SS Selection
Study objective: Todevelop estimatesof climate change scenarios through regional climate models.
This contract will be awarded to CIMA, which is the only institution in Argentina with the experience,
capacity, data, and on-going, research suitable to implement the study. Since 1987, the Centro del
Investigaciones del Mary la Atmdsfera (CIMA) has been usingregional models to study the response of
meteorological systems in South America and in the Antarctic Peninsula to global climate change.
Recent pilot studies have been conducted to model the South American climate, using a technique
developed at CIMA, based on the simultaneous use of a regional model and a global model of variable
resolution. CIMA i s currently runningan Atmosphere General Circulation Model (AGCM) coupled to an
ocean model developed at IPSL, France, as well as a regional high-resolution model M M 5 developed at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), USA. Additionally, C I M A also has results from
simulations from 1860-2000, which were performed using a coupled ocean-atmosphere model from the
IPSL that also incorporates a carbon-model.

            UPDATE OF NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INVENTORIES

                              PRELIMINARY TERMS OF REFERENCE

A.       Background
Inaccordancewith Articles 4 and 12of the UNFCCC, andtherelevant decisionsoftheCOP, allParties
to the Convention must submit national Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventories to the Climate Change
secretariat. Inventories compile data on emissions of carbon dioxide (C02), methane (CK), nitrous oxide
(N20),as well as Non Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs), CO, and NOx. Emission
estimates are presented in accordance with the source categories of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Changeguidelines for NationalGreenhouseGas Inventories (1996).

The inventory focuses on emissions from the following sources: 1) energy use, and more specifically
related to the following category of use (i)residential; (ii)
                                                           commercial; (iii) (iv) industrial; and (iv)
                                                                             public;
transport; 2) power generation; 3) land use change, including (i) agriculture; (ii) forestry; and (iii)
                                                                                                     native
forests and vegetal cover; and 4) waste (i.e. solid waste, wastewater, and sewage). Guidelines are given
by IPCC on the manner in which emissionstotals are to be estimatedand reported.

The activities producing the largest shares of emissions correspond to: 1) combustion of fossil fuels,
consistently releasing approximately 90% of the total C02 emissions and around 42% of the total GHG
emissions of the country; 2) enteric fermentation, releasing 62% of methane emissions and 19% of total
GHG emissions in 1997; and 3) management of agricultural soils, releasing 95% of total nitrous oxide
emissions and 21% of total GHG emissions in 1997 (see Annex 13 for the most recent information on
Argentine GHGemissions).

The main objectives of this component of the project are to: 1) upgradeinventories of GHGemissions; 2)
develop own factors of emissions; and 3) harmonize methodologies for developing energy balance and
GHGemission inventories. All project components will beexecutedfollowing the new guidelines for the
preparation of NationalCommunications accorded inCP.8.


GHG inventory update
The existing inventories of GHG emissions published in 1999 with data from 1997 will be updated with
data from the year 2000. National GHG inventories will be estimated and reported using the Revised
1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories. This will involve: i)gathering information from all relevant sectors; ii)processingdata using
IPCC methodological tools; iii)reviewing and adjusting national emission factors; and iv) analyzing
evolving GHGemission trends and cross sector evaluation.


Comparative analysis of previous and current GHG inventories
Argentina is one of the few countries in the world that will have performed four inventories of GHG
emissions covering the period 1990-2000. Consequently, a detailed assessment and analysis of the
evolution of emissions, by sector, will be conducted. This analysis aims at identifying current trends of
GHGemissions, as well as main drivers of their changingpatterns.

Using pertinent socio-economic data, a series of indicators will subsequently be generated. These
indicators will reflect the evolution of emissions by economic activity, relative to population. Results will
illustrate the evolution of emissions duringthe period 1990-2000.

Evaluation of National Energy Balances
This activity involves the evaluation of modifications neededby the existingNational Energy Balances in
order to make them compatible with Inventory Emission Source Categories. Currently, the energy
balance structure groups energy consumption for commercial, public, and residential sub-sectors under
one single category, while the GHG emissions inventory separates it into the three groups. Since the
methodology for building the energy balances has been applied for years, the study proposes to identify
any adjustment and modification that should be incorporated in the elaboration of the National Energy
Balances, in order to makethem compatible with the emissions inventories.

                            VULNERABILITY OF THE COASTAL ZONE
                             PRELIMINARYTERMS OF REFERENCE

A.       Background
The FirstNational Communication of the Argentinean Government to the UNFCCC of 1997 proposed to
evaluate the coastal vulnerability of the country to the impacts of climate change. The scope of the final
analysis was restricted to the ocean coastline of the Buenos Aires province and to the Bahia de
Samborombdn inthe Rio de la Plata basin. The final report concluded that the region would be severely
affected by any change in sea level, and that even a small raise of the ocean level would cause major
flooding of the planes on the valley of the Rio Salado. Moreover, it was found that an increase of the
base level of the river could decrease the drainage potential for the entire province, which could
subsequentlylead to flooding of one of the most prominent agricultural areas of the country.

The First National Communication was useful to assess the magnitude of potential impacts of climate
change on a portion of the coastal areas of the Rio de la Plata, an estuary where the mean water level is
less than one meter over the nearby sea level. Nonetheless, the studies conducted did not evaluate the
vulnerability of the entire coastline of the Rio de la Plata. Given the economic and social importance of
the region, a more in-depth analysis of its vulnerability to potential climatic changes i s justified, and will
be conducted as part of the Second National Communication. This component of the study will thus
build on results from the First National Communication and will address the vulnerability to climate
change of the coastline of the Rio de la Plata, in particular the region located to the north west of the
Bahia de Samborombdn. Although the region occupies less than 10% of the total area of the country, it
                          .
i s the most important urban center and houses almost 40% of the total population. The area's high
population density makes it particularly vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change. Given the
impact on the coastal environment that a changing climate entails, this specific study component will
focus on the response of the coastline of the Rio de la Plata. The study will focus on two areas: 1) Gran
Buenos Aires; and 2) the Parand delta.
Gran Buenos Aires area
The GranBuenos Areas region is locatedinthe northern part of the Buenos Aires province. Several facts
contribute to persistent flooding of the area. First, flooding of the Parand river, caused by heavy
precipitations during spring and summer.        Floods are of long duration, such that in certain zones,
unusually high water levels can exist for several months.          When precipitations are high, internal
tributaries of the Parand and Uruguay rivers flood, making the overflow conditions at the larger rivers
even more delicate. Second, the flatness of the region accentuates drainage problems. The third factor
contributing to flooding of the region are the sudestadas,which are Atlantic storms characterized by very
strong winds, persistent precipitation, and low temperatures. These Atlantic winds are of high velocity
and are believed to raise water levels in the region.

The area of Gran Buenos Aires comprises two zones, the Regidn Pampeana and arelatively small strip of
land bordering the Parand river. Both sub-regions are characterized by the absence of topographic relief
and by flat slopes. Precipitation rates oscillate between 800 and 1000 d y r . The area is windy, with
currents from the Atlantic bringing moisture, and cool winds from the South bringing freezing
temperatures. The characteristics of the Regidn Pampeana are described in a later section. The strip
along the Paranci river has a zone of high elevations, where flooding is not a concern. As the river banks
are approached however, this high zone abruptly ends in steep cliffs and the low side is greatly affected
by both flooding of the river and by precipitation events. Various settlements exist in this zone of risk of
the Parand, most of which are of precarious nature, where inhabitants live exposedto the risks imposed
by changing climate.

The delta region
The delta region extends from the Paranci river towards the North into the province of Entre Rios. It is a
region of low elevations underlain by sedimentary soils that were deposited by the Parand river. The
delta i s characterizedby the presence of islands of very dense vegetation, the interior of which is usually
                                                      67

covered by water. A second characteristic i s the presence of numerous rivers and streams that cut across
the entire region. Due to its very flat slope, the delta is constantly subjected to inundations. The climate
o f the delta i s temperate, and precipitation rates are in the order of 950 d y r . The area i s subjected to
strong winds from the South and the Southeast, which tend to drive recurrent precipitation events. Rains
caused by the action of Southern winds, referred to as Pamperos, are of high intensity but of short
duration. Southeast Atlantic winds drive the Sudestadas, with persistent precipitations but of lesser
intensity than that caused by the Pamperos. The sudestadas have a profound effect on the hydrologic
characteristics o f the delta.

The Parand delta i s currently growing towards the city of Buenos Aires at a pace o f 40 d y r , as a result o f
sediment deposition by the Bermejo andthe Pilcomayo rivers. These rivers originate inthe Andean peaks
o f Argentina and Bolivia, where steep slopes and high stream velocities cause erosion o f the underlying
rock. The sediments produced are transported downstream and deposited in flat areas. It i s estimated that
approximately 100 million tons of sediments are transported each year into the Paraguay and Parand
rivers, although not exclusively by the Bermejo. At the present rate of expansion, it i s estimated that the
Parand delta will reach the suburbs of Buenos Aires inapproximately 100-150years.

                         VULNERABILITY OF THE PAMPA BONAERENSE
                              PRELIMINARYTERMS OFREFERENCE

A.      Background

The Pampa Bonaerense or Pampa Hdmeda is located in the Buenos Aires province. It shares the
topographic characteristics of the Pampa region, namely widespread flat slopes and a virtual lack of
topographic features. The climate of the region i s temperate, with annual precipitations typically ranging
from 600 to 1000 mm. The region has traditionally been subjected to wet-dry cycles, which cause
alternating periods of flooding and drought. The severity of flooding events in the past twenty years has
increased, with resulting economic and environmental impacts on the area. Droughts have also become
more frequent, causing permanent damage to the soils. In addition to the problems associated with
surface water resources, unsustainable practices in the area have led to the over-exploitation and
contamination of groundwater aquifers.

Flooding in the region occurs primarily along the plains of one of its most prominent rivers, the Rio
Salado. The drainage basin of the Rio Salado also includes the Rio Samborombo'n, along with an
extensive network of streams and lakes. Given the low regional gradients, the system carries large
volumes of water at very low velocities. Two characteristics of the area aggravate drainage conditions
duringhigh-intensity rainfalls and contribute to the extent of inundations: 1)rainfall is often accompanied
by strong winds that drive floodwater further inland, away from river banks; and 2) phreatic levels are
typically very close to the surface, which limits the water retention capacity o f the soils. Excess water has
therefore no pathway for drainage and accumulates on the surface creating enormous, flat floodplains.
Evapotranspiration is often the only mechanism for water to be evacuated, which explains the long
residence times of floodwaters.      Damages are often considerable due to the destruction of crops,
infrastructure, animal and even human life.

Conversely, during periods of drought, waterways tend to decay and typically lead to the death of
vegetation and the loss of surface cover.       Windy conditions in the area subsequently cause surface
erosion, through processes of suspension, transport, and re-deposition of local sediments. Additionally,
duringthe dry periods, evaporationof the upper water table, typically close to the ground surface, leads to
salinization of the soils. Even short periods of drought result in noticeable deterioration of the soils,
changes in the area's ecosystems and in the human activities associated with them.

The state of groundwater resources in the Pampa Bonaerense is also a matter o f concern given their
particularly poor management. The overexploitation of groundwater aquifers has already created serious
environmental problems in the past and will continue to jeopardize future subsurface water resources.
Three interconnected aquifers exist in the province, the Puelches, the Pampeano, and the Parana'.
Pumpingfrom the Pampeano aquifer is limited, due to its low yield and to the poor quality of the water,
which has been contaminated by municipal and industrial pollution. The Puelches aquifer has been so
extensively exploited that during the 1980s, the regional groundwater flow regime was inverted.
Problems of saltwater intrusion along the coastline of the Rio de la Plata and o f contamination of
drinkingwater wells were prevalent at the time. Polluted drinkingwater wells were then shut down and
water was extracted from the Rio de la Plata. This water supply regime ultimately led to the risingo f the
phreatic surface levels inthe region, a factor that i s now exacerbates the flooding potential o f the area.

The use of supplementary irrigation for agricultural purposes in the region has also been an important
cause of over-pumping of the Puelches and Pampeano aquifers. The province of Buenos Aires i s second
inthe country interms of irrigated surface, with approximately 180,000 hectares covered in2000, a figure
that continues to grow at a fast rate.       Aquifers continue to be pumped at excessive rates, further
compromising future supplies o f groundwater.

                       VULNERABILITY OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION
                                         INTHEPAMPAHUMEDA
                               PRELIMINARYTERMS OF REFERENCE


A.        Background
The Pampa Hzimeda covers approximately 45 million hectares (about 18% of the country's total land
area) and i s one of the most important areas of natural resources for temperate agriculture on earth. From
the late 19" century, the expansion of agriculture and its articulation with international trade made it the
engine of Argentina's economic growth. Agriculture' inthe Pampa Hzimeda contributes the major part of
Argentina's agricultural exports and contributes approximately 80% of the country's agricultural output.
Over 90% of Argentina's soybean production, between 80 and 90% of the corn, wheat, sorghum, barley,
and sunflower production of the country take place in this area. The Pampa Hzimeda i s highly fertile and
has access to abundant water resources. Production in the Pampa Hzimeda typically consists o f joint
grain-oilseed-livestock practices, with each activity competing for land, and where their relative
partitioning depend on factors such as prices, weather conditions, etc. Grain and oilseed are in fact both
competitors and compliments to cattle raising, since the rotation of crops and pastures ensures soil
fertility.

Economic reforms enacted in Argentina in the early 1990s created a macro-economic environment more
favorable to agricultural investment, production and exports, and gave rise to sectoral growth of 6% per
p.a. between 1992-2000. The total area of cultivated land increased, accompanied by an increase in the
use of agricultural inputs, machinery, and new varieties of seed, among which were transgenic species.
Farmers throughout the country responded strongly to the new policies, and, agricultural production
systems changed. These changes have defined a new baseline scenario, in which the vulnerability o f the
agricultural sector to climatic changes needs to be re-evaluated. The new practices have drastically
improved agricultural production over the past decade, but their effects on the soils and the subsequent
response of these to climatic variations have not been investigated.

Changes in agricultural practices can be separated into: a) changes in land use; and b) changes in crop
management. In one single year, from 1995/96 to 1996/97, Argentina's total harvested area for major
field crops increased by 16%. Increases in harvested area resulted from the incorporation of new land, the
conversion of pastures to crop production, or the shift in traditional crop-livestock rotation patterns to a
more crop-oriented use.       Soybean production for instance, presents the most dramatic example of
increasingcultivated area, with an average yearly area expansion of 6.8% duringthe 1990s.

Changes in crop management included several factors, most important of which was the increase in the
use of agricultural inputs. The use of fertilizers, for example, increased by a factor o f five from 1991 to
1996, while that of other agrochemicals increased by threefold during the same period. Argentina's corn
and wheat yields increased by approximately 50% and 75% , respectively, between 1991 and 2001,
primarily due to the increased use of fertilizers. Along with chemicals, the use o f machinery, such as
tractors and harvesters, and of irrigation equipment also increased, improving crop yields. Lastly, shifts
in crop management brought about the incorporation of biotech varieties of seed, which have, in some
cases, greatly reduced production costs. Once more, the case of soybean i s illustrative of this trend.
Since the 1990s, a rapid rise in the use of "Roundup Ready" soybean varieties has taken place. It is
estimated that 90% of the soybean crop of 2001 i s planted to biotech varieties, which greatly reduced the
costs of weed control, mature early, and help to reduce weather risks. These characteristics are clearly
attractive to farmers, since they reduce labor and time and they increase cost savings. Inaddition, early
crop maturity, combined with the introductionof no-till cropping, has resulted in more intensive landuse,
as soybeans are double-cropped with wheat. The combination of all these factors resulted in the growth
of soybean production by an estimated yearly average of 8% duringthe 1990s.

Over the long term, the structure of agriculture has shown great flexibility in its capacity to adapt to
technological change and altered relative prices and profitability of different activities. The challenge for

the Argentine agricultural sector as a whole is to maintain production costs low, such as to sustain their
competitive level in international markets. Implementation of practices such as no-till cropping, which
drastically reduce fuel consumption, or the use of biotech seeds, which reduce the cost of weed control,
are likely to spread. At the same time, the sustainable use of natural resources i s of key importance to
economic recovery.

Over a large part of its area, the Pampa Hu'medai s highly deficient in terms o f natural drainage, and the
flooding of land, as a result of heavy rain within the area and high water levels which occur cyclically in
the Paranti river system, has a serious impact on production. Other climatic factors (e.g., the occurrence
of periodic drought, crop-damaginghail and highwinds) are also important. The management of climate-
generated risk is not well developed (for example, through crop insurance) and studies are under way to
understand and quantify the pattern of risks as a first step towards the development o f insurance and other
market-based instruments. In carrying out the study, the consultant would be expected to liaise closely
with the Oficina de Riesgo Agropecuario at SAGPyA2 in order to incorporate the results of the work
being done, particularly that concerning the preparationo f the "agricultural risk maps" (mapasde riesgo).

Agricultural activity itself produces green-house gasses (GHGs) which contribute to climate change,
Thus, agriculture is both highly susceptible to climatic conditions and, at the same time, contributes to the
generation of the factors driving climate change.

B.       Objectives
The purpose of the study i s to analyze the vulnerability of the agricultural sector in the Pampa Hzimedato
climate change, and to quantify the net effect of agricultural activity on the production of GHG.
Accordingly, the objectives of the study are:
    0    To analyze the structure of agricultural production and natural resource use in the Pampa
        Hzimeda
    0    To identify the actual and potential contribution of agricultural activity to factors generating
         climate change
    e    To identify the potential impact of climate change on the present structure of production
    0    To evaluate the potential of agriculture to respondto climate change
    0    To determine the socio-economic impacts of these potential changes in the structure of
         production

C.        Activities
The study would be carried out by building a model of land use for the Pampa Hu'meda, analyzing in
detail the technical structure o f agricultural production and simulating a number of scenarios
correspondingto plausible occurrences of climate change. The following activities will be carried out:

1 The study should be based on a Geographic Information System (GIS) covering the whole of the
     study area, the principle basic information layers of which should be: (a) a topographical map-base at
     a scale of at least 1:100,000; (b) soils data at reconnaissance or semi-detailed soil survey level; (c)
     climatic data; and (d) hydrological data.
2    The GIS would be used to carry out a series of physical simulations, including the definition o f the
     extent of flooding of land as a result (a) of increased rainfall within the study area, and (b) of
     increased flows of the river systems in response to increased rainfall outside the study area, under
     various scenarios.
3    Argentina can be divided into six major ecological zones3, o f which the study area i s one. For the
     study area, the GIS would include as a further information layer the major agro-ecological regions
     and sub-regions based on the classification shown in Table 12-B-3 (or on any other suitable
     classification to be presented in the proposal). Based on this regionalhub-regional classification, a
     detailed description would be made of existing land use, defining the areas under permanent

   Secretaria deAgricultura, Ganaderia, Pesca y Alimentacio'n
   These are: the North-east, the North-west, the Pampa, the West, Patagonia, and the territories of Antarctica.

                                                                                            Annex 12-B-3

  cultivation, permanent pastures, cultivationin rotationwith pastures, forestry and other uses, to arrive
  at a complete inventory of landuse in the study area. The inventory would include estimates of land
  under different forms of permanent agriculture and double cropping, the use o f conventional vs.
  minimudno tillage systems, soil degradation both structural and chemical, etc.
4 Detailed analyses would be made of the farming systems employed and the technical "production
  functions" utilized in each agricultural activity. This should be disaggregated at the level o f the agro-
  ecological region and sub-region to the extent necessary.         The objective would be to define
  input/output matrices for each activity in each region and sub-region that: (a) capture the technical
  elements of production that affect the drivers of climate change (e.g., production and liberation of
  GHGs, carbon sequestration), including fossil fuel and fertilizer use; and (b) describe the degree of
  susceptibility to climate change (e.g., changes in ambient temperature, changes in rainfall regime
  including amount and distribution). The use of different technical "production functions" utilized
  within a given region or sub-region would be analyzed (e.g., the use of conventional cultivation cJ:
  minimumand zero-tillage methods).
5 Farmbudget and enterprise (activity) analysis would be made to estimate production costs, revenues,
  and gross and net margins. The changes in relative product prices and gross margins over the period
  1990-2002 would be compared with the changes in planted areas and yields to derive: (a) data on the
  elasticities of substitution between crop production and livestock, and between individual crops; and
  (b) data on the use of landat the margin.

D.     Expected outputs
1 Determine the actual and potential contribution of agricultural activity to factors generating climate
  change: the present production of GHG would be estimated, and the scope for introducing technical
  changes to the systems of production to reduce their output would be discussed.
2 Evaluate the potential impact of climate change on the present structure of production: the possible
  effects on production of plausible scenarios of climate change would be calculated through the
  model.
3 Evaluate the potential of agriculture to respond to climate change: the macro-level changes (e.g., in
  the distribution of land use between activities and in farming systems) and the micro-level changes
  (e.g., inthe technological production aspects of individual crops and products) should be quantified.
4 Determine the socio-economic impacts of these potential changes inthe structure of production.

       VULNERABILITY OF WATER RESOURCESINTHE LITORAL-MESOPOTAMIA
                               PRELIMINARY TERMS OF REFERENCE

A.      Background

The Litoral-Mesopotamia comprises six provinces in the humidregion of the country, towards the north
eastern part of Argentina. The area is, in hydrographic terms, the richest o f the country, comprising
almost the entire basin o f the Rio Parand and its main effluents Uruguay and Paraguay, including a
portion of the Rio de la Plata basin. Severe precipitation events have traditionally caused flooding in the
area. However, over the past two decades, both the frequency and the intensity of precipitations have
increased, leading to flooding events of major consequences.

Predictions o f the effects of global warming on the Argentine climate vary considerably depending on the
model and on the emissions scenario used to make them. The resulting impact on water resources is
therefore difficult to assess, especially considering the drastically variable climatic and hydrographic
characteristics of the country. Inthe humidregions, precipitation i s typically abundant, and the need for
drainage infrastructure has traditionally been much more pressing than that for supplemental irrigation
duringthe summer. Inthe aridzones, conversely, the presence of irrigation systems is crucial.

It is anticipated that global warming will lead to an increase of atmospheric temperatures of unknown
magnitude. Higher temperatures, in turn, may result in the increase of atmospheric moisture, as the
capacity of the air to take up water increases, which will ultimately result in more frequent precipitation
events. Although not confirmed by all existing predictions of climate change in Argentina, it i s likely that
global warming will cause an increase in rainfall in the humid areas of the country. Desert areas could,
conversely, become drier, an event that inrelative terms would result in less serious conditions.


Statistical analyses have shown that streamflow values in the ParandParaguay basin have increased in
the last third o f the 1900s, relative to values recorded during the first two thirds of the century. Local
precipitation rates have also noticeably increased during the same period. The combined effects of these
two phenomena have led to flooding and inundations o f particular severity. Records show that, in the
case of the Parand river for example, there have been 16 flooding events (inexcess of 30,000 m3/s)from
the years 1904 to 2000. Of those 16 events, seven have occurred in the past 20 years and 3 in the last 10
years. Inthe case of the Uruguay river, 17flooding events (over 24,000 m3/s)have taken place duringthe
period of 1898 to 1998, six of which have occurred in the past 10years. From 1940 to 2000 the Bermejo
river has undergone 20 flooding events, 10inthe last 20 years and four in the past 10years.


The cause of these events i s not known with certainty, although various explanations have been provided.
Climate change has been suggested as a possible reason for the increasing rainfall in the region, although
no concrete evidence has been yet presented that supports that claim. On the other hand, EL NiAo/LaNiAa
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, which have become more frequent and more intense over the last
decade, have also been associated with increasing precipitation and drastic climatic events.             The
relationship between the occurrence of EL Niiio and changes in precipitation patterns and streamflows, in
different regions of South America, has not been entirely formulated. Nonetheless, it has been noted, for
example, that duringthe years o f El NiAo precipitation in the Pampa Hu'meda increases. The same trend
has been observed in years of no NiAo however, and therefore the link i s not direct. Duringthe years of
La Niria onthe contrary, the streamflow of the Bermejo river tends to increase.

                               VULNERABILITY OF THEPATAGONIA
                              PRELIMINARYTERMS OF REFERENCE

A.      Background
The Patagonia covers an extensive area, approximately equal to one third o f the total area of the country,
and encompasses the five southernmost provinces. It i s located inthe aridregion of Argentina, where the
combined effects of climate and poor land management practices have caused extensive desertification.
The impacts of climate change on the region are likely to be severe and include: a) erosion from
increasing rainfall in the lowlands; and b) disruptions to recharge patterns o f regional groundwater
aquifers, caused by effect decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature at the areas' glaciers.

The Patagonia covers an extensive area (in the order of 750,000 km2),approximately one third of the
total area of Argentina, encompassing the provinces o f Nuqukn, Rio Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz and
Tierra del Fuego.      Population density in the region i s low and primarily concentrated in urban
developments. The region i s limited on the west by the Andes and on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and
this topographic variability leads to drastic climatic and ecological contrasts.

The low areas can be described as and or semi-arid, where annual precipitation values range from 100 to
300 mm. Westerly winds of intensities ranging from moderate to strong are present throughout the year.
Soils predominantly consist of loose deposits with scarce vegetation cover. Increasing trends in annual
precipitation duringthe past 100 years have been observed in stations at the Rio Colorado,Neuqukn, and
Paso de Zos Zndios, all located in northern Patagonia, but stations in southern Patagonia show no obvious
change.

Large cattle factories began settling inthe regiontowards the end of the XIX century and have maintained
extensive raising practices, particularly ovine.       This has become the dominant economic activity,
practiced intensively to this date, in an unsustainable manner. Sheep have grazed for years on the natural
pastures, further reducing surface cover and contributing to more pronounced erosion.

The high areas of the Patagonia are located in the Andes, one of the primary locations o f the glaciers of
Latin America. It has been predicted that increasing temperatures in high mountain regions could lead to
the disappearance of significant snow and ice surfaces. In fact, there i s now scientific evidence that
glaciers in Latin America have receded dramatically in the past decades (IPCC, 2001). Although the
reasons for the melting of the glaciers i s still debatable, in 18 glaciers o f the Peruvian Andes, mass
balances since 1968 and satellite images show a reduction of more than 20% o f the glacial surface.
Significant reductions of glaciers have also occurred in southern Chile and Argentina, specifically at the
Sarmiento glacier.

On a smaller scale, snowfall rates may also be affected by changes in atmospheric circulation resulting
from the ENS0 phenomenon, as well as by increasing temperatures.                Snow accumulates at high
elevations and melts duringthe summer, becoming the main source of surface and underground runoff in
the lowlands.

A.      Background
In 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) published a report in which the
sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability of environmental and human systems to climate change,
as well as the potential consequences of climate change were evaluated. Predictions presented in the
report are primarily based on results from General Circulation Models (GCM). GCM have been widely
usedto predict the effect that varying concentrationsof GHG inthe atmosphere would have on the global
climate. Several of these models currently exist, based on different assumptions and representations of
climate systems. Since GCM simulate large-scale climatic features, all these models yield comparable
results, on a global basis (IPCC, 2001). However, results from separate GCM models are considerably
different when they are usedfor predictions of regional climatic patterns.

Since 1987, the Centro del Investigaciones del Mar y la Atmdsfera (CIMA) has been using regional
models to study the response of meteorological systems in South America and in the Antarctic Peninsula
to global climate change. Recentpilot studies have beenconducted to modelthe South American climate,
using a technique developed at CIMA, based on the simultaneous use of a regional model and a global
model of variable resolution. These studies were based on a regional model developedby LAHMKIMA
nested in a global model by LMDZand leadto satisfactory results.

Inorder to improve the quality of the results obtained, a new systemhas been developed, which consists
of the nesting of a new regional model (the most recent version of the Fifth-Generation PennStateNCAR
MesoscaleModel, MM5 version 3.4) in a more recent general circulation model (LMDZversion 3.2). A
zooming feature was applied to the latter model, centred on 30"s-latitude and 6O0W-longitude, which
makes it possible to incorporate greater details over the region. Both models are equipped with greater
horizontal and vertical resolution.

The models that will be used to for the simulations were developed at the Centro de Investigaciones del
Mar y la Atmdsfera (CIMA / CONICET / UBA) and the Centro Nacional Patagdnico (CENPAT /
CONICET). CIMA i s currently running an Atmosphere General Circulation Model (AGCM) coupled to
an ocean model developed at IPSL, France, as well as a regional high-resolution model MM5 developed
at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), USA. CENPAT is running the coupled
AGCM MARK 4 developed at CSIRO, Australia, and the regional high-resolution ETA model from
NCEP, USA.

Additionally, CIMA also has results from simulations from 1860-2000, which were performed using a
coupled ocean-atmospheremodelfrom the IPSL that also incorporates a carbon-model. Simulations were
forced with historic C02concentrationsup to 1995 and a SRES A2 IPCC-scenario from 1996. Two time
periods will be specifically targeted, namely that representative of the actual climate (+/- 10 years around
 1990) and that of a future climate (+/- 10years around 2090). Results from climate simulations usingthe
IPSL model are currently being analysed with positive preliminary results. The model captures, for
example, regional details such as the warming at the western Arctic Peninsula, which other models are
typically not able to capture.

The next stage of research involves the use of a downscaling technique in order to obtain regional results.
This technique implies the preparation of initial forcing conditions for the LMDZand MM5 model based
on information already obtained from long-term simulations using the global IPSL model. It is expected
that results of simulations of regional climate change will be available within the next 10-14 months.

A.       Background
The energy sector i s the largest emitter of GHG in Argentina, in spite o f the country's long trajectory
usingclean energy sources. Significant reductions to the amount of GHG emissions can be achieved by
increasing the efficiency of energy consumption. To that effect, govemment measures to promote the
Rational Use of Energy (URE) were first introduced, by law, during the 1985-89 period. The program
included four objectives, namely: 1) energy conservation; 2) use o f alternative fuels; 3) assessment,
development and use of new energy sources; and 4) development of financial options that would
encourage efficiency.     However, the impact of the initial phase of URE was limited, largely due to
economic turmoil in the Region at the end of the 1980s, and to the short duration of the programs, which
were not sufficiently long to accomplish significant changes in the patterns of energy use.

In 1992, drastic reforms of the energy sector were implemented, primarily focused towards privatization
and the deregulation of energy markets. Energy efficiency measures were not amongst the priorities of
the reforms. A National Office for the Rational Use of Energy was nonetheless part of the organizational
structure of the Secretary of Energy, with functions essentially limited to demonstration projects. Some
of the measures promoted by the URE included: 1) for the industrial sector, significant energy savings
were estimated from: (a) initiatives of co-generation of electricity and heat; and (b) programs for energy-
efficient drying of seeds and crops; 2) for the public and commercial sector, major savings were estimated
from: (a) programs of efficient street lighting; (b) energy saving initiatives in public and commercial
buildings; (c) energy efficient heating systems in public buildings; and (d) co-generation in hospitals,
public buildings, schools, etc; 3) for the residential sector, savings from programs related to: (a) efficient
lighting; (b) efficient appliances (Le. refrigerators); (c) energy-saving heating systems. Inspite of the fact
that these measures presented tremendous saving potentials, they were not supported by policy measures
andconsequently were not effective at promotingenergy savings by either the supply or the demand side.
It is therefore not surprisingthat despite its long history, the impact of UREin terms of energy efficiency
and energy conservation has not been significant.

Estimates of potential energy savings for Argentina reach values greater than 25% of the total national
energy consumption.       It is therefore clear that a NMP for GHG emissions must include mitigation
measures for the energy sector. However, several obstacles are currently in place that difficult the
effectiveness of these measures. Significant barriers to energy efficiency, for instance, are imposed by the
structure of the energy sector itself, and due to: (a) the price of energy - low efficiencies in the
consumption of energy are partly a reaction to its low price. Since the establishment of the reforms tariffs
for residential users are low, a factor that does little to deter energy waste. On the other hand, large
energy users (Le. consumption greater than 2 MW) benefit from low prices by directly obtaining energy
from generators at the MEM; (b) excess generating capacity - generators have been encouraged to
develop thermal facilities in an effort to use more efficient equipment. Given the low price of natural gas,
there i s currently an excess o f generating capacity, which discourages energy savings and further
contributes to the drop in prices; and (c) no incentives to distributors to promote energy conservation
given that they are independent from the generation and the transmission segments and that larger users
deal directly with generators; (d) shared economic responsibilities - in many cases, decisions regarding
the purchase or the installation o f energy efficient systems are not those who benefit from energy savings.
Builders for example, will not pay operating costs from less efficient systems; (e) difficulties inprocuring
 low rates of financing are one of the major difficulties of energy efficient systems; and (f) limited supply
 of energy efficient services - given all of the barriers mentioned, the number of services offered i s very
 limited, reinforcing the difficulties.

Additional obstacles to the development of energy efficient systems in Argentina include: 1) institutional
barriers, which are related to the absence of regulatory and financial frameworks where energy
 conservation can be promoted; 2) economic barriers, related to the difficulties associated with making
                                                        86

                                                                                             Annex 12-C-1
uncertain investments in a volatile economic climate; 3) technological barriers, due to limited access to
modem technologies that allow energy savings; and 4) educational barriers, caused by the lack o f public
awareness concerningthe costs and the benefits of energy efficient systems.

Having reviewed the difficulties that exist to the development o f energy efficient systems and to the
promotion of energy saving programs, the NMP must introduce initiatives that specifically address some
of these barriers. Several of the initiatives that have been used around the world in similar situations
consist o f a) encouraging energy savings by adopting pricing schemes that reward efficiency and by
imposing taxes on energy consumption; b) introducing Energy Services Companies (ESCOs), firms
whose services consist of developing energy efficiency programs for their clients and get compensated as
a function of the actual savings they help achieve; c) raising awareness amongst consumers about the
costs and benefits of saving energy by providing, for instance, labels on appliances that provide
information about energy efficiency; d) establishing minimum standards for efficiency of appliances,
construction codes and materials, buildings, etc; e) encouraging the creation o f agencies, public and
private, that promote the efficient use of energy; f) promoting voluntary participation of the various
sectors inprograms of energy efficiency

The NMP must therefore aim at reducing emissions from the energy system by promoting energy
conservation through programs that promote efficiency andregulation to support those programs.

A.       Background
The contribution of the transportation sector to the GHG emission balance in Argentina i s considerable,
making it an important factor in any emission reduction strategy or climate change mitigation plan. Well-
known measures to reduce transportation emissions essentially address two issues, namely a reduction of
travel demand or an increase in travel efficiency. The latter consists of a variety of measures including
improving infrastructure, introducing more efficient technologies or implementing government
regulations.   The optimal strategy for emissions reduction in a given city will likely encompass a
combination of measures that need to be adapted to the characteristics of the city andits demographics.

Current emission mitigation scenarios for Argentina include proposals for improving or increasing the
transportation infrastructure. It i s typically assumed that by increasing road capacity there i s a relief in
congestion and thus in the level of emissions, given that vehicles that were previously confined to
inefficient stop-an-go patterns can travel at higher, more efficient speeds. Mitigation scenarios for
Argentina include, among others, the following measures: 1) construction of highways and beltways in
larger cities; and 2) construction of suburban highways in Greater Mendoza, Greater Tucumdn, Greater
Bahia Blanca, and Greater Mar del Plata between the years 2010 and 2020. However, traffic studies in
large urban developments have repeatedly shown that independently of the levels of initial road
congestion and those of final road capacity, both emissions and congestion ultimately rise and become
higher than those that existed initially. Travelers will, for example, be willing to travel greater distances
since time of travel remains the same, until congestion levels rise again. Greater capacity generates
greater levels of traffic, which eventually leads to higher levels o f emissions. It i s therefore important that
mitigation scenarios address complimentary alternatives to infrastructure development, which address
changes in mobility patterns of the population.

Mitigation scenarios for Argentina, for instance, may include other types of measures aimed at changing
transportation patterns at reducing the demand for traveling and at increasing travel efficiency, such as the
introduction of zoning regulations. These new zoning laws establish administrative activities inside the
cities while industrialactivities are confined to the periphery, thus reducing traffic flow towards the most
densely populated areas. Other measures that reduce travel demand and increase travel efficiency that
could be implemented are, for instance: (i)   promoting shifts in modes of travel from automobiles to public
transportation; (ii) promoting emission-free modes o f transportation (i.e. bicycles); (iii)     institutingroad
pricing programs, which charge drivers for the use of particularly congested roads duringpeak hours; (iv)
promoting travel blending initiatives, which consist of programs aimed at reducing private car use by
modifying travel behavior; (v) establishing location-efficient mortgages, which present adaptable interest
rates that account for lower transportation costs; (vi) implementing location-dependent development
costs, which are charges imposed on developers to cover municipal costs of water and sewer lines, for
instance; (vii) encouraging substitutions of communications for traveling, by investing in communication
infrastructure or providing incentives to corporations; and (viii) adjusting automobile insurance policies
according to average distances traveled.

A reduction of emissions can also be achieved by improving vehicle efficiency. Technological advances
over the last three decades, for instance, have considerably increased the efficiency of automobiles.
However, consumer preferences are not always in line with environmental concerns, and more
institutionalized measures need to be implemented. In such cases, vehicle efficiency can be either
regulated through government standards, or through incentives related to the vehicle or the fuel.
Examples of measures that can be implemented to increase vehicular efficiency are: (i)             programs that
eliminate old, inefficient and polluting cars; (ii) system of taxes on the sale o f inefficient vehicles; (iii)
programs that charge taxes on vehicle fuels; (iv) fuel conversion programs, a measure that has already

A.       Background
The generation of renewable energy has a large potential in Argentina. Several commercially proven
technologies are available to makeuse of existing resources. The following technologies are particularly
promising:
a) Small scale hydropower - following the same principles as traditional hydro electric facilities, small-
scale hydro is a cost-effective and reliable alternative for electricity supply to local and regional grids.
The environmental and social impacts of a small-scale facility are significantly smaller than those of a
large-scaleproject. Argentina's hydropower resources are extensive, with estimates of installedcapacity
reaching 44,500 MW. However, the vast majority of water-related power projects involve large-scale
hydro power facilities. In 1995, a total capacity of 9,800 MW was installed in large-scalesystems, while
only 40 M W of small-scalecapacity existed.
b) Solar energy -photovoltaic (PV) cells havebeen usedfor years to collect solar energy and convert it to
electricity. Uses for this technology are considerable, ranging form residential kilowatt systems to
megawatt plants. Although the costs of PV technologies have limited the competitiveness of solar power
generation, prices have been steadily decreasing. PV can currently be usedto strengthen local electricity
gnds as part of distributed generation programs. Solar power resources are substantial in Argentina,
particularly north of the Limay-Rio Negro rivers. Large sections of the north west part of the country
receive solar inputs comparableto those in the southwesternU.S., where solar power generatingfacilities
have been developed. Total installed capacity in Argentina 1999 was estimated around 1 MW, where
maximumestimateswere in the order of 190MW.

c) Solar thermal power - this technology i s an alternative to the use of PV, in which instead of directly
converting sunlight into electricity, solar heat is collected and supplied to a thermal engine that produces
electricity.
d) Wind power - wind can be used to generate electricity on an intermittent basis. Wind turbines are
designed to provide energy across variable ranges of wind speeds and to withstand storm conditions.
Typical turbines have outputs of 600 kW. The technology i s mature, widely used, and when situated at
optimal locations, competitive with new coal-fired power stations.

Argentina has tremendous wind energy potential, concentrated primarily south of the Limuy-Rio Negro
rivers. Given the high wind speeds registeredin most of the southernpart of the country, and particularly
in the Patagonia,the potential power generatingcapacity in Argentina is one of the largest in the world.
It has beenestimatedthat the province of Santa Cruz alone could support an installed capacity equivalent
to that of the E.U. and the U.S. combined. In 1999, installed capacity was in the order of 3 MW, with
plannedinvestmentsof 6 MW.

e) Biomass power - agricultural and forest product wastes, as well as dedicated crops and fast growing
trees represent potential sources of renewable energy. Commonly used sources of biomass include,
among others, bagasse and alcohol from sugarcane, poultry litter, straw, and waste wood. Several
technologiesare currently available, includingwood fueled boilers for heat or electricity production, dual-
fuel plants, where biomass is used as a complement to fossil fuels in boilers, gasification processes,
which convert biomass to a fuel gas that can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels, and more complex
liquefaction processes to produce methanol andother liquidfuels.

Argentina already partially exploits its large biomass potential. Approximately 57% of the energy used
by the pulp and paper industry, for example, is derived from biomass.            Notwithstanding, enormous
quantities of forestry, wood-working and other agro-industrial residues, which could be used as
substitutes for fossil fuels, are instead burned in the open air or left to decompose without any energetic
use.

f) Biogas power - decomposing waste (ie. organic matter) generates methane as one of the by-products.
This biogas can be collected, purified, and used as fuel input for power generation in all applications
designed for natural gas. The technology i s proven, readily available, and competitive when located in
adequate sites. Engineered landfills are particularly attractive sites for biogas capture, although alternate
sources are manure and sewage and industrial sludge ponds.

Biogas power generation i s an attractive alternative in Argentina, particularly in the Buenos Aires
metropolitan area, which concentrates the majority of the population and where the largest number of
engineered municipal landfills i s located.

g) Geothermal power - geothermal energy uses heat obtained below the earth's surface to generate
electricity or thermal power through steam turbines. Normally geothermal power i s associated with the
 exploitation of hot water and steam reservoirs. The costs of this technology are linked to the accuracy
 and effectiveness of resource exploration, and research i s being conducted towards the improvement of
 these characteristics. The exploration of geothermal resources has recently begun in Argentina. One
 project exists in the Neuqukn province, generating approximately 760 KW out of a total estimated
 installed capacity of 50 MW.
 h) Wood energy - wood energy is a potential, although possibly not major source of renewable energy.
 Wood harvesting has not typically been an economically feasible alternative. With the present economic
 problems, however, it may have become a more affordable source of energy.

 In spite of the considerable potential for RE generation in Argentina, most of the existingresources, with
 the exception of large-scale hydro-power, are under developed. Several obstacles contribute to their
 limited use, including: (i)mismatch between demand and supply locations - renewable resources are often
 located in distant locations, away from the centers of demand and not connectedto transmission lines (Le.
 Patagonia wind power); (ii)      difficulties related to financing - large-scale investment in renewable
 energies require significant initial capital investments and due to the relative inexperience of the sector
 are considered investment risks. A traditional lack of availability of development capital in this sector has
 limited the number of investors. Small-scale renewable energy systems have been successful at providing
 services to localized users, as demonstrated by PAEPRA and PERMERprojects; (iii)         constrained demand
 -unlessconsumersusemorethan2MwWyearorinstallrenewableenergy systemsfor on-sitegeneration
 they do not have the choice of power suppliers andare therefore not able to opt for renewable sources.

 However, the most significant obstacle to the development o f the renewable energy sector and in the
 future role it may achieve in Argentina involves its relative position with respect to the electricity market.
 Indeed, renewable energy sources are currently at a competitive disadvantage in the liberalized electricity
 market, and incentives must be put in place in order to favor their development.             The first major
 disadvantage of the renewable energy market exists at the transmission level. Power generators are, by
 law, restricted on the share of transmission facilities they may own. Transmission lines in Argentina are
 controlled by one national and six regional high-voltage companies. Generators have guaranteed access
 to the transmission grid, but the electricity i s dispatched by CAMMESA to the grid, and ultimately
 delivered to distribution companies. The limited access to transmission lines in remote areas of the
  country with high renewable energy potential hinders the development o f these alternative sources of
 energy.    A second disadvantage concerns the pricing of electricity.        Prices are determined by the
  interaction of supply and demand, and therefore strong incentives exist to become a low-cost producer.
  The large capital investments required by renewable energy projects increase production costs, therefore
  reducing their competitiveness.      A third, and perhaps the largest disadvantage of renewable power
  systems involves the financing of power projects in a liberalized electricity market. In such a market,
  financing for projects becomes based on anticipated electricity sales, given that long-term power contracts
  become rare and therefore that customers become uncertain. As a result, financing i s tied to more equity,
  less debt, and shorter repayment periods. These conditions favor large, traditional companies and leave
  renewable energy companies at a considerable disadvantage.

This component of the project will be used to evaluate the existing market for renewable energy and the
feasibility o f mechanisms that promote its use in Argentina. Examples o f these mechanisms include: (a)
grant-based, consisting in temporary subsidies to targeted, new technologies at the research, development,
demonstration, or commercialization stage; (b) kilowatt-hour-based, which are also a subsidy that covers
the cost difference between renewable and less costly options; (c) tax-based, which involve tax
deductions and are also beneficial to companies near or at the commercial stage of development; (d)
regulation-based, which include, among others: (i)     requirement of utilities to purchase renewable energy
generation at a fixed price over a long-term period; (ii)    requirement that a certain percentage of annual
electric use in a given jurisdiction comes from renewable energy; and (iii)         regulations that electricity
providers disclose fuel sources. Results from this study will serve as an initial diagnostic of the RE
situation inthe country, which can later be incorporated to the various components of the PERMER.

A. Background

Mitigation measures to reduce atmospheric concentrations of GHG consist of measures that reduce
future emissions, as those describedinthe previous initiatives of the NMP, andthose that increasethe
capture of already existing GHG. Some land-use, land-usechange and forestry activities (LULUCFs)
reduce GHG emissions and qualify for the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) activities under
the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol.

The forestry sectorcan contribute to the reduction of atmospheric COz inthree major ways:

        (a) Maintaining existing sinks of GHG, which can be accomplished by: i)conservation
        measures that protect both young and mature forests (i.e. biomass stocks); and ii)programs
         geared at expanding plantations of fuel-wood , which protect native forests as they provide
         sources of energy;
         (b) Expanding sinks of GHG, done by: i)increasing the productivity of forests through
         technological improvements and forest management programs; ii)promoting afforestation
         programs that establish forest plantations in unutilized or abandoned lands for example; iii)
         restoring degraded forest ecosystems through programs of natural regeneration or
         reforestation; and iv) increasing the carbon storage capacity of soils by increasing agro-
         forestry activities and leaving organic waste behind after harvesting (increases in organic
         matter of forested soils are added to total forest biomass);
         (c) Reducing sources of GHG emissions related to forestry, which involves the promotion of
         programs geared at reducing production of disposable forestry products. These initiatives
         may include,for instance,recyclingprograms for wood products.

Trees sequester carbon as they grow, such that the rate of growth of a tree is a function of the total
amount of carbon absorbed. Therefore, for forests to be effective sinks of carbon, the growth of their
trees must be continuous. Conversely, when forests are cleared, carbon i s releasedby: i)trees that are
cut or burned; andii)forest soils that stored certain amounts of carbon during the lifetime of the trees.

There are two types of forests in Argentina, namely native forests and plantations. Two recent
inventories of forests, commissioned by the Secretaria de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable
(SAyDS) and the Secretaria de Agricultura, Ganaderia, Pesca, y Alimentos (SAGPyA) concluded
that the area of native forests was 40 millionhectares. Approximately 70% of the native forests of the
country are located in the Parque Chaquefio. On the other hand, the area of plantation forest was
estimatedas approximately 780,000 hectares, of which 75% are located inthe provinces of Misiones,
Corrientes, and Entre Rios, 13% are found in the province of Buenos Aires, and the remaining 12%
are distributedamong 10 other provinces. A highproportion of Argentine forests is privately owned,
and no regular monitoring of their managementis conducted.

Most of the forests under private ownership are utilized for logging and livestock grazing, with areas
gradually being converted from forests to pastures. For the most part, logging in these forests takes
place unmonitored. Natural forest managementpractices, which are based on selective logging and
the sustainablemaintenance of the forests, are not common inArgentina.

Projects involving LULUCF afforestation,and reforestation activities qualify for CDM activities and
are therefore an attractive option to consider as part of the NMPfor Argentina. The CDM establishes
that the generationof emission reductions suitable for trade requires the following steps:



                                                  95

                                                                                          Annex 12-C-4

   a) Assessment of a baseline - emission reductions are tradable provided they are in excess of
   those that would take place in the absence of the project. A baseline i s thus defined as those
   emissions that would be generated without the project.
   b) Choice of a model - the potential of a carbon sequestration project must initially be evaluated
   by usinga model that tracks the carbon stored by the forest. Models are used to forecast emission
   reductions and to identify the resulting carbon pools. They must, however, be supplemented by
   actual monitoringsince they are not accepted as a verification of emission reductions.
   c) Monitoring and verification - emission reductions can only be traded after they have been
   accumulated, reviewed by an overseeing panel, and verified by an independent audit. Monitoring
   o f all the pools generated by a project can be extremely costly, and therefore procedures have
   been developed to estimate the total reductions o f a project based on a limited number of key
   carbon pools.
   d) Choice of accounting practice -different methods to account for emission reductions from
   forestry projects exist. When designing a LULUCF project care must be taken in establishing,
   from the start, the method of emission accounting.
   e) Estimates of leakage - emission leakage occurs when the emission reductions obtained by a
   project are later lost due to emissions generated directly or indirectly by the project, for example,
   by promoting the clearance of other forested areas. Leakage i s of particular concern in countries
    where regulations on land use do not exist.

The potential for development of carbon sequestration projects in Argentina i s high. Benefits from
such projects are further increased by the possibility o f entering emission credit markets. The NMP
should therefore promote the implementation of these types of projects and provide guidelines and
methodology for identifying potential sites and formulating the projects.

The Native Forest and Protected Areas (LN3948 AR), in particular, i s conducting the first national
forest inventory, executing applied research and developing the regulatory framework for the
conservation and improvedmanagement of native forests. The Bank i s also working with the GOA in
researching techniques, improving the regulatory framework and strengthening institutions for the
improved management and utilization of planted forests through the Forestry Development Project.

A.       Background
Methane i s produced and emitted as a result of digestive processes that take place in the stomach of
ruminant animals. The amount of methane emitted during enteric fermentation varies according to a
variety of factors, which include, among others, diet, chemicals ingested, grazing methods, and
environmental conditions.
The revision of the 1997 GHGemission inventory, published in 1999,provides the latest figures available
on GHG emissions from the agriculture and livestock sectors. According to the report, the livestock
sector alone i s responsible for approximately 35% o f the total GHG emissions in Argentina, which are
primarily methane but also, include nitrous oxide. More specifically, approximately 68% o f the total
methane emissions in Argentina are released by the agriculture and livestock sector. Cattle release
approximately 92% of the total methane emissions liberated from enteric fermentation.

Current enteric methane figures have been estimated usingemission factors developed abroad, which may
not be representative of local cattle raising practices and conditions. This component of the project
therefore addresses the need to evaluate enteric methane emissions from cattle in Argentina, proposes
initiatives to reduce the amount of emissions.

         country
         If significant differences exist between measured and estimated factors, this study will develop a
         method to adjust emission figures included in GHG inventories
     0   To contribute to the development of programs that reduce methane emissions from enteric
         fermentation

Activities related to the production of energy (including the transportation sector) account for 50% of the
total emissions of the country. The share o f the agriculture and livestock sectors to the total balance of
emissions i s high, contributing to approximately 41% of total GHG emissions.

Emissions from the energy sector
Table A.2 summarizes the relative proportions of GHG emitted by the energy sector. The tow most
significant sources of emissions are combustion of fossil fuels, releasing approximately 89% of the total
COz,and fugitive emissions, releasing practically 95% of the total methane releases of the sector.

Emissions from the Agriculture and livestock sectors
Approximately 68% o f the total methane emissions in Argentina are released by the agriculture and
livestock sectors. Methane i s emitted during animal digestion by the microorganism in the animal's
digestive track. Cattle, for instance, releases approximately 92% o f the methane emissions liberated from
enteric fermentation.

Manure may also release methane if stored and allowed to ferment. Only emissions from cattle and pork

manure are of relevance in Argentina. Agricultural soils may release nitrous oxides through microbial
processes of nitrification and denitrification. Agricultural activities may add nitrogen to the soil
increasing the amount that can be releasedto the atmosphere. Nitrogen addition takes place in various
forms, among which: i)application of fertilizers; ii)cultivation of nitrogen fixing crops; iii)manure
spreading; iv) grazing livestock; and v) runoff waters with high nitrogen content. The contribution of
agricultural soils to the GHG balance of Argentina, and specifically to the release of nitrous oxide is
considerable, amounting to approximately 21% of the total NO2emissions in 1997.
