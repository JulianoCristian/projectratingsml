the Convention on\n            Climate Change Project for Argentina were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: Development of Future Climate\n            Scenarios. In the climate change context, the only\n            methodology accepted by the international community to\n            estimate future climatic conditions is the development of\n            climate scenarios. The methodology most commonly used is the\n            use of global climate model combined with high resolution\n            regional models. Nonetheless, these models have some\n            shortcomings in the simulation of median and extreme\n            precipitation in the Plata river basin. These models do not\n            reproduce adequately the magnitude, the annual cycle and the\n            characteristics of extreme precipitation. The project opted\n            to develop a regional circulation model that reduces the\n            uncertainty found in global climate models when applied at\n            the local scale. The key to develop a high quality SNC\n            rested in obtaining high quality products (i.e. inventory,\n            vulnerability, and mitigation studies). Technical capacity\n            of local consultants in Argentina is high on average;\n            therefore the quality of the products was good.\n            Additionally, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) worked\n            closely with contracted firms as soon as they were selected,\n            providing feedback on their proposals and early drafts\n            ensuring these would meet their objectives using technically\n            sound methods."}, "docdt": "2007-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
