The program is central to the Government's\n            strategy to: 1) reduce poverty and improve the conditions of\n            life in the rural areas; 2) improve agricultural\n            productivity; 3) optimize the use of available resources;\n            and 4) protect the environment by generalizing the delivery\n            of professional agricultural services to all levels of the\n            farming community. The main project components are: 1)\n            strengthening the delivery of the agricultural extension\n            services and providing support for farmers'\n            organizations through the provision of transport, equipment,\n            rehabilitation of facilities and incremental operating\n            costs; 2) improving the technical and management capacity of\n            agricultural staff through training by the provision of\n            equipment, supplies, facilities and transport for regular\n            in-service training of extension staff and the\n            rehabilitation of at least two agricultural training\n            colleges; and 3) support for financial management,\n            accounting and auditing, monitoring and evaluation and\n            regular supervision at all levels of the national\n            agricultural extension system."}, "docdt": "1995-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
