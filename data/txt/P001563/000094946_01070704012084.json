The project registered a series of\n            very positive impacts in localized areas throughout the\n            country but did not have the widespread productivity\n            increases that were envisaged. The lessons drawn from this\n            project include: To foster better use of public resources in\n            extension services, it is crucial that an extension delivery\n            system be demand-driven, responsive to farmer needs,\n            results-oriented, accountable to the end beneficiaries\n            (farmers), and held accountable when staff performance is\n            inadequate. In agricultural services projects, special\n            attention to input supply and the marketing aspects of\n            agricultural produces is of utmost importance to production\n            potential and the conversion of improved production to\n            higher farmer income. Partnership system was successful. It\n            is recommended that land tenure securization be covered\n            through a stand-alone project to magnify the positive\n            impacts of a project. The unguided and non-judicious use of\n            pesticides results in the build-up of pest resistance and\n            provokes environmental degradation. A clear pest management\n            policy must be part of project design. Mitigation plans to\n            national emergencies should be coupled with a sustainable\n            financial mechanism to avoid ad hoc emergency response."}, "docdt": "2001-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
