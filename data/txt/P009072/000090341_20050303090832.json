The lessons learned\n            indicate that the original project concept involved only\n            equipment for Operation and Maintenance (O&M), with\n            rehabilitation of irrigation schemes added later. Because\n            they are being given increased responsibility for managing\n            and funding O&M, Water Users' Organization (WUOs)\n            need effective training in management, finance, water\n            distribution techniques, and rehabilitation priorities, as\n            well as other areas. Functioning within a new paradigm,\n            State Hydraulic Works (DSI) needs to reorient its mission to\n            more explicitly focus on WUO support, and it might require\n            training in the modalities of its relationships with WUOs.\n            The Participatory Privatization of Irrigation Management and\n            Investment Project (PPIMIP) had little or no identification\n            of meaningful monitoring indicators, establishment of\n            initial benchmarks, or systematic data collection. The pilot\n            drip irrigation component was probably overlooked by General\n            Directorate of Rural Services (GDRS) also due to the\n            relatively small amount of funds allocated and due to the\n            prominent role the other implementing agency."}, "docdt": "2005-02-10T00:00:00Z"}
