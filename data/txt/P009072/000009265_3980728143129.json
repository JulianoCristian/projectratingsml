There are three components. The first\n            purchases irrigation operations and maintenance equipment\n            including wireless sets, motorcycles, vehicles, computers,\n            cranes, winches and small backhoes/loaders, trucks, gradalls\n            (truck-mounted machines with telescopic booms and wide\n            buckets), graders, bulldozers, excavators, and draglines.\n            The second component provides for consultants, training and\n            study tours, computers, office and training equipment, and\n            field vehicles. The third component helps a WUO purchase and\n            install a drip irrigation system, which receives water from\n            a small dam through an installed pipeline system, thus\n            eliminating the need to use electricity for pumps to create pressure."}, "docdt": "1997-09-18T00:00:00Z"}
