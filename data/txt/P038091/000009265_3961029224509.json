improvements and\n            protection of past investments in the highway sector through\n            rehabilitation and strengthening of paved highways; 2)\n            improvement of traffic safety in state and provincial roads;\n            3) improvement of the operational efficiency of the General\n            Directorate of Highways (KGM) through the implementation of\n            management systems and computerization; and 4) improvement\n            in the consideration of environmental factors in project\n            selection and design. The components of the project are the\n            following: 1) road improvement program, comprising\n            strengthening or upgrading of about 600 kilometers of high\n            priority state roads, about 300 kilometers of rural\n            (provincial) roads and town passages; 2) road traffic safety\n            program, involving: (a) civil and traffic engineering\n            improvements to accident black spots; (b) a program to\n            improve driver education; (c) provision of equipment to the\n            Turkish traffic police (TTP) and the medical hospital at\n            Gazi University; (d) extension of TTP's accident data\n            base to other users; and (e) provision of road safety\n            materials for traffic management; and 3) institutional\n            development program, consisting in the introduction of\n            various management systems and computerization throughout\n            KGM and training of the staff of KGM in the areas of\n            environmental analysis, road planning, construction and maintenance."}, "docdt": "1996-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
