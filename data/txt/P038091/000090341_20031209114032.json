Road Improvement and\n            Traffic Safety Project for Turkey were as follows: the\n            outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate that in looking back at the experience\n            gathered through this project, there are two major areas\n            where lessons emerge: (i) the successful implementation of a\n            rather complex traffic safety component involving several\n            agencies; and, (ii) the approach taken by the project to\n            influence governance issues in a sector prone to capture by\n            strong vested interests. In particular: The Traffic Safety\n            Experience - the design of this component was, from the\n            outset, the result of a participatory exercise in which each\n            organization involved in the project brought its own\n            perspective to the traffic safety problem and proposed its\n            own solutions. The individualistic approach to the issues at\n            stake slowly evolved into a collegial system structured\n            under the Task Force that was the key player in the\n            implementation of the component. This accomplishment, not a\n            minor feat in a country not known for inter-agency\n            coordination, can be attributed to the adoption of the\n            \"best fit\" rather than \"best practice\"\n            approach. The Governance Issue - the project was prepared at\n            a time in which the structural issues of governance were not\n            as clearly recognized as today, maybe confusing capabilities\n            (or lack thereof) with rent seeking behavior, and proposing\n            institutional development rather than major policy reforms.\n            The Bank's position of not participating in the\n            financing, and therefore not condoning, the practice of\n            continuous changes of design and cost overruns, was a step\n            in the right direction given the relationship with Turkey at\n            the time. A related question from which it might be possible\n            to draw some useful lessons refers to the Bank's\n            decision to deny a Government request to extend the life of\n            the loan. At that time substantial human and financial costs\n            had been sunk in the preparation of a fairly sophisticated\n            Highway Information System."}, "docdt": "2003-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
