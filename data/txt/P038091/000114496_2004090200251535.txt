Dear Sir:
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Road Improvement and Traffic Safety Project) 
dated June 24, 1996 between the Republic of Turkey (the Borrower) and the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), as amended. Pursuant 
to your request dated September 13, 1999 to address the needs of the emergency created 
by the Marmara Earthquake of August 1999, the Bank has agreed to amend the Loan 
Agreement further as follows:
1.
Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement is revised as per attachment to 
this letter.
2.
In Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement:
(a)
the objectives of the Project are amended to read:
“The objectives of the Project are to: (i) reduce road transport costs 
through 
infrastructure improvements and the protection of past investments 
in the highway sector 
through rehabilitation and strengthening of paved 
highways, and the restoration of roads, 
bridges and related road structures 
damaged by the Marmara Earthquake of August 1999; (ii) 
improve traffic safety on 
state and provincial roads; (iii) improve the operational 
efficiency of the 
management of highways through the implementation of management systems 
and enhanced 
computerization; and (iv) improve the assessment of environmental factors in 
project selection and design.”
(b)
a new paragraph is added to Part A of the project, reading:
“(3)
Repair of road surfaces, bridges, over- and underpasses and 
related structures 
in about 50 km of motorways and 400 km of state and provincial 
roads damaged by the Marmara 
Earthquake of August 1999.”
3.
In Section I of Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement, paragraph 1 of Part C is 
amended to read:
“1.
National Competitive Bidding
Works estimated to cost less than $5,000,000 equivalent per contract up 
to an 
aggregate amount of $55,000,000 equivalent may be procured under
