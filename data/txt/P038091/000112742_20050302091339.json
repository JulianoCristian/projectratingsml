The report furthers\n            the knowledge base on road safety programs, as well as\n            governance and institutional issues in the transport sector.\n            It agrees with the completion report in all ratings except\n            that the outcome is judged to be moderately satisfactory\n            instead of satisfactory.  Three important lessons may be\n            drawn from the project: A) Improvements in governance can\n            best be achieved when there is a holistic program of\n            institutional reform mandated at the highest levels of\n            government, with interactive communication with operational\n            staff to ensure that the changes take place in the field as\n            envisioned. B) Traffic safety projects can be particularly\n            successful where there is strong government commitment and\n            support and where a participatory approach is pursued to\n            ensure the support of all the diverse stakeholders.  C) The\n            elimination of road accident black spots can be a highly\n            cost effective way to reduce both the accident rate and the\n            degree of severity of the accidents occurring."}, "docdt": "2005-02-07T00:00:00Z"}
