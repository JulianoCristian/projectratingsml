past\n            Bank policy-based operations in the Philippines and provides\n            support for the Government's economic recovery efforts.\n            The program addresses fundamental problems which have been\n            outstanding and unresolved for many years and which are\n            considered essential for accelerating the recovery of the\n            economy. These include: (i) tax reforms designed to improve\n            the elasticity and efficiency of the tax system and generate\n            higher revenues; (ii) rationalization of trade policies to\n            reduce protection and improve industrial efficiency; (iii)\n            restructuring of the public investment program; and (iv)\n            rationalization of government financial institutions. The\n            first loan ($300 million) would finance essential imports\n            based on a standard negative list, and the second ($10\n            million) would finance technical assistance for\n            institutional strengthening and studies. The main benefits\n            from these loans will derive from the support they give to\n            the development efforts of the Government, both by\n            encouraging policy reforms and providing financial support."}, "docdt": "1987-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
