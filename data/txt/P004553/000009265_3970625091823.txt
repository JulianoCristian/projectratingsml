ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          Republic of the Philippines
Amount:            $300.0 million equivalent - Economic Recovery Loan (ERL)
$10.0 million equivalent - Economic Recovery Technical
Assistance Project (ERTAP)
Terms:             20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Program
Description:     The proposed program complements past Bank policy-based
operations in the Philippines and provides support for the
Government's economic recovery efforts. The program
addresses fundamental problems which have been outstanding
and unresolved for many years and which are considered
essential for accelerating the recovery of the economy.
These include: (i) tax reforms designed to improve the
elasticity and efficiency of the tax system and generate
higher revenues; (ii) rationalization of trade policies to
reduce protection and improve industrial efficiency;
(iii) restructuring of the public investment program to
ensure that planned expenditures are appropriate,
adequately funded, and support the recovery effort; and
(iv) rationalization of government financial institutions
to improve their efficiency, restore financial viability,
and reduce the Government's role in the financial sector.
The main features of the reform are described in the
Government's Letter of Development Policy (Annex V). The
first loan ($300 million) would finance essential imports
based on a standard negative list, and the second
($10 million) would finance technical assistance for
institutional strengthening and studies.
The main benefits from these loans will derive from the
support it will give to the development efforts of the
Government, both by encouraging policy reforms and
providing financial support. The program would also help
create an environment conducive for foreign creditors to
continue their support, as part of the recovery effort of a
highly-indebted country. The risks associated with this
type of program are mainly those related to possible delays
or inadequate implementation. However, the Government's
commitment to carry out needed reforms is very high, and a
significant number of prior actions have already been
taken, particularly in tax and financial sector reform.

Eatimated
Disbursements:   The import component of the program of $300 million
equivalent, would be disbursed in three tranches of $100
million each, over a period of two years. The first
tranche would be avaitable for disbursement after loan
effectiveness. The second and third tranches would be
released after meeting certain conditions and the comple-
tion of a review of the program of policy reforms. The
technical assistance loan of $10 million would be disbursed
within 36 months. Cumulative disbursements against the
program would be as follows:

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON TWO PROPOSED LOANS
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on two proposed
loans for a total of $310 million equivalent to the Republic of the
Philippines in support of an Economic Recovery Program. These loans would
have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Background
2.        In recent years the Philippine economy has been buffeted by events,
both domestic and external, which have led to an abrupt decline in economic
growth and a severe reduction in living standards for the majority of the
population. The restoration of growth and development, and the need to reduce
poverty, are urgent priorities which the Government is attempting to address,
and for which it is seeking assistance from the Bank.
3.        Recent Bank economic reports have detailed the causes of the crisis
and the needs for policy reform (see "Philippines: A Framework for Economic
Recovery "(November 5, 1986) and "Philippines: An Agenda for Adjustment and
Growth" (November 30, 1984)). In brief, these reports indicate that while
growth was rapid during the 1970s, the economy suffered from a number of
distortions in agricultural pricing, exchange rate, credit allocation, and
industrial protection, that resulted in a pattern of growth that could not be
sustained. Thus, by 1980, the gains available from new seed technologies and
expanded irrigation in agriculture were exhausted, as was the scope for
expanded industrial output based on import substitution. In addition, the
external terms of trade began to deteriorate, both because of higher energy
prices, and lower prices for such major Philippine export commodities as
copper and sugar. The growing world recession also limited the growth of
manufactured exports, which in the previous decade had expanded at a rate of
251 per annum. Despite the worsening balance of payments situation, the
exchange rate was allowed to appreciate (1979-83), further reducing the
competitiveness of manufactured exports and limiting their growth.
4.        In response to the worsening economic situation, the Government
embarked on an expanded investment program in order both to reduce energy
dependence and to provide a countercyclical stimulus. As a result, public
investment rose from about 6Z of GNP in 1979 to about 9% by 1982 (see Table
1). The expanded investment program produced some major benefits, increasing
substantially the share of domestic energy in total supply (from 211 to 45%,
1979-85). In other areas, however, the program was not well conceived and
produced projects which either had very low returns or extremely long



-2-
gestation periods. In the private sector as well, many investments were
overpriced, poorly designed, or resulted in excess capacity or firms that
could not compete in world markets. The viability of even sound projects,
furthermore, was undermined by the deterioration in domestic and external
conditions, including such diverse factors as declining copper and sugar
prices, a drop in tourism, and excess capacity in the world shipping
industry. Many of these private sector projects, however, were financed with
loans and guArantees from government financial institutions (CFZs). Project
failure led to growing losses for these institutions, which eventually had to
be covered (1984-86) by subsidies from the national budget.

5.        While public investment expanded during the 1980s, the level of
public savings declined. The public sector savings-investment gap widened from
3% to 6Z of GNP during 1979-82 and was largely financed by foreign bank
credits which were then readily available. The low level of public savings
was directly related to an inefficient and inelastic tax system that did not
respond to the growth in the tax base, and was undercut with exemptions and
exclusions. Thus, the Government had to introduce new taxes and to raise
existing rates frequently in order to maintain existing revenue levels, and
increasingly turned to foreign and domestic borrowing to fill the financing
gap. Paralleling the domestic deficit, the current account deficit of the
balance of payments rose during the same period, from about 4% of CNP to 8Z.



-3-
6.        The increased use of external borrowings to cover the balance of
payments gap resulted in a rise in the overall level of debt outstanding from
$13 billion at the end of 1979 to $24 billion as of the end of 1984, or
roughly 70% of total GNP. The debt service ratio rose to a peak of 372 in
1982, and balance of payments equilibrium continued to be maintained by
increased reLiance on short-term debt and rollovers of existing debt
maturities. By the end of 1983, about 40% of total debt outstanding was
short-term, one of the highest proportions of short-term debt of any of the
heavily indebted countries. The high debt burden, and the heavy reliance on
short-term debt made the country extremely vulnerable to external shocks. The
combination of the growing debt problems in the developing world and the
political uncertainty following the Aquino assassination, resulted in a
cessation of credit lines from commercial banks in 1983, and the need to
declare a debt moratorium and to seek debt relief.
Stabilization and Adjustment, 1983-86
7.        Beginning in 1983, the Government embarked on a major stabilization
effort, designed to reduce the deficit in the budget, lower the balance of
payments gap, and obtain a restructuring of its external debt. In the initial
stages, controls were reintroduced on foreign exchange transactions, imports
were restricted, and tariffs increased. While these measures succeeded in
reducing imports and stabilizing the balance of payments, they also helped
accelerate inflationary pressures, which were being fueled by a rapid increase
in the monetary base. Inflation reached a peak of 50Z during 1984 but had
been brought under control by 1985 as a result of tight monetary and fiscal
policies. Total output, however, declined with GNP growth rates of -7% in
1984 and -4Z in 1985. Public investment was reduced by over 50% (1983-85),
and private investment fell by about 35% (see Table 1).

8.        Nevertheless, the stabilization effort has been successful on other
fronts. Inflation has been reduced to a rate of only 12 in the first half of
1986, and the consolidated public deficit has been reduced from 5.82 of CNP in
1982 to 1.5% in 1985. On the external side, the extent of the adjustment has
been significant. The current account deficit has been reduced from the level
of 8% of GNP in 1983 to a small surplus in 1985. This has been accomplished
at a time when the terms of trade were deteriorating ans sugar, coconut oil
and other basic coomodity prices declined and copper prices remained
depressed. Between 1983 and 1985, export earnings declined from $5.0 billion
to $4.6 billion because of these factors. Imports, however, contracted even
further, declining from $7.5 billion to $5.1 billion (see Table 2). The
contraction in imports largely reflects the fall in demand derived from
declining levels of output and investment in the economy. In 1986, the terms
of trade will benefit from falling petroleum prices (a saving of about
$500 million) but this will be offset by falling export prices, so that the
overall terms of trade is likely to remain unchanged. The balance of payments
is likely to show a small surplus, largely because of the continued rapid
growth of workers' remittances. The effects of debt rescheduling and new
inflows from private and official sources plus declining interest rates have
further eased the balance of payments financing situation in 1985 and 1986.
The exchange rate continuelsto operate under a flexible system reflecting
demand and supply factors._   Weak demand for foreign exchange has enabled the
Central Bank to purchase foreign exchange and accumulate reserves, so that
foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank have risen from $1.1 billion at
the end of 1985 to about $2.5 billion by end 1986 (equivalent to about
3.7 months of imports of goods and services).
9.        Public Finance.  The most immediate problem facing the Government at
present is the management of public expenditures. As mentioned earlier,
because of the structure of the tax system, poor tax administration, and
growth in public expenditures, the budget deficit tended to grow in the early
1980s. From a level of about 2.3% of CNP during the late 1970s, the overall
public sector deficit increased to a peak of 5.8% in 1982. Since 1983, the
Government has been faced with the need to reduce the budget deficit in order
to maintain price stability, while the economic recession has both reduced the
tax base and made it difficult to enact new tax measures. Moreover,
expenditures have been squeezed by the need to provide for a growing subsidy
to the government financial institutions. Net lending to the GFIs has grown
from almost nothing in 1983 to P 11 billion in 1985 and is estimated to climb
to P 21 billion in 1986 (see Table 3). In addition, equity required by
nonfinAncial corporations is expected to total P 10 billion in 1986, for a
total equity and net lending of P 30 billion. In contrast, the capital
expenditures allowed for 1986 in the national government budget total only
about P 15 billion. Between 1983 and 1985, the squeeze on the budget brought
about by stagnant revenues and rising CFI and other expenditures resulted in
direct cuts in investment and maintenance/operating funds. In many cases,
1/   During 1986, the rate varied from 19.0 to 20.8 (Peso($, monthly
averages). For December 1986, the rate averaged 20.5.



even budgetted amounts could not be provided for, due to revisions in revenues
and expenditures--particularly subsidies. By 1985, investment expenditures in
the budget had been reduced to half of its 1983 level in real terms, and
maintenance and operating expenditures to about two third.. For 1986,
substantial increases are planned in these categories to restore expenditures
to more appropriate levels; at the same time greater revenues, are expected
from a reform of the tax system. Neverthelese, resources vill continue to be
tightly constrained by the large amounts required to cover the GFI deficits.
Thus, a whole range of issues arises, both of a short-term and long-tern
nature, which require an urgent solution. These relate to tax and tax
administration reform, discipline over expenditures, and reorganization of the
GFIs in order to control future erosion of public resources.

10.       Poverty and Unemployment.  The decline in real incomes that accom-
panied the stabilization program has exacerbated the problems of poverty and
unemployment that have been endemic in the past. Despite rapid growth in the
past, the incidence of poverty has remained high, per capita consumption has
declined, income distribution has continued to be skewed, and regional
disparities have remained pronounced. The national incidence of poverty in
1985 is estimated to be about 60% and higher in the least developed regions.
Declining sugar prices and production have had a particularly adverse effect
in sugar producing areas such as Negros, which has led to high levels of
unemployment and malnutrition.  The slow growth of employment opportunities in
manufacturing, rising land/man ratios in the rural areast and relatively rapid
population growth have all contributed to a declining trend for real wages.
This trend has been further exacerbated during the recent stabilization
period, which has seen per capita income decline by about 15% since 1982.



Unamployment increased during the same period, and is now estimated to be 25X
in metro Manila, compared to 122 in 1983 (see Table 4). The population growth
rate, which was until recently estimated to be about 2.52, is likely to be
much higher, probably on the order of 2.7-2.92. As a result of these factors,
the restoration of growth is an urgent priority, as is the necessity to place
new emphasis on programs that provide basic services, particularly in the
rural areas.

Structural Reform, 1980-85
11.       Despite the increasingly adverse economic situation during the first
part of this decade, the Government has been able to undertake important
structural reforms in a number of areas. These actions include a major reform
of the financial sector (1981-83), liberalizing interest rates on loans to the
industrial sector, deregulating interest rates on deposits, giving the banking
system greater flexibility to undertake long-term lending, and limiting the
Central Bank to a "lender of last resort" role. In 1985, the reforms were
extended to lending in the agricultural sector as well. A major reform of the
tariff system was undertaken during the 1981-85 period, which reduced nominal
tariffs from a maximum of 100Z to 50Z and lowered effective protection rates
from an average of 43% to 25%. In addition, a significant number of regulated
imports were liberalized. Since 1984, emergency import and foreign exchange
controls have been abandoned, and commercial banks have been free to trade in
foreign exchange, creating a floating exchange rate.
12.       In agriculture, significant reforms were implemented over the past
two years which improved the incentive system and considerably reduced the
anti-agriculture bias. With the exception of the protective system which
still favors mAnufacturing production, other price distortions in agriculture
have been largely eliminated. The institutional and policy reforms include



-7-
the liberalization of producer prices of pork, eggs and poultry; removal of
the price ceiling on milled rice; liberalization of trade in animal feeds,
fertilizer and wheat; and phasing out of credit subsidies. In addition,
monopolies in sugar and coconut trading have been dismantled and subsector
institutional arrangements are being rationalized. The Government has
recently accelerated reforms in the sector and abolished most export taxes,
abolished the ban on copra exports, eliminated the special levy on fertilizer,
reduced taxes on pesticides, and liberalized coconut oil exports.
13.       In general, the impact of recent reforms has been to remove many of
the distortions in output and factor prices that influenced growth and invest-
ment decisions adversely during the 1970s. The potential impact of these re-
forms, however, has been reduced by the general economic recession which has
had an overriding influence on output and investment decisions. Once the re-
covery is under way, it is likely that the pattern of growth will be influenc-
ed by these reforms and will be less capital- and import-intensive than was
the case during the 1970s, with less discrimination against agriculture as
well.
14.       Despite past progress in many areas, a number of complex issues have
been left unresolved. The nature, extent and quality of any economic recovery
will depend on the level of success in dealing with these outstanding problems.
The next section details the general nature of the recovery program of the
Government, and its plan for dealing with some of these issues.
PART II - THE PROGRAM FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY
The Future Policy Agenda
15.       Since February 1986 there has been a change in Government, and the
new administration has placed a high priority on economic recovery. The
overall approach of the Government, as contained in the recently approved
Medium-Term Development Plan, emphasizes certain key economic principles.
These include: (a) greater attention to poverty alleviation and social
justice; (b) acceleration of growth and increased economic efficiency; and
(c) reduced government involvement in the economy and an emphasis on private
initiative. The role of the Government is clearly seen as intervening in the
economy only it those areas where the private sector cannot meet social needs,
and where there is comparative advantage for public action. Heavy emphasis
will be placel on-programs to reduce poverty, raise employment, particularly
in rural areas, and to accelerate agricultural production and exports.  The
Government is committed to reducing special privileges, tax exemptions, and
subsidies.-Zor sperial interest groups.
16.       The Government's recovery plan focuses on the major outstanding
structural problems that have been left untouched by recent action, or left
uncompleted. The Government's amproach in these high-priority areas is
susmarized below.
17.       Macroeconomic Policies.  The overall goal of the Government is to
restore growth, while keeping inflation under control. Implementation of the



-8-
stabilization program of the earlier regime continues; fiscal deficits
created during the February 1986 elections were promptly offset by tightening
monetary policy. The need to provide a competitive exchange rate in order to
promote both industrial and agricultural exports is recognized, as is the need
to maintain low but positive real interest rates. A recently agreed IMF
program will help ensure a monetary and fiscal policy that will help promote
recovery without rekindling inflation.
18.       Agriculture.  The Government plans to address majir problems stilL
outstanding in the sector, focussing largely on institutional improvements
which can improve access to required inputs and technical advice. This
includes improvements in the system of research and extension, reform of the
rural credit system, rehabilitation of the irrigation network, and improve-
ments in fertilizer distribution. It also plans to increase expenditures on
rural infrastructure, and to improve mechanisms for planning and coordination
in the sector. Further steps will be taken to improve the marketing and
distribution system for agricultural products, reducing the level of direct
government involvement. The Government recognizes the urgent need to reverse
the deterioration of the natural environment brought about by destructive
agricultural practices. Major efforts will be made to accelerate the current
land reform program, and to extend it to other areas, particularly unutilized
sugarland.
19.       Industry.  The Government is committed to extending the program of
trade 1iberalization, as recent measures have demonstrated. The aim is to
reduce further effective protection of industry, and encourage an efficient
industrial recovery. Attention will also be given in the future to the
problem of financial restructuring and rehabilitation of existing industrial
investments, and to providing an incentive framework that encourages labor-
intensive and export-oriented industrial development.
20.       Financial Sector.  Reform of the financial sector is a high priority
in the Government s agenda, in order to provide adequate financial resources
for the recovery of both the industrial and agricultural sectors. Rationali-
zation of the government institutions is also critical, because of their
importance in the recovery process and because of the serious budgetary burden
they represent. New managements have been put in place, and further reforms
are being addressed by these two operations.
21.       Public Sector.  While the Government' s overall goal is to reduce the
size and scope of public sector involvement in the3 economy, it recognizes that
the legitimate requirements of government expenditures must be met from an
equitable and efficient tax system. The Government is committed to a general
improvement in both the structure and enforcement of the tax system in the
future. On the expenditure side, it recognizes the need to undertake a modest
increase in investment and maintenance expenditures in order to meet past
deficiencies, while avoiding the excessive expenditure levels of the past. It
plans a major reform of the public corporate sector, reducing the number of
existing public corporations through privatization or merger, and reforming
the remainder so as to make them independent of budgetary financial support.
The Bank has provided support in the form of studies and advice for this
restructuring. A major reorganization of the government is planned which is



-9-
expected to reduce the number of ministries and improve overall operating
efficiency.
22.       Poverty and Employment.  A major goal of the Government is to
restore growth of incomes, increase employment and reduce poverty. Emphasis
is being given to expanding rural infrastructure, the use of more labor-
intensive methods in its construction, and improved access to basic health,
education and other social services.
23.       As part of this broad reform program, the Government has identified
four high priority areas for immediate attention:
(a) reform of the tar system;
(b) continuation of the program of trade liberalization;
(c) restructuring of the public investment program; and
(d) reform of government financial institutions.
These four components will be supported by these two operations, and are
examined in more detail below.
Recovery Scenarios and Aid Requirements
24.       The challenge for the Philippines is how to restore the growth
momentum of the economy, deal adequately with problems of poverty and
unemployment, and maintain price stability while being faced with tightly
constrained resource availabilities, both external and internal. Thus, in
addition to the program of structural reforms, a crucial component of a
sustainable medium-term recovery will be the external financing strategy for
the next decade, including the maagement of the external debt. During the
past three years, both savings and investment rates have fallen. A rapid
increase in domestic savings will be possible only if total incomes are
rising, since it will not be possible to raise savings rates while further
suppressing per capita consumption levels.
25.       The key to future growth will be to achieve the right balance of
savings, investment, borrowing and consumption that will permit both the
higher investment rate necessary to accelerate the rate of growth, and also
provide for sufficient growth in consumption so as to allow some increase in
per capita living levels. Because of the already high debt overhang, the
financing of a large portion of the investment program through foreign savings
is neither practical nor possible. However, it is also doubtful that the
Philippines could sustain long-term current account surpluses (be a capital
exporter) and still have substantial growth during the next decade. Total
debt outstanding is likely to increase somewhat, reflecting a small and
controlled deficit in the current account. The most practical way for the
Philippines to reduce its relative debt burden is to ensure that the growth of
GNP and exports remains higher than the growth of its debt.

26.       Recovery Scenarios.  A medium-term projection that illustrates a
likely recovery path and the corresponding financing requirements is shown in
TabLe 5. This projection reflects a relatively favorable world economy in the
next five years 2?s a result of the recent decline in oil prices and real
interest rates.2   Industrial countries' GDP is projected to grow around 3.5%
per year (1986-90), international inflation is assumed to remain low and real
interest rates to stay at current levels. Petroleum prices are projected to
stabilize at about $18 per barrel through 1990 and rise to $25 per barrel by
1995, in nominal terms. Even so, the real price in 1995 would be below the
1985 level. Overall manufactured exports are projected to grow at around 7.5Z
during the period 1985-95. This assumes the maintenance of relatively open
markets in the developed countries, with no significant increase in nontariff
barriers over present levels.

27.       Given this external environment, it is possible to foresee a
recovery along the lines laid out in Table 5. The overall growth of GDP in
this scenario would rise gradually in the longer term to an average rate of
2/   These assumptions are between the high and low cases of the 1986 World
Development Report.



- 11 -
5.5%, which is close to the historical average of the period 1975-82, when the
growth rate averaged 5.4%. A growth rate of 5.5% would require a combination
of a 3% growth rate in agriculture and a 81 growth rate in industry. Export
growth would average about 6% in volume terms in the long run, including a
7.5% growth for manufactured exports. This outcome depends on the attainment
of both a favorable external environment, as well as progress in addressing
the key policy issues outlined above. In the industrial sector, these
projections assume that existing excess capacity can be brought back, at least
partially, into production through financial and physical restructuring, thus
lowering the incremental capital cost of growth in the near term. These pro-
jections also assume that public capital investment provides needed infra-
structure support for the private sector and remains in the range of 5-6Z of
GNIP.
28.       Although the need for reforms is undoubted, it is difficult to
quantify how policy reforms will affect future growth performance. Thus, the
projections in Table 5 are conservative in certain key aspects, particularly
those concerning the marginal productivity of capital and the required import
level. The projected incremental capital-output ratio is only slightly lower
than the 1975-82 period (4.6 vs. 5.5), and the marginal savings rate is
slightly higher. However, the import elasticity is somewhat higher (1.2 vs.
1.1). The higher import elasticity reflects an assumed rapid growth in
imports in the early recovery years, restoring imports to past levels and
providing resources for a growth of investment. A lower growth of imports
,would require a higher marginal savings rate and would lead to a lower growth
in consumption, a scenario which cannot be excluded but is not most likely.
29.       Financing Requirements.  The projections indicate a sustainable
current account deficit during the period of about 2.0-2.5% of GNP (1987-96).
Nevertheless, because of the significant overhang of debt and debt service, a
relatively large amount of financing or refinancing is required merely to
maintain a modest net capital inflow into the country. In nominal terms, the
cumulative current deficit for the 1987-91 period (see Table 6) amounts to
$4.3 billion. However, scheduled amortization payments amount to $11.4 bil-
lion. After allowance is made for reserve increases, reductions in short-term
debt, and disbursements from the official pipeline, a financing gap of
$17.4 billion remains for the period. Of this amount, new official
disbursements could be expected to provide about $4.1 billion, and about
$2.0 billion could come from other capital flows including direct foreign
investment and official grants. The balance of $11.3 billion would have to be
provided in the form of debt relief and/or new money.

30.       In terms of the debt situation, a financing scenario as envisioned
here would mean that the total debt outstanding would continue to grow, from
about $29 billion at the end of 1986 to about $32 billion by the end of
1991. The growth of debt and debt service is slower, however, than the growth
of GNP and exports, so that the economy tends to "grow out" from under its
debt burden. The debt service ratio (without rescheduling) would decline from



- 13 -
44% in 1986 to 39% by 1991 and 35Z by .1996.31 The ratio of debt to CUP would
decline from 91X in 1986 to 77% by 1991 and 64% by 1996. Over time, the
projection assumes that the structure of debt would change within these
overall totals. Medium- and long-term debt from both official and private
sources would increase (see Table 7), but the share of each in total debt
would remain the same (30Z official, 70% private). However, the reliance on
short-term debt would be reduced; the share of short-term debt would fall from
32% in 1985 to 7Z in 1996. In general, the scenario laid out here shows that
fairly substantial GNP growth is not only compatible with an improvement in
the structure of the debt but also that it is necessary for a reduction in its
relative burden.

Economic Recovery Loan-Program of Action
31.       During 1986, the Bank continued its discussions of the problem of
economic recovtry with the Government.  An economic mission visited Manila in
April, 1986, to assess the state of the economy and the critical issues in
future development. Its report ("A Framework for Economic Recovery,' Report
No. 6350-PR) was discussed with the Government in October and was the basic
background document for the meeting of the Philippine Consultative Group in
January, 1987. An appraisal mission for the Economic Recovery Program (ERP)
discussed specific actions when it visited Manila in July/August, when parti-
cular emphasis was placed on the issues of tax reform, trade liberalization,
public investment and GFI reform.
32.       The Government has worked out a specific program of actions in each
of these four critical areas, and this has been summarized in the Letter of
Development Policy (Annex V). It covers both steps recently undertaken and
steps to be taken during the next two years. In the following sections, we
summarize the nature of outstanding issues in each sector, and the Government's
program of action designed to address them. This program will be directly
supported by the proposed Economic Recovery Loan (ERL), with associated
technical assistance needs being financed under the proposed Economic Recovery
Technical Assistance Project.
Tax Reform
33.       The overall tax effort in the Phili2pines is low by comparison with
other middle-income, oil-importing countries.47 The problem stems not so much
from the level of rates, but from the low level of enforcement and the number
Of exclusions and exemptions that reduce effective revenue collection. Despite
progressive nominal rates, the elasticity of the present system is also low
(0.5), requiring annual adjustments in tax rates in order to provide
additional revenue. Even more disturbing is that despite these annual tax
adjustments, overall tax buoyancy (with respect to CNP) has fallen from 1.0
(1978-80) to 0.8 (1980-85). With domestic-based taxes performing poorly,
heavy reliance has been placed on taxes on international trade. In addition,
the system has had a distortive effect on resource allocation and created
inequities between taxpayers, particularly because of lax collection
procedures.
34.       The worst-performing tax is the income tax.  At present, revenues
from income taxes amount to only about 2Z of GCP, compared to 5-6% in most
other countries of similar income levels. Even as recently as 1980, the
income tax accounted for revenues equal to 3.3% of GNP. The main change that.
has taken place since 1980 has been the shift from global income taxation to a-
schedular form, which taxes income from compensation, dividends, interest, and
business sources according to separate schedules. Persons with mixed incomes
have been able to diversify their income across various schedules, paying
lower marginal taxes on each.
4/ Tax revenue as a share of GNP was 102 in 1983, compared with 19% average
for all middle-income oil importing countries (Source: WDR, 1986).

35.       Although some changes of the sales tax system have recently been
carried out which reduce the number of rates, more needs to be done to move
toward a single rate value added tax. The elasticity of the present sales tax
is about 0.4; 8 shift to VAT would increase this elasticity and improve
resource allocation. While somewhat difficult to administer, VAT taxes have
successfully been introduced in other developing countries, notably Indonesia,
Korea and Turkey. The introduction of a VAT could proceed by stages, starting
with manufacturing, and eventually reaching the service and trade sectors
which are now untaxed or lightly taxed. Present sales tax revenues amount to
only 1% of GCP; a more comprehensive VAT could increase these revenues to 2-3%
of GNP. Movement toward a single-rate VAT could be supplemented by higher ad
valorem excise taxes on specific commodities such as beer, cigarettes, liquor
and petroleum products.
36.       The Government has adopted a major Tax Reform Program in July 1986
that addresses many of these fundamental problems. The major elements to
improve the revenue elasticity of the system include a partial shift back to
global taxation of income, a shift to a fully ad valorem basis and increase in
rates for excise taxation of cigarettes and liquor, and abolition of most
exemptions from direct and indirect income tax. At present, interest income
has been excluded from the globalized income tax on the grounds that raising
rates from the present 20% to a possible marginal rate of 35% might induce
capital flight abroad to avoid taxation.
37.       In order to improve resource allocation the package includes
measures to rationalize trade taxes and marginal income tax brackets. The
highest marginal rate for income taxes has been unified at a substantially
lower level of 35Z (compared with the previous 60%). The reform of import
taxes include establishment of a minimum 10% duty on presently zero-rated
imports, selective lowering of certain high rates, and a shift to a CIF basis
of import taxation. With respect to export taxes, the Government has
abolished export duties that have penalized exporters in present comodity
market conditions. Only the export duty on logs has been retained for
conservation purposes.
38.       To enhance the redistributive impact of the tax system, measures
have been introduced to increase personal exemptions under income tax so as to
exclude all households below the poverty line. In addition, the Government
will reassess taxable values of properties, to provide for a more equitable
distribution of the tax burden. Steps are being taken to improve tax admin-
istration and enforcement, through the granting of one-time tax amnesties, the
limitation of business deductions, and providing improved incentives to
increase collections.
39.       Under the ERL, the Government has made a general commitment to raise
tax revenues from a level of 10X of GNP in 1986, to 11% in 1987, and 12% in
1988. If necessary, it will introduce new tax measures, including higher
excise taxes, to meet these goals. It will also introduce a value-added tax
by October 1988 to replace the complex and poorly performing sales tax.



- 16 -
Technical assistance is being made available from by IMF to help implement
this program, which could be in place by the end of 1987. In addition, the
Government plans to eliminate the double taxation of dividends by 1988, and to
initiate studies relating to:
(a) inflation adjustment and other aspects of capital gains taxation;
(b) inflation adjustment for depreciation;
(c) movement of pronerty taxation from an "actual use" to a "potential
use' basis;
(d) further rationalization of BOI incentives; and
(e) inclusion of interest income within the globalized income tax.
Trade Reforms
40.       In the past, a highly protected industrial structure provided incen-
tives toward capital-intensive, import-substituting activities that were inef-
ficient and biased against export development. A tariff reform program insti-
tuted in 1980 (and supported by SAL-I and SAL-II) has substantially reduced
effective protection in many industries. This included a reduction in overall
tariff levels which lowered effective protection, and the liberalization of
approximately 900 previously banned consumer items. The Government remains
committed to a gradual liberalization of the import regime, and a gradual
lowering of tariff protection. Because of the economic crisis, the liberal-
ization of restricted imports requiring prior approval was not undertaken as
scheduled. These restrictions amount to outright bans on certain consumer
goods, and a requirement for "prior approvals" from government agencies for
the importation of certain commodities, most of which are produced in the
Philippines. These "prior approvals" essentially represent, in most cases, an
import ban to protect domestic manufacturers, and as such represent a degree
of protection that was much greater than that nominally accorded through the
tariff system. In fact, the list of restricted goods tended to expand as the
Government sought to limit imports during the balance of payments crisis and
by the end of 1985 covered about 25% of total imports.
41.       The Government remains committed to a gradual liberalization of the
import regime, and a gradual lowering of tariff protection. Despite the
economic recession, emergency foreign exchange controls and the import tariff
surcharge imposed during the early days of the economic crisis have been
removed. In addition, significant progress has been made in the past year in
the removal of many of the existing quantitative restrictions on imports.
42.       A new program for the further liberalization of restricted items was
agreed with the Government in 1985, to be enacted during 1986-87- This new
progranu called for a phased program of reduction of controls on 1,232 items,
representing raw materiais, intermediate and capital goods, and consumer goods
(see Table 8). The commodities in this program cover about 14% of total
imports and include such important goods as iron and steel products, yarns and
threads, basic chemicals, textiles, and tires. The original schedule called



- 17 -
for the liberalization of 1153 items on December 31, 1986, and 79 items by
June 30, 1987. By end of December 1986 the Government had liberalized 936
items, about 75Z of the agreed program. In addition, in July 1986, the
Government removed all Central Bank prior-approval procedures covering the
import of capital goods.

43.       During the past year there has been considerable public debate in
the country over the merits of further trade liberalization. With the
continuation of depressed economic conditions and high unemployment, there is
strong opposition to measures which would cause additional unemployment, even
if the longer-term effects were positive. Many firms argue that they could be
competitive with imports if they could operate at full capacity, which can
occur only if the economy revives. The original schedule of liberalization,
in fact, was agreed to under the assumption that strong recovery would take
place in 1986. While the Government has indicated that it remains comitted
to the overall need to liberalize imports, it has requested a full review of
the present program and the establishment of a new timetable of action in
order to allow industries additional time to adjust and to work out
appropriate tariff adjustments. In the Government's view, the announcement of
a firm agenda for liberalization is as effective in promoting the adjustment
process as the actual liberalization of the imports, provided it is not
extended over too long a period of time.



- 18 -
44.       For those 292 items remaining in the original program, a new
schedule has been approved in December, 1986 which will complete liberaliza-
tion on or before April, 1988. The new schedule will be completed in four
stages: June 1987 (12 items); October 1987 (72); December 1987 (76); and
April 1988 (132). While tariff adjustments may be enacted in some cases on
liberalized items, in no case would a tariff adjustment be permitted that
would place the total tariff on any commodity above a maximus of 502.
45.       After the completion of the present program about 500 items will
remain regulated, covering approximately 11% of total imports. About one-
third of these are items that are regulated for legitimate health, safety and
national defense purposes. Others provide protection for the "progressive"
manufacturing program for automobiles, trucks, motorcycles and consumer
electronic goods. The remainder represent consumer goods and other interme-
diate products that were excluded from previous programs of liberalization.
The Government has agreed to undertake a review of all of these items and
develop a new program of liberalization by end-December 1987 or prior to the
release of the second tranche of the ERL.
46.       The Government will also undertake a further review of the entire
tariff structure, with the objective of reducing further the highest tariff
rates and to achieve a more even structure of effective protection. It will
also undertake studies of the tariff system and complete these studies by
August 1987. After an appropriate round of hearings, a new tariff schedule
will be announced before the end of 1988, and prior to the release of the
third tranche of the ER.
Public Investment and Expenditure Issues
47.       As a result of budget stringencies (1984-85), there have been
sizeable reductions in the level of real public expenditures. The expansion
of the investment program was clearly excessive during the early 1980s, but
the retrenchment during the stabilization period cannot be maintained for long
without damaging recovery prospects. The public investment program was cut by
almost 50% in real terms between 1983 and 1985 or from 7.4Z of CNP to about
3.52.  Reductions were particularly severe in such areas as transport/communi-
cations (-80%), industry (-83%) and energy (-54%) (See Table 9). Ongoing
foreign-assisted projects have been delayed because of the lack of adequate
counterpart funds, resulting in delayed disbursements and returns from these
investments.
48.       Although expenditures for social sectors as a share of GNP were
maintained on an obligation basis throughout the stabilization period, actual
spending for education and health were substantially below what was allocated
in the budget. While the Government decided to allocate more resources to
primary health care and basic education, the effectiveness of various special
poverty-oriented programs was in many instances impaired by overall resource
constraints. Moreover, the already scarce resources of the social sectors
were increasingly taxed by the continued rapid population growth.
49.       The budget stringencies also resulted in large cuts in operating and
maintenance expenditures (O&M). Thus the National Covernment's O&N expendi-



- 19 -
tures in 1985 were about 402 lower in real terms compared with 1983 and over
60% compared with 1977. These cutbacks have had serious implications for the
maintenance of the existing capital stock and provision of basic government
services such as agriculture extension, education and health. Likewise, the
constraints imposed on the public corporations have limited their operations
and efficiency; particularly costly in this regard has been the declining
level of maintenance undertaken by the National Irrigation Authority.
50.       To provide for adequate structural support of private sector
development in the medium term, a public investment program of about 5-6% of
GNP appears to be appropriate. This would restore the investment Level to
that of the 1976-77 period (5.4% of CNP), and is relatively modest in
comparison with other middle income countries. Capital formation of about 2-
3% of GNP will be required merely to allow for depreciation of the existing
public capital stock.

51.       The Government has issued a revised Medium-Term Public Investment
Plan for the period 1987-92, which calls for a total investment during this
period of P 331 billion in current prices (or about $12 billion in 1986



- 20 -
prices). This program was discussed with the Bank at a draft stage during the
appraisal mission, and the final version was reviewed during negotiations.
The overall level of this program implies a public investment rate during the
period of about 5.32 of CNP, which is within the suggested range. In
addition, the content of the program appears to represent a reasonable and
prudent attempt to deal with outstanding needs.

52.       Overall, the revised public sector investment plan reflects the cur-
rent shift in government development emphasis (Table 10). The share of public
investment in agriculture and rural development activities will increase and
will include additional investments to rehabilitate the irrigation system and
provide smalt-scale irrigation schemes in poverty areas. Transport and com-
munication remains a large share of the program (29%) but will have a greater
emphasis on feeder and secondary roads. Extension of the rural road system is
a high-priority activity that will directly benefit many rural poor. In
addition, the Government has launched a community-based rural employment
program to use local labor to build rural roads, social infrastructure, and
comnunity facilities. The implementation of this program was discussed during
negotiations, and the Government confirmed that adequate measures would be
taken to insure careful monitoring of this program.
53.       The allocations for industry will fall, and little tdirect investment
in industrial activities will be undertaken. Investment izl industry will
reflect a modest expansion of export processing zones, which will assist the
export expansion effort, and equity participation in joint ventures with the
private sector. While the share for energy and power will decline, a substan-
tial amount of investment in the power sector will be required to offset the
decision not to operate the Bataan nuclear power plant. The Government will
use a least-cost approach in power planning to maintain the best mix between
geothermal, hydro-electric, and coal-fired alternatives in its power develop-



-                ~~~~~- 21 -
ment program.  The power seator program also includes an expanded allocation
for rural electrification, which is conditional on a successful resolution of
the outsta-nding problems of the rural electric cooperatives.  Likewise, in the
water supply sector, there are substantial increases planned for the Local
Water Ultilcies Administration and the Rural Water Development Corporation.
The Grver.ent has agreed, however, that institutional and financial problems of
both organizatons will be resolved before these investments are undertaken.
In the, area of telecommunications, the limited access to telephone services
nationwide justifies the Government's major program to expand the network,
which is being undertaken at a lower rate than previously planned, and will be
kept in Line with implementation capabilities.
54.       With respect to social expenditures, the Government has made a sub-
stantial commitment to restructure the primary and secondary education system.
In the healch sector, the Government plans to launch a major PHN program Lo
restore health services to a more adequate level. The national government
budget calls for a 77% real increase in maintenance and operating expenditures
in the economic and social' sectors.  This increase, while seemingly large,
will intfact me:rely bring the level of O&M in these sectors to their 1982
level in real Ltrms, and will be particularly important for restoring health
and education services.%
55.       The C4nernment is committed, as expressed in the Letter of
Development Policy, to mainteining a public sector investment rate at the 5-6%
level during thernext 3 years and to maintaining O&M in the economic and
social sectors at least at their 1982 real levels. In addition, it will
s4tify the Bank of any major changes in the investment program, should they
occur in the future, and the overall program will be reviewed annually with
the Bank. The Government hap, developed an improved monitoring system for
public investAent to -give more Cumely reports of actual performance under the
*jrogram, on a quarterly basis.  This program was reviewed and agreed during
negotiations.  The Corerntent Wiill'also Lake steps to ensure full coordination
betneen NEDA and the Office of Bu6get and Management so that investment
projects, once included in the .ra:gram; would continue to receive adequate
budget support to ensure a timely and effective completion.
Government Financial Institutions
-56.      Background.  Refornil of the government financial institutions is a
major priority, both for the financial sector and for the economy as a whole.
in the past, the GP0* bave suffered from a variety of problems, largely
related to the>-' s*tA;ial nosition as public institutions.  These have included
-outside interfeirene in l.nding deciaions, the undertaking of costly govern-
meat credit programs without reimbursement, lack of sufficient internal con-
trols and auditing, poor management practices in terms of lending decisions
and portfolio management, and excessive size and diversity of functions.  At
the,same time, their special position allowied them unlimited use of government
'&posits, exemptions from t4sees and access to government guaranteed
borrowings.
57.       The tuwY tcorgeit FCIs are the Philippine National Bank (PNB) and the
Developmeit Bank of the Philippines (DBP), which together account for nearly



- 22 -
one-half of the total banking assets in the couotry. In the past, both
institutions provided important financial services; long term credit in the
case of DBP for both agriculture and industry, and a significant concentration
on agricultural finance in the case of PNB. However, both institutions are
now technically bankrupt, with about 80% of their combined portfolios being
considered as non-performing.
58.       At the second level, there are a number of somewhat smnller institu-
tions whose problems are less severe in scope and/or whose potential budgetary
impact is much 7maller. These include the Land Bank of thg,Philippines (LBP),
Philguarantee,.5  and the two social security institutions.-'  The financial
outlook and problems of these institutions require further study before a
reform program can be put in place. In addition, there are six government-
acquired commercial banks which have been taken over from the private sector
because of their liquidity deficiencies, but not yet fully rehabilitated.
59.       Reform Principles.  Recognizing these problems, the Government has
designed a reform program that addresses the problems of the two largest
banks, and lays the foundation for further reform to cover the remaining
institutions. The basic guidelines to future reform are detailed in a
financial policy statement of the Monetary Board which is attached to the
Letter of Development Pelicy (see Annex V).  Derived from past experience,
this policy statement indicates that primary reliance shall be placed on the
private financial system, and all banks, whether private or public, will be
given equal treatment in terms of Central Bank rules and supervision.
60.       Overall, the Government's policy is to insure that:
-    the share of government banks in the ove-:all banking system will be
reduced from 47% of total banking assets (1986), to a level of about
25X in future years;
-    the establishment of new government banks will be avoided;
existing government banks will be required to achieve and maintain
financial viability;
-    government equity infusions in Government banks will not be
undertaken for the purposes of covering losses;
-    specific credit programs directed by the Government will be funded
by it, and not from the resources of the banks;
-    government banks will not enjoy any special tax or credit advantages
which are not available to the private sector, nor will they benefit
from government guarantees on their liabilities;

all government banks will be subject to annual audit by private,
external auditors;
-    government banks will be permitted only restricted access to the
deposits of the national government; and
-    the Government will develop a system for enhanced performance
monitoring of the its financial institutions.
61.       DBP/PNB Restructuring.  A fundamental reorganization of the two ma-
jor GFIs has taken place which consists of: the establishment of new charters
and policy statements; the installation of new management teams and boards of
directors; the transfer of approximately P 133 billion of non-performing ac-
counts (at book valuy) and P 155 billion in liabilities from the banks to the
national government;- the implementation of a program of cost reduction,
leading to lower staff levels and numbers of branches; and internal reorgani-
zation and beginning of a program of institutional strengthening for each
bank. Annex VI contains a detailed analysis of the restructuring plans for
each bank as spelled out in the Letter of Development Policy and confirmed
during negotiations; a sunmary is given below.
62.       DBP.  An overall rehabilitation and financial restructuring plan for
DBP has been developed and reviewed by the Bank. This plan envisions a
smaller institution, one which in its initial stages will focus on lending for
agriculture, small/medium scale industry and housing. Expanded lending in
other areas will be possible only after a three year rehabilitation period
(1987-89) during which it will have established its financial soundness. In
the longer term, it may be possible for DBP to move away from retail lending
and become largely a wholesale lender, that is, a provider of long-term funds
to private banks.
63.       Under the rehabilitation plan, DBP has the status of a thrift bank
and is subject to the normal Central Bank regulations governing thrift banks,
which include limits on equity investments, exposure to any single borrower,
and the use of guarantees. In addition, the Government has decided that DBP's
debt/equity ratio will not exceed 5:1 (during the rehabilitation period, it
will not exceed 3:1) although under thrift bank regulations, this ratio could
be as high as 10:1. The financial restructuring of DBP will provide for a re-
duction in total assets from P 74 billion to P 10 billion. The restructured
bank will have P 7.4 billion of liabilities and P 2.5 billion of equity, yielding a
debtlequity ratio well within the prescribed limit. About P 2.8 billion of
small account NPAs will remain with DBP for their settlement.
71   Total liabilities include P 38 billion in contingent liabilities.  The
net budgetary cost of assuming these GFI assets and liabilities will be
about P 14 billion in 1987, declining to about P 7 billion by 1990.



- 24 -
64.       DBP's rehabilitation plan includes a program for keeping costs in
line with revenues. The overall level of staff will be reduced from 3,350 to
2,400 by the end of 1987, and 2,000 by 1988. These targets will be reached
through an early retirement scheme designed to increase the rate of voluntary
attrition. In addition, DBP's current network of 69 branches would be reduced
to 46 in 1987 and 14 by 1989. DBP intends to achieve this program in part by
setting up regional development banks from those branches which are viable;
those not suitable for incorporating into regional banks and which cannot be
otherwise sold would be closed. Regional banks that are still wholely owned
by DBP would remain a part of DBP's financial statements. The level of staff
and number of branches will be kept under review as part of the cost reduction
program. Under the present plan, however, staff and administration costs
would be held to about 4% of total assets during the period 1987-90.
65.       DBP has formulated an action plan for institutional strengthening
which has been agreed with the Bank. This plan covers strengthening of DBP's
credit policies, legal procedures, financial controls and management,
accounting and internal controls, and personnel management, as well as
reorganization of the head office. The implementation of this plan will be
monitored under this loan and technical assistance will be made available to
assist in its execution.
66.       As part of the financial plan, all government deposits having below
market interest rates would be phased out by the end of 1989. This phase-out
is in line with the planned reduction in the smaller NPAs still remaining on
DBP's books, which will also be liquidated over the same period. DBP's loan
disbursments are expected to grow from P 1.5 billion in 1987 to P 2.3 billion
by 1990, a fairly conservative projection. Total assets are expected to grow
by about 7X per annum (compared to a 5% inflation rate).  The bulk of DBP's
incremental financing is expected to come from Central Bank rediscounting
operations, or from direct loans from international agencies. Most of its
housing loans would be taken out by the government-owned secondary mortgage
institution NEMEC. Direct government deposits and other borrowings from the
National Government and government corporations are projected to decline from
39% of total assets to 16% by 1990. Remaining government deposits would be
paid market interest rates. On these assumptions, equity growth would result
from reinvested profits and the overall debt-equity ratio would remain below
2.5.
67.       PNB.  The fundamental objective of the Government's restructuring
plan is to restore the financial viability of PNB as quickly as possible. PNB
will be allowed to operate under the rules and regulations covering private
expanded commercial banks, without access to special privileges or funds. At
the same time, PNB will continue to serve as the principal banker for the
Government and public corporations, but within the limits prescribed by the
Government's policy on public deposits (see below). After a two year period
of successful operation, steps would be taken toward the privatization of the
bank through the public offering of stock. The government does not intend to
add to PNB's initial equity; any increases in equity would come from the
private sectors



- 25 -
68.       Under the adopted financial restructuring plan, PNB's total assets
would be reduced from P 79 billion to P 26 billion. At this size, PNB would
remain the second largest bank in the Philippines. A total of P 47 billion in
non-performing accounts and other assets would be transferred to the Govern-
ment, along with P 55 billion of direct liabilities and P 17 billion in
contingent liabilities. About P 7 billion of smaller non-performing accounts
would remain with PNB, against which an appropriate valuation reserve has been
provided. PNB's balance sheet after restructuring includes a net worth of
P 2.5 billion and liabilities of P 24 billion. The deposit base is divided
between P 12 billion of private deposits and P 4 billion in deposits from the
public sector, including the public corporations. From this base, PNB is
expected to be able to maintain a profitable operation, and expects to be able
to expand its loan portfolios at an annual rate of 14% per year. The
projected net worth to risk assets ratio is 13% (1986-90), considerably higher
than the required level of 6%.
69.       PNB's rehabilitation plan includes a program of organizational
restructuring and cost reduction, in line with a more efficient level of
operation. Overall, PNB intends to keep staff and other administrative costs
to about 3% of total assets. The overall staff complement will be reduced
from about 6,500 to 5,600 by the end of 1987, largely through voluntary
attrition which has been made more attractive by an early retirement scheme.
PNB's initial plan is to close 13 branches including four foreign branches.
The profitability of the remaining branches will be further reviewed, and a
final plan will be developed by June 1987.
70.       A plan for institutional strengthening has been drawn up by PNB and
reviewed by the Bank. The implementation of this plan will be monitored under
the ERL, and includes actions to improve credit policies and procedures,
financial controls and management, internal controls and auditing, and per-
sonnel management. Technical assistance to support this program will be
sought by PNB, and funded under the Economic Recovery Technical Assistance
Project (ERTAP).
71.       Government Deposits.  The deposits of the national government at
government banks will be limited to working balances, with the excess to be
placed at the Central Bank. Working balances have been defined to be the level
required to maintain efficient and effective operations, or about 1/15th of
annual expenditures and debt service. While local governments and public
corporations will be required to keep working balances at government banks,
they will be free to place investible funds directly in government securities.
The market for these securities will be improved to facilitate their use by
corporate treasurers.
72.       All government deposits, including short-term borrowings from the
public sector and deposits by public corporations, will be subject to a
liquidity requirement of 75%. The liquidity requirement must be held in cash
or government securities. This restriction is intended to reduce the reliance
by government banks on public sector deposits.
73.       Monitoring and Evaluation.  The responsibility for monitoring the
performance of DBP and PNB has been assigned to the inter-ministerial



- 26 -
Government Corporate Monitoring and Coordinating Committee (CCHCC). A system
of performance monitoring and evaluation will be put in place before the
release of the second tranche of the ERL. In the meantime, the Government has
agreed with the Bank on a list of key financial indicators, developed in
collaboration with DBP and PNB, which will be reported to the Bank on a semi-
annual basis. These indicators, and their suggested appropriate levels, are
given in Annex VI for each bank. They cover such areas as capital adequacy,
liquidity, funding, asset quality, and earning performance. In addition, the
attachment of DBP and PNB will formally be shifted from NEDA to the Ministry
of Finance by the end of 1987.
74.       Accounting and Auditing.  All banks, both government and private,
are now subject to accounting and auditing standards as established by the
Central Bank. To ensure full public accountability, the Monetary Board now
requires that all government banks be subject to annual audits by independent
private auditing firms, in addition to those normally undertaken by the
Government's Comission on Audit. DBP and PNB have already selected private
auditors, and audited accounts for 1986 and 1987 will be a requirement for the
releases of the second and third tranches, respectively, of the ERL.
75.       Asset Disposition.  The non-performing accounts transferred from the
GFls will be handled by a special Asset Privatization Trust (APT) established
for this purpose, and for the purpose of expediting disposition and privatiza-
tion of certain government corporations. The APT Board, comprising five
executive trustees and a chief executive trustee, was appointed in January,
1987. Its goal is to seek an orderly transfer of these non-performing
accounts to new owners in the private sector, while undertaking a minimum of
rehabilitation expense. This trust is seen as a temporary device with a
limited life (five years), and it is not the Government's intention to create
a permanent industrial holding company.
76.       The supervision of the APT is being undertaken by a Committee on
Privatization (COP), which is chaired by the Minister of Finance and includes
the ministers of budget, industry, planning and government reorganization.
The role of COP is to provide overall guidance on the disposal process, and to
approve the terms for individual sales.
77.       Draft operational principles and guidelines for disposition of the
nonperforming accounts were reviewed with the Bank at negotiations. These
guidelines specify that:
(a)  sales will be open to qualified buyers through competitive bidding
or auction arrangements;
(b)  rehabilitation prior to disposal will be undertaken only in
exceptional cases when it would lead to a justifiable increase in
the assets' saleability and price;
(C) as a general rule, nonperforming accounts will not be disposed of to
their original owners; and



- 27 -
(d) in the case of deferred payment, terms will be consistent among the
various individual disposition transactions.
78.       The APT will refine its plan for outside technical assistance in
order to ensure the proper functioning of the asset disposition mechanism.
Initial technical assistance requirements and plans have been developed and
reviewed with the Government, and funds are being provided under the ERTAP
operation to finance part of the technical assistance needs.
79.       Government Acquired Banks.  The six government-acquired banks are
relatively small commercial banks (total assets representing about 51 of
banking system assets). These banks were taken over by various government
institutions from the private sector during the past several years when they
were facing financial difficulties. Until now, the banks as a group have not
been fully rehabilitated as intended, and only one bank has been partially
privatized. As part of the Economic Recovery Program, the Covernment will
divest all six banks by October 1988.
80.       Studies.  In addition to the reforms discussed above, the Government
has agreed to undertake studies of LBP, Philguarantee, and CSIS/SSS with the
objective of reviewing these institutions' roles, longer-term viability and
needs for reorganization and strengthening. Terms of reference for these
studies have been reviewed by the Bank, and the studies will be completed
prior to the release of the third tranche. Technical assistance will be
sought for the study on GSISISSS, and this assistance will be supported under
the ERTAP. The other studies wilL be undertaken mainly by task forces in the
Philippines. Recomnendations arising from these studies could be pursued
under future operations.
PART III - THE PROPOSED LOANS
Background
81.       The proposed loans, particularly the ERL, complement past Bank
policy-based lending to the Philippines. Two structural adjustment loans, in
1980 and 1983, dealt with a broad range of issues, including a major reform of
the tariff system, liberalization of import restrictions, rationalization of
indirect taxes, the restructuring of the industrial incentive system, and
adjustment in energy prices. In addition, an Agricultural Sector/Inputs Loan
in 1984 supported a series of reforms in the pricing and distribution of
fertilizer, rice, feedgrains, and other commodities.  Basic studies of sugar
and coconut subsectors financed under this loan led to eventual reforms of the
institutional arrangements in these subsectors.
82.       The Bank has had a long involvement with the financial sector in the
Philippines, including, prior to 1980, several loans for agricultural and
industrial lending through DBP. Because of DBP's mounting financial problems,
lending to DBP was halted, and drawings on existing loans were suspended.
Attempts were made to begin a major reform and restructuring of the institu-
tion, but little progress was made. In 1981, the Bank approved an industrial



- 28 -
finance project (APEX) loan, to provide long-term industrial finance through
the private banking system, through a special office located in the Central
Bank. This loan also supported several important reforms in the financial
sector, including the liberalization of interest rates, and the introduction
of the expanded commercial bank concept. In 1984, an Agricultural Credit
Project provided short- and long-terp finance to agriculture through private
banks, and support for reforms aimed at reducing and gradually eliminating
subsidized lending in the agricultural sector.
83.       The initial concept of the ERP was originally discussed during the
Subcommitee meeting of the Consultative Group in Tokyo in May 1986. From
those discussions, it was clear that the Government was prepared to adopt a
number of important reforms, and that there was a need for quick-disbursing
balance of payments assistance.  The program was appraised during July/August
1986, and additional discussions were held with government officials during
the visit of President Aquino to Washington in September 1986. A post-
appraisal mission visited Manila in October, and negotiations were held in
Washington in December 1986; the Philippine delegation was headed by Mr.
Gabriel Singson, Senior Deputy Governor of the Central Bank. Supplementary
loan data are provided in Annex III.
IMF Status and Bank/Fund Coordination
84.       There has been close cooperation between the IMF and Bank staffs
during the preparatory work leading to the standby arrangement and the
proposed ERP. Bank staff have participated in Fund missions, and vice
versa. The ERP appraisal mission was in the field at the same time as the
Fund's standby mission, and there was close coordination, particularly in
developing agreed positions on policy reforms. The Fund has taken the lead
responsibility in negotiating the program for tax reform and the Bank has
taken the lead in the areas of GFI reform and public investment. The Bank and
the Fund have jointly developed the program for trade liberalization.
85.       The Government has agreed wj h the IMF on a new package of financial
support which totals SDR 422 million." The associated program includes a
limit on the national budget deficit to 4.4% of GNP during 1986, a growth rate
of no more than lZ in the monetary base, and limits on short-term debt and
minimum levels for international reserves. The program is designed to provide
sufficient flexibility to allow for some fiscal stimulus in order to start the
recovery process while still maintaining adequate controls to avoid infla-
tion. The program assumes the continuation of a flexible exchange rate policy
which will ensure an exchange rate that responds to market forces and provides
an incentive to expand exports. This program was approved by the IMF
Executive Directors on October 24, 1986.
8/   This package consists of SDR 198 million under a 18-month standby
arrangement covering the period October 1986 to April 1988, and a SDR 224
million CFF drawing. The total resources to be provided during the
period net of repurchases is SDR 55.4 million.



- 29 -
The Loans
86.       The proposed loans would total $310 million and directly support the
Government's economic recovery program. They would consist of one loan of
$300 million for import financing (ERL), and a loan of $10 million for
technical assistance (ERTAP).
87.       ER!.  Many of the proposed actions being supported by the ERL
involve difficult institutional restructuring issues. Therefore, this loan is
to be disbursed in three tranches of $100 million each, to support the
decisions that will be required at each stage of restructuring.
88.       The actions taken prior to Board consideration and the conditions
for the release of the second and third tranches are outlined in Annex IV.
Important prior actions for this loan, all of which are already in place,
include:
(a) adoption of the tax reform program as agreed, including the movement
to a global income tax, restructuring of the rates of the personal
and corporate tax, and other measures as outlined above;
Cb) agreement with the Government on overall policies affecting the
GFIs, including the use of external audits, and the elimination of
special subsidies and benefits;
iC) the financial restructuring of DBP and PNB, including the transfer
to the Government of nonperforming accounts and associated
liabilities, and a reduction in government deposits;
(d) agreement on a revised public investment program (1987-91) on an
initial increase in operating and maintenance expenditures, and on
the periodic review of the investment program by the Bank;
(e) implementation of the liberalization of 87 restricted import items
in September and December 1986 and the announcement of new schedules
for 292 remaining items.
89.       ERTAP.  The ERTAP will provide technical assistance to help the
Government undertake required financial restructuring of public-sector insti-
tutions, and for assistance in related areas. This technical assistance
program will focus on (a) institutional strengthening for DBP and PNB; (b)
assistance to APT for the disposition of nonperforming accounts and the
management of APT; (c) a study of the social security systems (GSIS and SSS),
which would require outside expertise; (d) assistance to the Central Bank to
strengthen its bank regulatory functions; and (e) support to the Ministry of
Finance to improve expenditure controls and accounting (see Annex VII). The
total project cost is estimated to be $15 million equivalent, of which $8
million or 53Z is foreign exchange costs. The proposed loan of $10 million
equivalent would finance 67% of the total project cost, exclusive of taxes and
duties. The Ministry of Finance will coordinate the implementation of the
technical assistance program.



30 -
90.       Action plans for DBP's and PNB's institutional strengthening and
associated technical assistance requirements to implement these plans were
finalized during negotiations. It is estimated that about 7 man-years of
technical assistance will be required. The rehabilitation pLans focus on
rationalizing the internal organization of these institutions, and stream-
lining procedures and upgrading policies to reduce operating costs. Technical
assistance will help these institutions carry out measures designed to
strengthen credit policy and procedures, financial management and accounting
and personnel management, and improve internal controls and procedures,
including auditing. The terms of reference for the required technical assist-
ance were agreed during negotiations and are expected to be completed over a
period of three years.
g9.       In order to assist APT in the orderly disposal of the nonperforming
accounts, the ERTAP will finance technical expertise to assist in such areas
as the technical evaluation of companies and sectors, the determination of
company specific disposaL arrangements, valuation of assets, the implementa-
tion of rehabilitation and financial restructuring programs, and the identifi-
cation of potential markets. Assistance will also be provided to help APT
strengthen internal policies, procedures and organization. This component
would involve about 10 man-years of technical assistance over a period of
three years and would finance only a portion of APT's total technical
assistance requirements. The balance is expected to be provided from other
multilateral and bilateral sources, including grant funds.
92.       The ERTAP will also provide assistance to the Central Bank (about 5
man-years) to strengthen its supervisory and examination functions, as they
related to both private and government-owned banks. The loan would allow the
Central Bank to upgrade the capability of its Supervision Department in the
areas of credit evaluation and asset appraisal, establish an early warning
system, upgrade the existing Bank examination manual, and allow for computeri-
zation of examination procedures. Assitance would also be provided to the
Ministry of Finance/Bureau of Treasury (about 2 man-years) to establish a more
effective system of monitoring and reporting of government expenditures.
Existing information management systems would be upgraded and integrated into
a single system. The loan will finance technical assistance, training, and
computer hardware and software to achieve these objectives.
93.       Various studies are to be undertaken, as part of the ERP, an govern-
ment financial institutions other than PNB and DBP. Most of these studies can
be undertaken by government task forces or local consultants. In the case of
CSIS and SSS, however, the technical problems are sufficiently complex as to
warrant the use of external technical assistance, to enable the Government to
draw on the experience of other countries. The study would review the insti-
tutions' contributions and benefit policies, investment policies, long-term
financial viability and organization, including the scope for greater integra-
tion. The study is expected to take 4 man-years of technical assistance; the
terms of reference for this study were discussed during negotiations, and the
study is expected to be completed before December 1988.



- 31 -
Procurement
94.       Import financing under the ERL, both public and private, for con-
tracts costing US$5.0 million or more will be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts for the
procurement of goods by the private sector estimated to cost less than
US$5.0 million will be awarded on the basis of normal commercial practices of
the purchasers. Public-sector imports under contracts below US$5.0 million
will be procured in accordance with standard government practices which are
acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for commonly traded commodities may be
awarded on the basis of prices available from organized international
commodity markets.
95.       For the technical assistance loan, locally and internationally
recruited consultants acceptable to the Bank will be selected following Bank
guidelines. International competitive bidding will be required for contracts
for goods costing over $100,000. Contracts for goods costing $100,000 or less
may be awarded through local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the
Bank, up to an aggregate of $700,000.  Contracts under $50,000 may be awarded
through solicitation of quotations, up to an aggregate of $300,000.
Disbursement
96.       The proceeds of the ERL of $300 million would be used for disburse-
ments against general imports based on a standard negative list which
excludes, inter alia, goods and services for military or paramilitary purposes
or for luxury consumption. Both private- and public-sector imports would be
eligible for financing. In order to reduce the number of disbursement appli-
cations, Statements of Expenditure will be used for payments below $100,000
equivalent. To expedite disbursements, a Special Account would be established
in the Central Bank of the Philippines, with an initial deposit of $25
million. The Bank would replenish this account on the basis of adequately
supported withdrawal applications. Loan proceeds would also be disbursed for
eligible expenditures made before loan signing but after September 16, 1986,
the date at which agreement had been reached on the basic recovery program.
This would allow disbursements to flow almost immediately after the loan is
declared effective. The counterpart of the import component would be used for
the general budget expenditures.
97.       The technical assistance loan ($10 million equivalent) would be
disbursed over three years, and would finance (i) 100% of expenditures on
consultants' services and training, and (ii) 1001 of foreign, 1001 of ex-
factory cost or 651 of local expenditure on equipment. In order to expedite
disbursements, Statements of Expenditure for payments below $20,000 equivalent
would be used under this loan, and a Special Account will be established in
the Central Bank with an initial deposit of $1 million.
98.       The first tranche of the ElaL would be available for disbursement
upon loan effectiveness. The second sand third tranches would be released upon
compliance with the conditions spelled out in Annex IV. The Bank will assess
regularly the satisfactory implementation of the Government's reform program,
including the implementation of DBP's and PNB's agreed restructuring plan, the



- 32 -
transfer of assets to APT, the implementation a revised public investment pro-
gram, further trade liberalization, and tax reforms. In addition to continued
satisfactory implementation of the program, specific conditions for the
release of the second tranche include Ci) receipt of acceptable audit reports,
by independent private auditors, on DBP's and PNB's 1986 accounts and finan-
cial statements; (ii) submission of detailed organizational, staffing and
financial plan for APT; (iii) completion of a program of studies to develop
proposaLs for tariff reforms; (iv) development and introduction of a satis-
factory system for monitoring and evaluation of PNB and DBP; (v) completion of
public hearings, and subsequent announcement of a new schedule for the further
liberalization of restricted imports; (vi) submission of a branch reduction
program for PNB by June 30, 1987; and (vii) implementation of a system to
monitor the physical and financial accomplishments of the Borrower's public
investments. For the third tranche: (i) receipt of acceptable audit reports,
by independent private auditors, on DBP's PNB's and APT's 1987 accounts and
financial statements; (ii) divestment of the Government's ownership in six
acquired banks; (iii) completion of the study of the social security systems
(CSIS and SSS), and studies of LBP and Philguarantee; (iv) the conduct of
public hearings and the announcement of an acceptable tariff reform program
and schedule of implementation; (v) introduction of a value added tax; and
(vi) implementation of measures for further tax reform.
99.       Tranche releases for the ERL would occur at approximately one-year
intervals, so that the entire loan would be fully disbursed in about two
years. Because of the timing of the loan, however, it is likely to affect the
balance of payments in three years: 1987, 1988 and 1989. The ERL would be an
important source of external finance during these years, providing about 102
of official financing and about 2% of total commodity imports.
Cofinancing
100.      Discussions during the CG subcommittee meeting in Tokyo last May
confirmed the interest of the donor community in the reforms being carried out
in conjunction with the ERP. Consequently, the Bank and the Government have
explored the possibilities for cofinancing, especially with the Governments of
Japan and the US, and with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Discussions on
possible cofinancing by the commercial banks have been deferred until the
expected second debt-restructuring is completed. While the eventual amounts
and participation in cofinancing are still uncertain, cofinancing efforts are
continuing. The proposed ERL is seen as a major vehicle for helping the
Government to mobilize additional external aid; cofinancing participation
might materialize after loan approval.
101.      So far, the greatest expression of interest has been from the
Government of Japan, especially through its Export-Import Bank (EXIM-Japan)
and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF). Discussions are pro-
gressing on parallel cofinancing arrangements of approximately $150-300 mil-
lion equivalent from each institution. The EXIM loan terms would be similar
to that of the proposed Bank loan; however, the loan would be denominated in
Japanese yen, the applicable interest rate would be fixed, not variable, and
the rate could be slightly lower than the prevailing long-term prime rate
(currently about 5.82 p.a.) in Japan. Disbursements under the cofinancing



- 33 -
loan are expected to be linked to the releases of thf three tranches of the
proposed Bank loan over the 1987-88 period. The loan would be linked with
expenditures under the Public Investment Program of such sectors as
power/energy, telecommunication, transportation, water supply and irriga-
tion. A substantial portion of the loan could be disbursed against local cost
expenditures. The OECF loan terms would have the standard 30 year maturity,
including a 10 year grace, with a 3% fixed interest rate. The loan would be
denominated in Yen. Disbursements under the cofinancing loan are likely to be
against general import based on a negative list similar to the Bank's, and
would be linked to the tranche releases of the ERL. The Government is also
considering a proposal by the ADB to support APT's program. This would
include financial and technical assistance for the rehabilitation of non-
performing assets before their sale or provision of credit facilities for new
purchasers.
Accounts and Audits
102.      For both loans, the Ministry of Finance will maintain financial
records of all transactions in accordance with sound accounting practices.
Implementing agencies under the technical assistance loan will also maintain
separate accounts of their respective transactions. These accounts would be
regularly audited, along with disbursements under Statements of Expenditure,
after the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower, by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank.
Monitoring and Evaluation
103.      As noted above, several steps are being taken to ensure proper
monitoring under this loan. In the case of the government banks, a set of
performance criteria have been identified for each bank which will be reported
to the World Bank on a semi-annual basis. Likewise, the Government has agreed
to report quarterly on the implementation of the public investment program,
and to report major changes to the Bank. The monitoring of progress in the
area of trade reform will be undertaken jointly by the Fund and the Bank,
while the Fund will be primarily responsible for monitoring the implementation
of the tax reform package.
104.      Release of succeeding tranches will be dependent on a review by the
Bank of actions completed. Annual review missions will visit the Philippines
prior to tranche releases to assess progress. The Government will prepare
reports on implementation prior to each tranche review mission, as well as an
overall evaluation of the program when it is completed. The Ministry of
Finance will have overall responsibility for the implementation of the policy
program and the coordination of technical assistance activities.
Benefits and Risks
105.      The major benefit of the program is the support it will give to the
economic recovery of the Philippines; both by encouraging policy reforms and
providing financial support for the development effort. The reforms initiated
under the ERL address fundamental problems which have been outstanding and
unresolved for many years. While the ERL will directly prc.vide foreign



- 34 -
exchange resources, it will also support reforms which "ill have a major
impact on the budget.  These include tax reforms, whiih will ensure a more
orderly generation of revenue, and controls on public investment, which will
help ensure that expenditures are appropriate and well focussed. In the
longer term, the resolution of the GFI problem will eliminate the major source
of budgetary drain which has, in the past, cAused expenditures to be cut back
in many critical areas.
106.      With these reforms in place, the economic recovery should be
stronger and follow more economically efficient lines. In addition, the
financing provided through the program, including possible cofinancing, will
help ensure that the recovery will not be aborted by a critical shortage of
foreign exchange. The ERL particularly provides support for structural
changes which we feel are essential for sustainable growth, enhanced export
earnings, and debt servicing capacity. Thus, the combination of a Fund
program and this operation is likely to create an environment within which the
major creditors will have greater willingness to undertake a significant,
multi-year rescheduling of their future debt service payments.
107.      As with any operation of this type, there are risks of having a
delayed or inadequate implementation of the program. Reducing the administra-
tive costs of the government banks would necessitate reducing their present
work forces, which could create adverse reactions. Likewise, opposition to
the trade liberalization program may stiffen because of the short-term dis-
locations and possible unemployment it could generate. The introduction of
the value-added tax may be more difficult than anticipated, and administrative
problems may delay its implementation. Even with full implementation of the
ERP, it is possible that the pace of recovery wjlJI be slower than anticipated,
because of factors external to the econqmy or beyond the control of the
Government.
108.      While these risks are recognized, the Government is clearly
committed to carrying out the reforms.  Many of the most difficult cosmmitments
in such areas as GFI reform and tax reform have been undertaken prior to Board
presentation. In the case of the GFIs and the public investment program,
monitoring programs are being put in place which will ensure that problems can
be identified as soon as possible. Through its economic and sector work,
furthermore, the Bank will continue to be involved in the dialogue on macro-
economic management.
109.      Poverty Impact. The ERL provides support to the Government's
program of economic recovery which by accelerating the growth rar- of output
will help provide jobs and reduce poverty. In addition, many of the
components of the ERL will have a direct beneficial impact in poverty related
areas. Specifically, the loan supports:
-    an investment program more directed than in the past to increasing
rural employment and providing basic social services;
-    an increase in the level of operating and maintenance expenditures
which will increase the quality of social services provided to the
public at large, including the poor;



- 35 -
-    a reform of the tax system which will reduce tax evasion and make
tax collectionb more equitable by eliminating direct taxation on
incomes below the poverty line; and
-    further reform of the trade regime which will reduce the discri-
mination which favors industry over agriculture, capital intensity
over labor intensity, And imports over domestic value added.
110.      There is the possibility, however, that the reform process could add
to the unemploynent problem, even if temporarily. The reform of the GFIs will
undoubtedly create some unemployment, but the provision of early retirement
and severance payments will lessen its financial impact. In addition, most of
the attrition will be done on a voluntary basis. Trade liberalization could
cause some. unempLoymenc in industries not capable of competing in world
markets., In:general, these industries tend to be those with low employment/
capital coefficients, and any short-term unemployment should be offset by
increased grcAwth in more labor-intensive industries, so that the net effect
should be job-creating.
PART IV - WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
ill.      As of September 30, 1986, the Philippines had received 100 Bank
loans (of which two were on Third Window terms) amounting to $4,016 million
and six IDA credits amounting tuo $122 million. IFC investments totalled
$162 uillion. The sha-.p of the Bank Group in total MLT debt disbursed and
outstanding is currently about 13% and its share in total debt service is
about 18Z. These ratios are expected to be about 15% and 12%, respectively,
by 1990.  Annex II contains a summary of IDA credits, Bank loans, and IFC
investments as of September 30, 1986.
112.      Batik Group lending to the Philippines expanded from an average of
about $90 miLlion and four loans per year in FY71-75 to an average of about
$420 million and seven loans in FY8o-84. However, the lending program
decreased dramatically in FY85 and FY86 because of the limited scope for
traditional project lending under prevailing economic circumstances. Only two
loans were made in FY86 for a total of $151 million. Although the lending
program was reduced in size during the stabilization period, the emphasis of
the program ensured that greater weight was assigned to alleviate the adverse
socioeconomic impact of the economic stabilization program. The Bank has
financed projects in virtually all sectors of the economy, with particular
emphasis on agriculture which has accounted for almost one third of total
Bank/IbA :Dendi'    dending for industry, transportation, energy, and social
sectors ioiiowed in declining order. With regard to the future, the lending
program is being revised to make it more responsive and relevant to the
country's current needs. During the next two years, the operations would
focus on essential macroeconomic and sectoral policy reforms, rehabilitation
and waintenance of existing infrastructure, and high priority activities that
would minimize the need for budgetary support.

113.      In agriculture, lending initially focused on expanding the irriga-
tion system, credit programs, and other services to support rice production.
The experience with irrigation has been positive with the establishment of a
strong institution and expansion in irrigated areas, although cost recovery is
still a problem. Efforts have also been made to diversify agricultural
production through loans for tree crops, livestock, fisheries, and integrated
rural development projects. In FY85, the Bank provided assistance under the
Agricultural Sector/Inputs project to support programs of policy and institu-
tional reforms, and the Agricultural Credit project to provide credit to agri-
cultural producers and to help establish a framework for a finLacially sound
rural czedit system.
114.      In the industrial and financial sectors, lendirg has supported poli-
cy reforms under the Government's structural adjustment program. Structural
adjustment lending in 1980 and 1983 ($502.3 million, total), supported a
series of reforms of the tariff structure, the system of industrial incen-
tives, energy pricing and export promotion. An Industrial Finance Loan
approved in FY81 supported improvements in financial sector policies, includ-
ing liberalizing interest rates, reducing bank specialization and increasing
the availability of longer term funds. It also introduced a new institutional
concept to broaden the reach of Bank lending by channelling loans through an
"tapex" unit in the Central Bank. In addition, the Bank has supported a
textile sector restructuring project and has continued to provide financial
support and technical assistance to small and medium industries.
115.      In infrastructure, the Bank has supported a number of transportation
projects (five highway projects, two rural roads projects, three ports pro-
jects and one shipping project). The Bank's role has been to assist the
Government in the implementation of its program in the sector, with special
emphasis on institutional issues and strengthening maintenance capabilities
and rural development. The Second Rural Roads Improvement project (FY86) was
designed to alleviate poverty in rural areas by providing farmers easy access
to markets and social infrastructure. To mitigate the social consequences of
the stabilization program, Bank-supported projects in water, urban and
regional development emphasized improvement of basic social services. Future
objectives would be to continue to provide assistance to the sector institu-
tions with which the Bank deals, assist them to formulate sector priorities
and investment programs, and implement appropriate sector policies.
116.      As a result of the country's economic and financial problems, and
particularly the tight budgetary constraints of the Government, implementation
of Bank-financed projects in the Philippines deteriorated during FY83-85.
Disburswent performance improved during the past year.  The disbursement
factor - (amount disbursed during the fiscal year as compared to the total
undisbursed at the beginning of the same fiscal year) for FY86 was 20.5X, up
from the FY85 level of 14.4%. The comparable FY86 ratios for Egypt and
9/   All calculations of the disbursement factor exclude disbursements under
Structural Adjustment Loans.



- 37 -
Morocco 102 were 24Z and 42%. The East Asia Regional average and the Bankwide
average were both about 23% in FY86. To deal with the implementation
problems, the Government and the Bank have instituted a process of joint
Country Implementation Reviews. Seven reviews have been held since May
1980. The Bank and the Government also agreed in FY83, under the Special
Action Pragram (SAP), on corrective actions to address project implementation
problems affecting the Bank's loan portfolio in the Philippines. Under the
SAP, selected projects benefitted from increased cost sharing and disbursement
ratios, the establishment of special accounts and in two cases, supplementary
financing. These actions facilitated project implementation and resulted in
improvements in disbursement performance, especially during FY84.
117.      These will be the first two loans to the Philirpines to be presented
to the Executive Directors in FY87. In addition, a nttber of other loans are
under preparation and will deal with issues in the government' s recovery pro-
gram which are not being addressed under the proposed operation. These
include a Public Corporate Sector Rationalization Project, which will support
a program of divestiture of non-financial government corporations and
improvements in the management and operation of those corporations remaining
in the public sector. In agriculture, a proposed loan for sugarland rehabi-
litation will help improve productivity and diversification in sugar producing
areas, while a loan for irrigation operations support will help define a
realistic program for rehabilitation and maintenance of the irrigation
system. Other lending operations, including a provincial ports project and a
land classification and titling project, have been appraised and are scheduled
for Board presentation in the coming months.
118.      The Bank is engaged in a number of economic and sector studies which
will help define development issues and future lending strategies in key
Sectors.  An Industrial Sector Mission visited Manila in August, 1986 and its
report will shortly be discussed with the Government. It will focus on
several important issues, including industrial restructuring, technological
change and the nature of the industrial incentive system. An Agricultural
Sector Mission will visit Manila in March 1987 to review the Government's
current strategy in this sector and possible roles for Bank assistance. A
special economic mission in February 1987 will review the implementation of
the public investment program, and public corporation cost recovery and
pricing issues. A possible Financial Sector Study is presently being
discussed with the Government.
101 Egypt and Morocco are useful as comparators as they have similar per
capita income levels and Bank group lending programs.

Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recoumend that the Executive Directors

Letter of Development Policy
January 2, 1987
Mr. Barber Conable
President
World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Conable:
Re: Program of Economic Recovery for the Philippines
Tntroduction
The task of economic recovery is of high priority to the
Government of the Philippines. Daring the past several months we have
been formulating our overall objectives and specific actions that must
be undertaken to effect a recovery.  This letter is to request a
policy-based loan to support our efforts in economic recovery, and
that will also help provide the quick-disbursing financiaL assistance
we require.
objectives
Our primary objective is to restore the growth of che economy as
quickly as possible, without introducing distortions in resource
allocation, or creating excessive inflationary pressure. After two
years of declining output and per capita consumption, and rising
unemployment, the restoration of growth is an urgent priority. At the
same time, we will begin to restructure our economy so that growth is
efficient and sustainable, and not based on price distortions or
government subsidies. In general, we intend to reduce the role of
government involvement in the economy, and rely wherever possible on
the private sector. We will, however, be paying particular attention
to the growing problems of poverty, unemployment and rural-
development, for which we feel a positive government involvement is
essential.
Critical to our recovery effort will be policy actions in four
areas, namely: (I) reform of the government financial institutions;
(2) reform of the tax system; (3) increased trade liberalization; and
(4) restrucrtring of our public investment program.
We describe below our recent actions in each of these areas, and
additional steps we will be taking in the near future.



ANNEX V

1. Government Financial Institutions
Restructuring and rehabilitating the government financial
institutions is an urgent priority in order to insure adequate
financial resources for the recovery effort and to reduce the
budgetary drain these institutions nov place on the National Treasury.
The Policy Statement of the Monetary Board on the Financial System
(attached) outlines the overall approach that will be taken. In
general, we will ensure that government banks vill, in the future: (1)
have an indicative market share limited to about one-fourth of the
banking system in terms of assets; (2) be financially viable and not
dependent on special assistance from the government, particularly to
cover losses; (3) be accorded equal treatment with private banks in
terms of regulatory requirements, and not enjoy fiscal or rediscount
advantages; (4) borrow on the strength of their own credit standings,
and neither their direct nor contingent liabilities shall be
guaranteed by the national government, except as may be required by
official foreign sources or in conjunction with the official
restructuring of foreign debt; (5) not have unlimited access to public
sector deposits, and be required to maintain liquidity balances
against these deposits; and (6) not have to administer special
government credit programs from their own resources, particularly if
these involve subsidized interest rates.
Furthermore, we are committed to the privatization of any bank
that is proven to be financially viable and for which no overriding
social purpose dictates its retention in the public sector. To this
end, we will dispose of our ownership in the six commercial banks
recently acquired by the government on or before October 30, 1988. We
will also make an effort to sell some or all of the stock of
Philippine National Bank in early 1989, once the financial results
from 1987 and 1988 are available and its financial viability and
profitability have been established.
For the immediate future, we will be focusing largely on the
rehabilitation of the two largest government banks, Philippine
National Bank (PNB) and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).
For these banks, we have put in place new management teams and new
Boards of Directors. The boards of both banks now have and will
continue to have substantial private sector participation. New
charters and policy statements for each bank have been adopted, which
bring their objectives, functions and organization in line with our
general financial policy statement. For each bank, we are in the
process of implementing a substantial cost reduction program, which
means reducing staff and branch offices in line with revised
expectations of operations, both in terms of level and content. Both
banks will be substantially reduced in size, by transfer from each
bank to the National Government of the larger nonperforming accounts,
as well as an appropriate amount of offsetting liabilities.

Both banks are in need of internal institutional strengthening.
We have reviewed the organization of each bank, and established a
program of institutional strengthening, including appropriate -
improvements in such areas as accounting, loan supervision, asset
manageeent and personnel management. We will seek expert technical
assistance to help carry out the program for each bank.
Development Bank of the Philippines. For the DBP, our
objective is to focus its operations on agricultural, small scale
industrial and housing finance, particularly during the next three
years, which we consider to be a rehabilitation period. Lending in
other areas will be extremely limited. Once the viability of DBP has
been established, we will begin to consider the possibility of
enlarging its wholesale lending operations. Specifically, we will:
(1) reduce DBP's assets from P 72 billion to P 11 billion; (2)
establish a P 2.5 billion equity base as of June 1986; (3) limit its
debt-equity ratio to,3:1 during the rehabilitation period, and 5:1
thereafter; (4) reduce administrative costs by appropriate reductions
in redundant staff and reorganization of its branch network; and (5)
eliminate, over the next three years, governumut deposits and loans to
DBP having interest payments below market levels.
Our present target is to reduce the staff of DBP from 3,300 to
not more than 2,000 by 1989, and the number of branches from 69 to 14,
excluding the head office.
Philippine National Bank. In the case of PNB, we feel that its
rehabilitation should quickly return it to profitability, and make it
a candidate for eventual privatization. We will not begin
privatization of PNB, however, until we have at least two years of
profitable operations. SpeciEically, we wilL (1) reduce the assets of
PNB from p 76 billion to about P 26 billion; (2) establish a
P 2.5 billion equity base as of June 1986; and (3) take appropriate
steps to reduce administrative costs by eliminating redundant staff
and branches.
- Our present goal is to reduce the overall staff of PNB to not
more than 5,635 by the end of 1987. We have already closed 9 domestic
and 4 overseas branches; further branch closing will be undertaken
after a review of the cost effectiveness of the branch network.
It is the intention of the Government to transfer the attachment
of both banks from NEDA to the Ministry of Finance. In addition to
the supervision functions of the Central Bfak over DBP and PNB, the
existing inter-ministerial Government Corporate Monitoring and
Coordinating Committee (GCMCC) has been given the responsibility of
monitoring these institutions. We will shortly be working out
arrangements for the detailed monitoring and evaluation of these
institutions. In the meantime, we have developed a set of key
parameters on financial performance which will be conveyed to the Bank
on a semi-annual basis.

Because of the nature of banking, it is important that all, backs,
including government banks, be fully audited by external independent
auditors.         A recently issued Central Bank circular (No. 1124
dated December 5, 1986) now provides that all government banks have
external independent auditors, in addition to that provided by the
Commission on Audit. In the case of DBP and PNB, these would commence
with a balance sheet audit as of December 31, 1986  in order to
certify the level of initial assets and liabilities and a full
financial audit, including income statements for the period July 1 to
December 31, 1986.
Government Deposits. The Central Bank has recently issued
Circular No. 1121, implementing the newly revised policy on government
deposits. Government chartered banks will continue to be the main
depositories for public funds; however, National Government deposits
will be limited to working balances approximately equal to 1/15th of
annual expenditures and debt service requirements. Balances in excess
of this level will be deposited with the Central Bank. For public
corporations, it is also our intention to limit deposits to working
balances, but this will be done by permitting such corporation
treasurers to invest funds directly in Treasury bills and similar
government instruments. Steps will be taken to improve the
marketability of these instruments to facilitate their use by
corporate treasurers. Monitoring of the investment activities -of the
corporations will be the responsibility of the GCMCC, which wilL also
be monitoring the performance of DBP and PNB.
Asset Disposition. We have established an Asset Privatization
Trust (Trust) to administer the disposal of the non-performing
accounts of the government banks. A ministerial Committee on
Privatizacion will provide overall supervision of the disposal process
and the work of the Trust. We are in the process of transferring to
the Trust the larger accounts (over P 10 million per account) of PNB
and DBP, and have established its basic charter and operating
guidelines. Trustees will soon be appointed to manage the trust, and
we expect to move expeditiously in the disposal of these assets. The
Trust has been given a life of five years, and it is not our intention
to create a permanent body or industrial holding company. In
addition, we will also transfer to the Trust, at some future date,
those public corporations which we feel should also be sold- to the
private sector. We are arranging for technical assistance to help in
the disposal process, utilizing domestic and foreign expertise
familiar with such operations in other countries.
Other Institutions. While we will give highest priority to the
reform of PNB and DBP, we will also begin studies leading to the
eventual rationalization and rehabilitation, where appropriate, of
other government financial institutions, including Land Bank of the
Philippines (LBP), Philippine Export and Foreign-

Page 5 of 15
Loan Guarantee Corporation (PhilGuarantee), Government Service
Insurance System (GStS), and Social Security System (SSS). We will
undertake in the very near future the establishment of appropriate
terms oE reference for the studies of these institutions, which will
focus on their overall roles, operational strategy, financial
viability, and requirements for reorganization and institutional
strengthening. These studies will be initiated by December 1987 and
completed by December 1988, and an agreed action plan for each
institution, based on these studies, will be developed within the
following year.
[I. Public Investment.
One of our major goals under the economic recovery plan will be
to raise the level of public investment and adjust its composition so
that it can fully support the recovery of the economy, the restoration
of growth, and the alleviation of poverty and unemployment. The
overall public investment program for 1986 is estimated to be about
P 29.4 billion, or a little less than 5 per cent of GNP. This is an
increase over the 1985 program which amounted to about 3.6 per cent of
GNP. Much of the increase will be for improved roads and for
employment oriented rural works projects. For the future, we intend
to keep the rate of public investment in the range of 5% to 6Z, a
level which is consistent with our recently approved Medium-Term
Public Investment Program for the 1987-92 period. The content of this
program has been discussed with your staff and found to be generally
appropriate in terms of its sectoral composition and project content.
Since events are moving swiftly, it may be necessary to make
adjustments in this program in the future. However, we will promptly
inform and consult with the World Bank regarding any major changes to
the program.
In the past, many of our capital assets have suffered from
inadequate funding for maintenance and operating expenditures. This
has led to a premature deterioration of many assets, and an
inefficient use of existing capital. In 1986, we will increase
maintenance and operating expenditures in the national budget by 62
per cent. This will restore the level of such expenditures in the
social and economic sectors to their 1982 level in real terms. For
the 1987-89 period, we plan to maintain these expenditures at this
level, as a minimum.
We also intend to improve our monitoring of the Public Investment
Program, to insure that projects are being carried out expeditiously
and in accordance with agreed objectives. We have already taken steps
to insure that development projects are adequately funded in the
national budget, so that they are not delayed because of inadequate
local currency funding. IEDA is in the process of developing a
monitoring system for the public investment program, building on the



4':
-7 -ANNEX V
Page 6 of 15
system that NEDA is currently operating, and which will report
quarterly on the status of ongoing projects in the investment program,
both in terms of financial and physical accomplishment. Copies of
these reports will be furnished to the Bank, commencing with the first
report which we expect to have available after the first quarter of
1987.
IlI. Trade Liberalization.
Our recovery depends on establishing an efficient and export
oriented pattern of production in both industry and agriculture. To
meet this goal, we feel it is essential to maintain as free and open
an international trading environment as possible. Thus, we intend to
continue with a program of gradually removing quantitative
restrictions and prior approval requirements on a broad variety of
goods. Out of our agreed program of 1,232 items to ba liberalized, we
have already removed restrictions on 929, including 80 items
liberalized on September 30, 1986.
For the remaining 303 items, in-depth studies and public hearings
have been conducted in order to determine the appropriate schedule for
liberalization, taking into account such factors as capacity
utilization, employment and the pace of economic recovery. For 54
items originally scheduled for liberalization by April, 1986, a new
schedule has already been announced on October 15, 1986. For the
remaining 245 items, a new scheduLe will have been approved by
December 23, 1986. For those items for which extensions must be
granted, in no case will the deadline be extended beyond April 30,
1988. In some instances, ve may increase tariff levels on certain
items that are being liberalized. In no case will these tariff
adjustments be alLowed to raise the total tariff above a maximum rate
of 50 per cent on any commodity. In addition, we will review the
status of the remnaining restricted items not included in the present
program, and develop a new schedule for these items by December 1987.
In the longer term, we are considering a further restructuring of
the tariff system, with the aim of establishing tariffs as the primary
instrument for industrial protection and rationalizing effective rates
of protection within and across sectors. This shall be undertaken
within the context of the  TrN and our commitment to GATT and ASEAN.
Our general goal is to reduce the overall level of tariffs and move
toward a more uniform tariff structure.  We have already raised the
minimum import duty on all goods to 10 per cent. We intend to
complete studies leading to a new tariff reform by December 1987, and
to hold hearings and announce the new tariff rates and schedule of
implementation by December 1988.

We intend to continue with the floating exchange rate system that
we established in October 1984. In order to insure Eull flexibility
in the market, no limits or administrative impediments will be placed
on foreign exchange holdings by commercial banks. Exchange rate
policy will be subject co review to ensure that it remains
sufficiently supportive of external competitiveness, particularly in
relation to major competitors and for emerging export industries.
IV. Tax Reform.
In order to ensure a sufficient level of resources for critical
puiblic expenditures, we feel it is essential to raise our overall tax
effort. We intend to raise the overall level of taxes to GNP from 10
per cent at present, to 11 per cent in 1987, and to 12 per cent in
1988.  We have already undertaken a comprehensive tax reform, which
will improve the overall elasticity and equity of the tax system, and
be instrumental in promoting growth and efficiency.
We have already implemented 26 measures, covering both long-tern
structural reforms and one-time tax amnesties.  These include measures
to globalize taxes on all incomes except passive incomes; raise
personal exemptions 'under the income tax to avoid taxing incomes below
the poverty level and provide for their future indexation; reduce and
simplify business and sales taxes; abolish all export taxes, except
that on logs; reform the basis of the taxation of imports; and remove
all tax and duty exemptions, with a few exceptions. Revenue measures
also enacted have increased taxes on beer and cigarettes. Finally, we
have extended amnesties for the collection of income and property
taxes.
We also intend to eventually replace existing sales and turnover
taxes with a value-added tax. The value-added tax will be introduced
no later than Occober 1988, and may be introduced prior to the 1988
budget year. We are availing of technical assistance from the IMF in
order to prepare for the introduction of the value-added tax.
For remaining outstanding issues, we will undertake studies prior
to December 1987. These studies will include (a) the timing of
further globalization of the income tax; (b) capital gains taxatLon
(c) tax depreciation allowances; (d) BOI and other tax incentives; and
(e) property taxation. Reforms based on these studies will be
introduced by December 1988.
IMF Program. We have recently concluded an agreement with the
IfF for a nes standby arrangement and compensatory financing facility.
This agreement supports a program of agreed ceilings on monetary base
growth, public sector credit expansion, and short term external debt.
This program will insure that our economic recovery will proceed
without producing inordinate inflationary pressures chat could
undermine the basic stability of the economy.

Conclusion-
Wie believe that the program of reforms outlined above will be
instrumental in restoring growth of output and employmelnt. fr3 would
like to request, therefore, financing of $310 million in support of
this program of economic recovery, which would incLude up to $10
million for funding technical assistance activities associated with
our recovery program.

Min. No. 46 - November 28, 1986
1077. Policy statement of the Monetary Board on the Financial System
ACTION TAKEN:
The Board approved the policy statement on the
Financial System of the Monetary Board approved in
principle under Resolution No. 741 dated August 29, 1986,
as follows:
POLICY STATUME   OF THE MDNETARY BOARD
ON THE FINANCIAL SY5T
1.  The Objectives  of the Central Bank.  As
provided in its charter, the objectives of the Central Bank
are primarily to maintain internal and external monetary
stability, to preserve the international value of the
currency and its convertibility, and to foster monetary and
credit conditions conducive to a balanced sustainable
growth of the economy.
In pursuance of these objectives, the Monetary Board
hereby adopts the following statement of policies with
respect to the perceived purposes, functions, and roles of
the financial system in general, add the government
financial institutions in particular, which would assist in
the attainment of these goals.
A.  THE FINCIAL SYSTEM
2.  The Role  of the  Financial System.  The
financial system, and especially the banking system, should
facilitate the process of financial intermediation,
primarily by fostering and maintaining the operation of an
efficient market mechanism, through the active predominant
participation of private financial institutions under



RESTRICTED    ANE v
- 61-                        Page 10 of 15

conditions of effective competition.  Here growth of the
system is not enough, and financial intermediation should
-be supportive as well of economic activities reflecting
national priorities.  In the process of facilitating
financial intermediation, the system should become more
effective, more efficient, and more equitable.
For purposes of this Policy Statement, the financial
system mentioned herein consists of the various financial
institutions, both banks and other financial entities,
which are subject to supervision and/or regulation by the
Central Bank of the Philippines.
3.  The Maintenance of Conditions of Competition.
The maintenance of conditions of competition within the
financial system shall be observed, consistent with the-
needs of- structural and institutional stability. Price
competition, that is, the solicitation of both depositors
and borrowers by the banks through the use of attractive
but realistic interest rate differentials for deposits and
for loans  will- be encouraged.  Oligopolistic arrangements
by private financial aggrupations will be discouraged.
4.  Principle of Equality of Treatment. All banks
or other financial institutions within the same category,
-whether government or private, shall be entitled to fair
and equal treatment in the formulation and implementation
of Central Bank. rules and regulations.
The use of generally accepted accounting principles
and generally accepted auditing standards shall be followed
to the fullest extent possible in the determination by the
Central Bank of appropriate accounting and auditing systems
and procedures which shall be applicable to all banks,
whether government or private.
B. TuE CENUEAL BANK
5. The Extension of Credit. The Central Bank
shall avoid any direct involvement in the granting of loans
to private final users by way of requiring prior Central
Bank approval of original eatensions of domestic credit by
financial intermediaries.

Min. No. 46 - November 28, 1986
The foregoing will not apply to the authority of the
Central  Bank  to pass upon extension by financial
intermediaries of credit whi,n involve the use of foreign
exchange to individual end users, or where specific fund
sources so require for policy,- legal or other reasons.
C. GOVKRNNOT FINIWCIAL INSTITUIONS
6.  Role of Government Ficancial Institutions.
It is the policy of government to encourage private sector
initiative and participation in.the financial system.
However, there remain certain valid reasons for continuing -
government participation, more particularly in the banking
sub-sector, some of whicb are as follows:
(1)  To provide the national government,
government owned or controlled corporations, and
local governments with-such banking facilities as
deposits and withdrawals, foreign exchange, trusts,
and other related services.
(2)  To u-tilize existing appropriate domestic
and international networks as needed where
substantive  skills have been developed and
investments made, such as in agricultural credit, in
medium and long tern financing for small and medium
scale industry particularly in the countryside, and
in international banking.
(3)  To provide & standby presence for specific
. financial rertices or activities in pursuance of
national government pilicy whetefeexplicitly
indicated by appropriate hih.ber authorities and with
the use of special resources made available by and
for the account of said authority..
(4)  To preserve rA   encourage substantial
private deposits preseutly ledged-with government
banks, provided that such, funds are obtained on a
competitive basis with the private banks.  -
(5)  To maintain an important competitive
presence ili thea financial markets.
These functions-are, however, to be undertaken within
the  context of instituitional financial viability.

a government bank should operate under the same rules and
regulations applicable to its private counterparts, in the
same category, and should not enjoy any privileges nor be
subject to any restriction not accorded to or imposed upon
the latter.
10. Limits to Government Partic.ipation in the
Banking System.  With the- end in view of maintaining
conditions of competition, conscious ,and continuing, efforts
will be taken by the monetary authorities to ensure that
the share of government-banks iu the market stays within
-some quantitative limits or guidelines, so as to ensure
that private sector market 'forces predominate and function
effectively in the banking system. An initial indicative
guideline would be not more than one-fourth of the
resources  of the banking system, inclusive of the
government banks other than the Central Bank.
11.  Performance Evaluation.  The appropriate
government authorities concerned, which in any case shall
include the Ministry of Finance, shall formulate
appropria-te performance evaluatiou standards and procedures
on the basis of which government banking inst.itutions will
be regularly monitored to ensure adherence thereto.
12.   Privatization  of Governument Financial
Institutions.   The possibility of private equity
participation in the government banking institutions
-competing  directly  with other private financial
institutions will be kept under consideration.

PHILIPPINES
ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM
ISSUES IN GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)
1.        In determining DBP's future role, the restructuring plan for DBP
seeks to achieve a balance between three sometimes conflicting objectives:
(a) the desirability of limiting DBP's activities, particularly during a
transitional rehabilitation period, thereby enabling DBP to consolidate and
strengthen its institutional capabilities; (b) the need for DBP to have
sufficient operational flexibility to ensure its future financial viability;
and (c) the desirability of focusing DBP's future operations on activities
considered development priorities. The restructuring plan also recognizes
that over time the potential exists for an evolution in DBP's role.
2.        Accordingly, it has been agreed that as the private sector becomes
more active in development financing, a longer-term objective for DBP could be
movement from a retail (direct) to a wholesale (indirect) lender through other
banks. For the near term, however, DBP's need for consolidation argues
against its playing a significant role in both retail and wholesale lending.
Therefore, it has been agreed that for the near term the restructured DBP will
emphasize direct lending for industry and agriculturep although it will also
continue its low-risk but profitable mortgage origination. Furthermore, given
DSP's limited resources and past difficulties with lending for large-scale
industry and in line with the government's development priorities, DBP's
industrial lending will be largely limited to small- and medium-scale industry
during a three-year rehabilitation period (1987-89). During this period, DEP
will also accord low priority to lending for wholesale (indirect) lending,
lending to the public sector, and other functions. In addition, during the
rehabilitation period, DBP will not undertake any new equity investments,
except in branches to be privatized and in wholly owned subsidiaries engaged
exclusively in the provision of services internal to DBP.
3.        Following the rehabilitation period and once DBP has a track record
of institutional soundness, gradual expansion of DBP's wholesale lending could
be considered. Such expansion would need to consider the scope for DBP's
withdrawal from retail (direct) lending and the extent to which retail and
wholesale lending can be effectively combined in one institution.
4.        Under the rehabilitation plan, DBP's status would be converted froa
that of a specialized institution to that of a thrift bank. As a thrift bank,
DBP is empowered to make loans, make equity investments in allied under-
takings, assume contingent liabilities and accept deposits; it is not
empowered to operate checking accounts or engage in foreign exchange
trading. This designation as a thrift bank is consistent with the general
thrust of the GFI reform program, whereby the objective is for CFIs to operate
under the same terms and conditions as their private sector counterparts.

DBP Attachment, Board and Management
5.        Historically, DBP has been attached to the National Economic
Development Authority (NEDA). This arrangement has not proved appropriate.
Accordingly, the Govertment plans to shift the attachment of DBP to the
Ministry of Finance. DBP's charter provides for a Board of Directors composed
of nine members, all of whom will be appointed by the President, which will be
a policy-making body distinct from DBP management. This is an important
improvement over the past, when several Board Directors and the Chairman had
day-to-day operational responsibility. Accordingly, DSP's President will be
the only staff represented on the Board (as vice-chairman), and the positions
of DBP President and Chairman will not be held by the same person. In
addition, to enhAnce public accountability and strengthen Board capabilities,
at least four of the nine Board members will come from the private sector.
DBP's new Board has been appointed and is already functioning.
Operating Policies
6.        DBP's revised Charter and Policy Statement constitute the basis for
the restructured DBP's operating policies. DBP has agreed that it will not
amend its Policy Statement unless in consultation and agreement with the World
Bank. These two documents define DBP's basic thrusts, while the Policy
Statement additionally specifies key staff and branch reduction steps that
will be implemented as part of its reorganization and confirms general
agreements that DBP will operate under the same terms and conditions as its
private-sector counterparts, adopt generally accepted accounting policies,
engage an external independent private auditor and implement an institutional
strengthening program with the benefit of technical assistance. In addition,
the Charter and Policy Statement confiin that DBP will be subject, unless
otherwise specifically stipulated, to the normal banking legislation and
regulations applicable to thrift banks, and contains special limits applicable
during the three-year rehabilitation period.
7.        Ihe legislation and regulation provide for the following principal
exposure limits: single-borrower exposure limit equivalent to 15Z of DBP's
net worth (with a ftrther 15% permissible in case of housing development
investment); maximum total equity investments equivalent to 252 of DBP's net
worth; maximum equity investment in a single entity equivalent to 15X of DBP's
net worth; equity investment in a single enterprise to remain a minority
except in the case of allied nonfinancial undertakings; and maximum aggregate
amount of standby letters of credit equivalent to 50% of DBP's net worth.
However, during the rehabilitation period, DBP will adhere to a single-
borrower exposure limit of P 50 million, substantially less than permissible
under current legislation. This includes loans, equity investments and
contingent liabilities. In addition, for loans and equity investments
existing at the time of DBP's restructuring and exceeding applicable limits,
DBP will have five years to bring them within prescribed limits. Furthermore,
DBP's charter permits it to exceed the prescribed limits in the case of new
equity investments in thrift banks, provided these are connected with its
branch privatization program and the limits are adhered to within five years.

Page 3 of 11
8.        In addition to these limits, DBP's Policy Statement specifies that
DBP's interest rate policies will ensure the maintenance of positive spreads
and will be in line with market rates; DBP will not expose itself to uncovered
foreign exchange risk; DBP will not undertake any lending in support of
government social programs unless specifically funded by and for the account
of the Government; and DBP will not finance more than 60% of the cost of any
one project. The Policy Statement further stipulates that DBP's consolidated
debt (including guarantees) to equity ratio will not exceed three to one
during the rehabilitation period, and five to one thereafter. This is
substantially more prudent than the leverage allowed thrift banks under
banking legislation.
Institutional Strengthening and Cost Reduction
9.        An essential component of DBP's overall rehabilitation plan will be
organizational restructuring to tailor DBP's organizational setup to its
reduced size, scope and income-generating capacities and to enhAnce effi-
ciency, in order to keep costs in line with projected revenues. Without a
firm program of cost reduction, it will be impossible to assure DBP's future
financial viability.
10.       Agreement has been reached on indicative targets for the scaling
back of branches and personnel. DBP's current branch network of 70 would be
reduced to 46 in 1987 and 14 in 1989, This branch reduction program would
leave DBP with one branch in each region and is considered appropriate for
DBP's operations and potential reorientation as a wholesale bank. DBP hopes
to accomplish this branch reduction through spinning off its branches into
private regional development banks. While there banks will be initially owned
by DBP, it is committed to reducing its equity share to 30% within five years
(end-1991). Furthermore, any branches which cannot be divested in some form
by 1989 will be closed.
11.       DBP plans to reduce its staff from the current level of 3,350 to a
maximum of 2,550 by 1987 and 2,000 by 1989. DBP has developed an early re-
tirement scheme which has attracted considerable interest, and it does not
foresee difficulties in meeting these targets. The financial impact of the
staff reduction will be partially funded by the national government. For
1987, salaries and personnel benefits are estimated to be about 15Z of total
operating income. Thus, further staff reductions are likely to have a limited
impact on financial viability. However, the adequacy of DBP's staffing, both
in number and levels, will be kept under review by DSP as part of an overall
cost reduction program.
12.       DBP has historically suffered from serious institutional weaknesses
which will be addressed as part of the rehabilitation program. DBP has formu-
lated an action plan which has been agreed with the Bank and the implementa-
tion of which will be monitored under the loan. The action plan is comprehen-
sive and covers strengthening of DBP's credit policies, legal procedures, fi-
nancial controls and management, accounting procedures, internal controls and
auditp and personnel management and training. It also covers the reorganiza-
tion and streamlining of the head office. Technical assistance will be made
available under the ERTAP loan to assist in this program of institutional
strengthening.

Financial Restructuring
13.       DBP's financial restructuring plan provides for a reduction in its
total assets from P 74 billion to about P 10 billion through the transfer to
the Government of its nonperforming accounts with a value of more than
P 10 million and a commensurate level of liabilities. DBP's starting equity
(June 1986) is P 2.5 billion, resulting in a consolidated debt (including
guarantees)-to-equity ratio of 2.95, below the 3 to 1 limit agreed for the
rehabilitation period. Liabilities of P 1.4 billion consist of P 1.9 billion
in private deposits and borrowings; P 3.4 billion in deposits and negotiated
borrowings from the Government and government corporations; and P 2.1 billion
of miscellaneous other liabilities. In line with the new policy on government
deposits, all government and public corporation deposits and borrowings are
subject to a 75% liquidity requirement. In addition, although P 2.3 billion
of the government funds bear subsidized rates, it has been agreed that
subsidization would be phased out within three years, in line with the elimi-
nation on the asset side of the remaining nonperforming accounts. DRP's
assets include P 2.2 billion in bonds and securities; a net loan portfolio of
P 3.8 billion; and a minimal level of equity investments of F 0.8 billion.
The gross loan portfolio includes P 3.0 billion in nonperforming accounts with
an individual value below P 10 million each, which are considered too small to
transfer to the Government. A valuation reserve of P 2.9 billion has been
provided against these accounts, so their net asset value is P .1 billion.
Operational and Financial Projections
14.       DBP's loan disbursements are expected to average P 1.8 billion per
year during the 1987-90 period and to be distributed between small- and
medium-scale industry (161), agriculture (36%), housing (43%), and other
lending, including private development banks (6%). Almost all of the housing
loans would be taken out by the government-owned secondary mortgage
institution NBJ4FC. The only new equity investments would be those in branches
to be privatized.
15.       Total liabilities and net worth (or total assets) are expected to
decline slightly during the period. While private sector deposits are
expected to grow by an average of 25% per year, they will continue to remain a
small share of total liabilities and net worth (less than 9% in 1990). The
bulk of DBP's incremental financing is expected to come from Central Bank
rediscounting facilities (IGLF, ATE). Direct government deposits and other
borrowings - from the National Covernment and government corporations are
projected to decline from 39% of the total in 1986 to 161 by 1990. Remaining
government deposits would be paid market interest rates. On these assump-
tions, equity growth would result from reinvested profits, and the overall
debt equity ratio would remain below 2.5 during the 1981-90 period.
16.       DBP's financial performance is projected to become and remain
viable, with net profits averaging P 354 million annually during the 1987-1990
period, or about a 4.8% return on average total assets, and a 10.2% on average
total equity. Operating expenses are expected to average about 4.4% of assets
during the 1987-90 period, in line with DBP's branch and staff reduction plan
and cost containment measures.

Philippine National Bank (PNB)
17.       The commercial banking system in the Philippines is fairly well
developed and over the medium/long term, the need for a publicly owned
commercial bank is not apparent. Accordingly, the principal objective for a
restructured PNB will be the achievement and maintenance of commercial
viability, so that it can be gradually privatized. The need for PNB to
demonstrate publicly a track record of responsible and profitable operations
precludes immediate steps towards privatization. However, under this loan,
the Government has agreed to take the first steps towards privatization, once
financial viability has been proven, through a public offering of PUB
shares. This would occur in early 1989, or at a later date if deemed more
appropriate by the Government and the Bank.
18.       Within the fundamental objective of achieving commercial viability,
PNB will continue to operate as an expanded commercial bank on the same terms
and conditions as its private sector counterparts. At the same time, PNB will
continue to serve as the principal banker for the Government and government
corporations, within the limits prescribed by the new policy on government and
government corporation deposits. While PNB plans to emphasize international
trade financing and agricultural and short-term small- and medium-scale
industrial lending, high-risk activities will be kept within limits so as not
to jeopardize PNB's viability. PUB's thrusts and objectives are embodied in a
revised Charter and Policy Statement, both of which have been formally
issued. PNB's Policy Statement would not be changed during the rehabilitation
period unless in consultation and agreement with the Bank.
PNB Attachment, Board and Management
19.       Historically, PUB has fallen under the responsibility of NEDA, an
attachment which has not proved satisfactory. Therefore, the government has
now agreed to attach PNB to the Ministry of Finance. Under the new charter,
PNB's Board of Directors will be composed of nine members; to enhance its pro-
fessional standing and public accountability, at least four members will come
from the private sector. PUB's Board has already been fully reconstituted,
and PNB's new President appointed in April 1986.
Operating Policies
20.       PNB will be subject to the normal banking legislation and regula-
tions applicable to expanded commercial banks. These provide for the follow-
ing principal exposure limits: maximum single borrower exposure limit equiva-
lent to 15Z of PNB's net worth, with a further 15% under certain conditions;
maximum total equity investments equivalent to 50% of PNB's net worth; maximum
equity investment in any one enterprise e?yivalent to 15% of PUB's net worth
and 30-35% of the enterprise's net worth;- and maximum total standby letters
11   Except for investments in certain allied enterprises, which can be 100%-
owned.



- 72 -
ANNEX VI
Page 6 of 11
of credit equivalent to 50Z of PNB's net worth. The banking regulations also
require PUB to adhere to a 6% net worth/risk assets ratio.
21.       In addition to the above, PNB's Policy Statement stipulates that PNB
will adopt interest rate policies which will ensure the maintenance of
positive spreads and alignment with market rates; PNB will not expose itself
to uncovered foreign exchange risk; PNB will not undertake any lending in
support of government social programs unless specifically funded by and for
the account of the Government; and PNB's assumption of contingent liabilities
will be Limited to those incurred in the normal course of expanded commercial
banking. The Policy Statement also stipulates that during PNB's rehabilita-
tion period, defined as a minimum of two years' satisfactory operations after
restructuring, PNB will not undertake any new equity investments except in
wholly owned subsidiaries exclusively providing services internal to PNB.
Finally, the Policy Statement confirms agreements on PNB privatization, the
use of generally accepted accounting principles and external private audits,
and the intention to source any future equity injections from the private
sector.
Organizational Restructuring
22.       PNB's rehabilitation plan incorporates a program of organizational
restructuring involving a streamlining of the head office organizational setup
and scaling back of unprofitable branches and personnel. PNB's branch reduc-
tion program is still under review; preliminary targets include the closure of
13 branches by the end of 1987. A final plan will be developed and oresented
to the Bank by June 1987, following an in-depth review of the profitability of
all branches. PNB proposes to reduce its staff complement from the 1986 level
of 6,490 to 5,635 by end 1987. PNB intends to further review these targets
taking into account the finalized branch and cost reduction program.
Institutional Strengthening
23.       PNB has formulated a comprehensive Action Plan for strengthening its
institutional capabilities. The Action Plan has been agreed with the Bank,
and its implementation will be monitored under the ERP. The Action Plan
covers credit policies and procedures, financial controls and management,
internal controls and audit, and personnel management and training. Outside
expertise to support this program will be arranged, and partially financed by
the ERTAP loan.
Financial Restructuring
24.       PNB's financial restructuring plan provides for a reduction in PNB's
total assets from P 79 billion to P 26 billion, or from 21% to 8% of comer-
cial banking assets, through the transfer to the Government of nonperforming
accounts having an individual value of mar. trhn P 10 million and a
commensurate amount of liabilities. At this size, PNB is the second largest
bank in the Philippines. PNB's balance sheet after the restructuring
(June 1986) includes a net worth of P 2.5 billion, resulting in an initial
debt-equity ratio of 9.4:1. LiaDilities of P.23 billion include P 12 billion
in private deposits and P 4 billion in deposits from the National Government



- 73 -
ANNEX VI
Page 7 of 11
(working balances only), local governments and government corporations.
Governmental deposits are subject to a 75% liquidity requirement and those in
the form of time and savings deposits will carry market rates. Assets include
a gross loan portfolio of P 13 billion. This includes P 7 billion in
nonperforming accounts with a value below P 10 million against which an
appropriate valuation reserve has been provided.
Operational and Financial Projections
25.       Per PNB's base case projections, PNB's loan portfolio is expected to
grow between 1986-90 by an annual average 14%, and to be distributed on
average as follows: agriculture 31%; manufacturing, mining and construction
291; utilities 6%; commerce 15% and others 9%. Total assets are forecast to
grow by an annual average 11% and private deposits by an annual average 16%.
In line with the new government deposits policy, deposits of the Government
and government corporations are forecast to grow by only an annual average
10%. PNB's net worth to risk assets ratio is projected to average 131 during
the 1987-90 period, well above the 6% minimum required by regulation. PNB's
forecast of liquid assets to deposits ratio is 59%, which appears to be
adequate.
26.       PNB's financial performance is expected to improve steadily, with
net profits growing from P 30 million in 1987 to P 380 million in 1990, or an
average return on equity of over 5%. Administrative expenses are expected to
decline in relative terms from 3.41 to 2.8% of average total assets, as cost
reduction measures become effective.
Disposition cf Nonperforming Accounts
27.       A key objective of the GFI reform program is to render productive
the nonperforming accounts currently in the portfolios of DBP, PNB and
Philguarantee and to nmaimize the Government's return from these accounts. In
order to effectively manage this process an asset disposition mechanism,
independent of the banks, has been established with the fundamental objective
of disposing of the nonperforming accounts to the private sector within a
period of at most five years. The time limit is expected to prevent the
mechanism from developing into a permanent government holding company. The
mechanism will handle only nonperforming assets transferred from the CFIs;
liabilities transferred from DBP and PNB will be handled by the Treasury. The
mechanism will also handle the privatization of certain government-owned or
controlled corporations which will be pursued under the Government's proposed
program for reform of the nonfinancial government corporations.
28.       The asset disposition mechanism is two tiered, and legal instruments
establishing both tiers have been issued. The first tier will be the
Committee on Privatization (COP), a five-man interministerial body composed of
the Minister of Finance (chairman), Director General of NEDA, the Minister of
Budget, the Minister of Trade and Industry and the Minister for Government
Reorganization. COP's principal responsibility is to oversee the disposition
process, and it is accordingly empowered to issue guidelines governing the
disposition process to the second-tier entity and the government banks, the
principal implementing arms; to approve or disapprove the individual



- 74 -
ANNEX VI
Page 8 of 11
disposition proposals on terms and purchasers made by the implementing arms;
to approve the organizational and financial requirements of the implementing
bodies; and to periodically monitor the status of the overall divestment
program. COP is expected to require only a skeleton staff to carry out its
mandate and has been established for a period of five years.
29.       The second tier is the Asset Privatization Trust (APT), a government
corporate body which will serve as the National Government's trustee for
nonperforming accounts and government corporations transferred to it. APT's
principal objective is to dispose of these assets and administer them pending
disposal. In exceptional cases, where justified, APT would rehabilitate
assets prior to disposal. Like COP, APT has been created for a period of five
years. APT will have a five-man Board of Trustees, all appointed by the
President, including a Chief Executive Trustee and four Associate Executive
Trustees. All of the trustees have been appointed. APT is empowered to hire
its own staff, although it is expected that it would rely as much as possible
on secondments from other government entities and on external expertise in an
advisory capacity. A detailed program covering organizational, staffing,
financial and procedural requirements will be developed and provided to the
Bank by April 1, 1987.
30.       GFIs are retaining for their own account nonperforming accounts with
a value of not more than P 10 million. Accounts with a value of more than
P 10 milLion will be transferred to the National Government. Among accounts
transferred, COP will refer to APT those which have potential for sale as
going concerns or for which disposition is expected to require special
expertise. DBP and PNB may be asked to continue servicing these accounts
pending full transfer. The balance of nonperforming accounts transferred will
be referred back to the GFIs for disposal under the guidance of COP/APT.
31.       A tentative list indicates that there are 396 accounts having a
value of at least P 10 million to be transferred from DBP, PNB and
Philguarantee to the Government. The GFIs' exposure in these accounts amounts
to P 141 billion (US$7 billion equivalent). However, approximately one half
of this is estimated to be accrued interest; the actual value of the underly-
ing assets has been estimated to be only about P 80 billion. The distribution
of accounts from DBP and PNB aze as follows: agriculture 37; government 44;
manufacturing 159; mining 27; service, trading, utilities and others 116.
Draft legal documents effecting the transfers of assets and liabilities from
the GFIs to the National Government/APT and the timetable for such transfers
were provided to the Bank at negotiations. Since transfer of legal title is
expected to take some time, the designated assets and liabilities have been
segregated from DBP's and PNB's balance sheet for the account of APT.
Other Institutions
32.       As part of the Economic Recovery Program, the Government will
initiate studies of four smaller GFls, leading to their eventual financial
restructuring.

Page 9 of 11
33.       LBP.  LBP's principal mandate is to finance the Government's land
reform program and to undertake commerciai banking activities to cover part of
the costs of agrarian reform. LBP is heavily dependent upon government
resources. These include low-cost refinancing from the Central Bank and
government deposits, the latter accounting for about 801 of LBP's total
deposits. Despite collection rates of less than IO% on its agrarian reform
portfoLio, LBP's commercial banking activities have enabled it to remain
profitable. However, its financial performance could come under stress
without improved collections and with changes in government deposit policy.
The proposed study would review LBP's role and medium-long-term viability,
taking into consideration how agrarian reform should best be administered and
funded.
33.       Philguarantee.  Philguarantee's activities have included
guaranteeing large exposures of DBP and providing guarantees on behalf of
overseas contractors and for exporters and priority government projects. The
vast majority of its outstanding guarantees are in foreign currency.
Philguarantee is technically bankrupt, and annual government support is now
necessary to service payments on guarantees. Since 1984, Philguarantee, like
all GFIs, has been precluded from guaranteeing foreign loans. The proposed
study on Philguarantee will in particular review whether it has a continuing
role, taking into account its current lack of credibility in the financial
system and the proposals under review to create an independent export credit
guarantee corporation.
34.       GSIS and SSS.  GSIS provides a variety of insurance services and
retirement/disability benefits for public sector employees. SSS administers
social security, medicare and employees compensation programs for employees in
the private sector. Issues to be reviewed regarding GSIS and SSS include
their investment policies, in some instances excessively risky; their
financial performance and longer term viabilities; their organizational setup
and, in this context, whether there is a case for greater integration among
the two entities; their benefits and contribution policies, and the case, if
any, for GSIS and SSS aligning these policies; and their coverage. These
issues require in-depth analysis using actuarial and other specialists. Tech-
nical assistance will be provided under the ERTAP for a study of the two
institutions.

ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM
Technical Assistance Project
1.        The Economic Recovery Program will be supported by an Economic
Recovery Technical Assistance Project. The Project will help the Government
undertake its program of economic recovery with particular emphasis on the
improved operation of various public sector financial institutions. It will
help ensure that the rehabilitation programs of the two major GFIs required
under the ERL are carried out effectively, including the disposition of their
non-performing accounts. Specifically, it will focus on and include financing
for Ci) institutional strengthening for DBP and PNB; (ii) assistance to the
Central Bank to strengthen its Bank supervisory functions; (iii) assistance to
the Ministry of Finance/Bureau of the Treasury to provide more effective
monitoring of public expenditures; (iv) assistance to APT for the disposition
of non-performing assets and for the management of APT; and Cv) a study of the
social insurance systems (GSIS/SSS).
Project Costs and Financing
2.        The total project cost is estimated at $15 million equivalent, 2!
(in December 1986 prices) of which about $8 million equivalent will be in
foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan of $10 million would cover the full
foreign exchange cost and about 28% of local cost, or approximately 67Z of
total project cost. The balance of the local cost will be financed by the
Government and the individual executing agencies. The Bank loan would be for
20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable estimated rate.
3.        While the participation of local consultants would be encouraged,
some of the consultancy needed under the project would require specialized
skills, currently not available in the country. In addition, foreign firms
are expected to participate through joint ventures with local firms. The
total project cost includes $1.4 million equivalent, about 10% of base cost,
as price contingencies based upon projected internatiozal inflation rates of
3Z in 1987, Z in 1988, and 1% in 1989, and local inflation rates of 5.5% in
1987, 5% in 1988 and 5X in 1989.

DBP and PNB
4.        The fundamental reorganization of PNB and DBP proposed under the
Economic Recovery Program will include a program of institutional strengthen-
ing designed to ensure future viability of these two banks. These programs
will include actions that will reduce costs and increase the efficiency of
operations through improved credit policies and procedures, financial controls
and management, internal controls and auditing, and personnel management. The
coverage, composition, and estimated costs for the institutional strengthening
component were developed during appraisal and post-appraisal missions of the
ERP. The terms of reference for the consultants of both institutions were
discussed and agreed during negotiations. It is estimated that about 87 man-
months of consultancy services will be required to carry out the PNB and DBP
plans. The program is expected to be completed in three years with the bulk
of the work taking place in the first year, 1987.
5.        The technical assistance to PNB and DBP will help these institutions
in carrying out their action plans. Specifically, consultant services will be
utilized for: (i) development of proposals for an organizational framework
and appropriate staffing level which will streamline functions and assist the
decision making process; (ii) identification of improvements needed in person-
nel management with emphasis on recruitment, performance evaluation, rewards
management, and manpower planning; Ciii) design of necessary training pro-
grams; (iv) development of recommendations to improve control, timing and
quality of both foreign and domestic operations; (v) supervision of the prepa-
ration of a Credit Policy Manual specifying both overall lending practices and
specific sectoral lending policies; (vi) implementation of credit, planning,
budgeting and performance measurement process; (vii) improving existing
management information systems; (viii) development of a data processing system
to meet the needs of each institution consistent with the consultants'
recommendations on each area; and (ix) improvement in treasury management
functions to meet near term operating needs.

6.        Given the different nature of operations in both financial
institutions, DBP's technical assistance requirements will also include:
(i) the development of an action plan for both staff and branch reduction
recommending alternative approaches such as privatization and/or closure;
(ii) designing a training program focussing on-cash flow lending as well as
collateral based lending; and (iii) adoption of a methodology for project
appraisal and procurement procedures and documentation.
Central Bank
7.        In order to strengthen the Philippine financial sector as a whole,
improvements are-required in the supervisory and examination functions of the
Central-Bank, both as they relate to private and government-owned/controlled
banks. In the past, failures in the banking sector have often been the result
of poor banking practices which should have been deatected or corrected through
Central Bank supervision. These practices included inadequate credit analy-
sis, lack of feasibility studies, poor project-monitoring, and inadequate L
supervision of collateral. The proposed technical assistance loan wouldrhelp
the Central Bank upgrade the capability of its examining force-in the, areas of
credit evaluation and asset appraisal. Emphasis will be placed on systematic
monitoring of lending policies, in order to ensure that the values of the loan
portfolio are maintained. The program of technical asaistance will also help
establish an early warning system whereby problems c"a be detected at a time
when corrective measures are possible, as well as a bank rating system. The



- 81 -
ANNEX VII
Page 4 of 5
existing Bank examination manual will be revised and upgraded, and computeri-
zation of examination procedures will be introduced. The loan proceeds will
be mainly used for financing training of Central Bank staff in supervision and
examination, consultant services for upgrading the examination manual and the
establishment of the early warning system, and for the acquisition of a
limited amount of computer hardware and software for use in the supervision
and examination sections. About 60 man-months of consulting services are
planned.
Ministry of Finance/Bureau of Treasury
8.        The functions of tZa Bureau of the Treasury include execution and
supervision of financial transactions of the National Government, management
and servicing of public debt, and the administration of the internal banking
system of the National Government. Currently this agency has problems in
accessing data, reconciling figures, and reporting the relevant information.
The Bureau of the Treasury will develop a Management Information System (MIS)
to help establish a more effective monitoring and reporting of government
expenditures, and of the financial assistance to government corporations.
This component will be implemented over approximately 30 months and would
require 24 man-months of consultancy services. The entire information system
of the Bureau will be integrated into one and an MIS development plan will be
prepared to identify equipment, training, and manpower requirements to develop
such a system. Subsequent steps will be taken in a number of development
phases throughout the implementation period. The expected output includes an
analysis of the existing system, compilation of existing documentation flows
and organization requirements, a plan for the implementation of the MIS, and
pilot testing and training for users of the MIS system.
Asset Privatization Trust (APT)
9.        The APT has recently been established as a temporary agency to
expedite disposition and privatization of certain Government corporations and
acquired assets. APT will, therefore, dispose of the non-performing accounts
of the government banks, mainly DBP and PNB, which have been taken over as
part of the rehabilitation of these institutions. Because of its temporary
nature, its staff will remain small, and it will rely heavily on outside
expertise, both domestic and foreign. The proposed technial assistance loan
will help finance consultant services in such areas as marketing services,
industrial sector studies, asset valuation, rehabilitation feasibility
studies, and legal services. In addition, some assistance is envisioned for
strengthening the internal manAgement of APT. Because the APT is not yet
fully operational, it is not possible to define exactly all the types of
technical assistance required. It is estimated that APT will require about
120 man-months of consultancy services, most of which will be financed by the
ERTAP. Bank staff will evaluate proposals under this component of the project
on a case-by-case basis.

GSIS/SSS
10.       The Government's social security sector comprises the Government
Service Insurance System (GSIS) and the Social Security System (SSS). GSIS,
established in 1936, provides a variety of insurance services and retirementl
disability benefits for public sector employees. SSS, established in 1954,
administers social security, medicare and employee's compensation in the
private sector. Being the dominant social security/insurance schemes, GSIS
and SSS control a significant proportion of the country's long-term resources.
A comprehensive study of these institutions is required to determine whether
the present institutional, functional, regulatory and investment policy
arrangements result in adequate delivery of services, efficient use of
resources and long-term financial viability of the social security system.
The study calls for identification of strategies and policy recommendations to
rationalize the operations of CSIS and SSS. It will focus on steps necessary
to increase the financial viability of these institutions by focusing on the
contributions received versus the benefits provided, and the risk and return
on investments made with GSIS/SSS resources. The study will consider whether
any activities presently undertaken by GSIS/SSS can be better undertaken by
the private sector, or discontinued. Consideration will also be given to
steps that can be undertaken to improve the managerial and administrative
efficiency of the two organizations, including their possible merger.
11.       The technical problems involved with this study make it necessary to
draw on outside expertise, particularly consultants familiar with social
insurance schemes in other countries. The study is expected to required
approximately 48 man-months of consultancy services. The final report is
expected to be completed by December, 1988.
