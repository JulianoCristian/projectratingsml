(a)\n            improve the existing network of national highways and\n            bridges; (b) raise maintenance to adequate levels and remove\n            the backlog of restoration works; (c) improve highway\n            management, particularly maintenance, and thus further\n            strengthen the MPWH institutional framework. The project\n            also aims to assist in deregulating interisland shipping,\n            developing the domestic construction industry, and improving\n            the road transport industry. To accomplish these aims, the\n            project provides for reconstruction of bridges, improvement\n            and restoration of national highways, consulting and\n            technical assistance services, and training. The project\n            benefits are mainly savings in vehicle operating costs and\n            in highway maintenance costs. The main project risk is in\n            higher construction costs than estimated; this risk has been\n            reduced by a thorough preparation of the bridge\n            reconstruction and highway improvement programs. Two\n            measures proposed under the Special Action Program and\n            included in this project are a higher cost-sharing ratio and\n            the establishment of a Special Account."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
