INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO AUTORIDAD PORTUARIA NACIONAL (APN)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
FOR A SECOND PORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Autoridad Portuaria Nacional (APN) with the guarantee of the
Republic of Panama for the equivalent of US$24.4 million to help finance a
Second Port Project. The loan would have a term of 15 years, including 3 years
of grace, with interest at 11.6 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A report entitled "Panama's Development in the 1980s:  A Special
Economic Report" (2306-PAN) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
July 31, 1979. A Bank economic mission visited Panama in September 1980. A
draft of its report was discussed with the Government in April 1982, and the
report will be circulated to the Executive Directors shortly. The mission's
findings are reflected below. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Although Panama continues to be adversely affected by sharp increases
in petroleum prices, it has managed to reverse the decline in per capita GDP
experienced during 1974-77. GDP grew by an average 5.5 percent in 1978-81,
double the rate of population growth. In 1978 the service sectors--banking,
commerce, transport, communications and storage--were the most dynamic, while
in 1979 manufacturing and public utilities were the fastest growing sectors.
Construction recovered strongly in 1980; during 1981 it fell slightly but
banking, commerce, and other services showed great buoyancy during both years.
Unfortunately, agricultural output has not increased since 1977.
4.        The Government's three main concerns since 1968 have been to
eliminate rural poverty, to increase national control over the economy,
including the Panama Canal, and to create new sources of economic growth
and exports. Social programs in health and education were extended to most
areas, and an agrarian reform program was initiated. The second goal was
achieved by the U.S.-Panamanian Treaty by which the administration of the old
Canal Zone reverts to Panama. Major investments were undertaken in transport,
tourism, international commercial infrastructure, water supply and sewerage,
and power, mostly to provide support for expected private activities. Power
and most telecommunications facilities were nationalized. New State enter-
prises were created for export crops such as sugar, citrus, and bananas; and
a State-owned cement plant was built. Self-sufficiency in basic foodstuffs such
as rice, corn, and beans was also accorded high priority.
5.        The Government's social programs have had considerable success
in enhancing the quality of life in Panama, as reflected in demographic,
health and educational indicators. Infant mortality declined by 20 percent
between 1968 and 1976, while fertility rates fell from 131.3 per thousand in
1971 to 114 per thousand in 1975. Access to potable water for the rural
1/   Panama's fiscal year is the same as the calendar year.



- 2 -
population increased from 43 percent in 1970 to 63 percent in 1976. The
proportion of the population enrolled in schools of all types increased from
less than one-quarter to over one-third between 1968 and 1978. Despite these
achievements, estimates indicate that some 21 pcrcent of the urban and about
30 percent of the rural population continue to live in poverty.
6.        As regards the Government's economic programs, the Colon Free Zone
and hydroelectric prn ects have been quite successful, in the first case by
increasing employment and earnings from export of services, and in the
second by reducing the burden of rising petroleum costs. Perhaps the most
successful of Government programs was a major change in the banking legisla-
tion in 1970. This has attracted almost a hundred banks to Panama; it is now
a major regional Eurodollar Center. Other programs involving direct production
by the public sector or affecting private sector decisions have been less suc-
cessful. Agricultural programs have led to self-sufficiency in rice and
increased the output of milk, but have had less impact on the output of beef,
and feed grains. State sugar mills have increased output but they usually
operate unprofitably. Similarly, State enterprises in tourism and cement
together with the sugar operations, have been a burden on the fisc. The
public enterprises' direct competition with private enterprises and some
uncertainties relating to Government labor and price policies adversely affected
the climate for private investment. Recent improvements in the dialogue between
the Government and the private sector and a more flexible approach to labor and
price policy appear to have increased private sector confidence.
7.        The high level of outlays for economic and social infrastructure,
coupled with the substantial losses of State enterprises, resulted in signi-
ficant increases in public external borrowing, despite periodic efforts to
strengthen the public finances. The public sector deficit increased from
4.4 percent of GDP in 1970 to over 15 percent of GDP in 1978. In 1979, the
deficit fell to 11 percent of GDP, largely as a result of a reduction in
investment. At the end of the year, Panama's disbursed external public debt
which had reached 77 percent of GDP in 1978 fell to 74 percent of GDP; but
interest on the debt continued to absorb about 40 percent of current revenues
of the central Government.
8.        This alarming situation prompted the Government to take action.
During 1980 a series of actions reduced the public sector deficit significantly.
These measures included increases in taxes on gasoline and cigarettes and in
maritime and corporate registration fees, improvements in income tax adminis-
tration, elimination of several income tax exonerations and reductions in current
and capital transfers to decentralized agencies and public enterprises. The
reduction of these transfers resulted in increases in the prices of 19 basic
items including milk, bread, and tomatoes, and rental rates charged by the
State Machinery Pool. Some profitable agencies, e.g., the telecommunications
company and the Colon Free Zone, were required to increase their transfers to
Central Government. An emergency public employment program which had grown
to employ over 17,000 people by the end of February 1980, was discontinued
on that date. In conjunction with favorable sugar prices, a major increase
in canal revenues, and very buoyant tax revenues, these measures reduced
the deficit to less than 6 percent of GDP in 1980 -- successfully meeting the
targetted reduction required under the IM.F Standby Agreement. Panama's next



- 3 -
program--again supported by the IMF--had a ceiling of 6 percent of GDP (US$215
million) for the 1981 deficit, and for the second year in a row the Government
was able to complete its program successfully. The IMF Board has approved another
Standby in support of a financial program for 1982 which includes a public sector
deficit ceiling of 6 percent of GDP.
9.        The strategy for recovery and growth of the economy now requires
that private capital and entrepreneurs provide the buoyancy in economic
activity that the public sector can no longer provide given the ceiling agreed
with the IMF. New opportunities have indeed been created for the private
sector. The past high level of public investment has provided an expanded
physical infrastructure. Investments in hydropower are reducing Panama's
dependence on expensive imported petroleum. Panama's workforce is among the
best educated in the area. There is social tranquility, and tax incentives
and financing facilities for industry are readily available. In agriculture,
recent increases in support prices and provision of credit facilities are
designed to realize the potential for increased production and exports of
beef, fruit, cocoa, and coffee, and for replacing imports of vegetable
oils and dairy products.
10.       The prospects for growth also depend on the use of land and facilities
reverting to Panama and on the nigher earnings to be received by Panama under
the new Canal Treaty. Implementation of the Treaty began on October 1, 1979
and will be completed on December 31, 1999, when the Canal and all ancillary
facilities will revert to Panama. Already the ports of Balboa, Cristobal and
Coco Solo Norte, two abandoned airfields, much valuable land, and most service
outlets of the former Panama Canal Company's supply division have reverted to
Panama. The reverting land makes even more feasible a spatial orientation
in development strategy which emphasizes the metropolitan area, bounding the
Canal and traversing the isthmus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, as the
best site for activities to take advantage of Panama's excellent geographic
location. The Government is actively planning the conservation and further
development of infrastructure in this area for expanded private sector activi-
ties which would generate employment, revenues and rents adequate to pay for
these investments.
11.       The longer-term outlook for the Panamanian economy seems favorable,
given its geographic advantages, educated workforce, low population/land ratio,
and large hydroelectric potential. The medium-term outlook will depend on the
policies affecting certain critical domestic issues and on the performance
of the international economy. The critical domestic issues include rising
urban unemployment, the size of the public external debt, the relative roles
of the public and private sectors, and the climate for private investment--
especially as regards price and wage policies. The Government is now keenly
aware of these issues. It has developed and is continuing a dialogue with
businessmen, and has adopted more flexible approaches to price controls and
recognizes the need to reduce its direct involvement in activities which not
only compete with the private sector, but often operate at a loss. In addition,
it is pursuing a program to attract internationally-integrated assembly
industries by simplifying procedures for establishing plants and granting
incentives and by training labor in response to the specific manpower require-
ments of incoming firms.
12.       During the last two years the Government has acted decisively to
reduce the relative size of the public sector deficit. As a result, public



- 4 -
external debt has fallen compared to GDP. Nevertheless, continued caution
will be prudent. The public external debt was still about 67 percent of
1980 GDP, and during 1981 interest payments on this debt equalled about
7.5 percent of GDP, a major cost to the economy. By end 1980, about three
quarters of the public external debt was owed to private banks, bondholders,
and suppliers--the overwhelming proportion of it at floating interest rates--
and less than 15 percent was owed to multilateral development institutions.
For reasons of debt management as well as employment generation, the recent
government actions will be vital to ensure that growth continues in a stable
financial environment. The Bank will be monitoring the impact of recent
measures and is continuing a dialogue with the Government as it seeks to
reduce the losses of public enterprises, while encouraging higher growth
and greater employment. On the basis of the strong fiscal action taken by
the Government and the favorable longer-term outlook Panama is considered
creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       The Bank has to date made twenty three loans to Panama totalling
US$356.1 million (net of cancellations). Of these, 12 loans for US$147.0
million, are fully disbursed (two for roads totalling US$13 million; one for
an airport project for US$20 million; four for agriculture totalling US$9.0
million, three for power for US$76 million; one for ports for US$24 million.
and one for fisheries for US$4.9 (net of cancellations). Ongoing operations
include one project for livestock credit; one for development of tropical tree
crops, two for development banking; two for highway maintenance and rehabilita-
tion; two in the power sector (for generation, transmission and distribution);
a project to support energy planning and petroleum exploration; one to help
develop the water supply and sewerage sector; and a loan for the urban develop-
ment of Colon. The most recent of these loans, for road rehabilitation, was
approved by the Executive Directors on June 23, 1981.
14.       IFC has made three investments in Panama.  The first was a commitment
in 1971 to acquire US$0.3 million of equity in the Corporacion de Desarrollo
Hotelero, S.A. and to lend to the Corporacion US$1.2 million to build a new
international hotel. The second is a commitment in December 1977 to lend
US$2.4 million and acquire US$1.4 million in equity in Vidrios Panamenos, S.A.,
the first glass container factory in Panama. These projects have been satis-
factorily completed. The third is a commitment in 1979 to acquire US$2.5
million in equity in the Banco Latinoamericano de Exportaciones (BLADEX), a
regional export bank promoted by the Government of Panama.
15.       Satisfactory progress of the overall implementation of ongoing
projects is reflected in the steady increase in Bank disbursements, from
US$17.0 million in FY79 and US$16.1 million in FY80, to US$31.0 million in
FY81. Disbursements in the first nine months of FY82 have reached US$24.6
million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC invest-
ments as of March 31, 1982, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



- 5 -
16.       Bank lending to Panama is designed to support the Government's
development strategy particularly as regards the further development of
Panama's infrastructure and service industries and the diversification of
production and exports. Specifically, the Bank assists those sectors in which
it can make a special contribution in terms of (i) developing policies and
institutions, (ii) removing infrastructure bottlenecks, and (iii) better
utilizing the country's natural resources, including its geographic location.
In addition to the proposed project, projects under active consideration for
Bank lending are a second water supply project, which would support the reha-
bilitation of the water and sewerage systems in downtown Colon, Panama City
*          and smaller urban centers; an engineering project which would assist in the
assessment and preparation of a copper mining project (Cerro Colorado), a
development banking project as well as further development of the power sector
and livestock production.
17.       Both the USAID and the IDB have invested substantial amounts in
agriculture and social services (including family planning in the case of
USAID). Past lending patterns are likely to persist, at least as regards the
social services, because the Government prefers to borrow on concessionary
terms for these sectors, while utilizing other assistance for projects which
are expected to result in more immediate economic benefits. In addition to
agriculture and social services, the IDB is financing road construction,
industry and telecommunications, sectors in which it is likely to continue
lending. The IDB also participated with the Bank in the financing of
the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project, is financing a rural electrification
program and is expected to cooperate with the Bank and other sources in
financing the preparation of the Cerro Colorado copper mining project. USAID
expects to concentrate its efforts on manpower training and projects oriented
toward environmental protection. USAID is also lending for alternative
sources of energy (other than petroleum).
18.       The Bank's share of Panama's publicly guaranteed external debt out-
standing and disbursed was 5.8 percent at the end of 1980 and the Bank's
share of public external debt service was estimated at 3.7 percent in 1980.
These percentages are expected to increase slightly in the 1980's.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
The Transport System
19.       Panama, a long, narrow country, is divided lengthwise by mountain
ranges and across by the Panama Canal. As a result, the country has developed
along two main axes: one along the Canal and the other along the lands on
the Pacific Coast, particularly in the western part of the country. To the
east of the Canal lies the relatively unexplored region of the Darien.
Except for the sparsely-populated Caribbean coast and the Darien where air
travel and coastal shipping are the only means of transportation, Panama's
domestic traffic is basically moved over highways (97 percent of freight
and 99 percent of passengers). The most important international transport
facilities, in addition to the Panama Canal itself, are the Omar Torrijos
International Airport at Tocumen near Panama City, the ports on the Canal,
and the Pan-American Highway.



- 6 -
20.       The metropolitan region (adjacent to the canal) accounts for
about 70 percent of the country's GDP and thus plays a dominant role in
the country's economy. Growth in the economy of this region is focused
on exports of light manufactured goods, particularly from the Free Zone
in Colon. Efficient cargo movement through the major ports of Balboa and
Cristobal is an important requirement for this growth.
21.       Public investments in the transport sector accounted for 22 percent
of the total public investment in 1970-73, but only 15 percent in 1974-80.
Road investments accounted for the major portion (62 percent) of transport
investments in the past decade with airports accounting for 21 percent and
ports 17 percent.  The transport system in Panama is now considered broadly
adequate for the economic activity in the country.
22.       The Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy (MIPPE) is responsible
for overall coordination and planning for the sector as there is no ministry
of transport. While this system may have certain advantages in Panama, MIPPE
has not, so far, carried out the coordinating role effectively, nor is it
organized to do so because it does not have the necessary staff or appropriate
data. The Office of Sectoral Planning within MIPPE is being reorganized to
enable it to coordinate sectoral planning and budgeting, and this effort is
being supported by the Road Rehabilitation Project (Loan No. 2020-PAN of
July 24, 1981).
Highways
23.       Panama's highway network totals some 8,400 km, of which about
2,700 km are paved, 3,20Q km gravelled and 2,500 km are earth feeder roads.
This network is the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works, which
has about 6,500 employees. Road development has been concentrated, in the
last decade, on paving and improving the roads with more heavy traffic. While
the overall road system grew by 25 percent between 1969 and 1980, the paved
and gravel road networks grew by almost 77 percent and 167 percent respectively.
24.       Total freight traffic increased by 5.6 percent annually in the
period between 1970 and 1980, from 590 million ton-km to 1,015 million ton-km,
and, in the same period, total passenger traffic grew by 6.5 percent annually
from 2,956 million passenger-km to 5,531 million passenger-km.
Aviation
25.       International passenger traffic is handled almost entirely by the
Bank-financed Tocumen (Omar Torrijos) International Airport, which in 1981
served almost one million international passengers. Capacity of this airport
is currently underutilized, and with good airline scheduling no further expan-
sion should be required in the near future. Twelve foreign carriers operate
combined passenger and cargo services, and six carriers offer all-cargo
services. There are two Panamanian carriers in the international business:
the Government-owned Air Panama and the privately-owned Compania Panamena de
Aviacion.



-7-
Railways
26.       Since the completion of the Canal, railways have not played a
significant role in transportation in Panama. There are three small railway
companies with a total of about 400 km of route: The Panama Canal Railway
(PCR); the Chiriqui Land Company Railway, which is integrated into the
Standard Brands banana production system; and the Chiriqui National Railway,
which is gradually being phased out and has only 30 km of track remaining.
The most important of the three is PCR, the ownership of which recently
reverted to Panama and has been under the management of APN, although a
separate railway authority is being established.  In 1980, PCR carried about
450,000 passengers and about 100,000 tons of cargo between Panama City and
Colon. Passenger traffic has been steadily decreasing while freight traffic
has remained fairly constant. A British consulting firm has carried out a
study of the railway with a view more clearly to define its future role.
Pipeline
27.       A 130-km trans-isthmian pipeline to transport mainly Alaskan crude
to the eastern seabord of the United States is under construction.  This
pipeline should reduce congestion in the Panama Canal and reduce oil shipping
cost. It will not affect domestic transport demand and will be financially
self-supporting.
The Maritime Subsector
28.       Total cargo volumes handled by all the ports in Panama are large; in
1980 traffic amounted to about 46.1 million tons, but most of this consisted
of oil transshipped at two special facilities in the western part of the
country, while only 2.1 million tons was general cargo.
29.       The main feature of the maritime subsector is the Panama Canal.
Built early in this century, the Canal receives about 13,000 ocean-going and
4,000 small vessels per year, or about 46 vessels per day. Because of their
central location on one of the world's main ocean routes, the Canal ports of
Balboa (on the Pacific coast) and Cristobal (on the Atlantic) receive a larger
number of ship calls than most other ports in the world, but these calls are
often just to collect bunker fuel, and combined total general cargo volumes at
both ports are quite small (about 850,000 tons in 1981). About 900,000 tons
of dry cargo are handled at the three other ports of Almirante, Puerto Armuelles
and Bahia Las Minas. Coco Solo Norte, a former US Navy base facing Cristobal
on the Atlantic entrance to the Canal, can conveniently serve Colon and its
Free Zone. The naval base has fallen into disrepair but the port's basic
structures are still sound. Very little use is made of this port at present.
Five minor port facilities (Colon Muelle 3, Folks River, Aguadulce, Pedregal
and Darien) combined handle about 300,000 tons per year.
30.       The majority of the general cargo is, therefore, handled at Balboa
and Cristobal and this traffic is expected to increase at an average rate of
about five percent per year. Both ports have adequate berth space to accom-
modate projected increase in traffic. Containerization of cargo has rapidly
increased in recent years. In 1975 only 10 percent of Cristobal's cargo
tonnage was shipped in containers, while in 1981 53 percent was containerized;
the number of containers increased at an average rate of 29 percent to about



-8-
33,000 in 1981. Lack of specialized facilities and equipment for handling
containers in Cristobal constrains handling efficiency. Balboa has two
container handling cranes and a higher proportion (60 percent) of its traffic
is containerized. This equipment is considered adequate to handle projected
traffic. The port also includes a ship repair facility, which APN is
reactivating through a concession agreement with an experienced French-
Panamanian firm.
31.       The main institution in the port subsector is APN.  APN was formed
in 1974 and was given the power to plan, design, build, operate and improve
all national ports, and to set and collect tariffs as well as contract loans.
The basic law of APN was formed with the advice of an UNCTAD expert on port
administration and is satisfactory. APN has a strong Executive Committee
comprising the Minister of Commerce and Industry (Chairman), the Ministers
of Public Works, Finance and Planning, as well as one representative each from
the port workers and the port users.
32.       The staff of APN has grown rapidly since its formation; in the
initial stages of the first Port Project (Loan No. 1114-PAN of May 27, 1975)
the institution employed less than 100 people, a figure which reflected
both the relatively small volumes of traffic handled and the fact that the
general management philosophy was based on running the port operations through
various concession agreements. The staff has now increased to almost 4,000
people mainly because Balboa and Cristobal were added to APN's responsibilities
in 1979, and in these ports APN employees (as opposed to concessionaires) carry
out most port operations.
33.       The current organization of APN includes the appropriate range of
operating and advisory departments. The main problem with the organization
is that too many of these departments, as well as individuals, (about 25),
report directly to the Director General--who, therefore, is involved excessively
in day-to-day operations. APN is also short of trained staff and productivity
has to be increased, and accounting and management systems have to. be improved.
In conjunction with the execution of the proposed project, APN plans to carry
out a reorganization which will group the divisions into five directorates
encompassing the major groupings of activities. This plan is sound and would
be reinforced by additional action including: hiring of additional technical
staff; appointment of an Operations Director (Section 4.05 of the draft Loan
Agreement); improvements in finance and accounting; improvements in management
procedures; and staff training. The proposed project includes components for
technical assistance and for training APN's staff.
Bank Assistance to the Sector
34.       The Bank, to date, has helped finance six projects in the transport
sector in Panama and it served as the Executing Agency for the UNDP-financed
National Transport Survey which was completed in 1974. The Bank's first
operation (Loan No. 123-PAN), in 1955, involved a loan of US$5.0 million for
roads. The second operation (Loan No. 264-PAN), in 1960, involved a loan of
US$7.2 million for the construction of ten feeder roads. The third (Loan No.
783-PAN), in 1971, was a loan of US$20.0 million to the Civil Aviation Authority
to help finance the construction of a new runway and terminal at Tocumen (Omar
Torrijos) International Airport. The fourth (Loan No. 1114-PAN), in 1975, was



-9-
a loan of US$24.0 million for the construction of a new fishing port at
Vacamonte. The Bank's fifth loan, in 1978, (US$12.0 million Loan No. 1565-PAN)
helps finance a highway maintenance project. A sixth loan (US$19.0 million
Loan No. 2020-PAN of July 24, 1981) assists in financing Panama's Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program. These last two projects are still
under implementation. In addition, the Colon Urban Development Project
(US$35.0 million Loan No. 1878-PAN of August 7, 1980) includes components for
the widening of a road serving the Colon metropolitan area, container storage
facilities for the port of Cristobal, a bus terminal for the City of Colon,
and a study of urban transport management, railway personnel training and the
completed study of APN organization. This latter will assist in APN's reorga-
nization (para 33 above).
35.       Loan No. 1114-PAN for the construction of the fishing port at
Vacamonte was the Bank's first operation in the port subsector and its first
loan to APN, the Borrower for the proposed project. There was minor delay in
inviting bids for civil works. Only one bid was received (from a Japanese
firm) and according to Panamanian law this necessitated rebidding. The same
contractor was again the sole bidder and was awarded the contract in August
1976. The rebidding process resulted in a seven-month delay. During construc-
tion, damage to the breakwater due to abnormally high waves, its repair, and
problems with the supply of reinforced concrete caused additional delay. With
energetic efforts on the part of APN, the contractor and the consultants it
was possible to complete the project less than a year behind schedule.
However, this delay coupled with the appreciation of the Japanese yen vis-a-
vis the US dollar resulted in a 36 percent cost overrun. In addition, unfore-
seeable developments in the international tuna fishing industry have reduced
the anticipated benefits from the tuna transshipment component. The economic
rate of return is now estimated at 10 percent as against the appraisal estimate
of 15 percent. The institutional improvements aimed at were fully realized.
The Project Completion Report was issued in June 1981.
36.       In agreement with the Government, the Bank's current strategy for
the transport sector focuses on projects which:
(a) support the internationally oriented service sector in the
Metropolitan Region;
(b) capitalize on and support the initiative of the private sector;
(c) avoid heavy capital investment;
(d) preserve or extend the useful life of existing facilities;
(e) emphasize the best use of existing capacity through improved
pricing, maintenance, operational and management practices; and
(f) are financially self-supporting either directly through
tariffs, or indirectly through sectoral tax policies.
The proposed project reflects this strategy.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.       The proposed project is based upon findings of a study of the develop-
ment prospects for the country's main ports, including a twenty year Master Plan
study of the ports of Balboa, Cristobal and Coco Solo Norte, and a fender
systems study for these ports, carried out by consultants: Tippetts, Abbett,
McCarthy and Stratton (TAMS, USA) in association with Lopez-Moreno (Panama)
and R. R. Nathan Associates (USA). The project basically consists of the
high priority investments identified.
38.       The project was appraised by missions in March and September 1981,
and March 1982. Staff Appraisal Report No. 3481b entitled "Staff Appraisal
Report-Second Port Project" dated May 21, 1982 is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in Washington in April/May
1982, and the Panamanian delegation was led by Mr. Aristides Valdonedo, Director
General of APN.
Project Objectives and General Description
39.       The basic objective of the proposed project is to assist APN in
meeting the challenges created by the provisions of the 1978 Canal Treaty
under which the international ports of Balboa and Cristobal, and Coco Solo
Norte were reverted to Panama and are now operated by APN.  Specifically,
the project represents the first five year investments for Cristobal and
Coco Solo Norte in the Master Plan and is designed to:
(a) rehabilitate and make the most economical use of the reverted
port facilities at Cristobal and Coco Solo Norte;
(b) support the immediate investment requirements, particularly
those needed to deal with the rapidly expanding volume of
container traffic; and
(c) strengthen APN as an institution so that it may fully
meet its expanded responsibilities.
40.       The physical components of the project would consist of improvement,
strengthening and extension of existing wharves and piers and provision of
container cranes at Cristobal and rehabilitation of the port of Coco-Solo Norte.
Technical assistance and training to improve port operation and administration
would also be provided.
Project Description
41.       Cristobal:  The project would ease container handling in the conven-
tional berths at Piers Nos. 7 and 8, and provide specialized, efficient container
handling berths at Piers Nos. 9 and 10. The civil works proposed for the conven-
tional berths would provide a better traffic flow as a result of repairs made to
the piers and transit sheds and paving and improvements to the road access. For
the container cargo handling berths, the civil works proposed would strengthen
and extend the existing wharves, provide a Roll-on/Roll-off (Ro-Ro) ramp and



- 11 -
dismantle and remove existing transit sheds to allow efficient movement of
containers from shipside to the paved container storage area (being constructed
under Loan 1878-PAN). Container handling equipment, consisting of two gantry
cranes for Wharf No. 10, chassis trailers and other items for use within the
port would permit speedier and more efficient handling of container cargo.
42.       Coco Solo Norte:  The project would upgrade the port both for general
cargo and Ro-Ro traffic. Works would include dredging alongside the piers,
repairs to existing head quay, finger piers and berthing structures, addition
of new fender systems, paving of open storage areas, installation of a bunker-
ing system, construction of a central administration building and additions and
improvements to service roads and provision of utilities. The northern side of
the port would be rehabilitated and the paving of the piers extended, existing
transit sheds repaired and derelict buildings removed. The southern side would
be converted to accomodate Ro-Ro traffic, including the removal of minor
structures, extension of the paving of the pier and provision of paved open
areas for container storage and installation of a gate house and a weighbridge.
43.       Training and Technical Assistance:  The training component would consist
of providing training equipment, fellowships, expatriate training specialists
and local training instructors. APN's training capability would be improved and
three years of its five-year training plan for port administration, operation and
maintenance would be executed. Detailed training programs, involving 54 man-months
of expatriate and 96 man-months of local expertise, were agreed at negotiations.
The technical assistance component would provide about 68 man-months of advisory
services to improve data processing and records management; payroll, budgeting,
costing, accounting, inventories, equipment maintenance and materials systems;
and procurement and personnel procedures. Engineering and supervision would
involve about 326 man-months.
Project Execution
44.       The project would be executed by APN, assisted by consultants, over
a period of three and one-half years. Consultants have been hired with Bank
concurrence to carry out the detailed engineering, preparation of bid documents
and bid evaluation. Consultants for supervision of construction would be hired
by November 1982. The project would be completed by the end of 1985.
APN's Financial Situation
45.       Until 1981 APN had earned a profit in all years since its creation.
However, since 1979 its profitability declined because of increasing expenses
on the Canal Ports, interest costs and having responsibility for PCR. After a
year of experience with the Canal ports, APN increased port tariffs in late 1980
which increased revenues by about 28% during 1981. However, due to general cost
increases, the net income from port operations was not sufficient to offset the
increased losses of PCR and interest cost. As a result APN incurred a net-loss
of about $1.7 million in 1981. Under the terms of the Canal Treaty, Panama is
required to maintain PCR in good operating condition until the year 2000. Start-
ing in 1982, and until PCR ceases to be under the operational responsibility of
APN (para 26 above), the Government would provide APN with sufficient funds to
meet the operating cash deficit of the railway (Section 3.02 of the draft
Guarantee Agreement).



- 12 -
46.       APN needs to increase revenues to meet rising operating costs and
contribute to the cost of APN's development programs. In order to meet its
financial targets and recover a share of the benefits accruing to port users,
APN plans to review its operating costs and the structure and level of its
tariffs at least once every two years. The first such review would be completed
in time to introduce tariff adjustments by January 1983 to provide additional
operating revenues of about 15%.
47.       Financial projections indicate that with the above mentioned tariff
increase, and with projected tariff adjustments at two-year intervals, APN
would be able to make the required contribution to the project, meet its debt
service obligations, and still have sufficient funds to allow for needed
increases in working capital. In addition, APN will be contributing funds to
the port component of the Colon Urban Development Project. During project
implementation, APN's other investments would not exceed US$1.9 million
equivalent in FY 1983 and US$1.5 million equivalent in any fiscal year there-
after without Bank approval (Section 5.07(a) of the draft Loan Agreement).
The relatively heavy investment program will increase APN's debt service
obligations and borrowing should be monitored carefully during project imple-
mentation. APN would not incur, before completion of the proposed project,
without Bank approval, any long-term debt (maturity after more than one year)
if the debt service ratio falls below 2 (Section 5.06 (a) of the draft Loan
Agreement).
48.       The Government's policy is that APN should be financially self-
sufficient. Profitability targets will have to be defined initially in terms
of working ratios, since APN's fixed asset values do not include the facilities
at the Canal Ports and, thus, costs are underestimated as they do not include
depreciation on these assets. Since October 1979 APN has been in charge of
port areas and port facilities, including buildings, installations and equip-
ment by law. According to the Panamanian constitution, port areas are
public domain the ownership of which cannot be transferred to any public or
private agency. The Government is in the process of transferring to APN the
custody of the port areas and the ownership of all port buildings, installa-
tions and equipment operated by APN. These transfers would be completed by
June 30, 1983 (Section 3.05 of the draft Loan Agreement). APN would value all
its fixed assets and, by December 31, 1984, record them in its books. There-
after APN would revalue its fixed assets at least once every three years
according to methods satisfactory to the Bank (Sections 5.04 (a) and (b) of
the draft Loan Agreement). Starting in 1985, when all APN's assets are
properly accounted for, APN would adjust its rates and charges from time to
time in order that it would achieve a rate of return in any fiscal year of at
least 8 percent on its average net fixed assets in operation. In the interim
tariffs would be adjusted to achieve a schedule of financial objectives, based
on working ratios (Section 5.05(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
49.       Total project cost is estimated at US$48.3 million equivalent
including contingencies, the front-end fee and US$4.5 million of taxes and
duties, with a foreign exchange component of US$28.8 million. Cost estimates
for civil works are based on detailed engineering and unit prices for ongoing



- 13 -
civil works in Panama; those for mechanical equipment are based on recent
quotations and purchases. Average consultant services costs for technical
assistance, inclusive of air fares and subsistence, are estimated at about
US$9,600 per man-month, for training $4,300 per man-month, while that for
engineering and supervision would be about US$5,500 per man-month.
50.       The proposed loan of US$24.4 million represents about 50 percent
of total project cost and would finance about 85 percent of the foreign
exchange cost. UNDP has agreed in principle to provide US$0.3 million equiva-
lent to finance technical assistance and detailed engineering. The Government
would contribute US$8.8 million equivalent, and APN US$14.8 million equivalent
to the project cost.  The Government would provide its contribution on a loan
basis, with repayment to commence after project completion and geared to APN's
profitability.
Procurement and Disbursement
51.       The project civil works are expected to be executed under three basic
contracts. Two (one for each port) to be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding (ICB), in accordance with Bank guidelines, while the third
contract to cover the demolition of the transit and freight sheds at Cristobal,
estimated to cost about US$700,000 equivalent, would be under local competitive
bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. Prequalification will be required
for civil works contracts under ICB estimated to cost US$500,000 equivalent or
more each. Equipment would also be procured on the basis of ICB. Contracts
for goods estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent each, but not
exceeding US$1.4 million in the aggregate, may be procured under local competi-
tive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for the advisory
services and engineering consultants for preparation of detailed engineering,
bid documents and bid evaluation were completed prior to negotiations upon
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
52.       Disbursement for the project civil works would be on the basis of
45 percent of total expenditures, those for equipment procurement on the basis
of 86 percent of foreign expenditures. For consulting services and technical
assistance, disbursement would be on the basis of 63 percent of total expendi-
tures and for training, on the basis of 43 percent of total expenditures.
Retroactive financing of up to US$200,000 equivalent in respect of consultants'
services would be made. Disbursements, which would be made under normal
documentation, are expected to be completed by the end of 1986.
.Monitoring
53.       The proposed project would assist in improving APN's productivity and
cost effectiveness. Targets indicating the effectiveness of the port operations
have been developed, and the aci.ievement of these targets would be regularly
monitored during project implementation.



- 14 -
Benefits and Risks
54.       The main benefits of the project would be increased efficiency of
the operation of the project ports resulting in reductions in labor, main-
tenance and operation costs, savings in ship service time and reductions in
shipping costs, recapture of lost transshipment business, increases in APN's
revenues, employment generation, mainly in the Free Zone in Colon, and improve-
ments in APN's management and operations. The economic rate of return for the
Cristobal component is estimated at 25 percent and for Coco Solo Norte, 24 per-
cent.  The overall economic rate of return of the proposed project is estimated               *
at 25 percent.
55.       The project is less than usually dependent on general traffic growth
and is thus reasonably well insulated from the current world economic stagnation.
A risk analysis, covering variations in costs of execution, timing, and capture
of benefits gave an 80% probability of an ERR above 17Z. One specific case
assuming a 50% cost overrun, all benefits delayed one year, and the benefits
from ship waiting time reductions and transshipment earnings halved still gives
an ERR of 12%. The chances of such a low rate of return occurring are calculated
at less than 2%. The project does not involve any unusual risk.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
56.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and APN, the draft Guarantee
Agreement between the Republic of Panama and the Bank and the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement are being distributed separately. Special conditions of the loan
are listed in Section III of Annex III.
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

NOTES
/a   The group averages for each indicator are population-weighted arithmetic means. Coverage of countries
among the indicators depends on availability of data and is not uniform.
/b   Unless otherwise noted, data for 1960 refer to any year between 1959 and 1961; for 1970, between 1969
and 1971; and for Most Recent Estimate, between 1976 and 1979.
/c   1963;  /d The primary and secondary enrollment ratio in 1978 are too low and too high, respectively,
since a partial change to eight years "basic school allocated too many students from the primary to
secondary track. The data are now being adjusted to reflect the new system.

C. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION (as of March 31, 1982) I/
Loan 1280:     Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$12 Million Loan of
June 9, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: July 15, 1976;
Closing Date: July 30, 1982.
Project execution has been slower than estimated at appraisal due in part
to changes in the management of the Borrower (IDAAN). As a result of the changes,
there were delays in the selection of the consultants to carry out the engineer-
ing of the Colon treatment plant and the rehabilitation of the Chorrera treatment
plant, the largest components of the project. Construction of all project
components started during 1978 and is proceeding well, and no further delays
are expected. Improvements in the accounting and commercial systems have been
carried out: asset inventory and valuation has been completed and the billing
and collection system improved. IDAAN has been financially sound largely as a
result of substantial increases in water rates in 1976 and 1977. In addition,
IDAAN recently modified its tariff structure and increased its rates.
Loan 1397:    Second Livestock Development Project; US$8 Million Loan of
April 28, 1977; Date of Effectiveness: February 1, 1978;
Closing Date: August 31, 1982.
After a slow start progress is picking up. Changes in the milk legisla-
tion required in connection with the project involve a modification in the
method of determining milk grade and thus'the price paid to producers: the
grade of milk is now determined by the standard of on-farm buildings. The
modified legislation will require that producers be paid according to the
quality of milk produced. The legislation was approved in 1978 and the Govern-
ment is taking steps to ensure its implementation scheduled for 1982. In 1981,
the Bank agreed to modify the livestock breeding farm component which was to be
carried out in an autonomous state farm that has now become part of a military
base; it is now being carried out in five different research extension farms
of the Ministry of Agriculture. Action is also being taken to hire consultants
to implement staff training and assist with implementation of the new milk
pricing legislation. Loan commitments are behind appraisal estimates due to
delays in commitments in 1977, the year of the Canal Treaty ratification.
However, as of March 31, 1982 about 45 percent of project funds had been
disbursed. The Loan is expected to be fully committed by end-1982 and dis-
bursed by end-1984.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 1470:      Fourth Power (Fortuna Hydroelectric) Project:  US$42 Million
Loan of July 1, 1977; Date of Effectiveness: February 8, 1978;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1983.
All major contracts have been awarded. The underground civil works, financed
by the IDB, have suffered delays in the excavation work partly resulting from un-
foreseen geological problems in the tunnels and underground cavern. The project
is now expected to be completed in April 1985 with a delay of some 24 months.
Construction of the dam, which is now expected to be completed in October 1982,
is proceeding without major problems, albeit with a delay of about 6 months.
Procurement of equipment and transmission is proceeding without problems. There
will be an increase in the project cost because of the longer construction period
and the changes in the power house design due to the geological problems
encountered. Efforts are also being made to resolve existing organizational and
managerial problems.
Loan 1565:      Highway Maintenance Project:  US$12 Million Loan of June 30,
1978; Date of Effectivness: October 2, 1978; Closing Date:
March 31, 1983.
The project started about one year behind schedule due to delays in field-
ing a team of consultants, instead of a consulting firm, as a consequence of a
change in government policy. A group of seven experts is now working in Panama
in two pilot provinces. Procurement of maintenance equipment and spare parts
is underway and project is now progressing steadily, though slower than planned.
Nationwide implementation of standard maintenance procedures and a new maintenance
management system started in 1981, following testing in two pilot provinces.
Procurement of maintenance equipment and mechanics tools is complete. Programs
for overhauling equipment and procuring spare parts are underway. Additional
assistance on equipment and workshop management has been included under
Loan 2020-PAN.
Loan 1641:      Development Banking Project:  US$15 Million Loan of January 23,
1979; Date of Effectiveness: September 25, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982.
The loan only became effective on September 25, 1979 because of delays in
obtaining Government guarantees covering COFINA's exposure in several enter-
prises in excess-of the Iimits stipulated in COFINA's Policy Statement. The
problem has been resolved and implementation is progressing satisfactorily. The
Loan is now fully committed.
Loan 1672:      Tropical Tree Crop Development Project:  US$19 Million Loan of
April 25, 1979; Date of Effectiveness: July 25, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
The coffee and cocoa components are proceeding satisfactorily. The banana
component has suffered delays because of a change in management in one of the key
implementing organizations, the Banana Corporation of the Pacific (COBAPA) which
led to a deterioration of its finances and technical capability. The Ministry
of Agriculture has assumed responsibility for the banana component and plans to
provide a solution to existing problems are being discussed with the Ministry.
Progress of the component will be closely monitored.

Loan 1778:     Fifth Power Project:  US$23 Million Loan of January 30,
1980; Date of Effectiveness: April 22, 1980; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
Procurement and implementation are proceeding on schedule.
Loan 1878:     Colon Urban Development Project:  US$35 Million Loan of
August 7, 1980; Date of Effectiveness: August 14, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily except for the housing
component. The site originally selected for part of the component does not meet
with the beneficiaries' preference. An alternate site has been selected and
work is expected to progress steadily.
Loan 1954:     Energy Planning and Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project:
US$6.5 Million Loan of April 23, 1981; Date of Effectiveness:
July 21, 1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
After initial delay appointment of consultants has progressed and some of
them are already in the field.
Loan 1955:       Second Development Banking Project; US$20 Million Loan of
April 22, 1981; Date of Effectiveness: July 21, 1981;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Progress of this project is satisfactory. There is active demand from
entrepreneurs and commitments are expected to be completed by the end of 1982.
Loan 2020:     Road Rehabilitation Project; US$19 Million Loan of July 24, 1981;
Date of Effectiveness: October 13, 1981; Closing Date:
December 31, 1985.
Due to initial delays resulting from a change of the Ministry of
Public Works' management, the project is about a year behind schedule. Detailed
engineering for the first year's roadworks is now almost complete. Contractors
have been prequalified and bids are being prepared for four road sections.
Consultants' proposals for technical assistance to the equipment maintenance
service are being evaluated and a program of expanding vehicle weight control
has been started. Generally, the project is now progressing satisfactorily.
