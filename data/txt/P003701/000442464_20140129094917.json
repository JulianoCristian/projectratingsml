outcomes were satisfactory, risk\n            to global environment outcome was low or negligible, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: while the\n            project only became effective in February 1995, initial\n            target December 1997 for ODS phase-out which was established\n            by the country was unrealistic despite the Montreal protocol\n            targeting ODS phase out for developing country only in 2010.\n            The main selection criteria was simply eligibility and the\n            use of ODS in the enterprise's production. From the\n            experiences of the early phase of the program, it was found\n            that arrangement of the sector specific workshop was the\n            most effective way to reach the enterprises. The sector plan\n            approach had helped the country to have the overall picture\n            and to determine appropriate strategy on how to address the\n            remaining consumption within specific sector. Appointment of\n            individual professional who has a good network and\n            relationship with private sector, as a group coordinator\n            (GC) had helped the project management unit (PMU) and\n            Kementrian Lingkungan Hidup (KLH) achieve the implementation\n            of ODS phase out program effectively and in efficient manner."}, "docdt": "2012-01-06T00:00:00Z"}
