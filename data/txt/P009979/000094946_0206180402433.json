Lessons highlight the\n            importance of implementing legislative actions prior to loan\n            effectiveness, and, the Bank should ensure that sector\n            policy, and reform objectives are recorded in a formal\n            Letter of Development Policy, regardless whether or not,\n            there is an apparent commitment to sector reforms by the\n            government. Furthermore, the Bank should not underestimate\n            the magnitude of resistance by trade unions and the\n            difficulties this brings along to staff, corporate\n            management, and the government itself, nor the time required\n            to develop sufficient consensus, needed to address\n            structural changes in large organizations requiring major\n            staff reduction. Similarly, the Bank should not rely on\n            studies and expected implementation of their recommendations\n            as part of conditionality, an approach by nature too vague,\n            difficult to manage, and almost impossible to enforce.\n            Additionally, in order to ensure commitment and full\n            implementation of technical assistance components, clearly\n            defined terms of reference, agreed during appraisal, should\n            be ensured by the Bank prior to negotiations. As for the\n            lending instrument, investment loans are poorly suited to\n            support long-term sectoral reforms; had an adjustable\n            program loan been available at project design, effective\n            gradual support to sector policy changes would have\n            minimized risks and costs, securing incremental\n            commercialization, and progressive closure of loss making activities."}, "docdt": "2002-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
