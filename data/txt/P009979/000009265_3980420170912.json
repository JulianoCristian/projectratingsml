 Rehabilitation Project are to support India's current\n            market-oriented reforms in the coal sector and,\n            specifically, to provide financial and technical support to\n            India's efforts to make itself commercially viable and\n            self sustaining. Underpinning India's broad drive to\n            achieve economic growth, the project also aims to increase\n            domestic supplies of coal. The project will consist of (a)\n            an investment component - high return and quick disbursing\n            investments to maintain or improve the profitability of the\n            24 existing mine sub-projects; and (b) an assistance and\n            training component - a study of the rules and regulations\n            governing the coal industry, in light of the\n            Government's decision to open up the coal sector to\n            private investors; and technical assistance to support\n            India's institutional capacity development in project\n            implementation and mining operations and management."}, "docdt": "1997-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
