is India's most important\n            source of commercial energy, currently meeting about\n            two-thirds of that country's energy needs. Over the\n            past two years, the government of India and Coal India have\n            implemented reforms aimed at making the coal industry\n            commercially viable and financially self-sustaining. The\n            primary objective of the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project\n            is to support this reform agenda and Coal India's\n            transformation into a commercial company whose operations\n            are environmentally and socially sustainable. In order for\n            the program to meet its long-term financial impact, it will\n            support investments in opencast and underground mining\n            operations that are projected to yield the highest economic\n            returns; provide technical assistance in support of the\n            program; and assist Coal India in mitigating the adverse\n            effects of mining operations on the environment and the\n            people directly affected by mining activities."}, "docdt": "1995-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
