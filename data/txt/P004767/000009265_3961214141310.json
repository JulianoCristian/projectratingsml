The main objective of the project was to increase\n            the gas supply capability of Thailand by: (a) expandingt he\n            gas transmissions ystem; (b) strengthening the institutional\n            effectiveness of Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT); and\n            (c) enabling Thailand to make a more efficient use of its\n            capital resources in the gas sector through annual reviews\n            of PTT's investment programs.  Bank's performance\n            was highly satisfactory. Borrower's performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (a)\n            in the Asian context support to national oil and gas\n            companies, to construct gas transmission systems helps\n            unbundle the sector, reduces the marketing risk for those\n            engaged in exploration, development and production of oil\n            and gas and thereby promotes private investment in such\n            upstream activities; (b) projects with a high degree of\n            ownership by the borrower succeed, especially when the Bank\n            focuses on identifying and managing possible risks to ensure\n            sustainability; (c) gas reserve and recovery level estimates\n            need to be reviewed and certified by external experts; (d)\n            Bank missions need to cover areas far beyond the traditional\n            project boundaries and work with a wide range of agencies\n            which translates into extra resources and time to address\n            adequately the Bank's environmental concerns; (e) the\n            use of the same Task Manager for appraisal and supervision\n            leads to greater efficiencies in Bank performance; (f) Bank\n            divisions dealing with public utilities need to have\n            adequate in-house financial expertise."}, "docdt": "1996-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
