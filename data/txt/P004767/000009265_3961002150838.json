transmission system; (b) strengthening the institutional\n            functioning of the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT);\n            and (c) making more efficient use of capital resources in\n            the gas sector through annual review of PTT's\n            investment program.  The project consists of the following\n            components: (1) a long submarine pipeline from the Bongkot\n            gas field to the existing Erawan production complex; (2) a\n            long submarine pipeline from Erawan to a terminal at Khanom;\n            (3) a new Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition and\n            telecom system and renovation of the existing system; (4) a\n            riser platform; (5) equipment including additional\n            compression capacity; (6) upgrading of PTT's Management\n            Information System and training of staff; and (7) a study\n            for preparation of safety and environmental standards, and a\n            study for the second pipeline."}, "docdt": "1992-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
