                             February 25 - March 1, 1989

                                    AIDE-MEMOIRE



1.   Introduction

1.1         A World Bank mission comprising Robert Mulligan (Highway Engineer)
from headquarters and C.S. Nawathe (Highway Engineer) from the New Delhi Office
visited Gujarat from February 25 through March 1 to supervise this project.

1.2         This Aide Memoire summarizes the mission's findings and discussions
with Government of Gujarat (GaG) officials. The conclusions and recommendations
recorded here, however, are subject to confirmation by the Bank.

1.3         The mission wishes to record its appreciation of the assistance
received from all concerned in GaG, and in particular for the arrangements made
for visiting project work sites. A list of officials met is at Annex 1.

2.   Background

2.1         Credit 1757 for SDR 101 million (US$ 119.6 million equivalent) ~as
signed on May 12, 1987, and became effective on August 27 of that year. The
project provides for:

       (a)   the construction, reconstruction or improvement of about J,040 ~m
             of village roads in seven districts of Gujarat wher-e the daily
             industry predominates;

       (b)   the procurement of road construction equipment to facilitate the
             implementation of (a) above;

       (c)   the construction     of   offices,    workshops,   and   other   project
             accommodation;

       (d)   technical assistance and engineering services for project management
             and training; and

       (e)   a Maintenance Planning Study and a road safety program.

3.   Civil Works

3.1         The unsatisfactory situations of contract execution and project
superVISIon described in the Aide-Memoire of the last highway mission (November
17-22, 1988) has markedly improved. The PWD has obtained from the Irrigation
Department a considerable amount of construction equipment suitable for road
works, and this has been deployed on a rental basis among the contractors who,
on the work sites visited, are putting it to good use. However, notwithstanding
this acquisition, there is still a short-fall in equipment requirements for the
                                        2

contractors such as.motor graders and compaction equipment; this shortfall will
be met by international procurement for which advertisements will appear in
"Development Forum" andthe local press on April 16, 1989 (Annex 2).

3.2          The mission noted that for several contracts where reconstruction/
improvement works were in progress, that the land needed to permit widening of
the formation had not been acquired and that the contractors had either completed
or were working on the rehabilitation of the carriageway. With the carriageway
works completed resulting in a pavement of much better quality than encountered
before on a rural road, the local villagers would consider that they had got what
they wanted without giving the land needed to construct the side slopes and
drainage needed to complete the road works properly. Consequently, the mission
recommends that no contracts be started until the land needed to complete the
road as planned and in a proper construction sequence, is available.

3.3          The mission further noted that on some roads, pipe culverts were
being installed under low embankments.     To obtain sufficient protective cover
over the pipe, it was being semi-submerged below surrounding ground level, thus
effecti vely halving its hydraulic capacity. In such situations where large cross
flows are not anticipated, the mission recommends that a pipe culvert not be
installed and instead that a paved drift or depression in the road be built to
accommodate the cross flow.

3.4         Th~ sand sub-base layer of the pavement is a source of problems for
contractors as, although this layer is stable at the moisture content. of
compaction, it is in a dry state when the next pavement layer is placed on it
and can then be easily disturbed and lose shape. The mission recommended in the
last aide memoire that sand be blended with murram to provide a stable sub-base
course and recommends this suggestion be adopted.

3.5          Other matters on which the mission commented were:

      (i)    the need for minor adjustments to alignments to improve longitudinal
             geometry in tortuous road sections;
        •
      (ii)   that the taking of borrow material directly adjacent to the edge of
             the road should be avoided as this practice results in poor drainage
             and, in some cases, permanently standing water;

      (iii) that experiments should continue in the placing and spreading of the
            water-bound macadam base course material, and that the height of the
            camber boards used to gauge the thickness of this layer should be
            increased to measure the loose as opposed to the compacted thickness;

      (iv)   that the gradation of the coarse fraction of the WBM should accord
             with the MOST specification detailed in para 404.2.5 (Grading No.
             2)   j


      (v)    that the trees standing in some of the road lines and around which
             the contractors are at present working, be removed without delay;
             and
~                                            3

           (vi)     that the poor quality of masonry work evidenced on some of the
                    culvert head walls not be accepted for payment until rectified.

           Progress

    3.6         Annex 3 shows project status for the period ending January 31, 1989.
    In brief, of the 1025 road jobs totalling 4042 kms covered under the project for
    construction/reconstruction/improvement and estimated to cost Rs. 1725 million,
    61 contracts comprising 264 jobs (769 km) have been finalised at a cost of Rs.
    180 million. Bidd~ng 69 packages comprising 233 jobs (1009 km) is under way.
    Upto January 31, 1989 work to the value of Rs. 86.8 million had been completed
    and reimbursement of 5.774 MSDR has been received.

    4.   Contract Supervision

                As far as contract superVISIon is concerned, the sites visited were
    adequately manned and had the equipment needed for their work as listed in the
    November aide-memoire. In consequence, the works were being properly set out,
    the means were available to monitor the moisture context of the material being
    compacted as well as assuring that the specified degree of compaction is
    obtained. All the transport needed for site staff has not yet been obtained,
    but the mission was assured that these needs would be met shortly through LCB
    procurement procedures financed under the project.

    5.   Land Acquisition

    5.1          The issue of the timely acquisition of land was raised by the
    November 1988 mission, when GOG detailed its arrangements for setting up
    acquisi tion teams in the three main districts to process all the individual
    cases. It is clear that availability of land is a present cause of delay, as
    evidenced on some current reconstruction/improvement works, and GOG is urged to
    deploy the staff detailed in the November aide-memoire without delay so that the
    award of contacts is not held up.

    6.   Buil9ings

    6.1          The November mission requested that a program for the construction
    of needed office/storage space be prepared for each district so that the
    necessary works can be put in hand by local contractors. This program has not
    yet been prepared. GOG is requested to review its requirements of office/storage
    space and prepare a program so that the facilities will be available for the
    administration of the road works.

    7.   Staffing

    7.1          Although the last mission and earlier missions had stressed the
    urgency for sanctioning all the field units identified in the appraisal report,
    GOG's reluctance to mobilise the full staff has been affecting project
    implementation.    Of the new 300 jobs budgeted during FY 88/89, detailed
    engineering has been completed for 214, but contracts could not be awarded for
    any of them. Out of the Rs. 170 million funds available during the year (FY
    88-89) the expenditure during the first 10 months is barely Rs. 54 million. Many
                                        4

works have not been started. No advance planning has been made to ~~dertake the
survey and detailed engineering of the works proposed to be includ'ed in the Fy
89-90 budget. Due to staff shortages project targets are not being met. If cost
and time overruns are to be avoided immediate action to sanction the staff
originally agreed is necessary.


8.    Studies

8.1          The Bar.oda-based consultant, ORG, provided the mission Hith a copy
of the February output of its computerized system for monitoring of the project.
The mission made a few minor suggestions which would enhance its use as a
management tool for GOB and as a basis for GOB's project reporting to the Bank,
but otherwise the system proposed appeared suitable for the purpose and easy for
field staff to interact with. Computerized progress reports for a particular
month would be available to project management by the middle of the following
month. ORG will continue to operate the system on behalf of GOB for the next
few months until any teething problems are eliminated and project staff are fully
conversant with its use.

8.2         The short list of consultants proposed by GOB to implement the
maintenance planning study provided for under the project was agreed by the Bank
and the mission understands that the letter of invitation to submit proposals
has been sent to the selected consultants. GaG's evaluation of the proposals,
when received, will be reviewed expeditiously by the Bank so that the selected
consultant can negotiate a contract with GaG and start work as soon as possible.


9.    Training

9.1          The status of training provides for under the project remains the
same as reflected in the November aide memoire.      The mission reiterates its
request that the earlier offer of the Australian Government to undertake field
training of selected project enquiries be taken up without delay. The experience
these of{icers would gain on the design and construction of low-cost roads would
be highly relevant to the project and could result in considerable economies in
pavement composition.   DEA is urged to give its early approval of these short
term (3-4 months) courses in that country so that the fullest advantage may be
taken of the practical results.

10.    Audit

10.1        The audit of project accounts for Gal's fiscal year 1987/88 has been
completed and the auditor's report was given to the mission.
