          This document records the discussion and findings of a mission to
Gujarat, but is not binding upon the Bank until confirmed in writing from
Washington.   During the visit the mlssion met Messrs. Kamdar (Secretary
R&B) , A.J. Trivedi (CE Roads), PV Patel (OSD PPM Cell) and the SE Road
Project Circle Gandhinagar and his staff.

2.       Since the mission's last visit to the project in February 1987,
the Superintending Engineer Road Project Circle, Gandhinagar, mainly
responsible for starting the works is transferred and is      to be
replaced by a full time S.E. Apart from this circle and three divisions
working under it no additl0nal posts are created.   There are many
important issues which require microplanning.   This is possible only if
undivided attention is given by the top man.   For this~ the level of
Superintending Engineer is not adequate.   Mr. Trivedi, the Chief Engineer
Roads, has multifarious responsibilities of the roads in the whole state
of G~jarat.   Being a very busy person, he cannot pay full attention to the
Rural Roads Project work.   Initially to put the project on the right
track, many important issues pertaining to the estimates, tender,
specifications, prequalifications and setting up of the monitoring system
are required to be settled.   Innovations and introduction of new ideas
involve great risks and the time will run out if one wants to take
chances.   It is from this point of view that the bank would request GOG to
establish a separate office of the Chief Engineer Rural Roads (World Bank
Project) without any further loss of time.   Simultaneously, GOG should
ensure that persons chosen to work in the W.E. project do not rotate too
frequently and that only those who can serve the project for full term (3
to 4 years) need be posted on the job.

3.       GOG intends to invite LCB tenders for the 11 packages as listed
in Appendix 1. For these packages contractors would be prequalified
following the procedure for concurrent prequalification.  Documents
prepared for this purpose were scrutinised.  These consisted of the draft
tender notice, the document for prequalification and the tender document
alongwith the detailed technical specifications.  The tender notice and
the document for prequalification were checked and cleared with the
following modifications:

                   the sale of the tender documents will not be restricted to
                   the contractors registered only in Gujarat, Maharashtra or
                   Central Government Departments but shall be open to all

               Indian Contractors or eligible Foreign firms.  Guidelines
               for procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits n~ed to
               be followed strictly;

               eligibility criteria should be specified in the
               prequalification document.

         This procedure shall be valid only for the eleven packages under
consideration.  For future tenders however, the contractors will be
prequalified much in advance.  Such prequalification shall be valid for a
period of 12 months or 50.  The prequalified contractors will be able to
bid for any civil work tenders invited during the period.

5.       As regards the tender document, GOG has new agreed to adopt the
MOT/IRe specifications with minimum changes necessitated due to local
conditions and, the consider-atiens on which the item rates in the
estimates are analysed.  Especially more attention will have to be paid
while estimating quantities of loose material involving higher void
percen     (than usually cunsidered in the GOG specifications~

6.       At the end of the visit, the mission was given a copy of the
ORG's draft proposals for technical ~ssistance for project monitoring.
The mission will send spearate comments on the proposals.
