                                    DRAFf AIDE MEMOIRE



1.    Introduction:


1.1   An International Development Association (IDA) mission comprising of Messrs. C.S.
      Nawathe (Highway Engineer) visited Gujarat from December 16 through 27 and K.N.
      Venkata Raman from 23 to 25, to carry out supervision of the above project. The mission
      held meetings with the Secretary and officials of the Roads & Buildings Department, and
      visited road works in five districts included in the project On its return to Delhi, the
      mission held meetings with officials of the Department of Economic Affairs, GOI, and
      Department of Rural Development.

1.2   This Aide M emoire summarizes the mission's findings and recommendations as discussed
      during the wrap-up meeting held with officials of the Government of Gujarat and
      subsequent meetings with DEA/DRD.

1.3   The mission records its appreciation for the assistance and warm reception received from
      all concerned, in particular for the arrangements made to visit work sites. A list of officials
      met is enclosed as Attachment 1.

2.    Back~round   :

2.1   Credit 1757-IN for 101 million SDR (US $ 119.6 million equivalent) was signed on May
      12, 1987, and provided for:

      i)     the construction, reconstruction or improvement of about 4040 kms of Rural roads
             in seven districts of Gujarat where the dairy industry predominates;
      ii)    the procurement of road construction equipment to facilitate the implementation of (i)
             above;
      iii)   the construction of offices, workshops and other project accommodations;
      iv)    technical assistance and engineering services for project management and training;
             and
      v)     Maintenance Planning Study and a Road Safety Program.

2.2   Although the project became effective on Aug 27,1987, it could not gather momentum till
      F. Y. 1989-90, due to initial financial constraints caused by three successive drought years.
      During the long gap between the appraisal and the slow start, some District Panchayats
      completed 116 roads totalling 375 km included in the project, reducing its scope to about
      3670 krns. However, since April 1990, GOG has been able to accelerate the pace of
      implementation by ensuring adequate flow of funds through its own resources and through
      NDDB's assistance. Due to this, the original program will be completed well before the
      date of project completion.
                                                 2


2.3    Unfortunately, because of the sharp decline in the value of the Rupee against the SDR, and
       because of the reduced scope as defined in the appraisal and the slow start, the project
       would not have utilized even half the Credit. Realizing this, GOG requested the March
       1991 IDA supervision mission to enlarge the scope of the project to include other districts
       of the state and to adjust the project to permit full use of the available Credit. As of date,
       the proposal envisages constructing of 8568 kms of roads costing Rs. 4800 millions and
       covering 13 districts; details of which are given in Table 1. The March 1991 IDA mission
       reviewed the proposal submitted by GOG, and, after satisfying that it was in tune with the
       content and original objectives of the project, agreed to recommend it for approval of the
       Bank Management.

 2.4   In the meantime, due to internal reorganization, the responsibility of the project
       management was temporarily transferred from the Infra-structure Division to the
       Agriculture Operation's Division. This, coupled with the transfer of concerned project
       officers in the Infrastructure Division, has affected the approval process. GOG had also
       delayed submission of proper implementation schedule taking into consideration the latest
       revised costs, domestic and foreign inflation and the changing interest rates. These details
       are now furnished but GOG has yet to furnish firm commitment on the signing of the
       contract for Management Planning Study and providing road maintenance budget at the
       level corresponding to the technical norms fixed by the Eighth Finance Commission. No
       sooner these are received, restructuring process would be finalized without further delays.

3.     Planning for New Additional Works:

 3.1   New roads selected in the 13 districts will conform to the same economic tests as the rest of
       the roads in the project as out lined in the SAR. However, for achieving greater impact
       within the limited resources, some precautions would be necessary.

 3.2   As villages located within 2 kms of the existing all weather roads have easy access to the
       road transport facilities, the mission recommends that any improvement jobs on road links
       shorter than 2 kms be given lowest priority in the future program. This would also be in
       tune with the main objective of the project to provide improved access to more backward
       areas of the state. The new program would also include some missing links and bridges
       which would improve the communication by shortening the travel time and distance to the
       main dairy establishments resulting in substantial reduction in transportation costs.

4.     Civil Works:

       Progress of the works:

4.1    By the end of Nov 1991, about 420 roads totalling more than 1590 kms have been
       completed and the state of progress in respect of other roads on hand (490 Nos. 2050 kms.)
       amounts to completion of 660 kms of roads. By the end of current financial year (March
       1992), about 2200 kms of road works would be completed. This would amount to 60% of
       the achievement compared to the original SAR targets. At this rate, and on the approval to
       revised scope of the adjusted project, the original SAR targets would be achieved by the end
       ofFY 94, as scheduled. Table 2 gives details of progress by the end of Nov 91.
                                               3


      Revised Implementation Schedule:

4.2   Considering that the level of funding would remain more or less constant, the whole
      program is recast and revised implementation schedules are prepared. The revised
      implementation schedule is given in Table 3. The credit would be utilized by end of March
      1997. By then, road works would be completed in 7500 kms. at the cost of Rs,4200 M.
      By them the road works would be completed in 7500 kms at the cost of Rs,4200 M.

      Administrative Approval (AA), Technical Sanction (TS)    :

4.3   A total programme of 3667 kms have been given AA and TS for Rs. 1498 millions. In
      addition, in anticipation of the Bank's approval to the revised scope of the project, GOG
      has already included a program totalling Rs. 490 Millions for constructing 1362 kms of
      road works, in the State's annual budget for FY 91-92. Of this, plans & estimates are
      ready for 400 kms of the works. GOG is awaiting the Bank's formal approval to the
      restructuring before giving AA and TS to these works.

4.4   The R&B Department has already opened 1 circle, 6 divisions and 22 sub divisions to
      handle the program of 1400 kms in the 4 new districts covered under the expanded scope of
      the project, while the three existing circles will be responsible for 3500 kms of additional
      roads in the 9 districts including the 6 districts covered in the SAR, and along with the
      works, already in progress.

Procurement Status:

      Road Works

4.5   Procurement has been completed for 235 packages corresponding to 892 jobs, 3627 kms
      (821 kms New construction, 1029 kms Re-construction and 1817 kms Improvement) for a
      total amount ofRs. 1478 million. Procurement is in progress for 4 packages, covering 17
      jobs, 40 kms for a total amount of Rs. 13 million.

4.6   Contract awards concluded after March 1, 1991 for 40 packages totalling Rs,430 millions,
      were reviewed in the NDO and were cleared and no objection was given for disbursement
      of eligible payments under these contracts.

4.7   The Association guidelines are generally being followed in the procurement of civil works,
      goods and services. However, many engineers and Accounts staff are not fully conversant
      with them or they carry out the procedures without proper understanding. Therefore, a
      Workshop was held on December 24, 1991 to acquaint the field officers connected with the
      project, the procurement procedures and access their views on the bidding documents and
      other documentation.

4.8   The mission reviewed the proposals for grouping of works into packages with a view to
      ensure that all contiguous works are grouped into the same compact packages, large enough
      to attract competent contractors. The mission was happy to note that most of the larger
      packages, awarded at the beginning of this year, are progressing extremely well, and many
      of them might be completed before their schedule dates of completion.

4.9   Due to the uncertainty following the Gulf war crisis, bids with premiums ranging from 30%
                                                4

       to 60% above had to be accepted. However, the situation is now stabilized and the
       Department does not anticipate any problems of higher bids in the near future.

       Prequalifications of contractors:

4.10 To ensure better performance and higher quality of works, the prequalifications criteria have
     been revised and incorporated in the PQ documents. The applicant would be prequalified
     based on the revised criteria and bids would be invited from the prequalified contractors
     only. The revised criteria now specifies:

              a minimum annual financial turn-over;
              satisfactory completion of works (from start to fmish) of similar nature;
              execution of minimum quantity of critical items of work;
              minimum number of critical equipment;
              availability of project manager with minimum experience of similar works; and
              that prequalified contractors would be awarded works only to the extent of assessed
              available bid capacity.

4.11   Advertisement, inviting applications for prequalification of contractors for the 91-92 annual
       program (Packages 57, Jobs 373 kms and totalling Rs.492 million) has been published on
       December 29, 1991 and it is planned to finalise the prequalifications by the end of March
       1992. Bids for the works would be finalized before June 1992 and the works would
       commence by July/October 1992.

       Buildings:

4.12 Procurement of all but two packages has been completed. Procurement for two packages
     is likely to be completed by June 1992.

       Quality of Works Inspected:

4.13 The mission visited 34 work sites involving 170 kms of roads at different stages of
     construction (attachment 2). The mission was satisfied about the efforts made by the R&B
     Department in improving the quality. Obviously, works carried out by some contractors
     were undoubtedly superior to others because of their experience, better management and
     work culture. On the other hand, some contractors (as well as departmental supervisors),
     do not know how to handle the modem equipment and are unable to achieve better results.
     They however need adequate training and proper guidance. There are some contractors
     who do not want to mend their ways and are interested in making money at the cost of
     quality. In such cases, the departmental officers will have to take strong measures to
     correct them, and if possible, eliminate them in future prequalifications.

4.14 The newly acquired compaction equipment- vibratory roller is being widely used. On few
     roads, contractors have been using their own bull-dozers and tractors with improvised
     attachments. Obviously, the technique of effective use of graders has yet to be learnt. So
     also, the importance of optimum moisture control during compaction is not realised fully
     ( may be due to the smaller volume of earthwork involved). In many cases, there is no
     proper mixing of soil and water during watering, with the result, the compaction is non
     unifonn and results, far from satisfactory. The situation needs greater attention. In
     Saurashtra region, excellent material is available for constructing road embankments but
     there is a genuine scarcity of water due to scanty rainfall (30 to 40 cm). This is affecting the
                                                5

      embankment construction. In such a situation, earthwork construction could be so timed to
      take advantage of natural moisture in the soils during the rainy season. Even bringing water
      by long haulage may have to be resorted to and provided for in the estimates. Large
      vibratory compactors could be combined with other earthmoving equipments
      advantageously. With modem heavy vibro compactors, it is possible to compact layers of
      increased thicknesses.

4.15 On a few works, stricter control is necessary on the size and grading of materials used in
     the Water Bound Macadam (WBM) construction. Similarly, widening of road crusts from 3
     m to 3.75 m to bring the roads to current IRC standards is rather very difficult. Such work
     should be permitted only after the formation has been widened to 8.5 meters or so.
     Although camber boards are now more regularly used during construction, more attention
     should be paid to super relevation and widening on curves. For the works of improvement
     category, it would be necessary to ignore the existing badly damaged surfaces (WBM & BT
     alike) & provide for re-sectioning of the old road with an addition of extra materials as per
     the requirements. This would greatly help in improving the riding quality of such roads.

4.16 As regards construction of CD works, it is necessary to use firm shuttering for the
     construction of concrete blocks around the pipes and ensuring placement of fmn cradles at
     the joints. Departmental supervision must be tightened to get better results.

4.17 The mission visited some Hot Mix Plants and sites where premix asphalt carpeting work
     was in progress, and was satisfied with the measures taken to control the mix quality,
     thickness of the pavement, compaction etc.

5.    Land Acquisition:

5.1   In 27 cases involving road sections totalling about 48 kilometers, the works are held up
      either due to dispute over the road alignment or due to land not been acquired. In some
      cases contracts had to be extended for long periods till the issues are resolved. Until now,
      Rs.2.2 million have been spent in acquiring land in 1962 kms out of 3670 kms of the
      original program. GOG's decision to reduce the extent of land acquisition problem by
      borrowing earth from outside has certainly helped in accelerating the progress but has
      increased the cost of construction appreciably. In view of this, it has been agreed that
      unless the land along the roads are available, the road work will not be included in the
      additional program. In this regard, the mission also agreed to lower the road formation
      standards from 7.5 m to 6m, for Village Roads which only serve as approaches and have
      no potential of conversion into parts of through roads at a later date.

5.2   The three land acquisition cells, which have started functioning under each Superintending
      Engineer since 1990, are still to be fully operative because a large number of vacancies (18
      out of 25 posts) of cadestal surveyors, and one post of Talathi, all of whom are to come on
      deputation from the Revenue Department. In future, more land will have to be acquired
      through private negotiations before inclusion of roads in the Project. As such, it would be
      advisable to set up district level committees to finalise such deals. Periodic review at higher
      levels would considerably improve the matters. Measures similar to those taken by GOG to
      acquire lands to resettle and rehabilitate the project affected persons on the ongoing Sardar
      Sarovar Project, should be adopted in this project also.
                                                 6

6.     Road design Standards:

6.1    Summary of geometric design standards and pavement design details proposed to be
       adopted on the project have been listed in Table 3.1 page 63 of the SAR. The mission
       however noticed that in a large number of cases, it has not.been possible to adhere to
       these standards in respect of the right of way, minimum radius and side slopes mainly with
       a view to avoid extra land acquisition. Under this situation, the Bank would be willing to
       relax the standards in respect of village approach roads shorter than 5 kms in length and
       having no potential for traffic growth. In such cases (in flat and rolling terrain), the
       formations can be reduced to 6m, Right of way to 15m, design speed to 30 to 25 kmph and
       the minimum radius of curve to 45m. Depending on the type of strata traversed, the side
       slopes can be steeper than IV: 2H and may be designed accordingly. Sometimes, empty
       asphalt drums, toe walls and pitching should be used in restricted places and for sections
       requiring protection.

 6.2   Classification of roads into improvement or reconstruction categories, though simple,
       requires vast experience and sound judgement and it cannot be left only to the junior level
       officers. It has to be timely reviewed by the experienced seniors, before finalization of the
       estimates. This would avoid prescribing rectification measures inadequate to meet the
       situation and necessitating extra items during execution involving long delays. Many a
       times, if the works are not visited by senior officers timely, road condition does not
       improve satisfactorily even after the completion of works. If a road has sunk unevenly, has
       no embankment and poor drainage, it will have to be raised or re-sectioned. In the case of
       road passing through black soil region, provision for blanketing and sub-base of selected
       material (murrum /gravel / sand) would be required before laying of the WBM. In the case
       of roads passing through excellent strata, (like in many parts of Saurashtra), construction
       costs can be lowered effecting suitable reduction in the total crust provided on the road
       sub-grades built with such material.

 6.3   For pipe culverts, even after lowering the sills of the concrete pipes upto 6" in the bed, if
       minimum cushion is not available, the design of the culvert should be changed to hard
       passage. On the other hand, where road levels are much higher than the HFL, and nalla
       passes through deep gorge, it would be advisable to raise the deck level of the bridge to fit
       into the grade without vitiating the road geometrics. In such cases, cause ways or
       submersible structures are not appropriate as they would need huge cutting for approach
       roads. Even single lane bridges could be permitted on roads with less traffic potential.

7.     Equipment:

7. 1   The actual equipment needs are reviewed by GOG and the overall status of procurement is
       given in table 4. Crushing Plants & 2 small Ton Vibratory Rollers are the only major
       items of equipment which are remained to be procured. ICB bids invited for the main
       crushing plants are due on 30th Jan, 1992. Along with the cone crushers, an alternative
       like Rotor crusher equipment would be considered acceptable if found equally efficient,
       after sales service is guaranteed and the spares are available easily.

7.2    Along with the main crushing plants, some ancillary machinery and equipment like air
       compressors, drills and tippers would be needed and procured under LCB. Similarly,
       some civil works associated with the erection and functioning of the crushing plants would
       be carried out under LCB, after the supplier's detail requirements are known.
                                                7

7.3   Earlier, some small vibratory rollers were ordered from a local Calcutta firm,which now
      has reportedly gone out of business without completing the orders and a few pieces
      received from it are also not found to be working satisfactorily. From this experience,
      GOO has proposed to procure them through International shopping. This proposal was
      cleared by the March 1991 mission but there has been no further progress in this
      connection.

7.4   The Rand B Departments proposals for charging rental fees for the machinery to
      contractors, the mission observed that consultation of interest charges on the purchase price
      of equipment were not based on the current interest rates; otherwise the analysis appeared
      to be in order and acceptable. Table 5 gives the rental charges proposed for the year 1991-
      92 for different items of equipment.

7.5   Although machinery worth Rs. 54 Million has been purchased, there is little monitoring on
      the use of the equipment. Many items of equipment are not manned by regular operators.
      It would be essential to obtain following periodic reports in respect of each of the
      equipment:

             name of equipment, date of purchase, expiry of warranty;
             name of division;
             period of report;
             name of work/contract where it is working;
             whether working or out of order; with reasons
             available hourslidle hours;
             charges recovered, connected operating expenses, cost of repairs,
             profit/loss account etc.

8.    Studies:


8.1   It is very surprising that the contract (involving payments of Rs 5.37 millions in Indian
      currency and 87000 in foreign currency), with the consulting firm (RITES, SWK fmn and
      CRRI), which was cleared with the Bank in June 1991, has still not been signed. GOO is
      awaiting DEA's clearance on the issue of Income tax exemption to the consultant and his
      staff. GOG was advised to study the procedure followed by the Government of
      Maharashtra, in appointing the supervision consultants on the Bank assisted State Roads
      Project (Cr.1959-INlLn.2994-IN) with a view to expedite the contract signature. Any
      further delay in this matter may jeopardize the earlier price negotiations with the consultants
      and may pose problems in processing the restructuring.

9.    Staffing:

9.1   GOG has already sanctioned an additional circle to deal with the four additional districts
      included in the expanded scope of the project area. At present, the staffing is quite
      satisfactory as there are only 25 % vacancies in the posts of Asstt Engineers/AAEs. The
      Secretary, Rand B Deptt has promised to post selected staff to man them and to consider
      transfer of one more circle or additional divisions to speed up the project implementation.



9.2   Although in the last couple of months a few senior officers have retired, these changes
                                                    8

       would not seriously affect the tempo of this project because of GOG's finn commitment to
       the project.

9.3    So far, GOG has not taken any action on providing hardship allowance to the staff located
       in the interior areas, mainly because most of the RRP staff is residing in the adjoining
       towns like other Govt employees. GOG cannot be partial to the RRP staff for grant of
       special privileges, as this might have wider repercussions. The CE RRP should make a
       special case in respect of staff residing in interior villages, etc., to give incentive to the staff
       to stay close to the work sites.

10.    Trainin~:

10.1   Regular domestic training courses are proceeding satisfactorily. 22 courses have been
       arranged so far and a further program has been drawn out. The mechanical wing has started
       training programs for the technical staff, mechanics and drivers especially in the
       maintenance and use of vibratory rollers. Similarly, BEML,the manufacturers of motor
       graders, are arranging a training course for the mechanical staff.

10.2   Due to some reason or the other the idea of taking up some demonstration contracts to
       provide on the job training to departmental and contractor's staff has received a setback.
       GOG wanted to take advantage of the revived Amdavad-Vadodara Express highway works,
       for this purpose, however, the Chief Engineer has promised to select a few works to
       provide on the job training to the Project staff.

11.    Financin~   & Disbursements :

11.1   Although the target for the current FY is RS.524.41 M, the current year's budget is Rs.
       328.4 M. The expenditure upto the end of November amounts to Rs. 239.52 M and CE,
       RRP is awaiting further release of funds. The Secretary, R&B has assured the mission
       that there would not be any difficulty in arranging the funds as needed. The mission
       however feels that close monitoring of funding is necessary to avoid any adverse impact on
       the project and to maintain the tempo of works.

11.2   During the meeting with DEA, Mr. Hardeepak Singh, Director, informed the mission of
       GOl's decision to grant advances to GOG from he Special Account in the beginning of FY
       92-93.

11.3   Uptodate expenditure totals to Rs 808.8 Millions, and claims have been lodged for a total of
       Rs. 647.3 M. However, disbursements received upto the end of November 1991, amount
       to Rs. 485.7 Million. For some time, disbursements were stopped temporarily for a while,
       pending clearances to the bids finalized since the procurement/disbursement matters were
       transferred to NDO procurement and disbursement units.

12.    Audit:

12.1   Although audit certificates are being received regularly, SOE audits are not being furnished
       in the proper fonn acceptable to the Bank. GOG is pursuing this with the Comptroller &
       Auditor General. The mission has cautioned the Chief Engineer, RRP, that if the
       certificates are not furnished urgently, disbursements may have to be suspended again.

13.    Computerised Project Monitorin~ System:
                                                9


13.1   Although the System established through Technical Assistance is working satisfactorily, it
       is only localised in Sachivalaya and has not been established in the offices of the
       Superintending Engineers. Since very few people are conversant with it, all the EEs must
       be trained to handle the data originating from them. GOG should review this and purchase
       additional PCs and train more number of staff members.

14.    Consultants for Detail Engg and Contract Supervision:

14.1   Due to changes in the departmental set up , GOG has decided to postpone the idea of
       engaging consultants for these works. This issue would therefore be reviewed by the next
       supervision mission, if the progress lags behind the targets on this account.

15.    Road Maintenance:

15.1   Generally the civil works contracts are for periods of more than two years and the defect-
       liability extends one year on completion of works. Maintenance responsibility for most of
       the completed road works has fallen on the Rand B department only around this year.
       GOG has initially allocated a small amount of Rs. 3 lakhs for maintenance of project roads
       taken over by the department at the end of the defect liability period. Although GOG has
       committed to give funds according to the norms fixed by the Eighth Finance Commission,
       the Chief Engineer has yet to submit his demand to the Government. The Secretary, R and
       B, must ensure that at least from the next financial year, GOG would allocate maintenance
       funds at the level corresponding to the technical norms fixed by the Eighth Finance
       Commission.

Assumtions: 1. Salvage Value (SV) = 0.1 Capital Cost (CC)
            2. Tyres have a life of 2000 hours capital cost of tyres is taken out from
              CC and hire charge component for them are worked out and added separately.
               Howby GOG, However, such charge work out to be about 1% hence not shown
               separately below.

Calculations: A. Depreciation Rate = (CC_SV) Divide by life in hours
              B. Repairs Provision = 1.5 CC Divide by life in hours
              C. Operation & POL = Hourly pay of operator, cleaner + hourly cost of POL
              D. Interest @ 12% p.a. =(0.12 CC) Divide by annual life in hours
              E. Supervision and unforeseen charges = 12% (A+B+C)
              Hourly hire charge:
                                 =
              a) for works hours A+B+C+D+E
              b) for idle hours = 0.25 A+C (wages component only) + D+E
