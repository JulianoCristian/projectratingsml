The mission wishes to express its appreciation\n            of the assistance received from all concerned in the GOG and\n            in particular for the arrangements made for visiting many of\n            the project sites. The project involves construction,\n            reconstruction or improvement of about 4000 kilometers of\n            village roads in seven districts of Gujarat where the dairy\n            industry predominates. The project is rescheduled to be\n            completed in seven years from the time it became effective\n            on August 27, 1987. After some initial difficulties, a\n            marked improvement in project implementation was recorded in\n            March 1989, but this positive trend did not continue. The\n            project is now almost two years behind schedule and\n            continues to suffer on account of poor funding, inadequate\n            equipment, and delays in acquiring land or removing\n            encroachments, delayed technical sanctions (TS) and\n            administrative (AA) approvals, poor enforcement of contract\n            conditions and specifications, inadequate staff and frequent\n            staff turnovers. None of the works started has been\n            completed in the past 30 months. Road works are only\n            partially completed on about 400 km. i.e. less than 10\n            percent of the total program length; the project will barely\n            reach a 30 percent completion during the project period."}, "docdt": "1990-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
