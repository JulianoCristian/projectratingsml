(2) improve rural road\n            construction and maintenance, road planning and road\n            maintenance management; (3) development of a higher level of\n            road safety and; (4) training of local staff in the\n            administration and operation of the road network.\n            Performance of Bank during both the project processing and\n            implementation phases has been satisfactory. Borrower\u2019s\n            performance was satisfactory. The key lessons learned from\n            the project were: (a) without political support and project\n            ownership, even simple projects can suffer from delays and\n            weak implementation, as was the case during the first two\n            and a half years of implementation of this project; (b) the\n            design and construction quality standards required should be\n            clearly and strictly enforced through adequate supervision\n            mechanisms to obtain uniform construction quality; (c)\n            selection and design of rural roads would be simplified if\n            up-to-date accurate topographical maps were available; and\n            (d) a steady flow of contracts over a long period, such as\n            seven years, enables contractors to receive regular work and\n            thereby become established, gain good experience and\n            encourages them to mechanize and adopt more modem\n            construction techniques."}, "docdt": "1996-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
