Credit 1757-IN for 101 million SDR (US$ 119.6\n            million equivalent) was signed on May 12, 1987, and provided\n            for: (i) the construction, reconstruction or improvement of\n            about 4,040 km of village roads in seven districts of\n            Gujarat where the dairy industry predominates; (ii) the\n            procurement of road construction equipment to facilitate the\n            implementation; (iii) the construction of offices, workshops\n            and other project accommodations; (iv) technical assistance\n            and engineering services for project management and\n            training; and (v) a maintenance planning study and a road\n            safety program. The speed of implementation increased\n            substantially in the last year, as already reported in\n            August 1990. About 310 roads, a total of more than 1,600 km,\n            are expected to be completed by the end of March 1991. Close\n            monitoring of this progress is carried out in the field and\n            at central level by the Rural Roads Cell (RRC) of Roads and\n            Buildings Department (R&BD) and contractors are being\n            effectively directed to comply with the proper sequencing of\n            operations and with the schedules of progress. At the\n            present pace 3,600 km of road works could be completed by\n            December 1994."}, "docdt": "1991-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
