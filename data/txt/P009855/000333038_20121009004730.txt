                GUJARAT RURAL ROADS PROJECT - CREDIT 1757 - IN

                        JANUARY 1990 SUPERVISION MISSION



                                  Aide-Memoire

Introduction

1.1   A World Bank mission compr~s~ng Messrs. A. Cittati (Highway Engineer)
and C.S. Nawathe (Highway Engineer) visited the state of Gujarat from January
21 tht"ough 25 to supervise the project.     Mr. J. Bentchikou (Sr. Highway
Engineer,) joined the mission on January 25.

1.2   This Aide Memoire summarizes the mission's findings and discussions with
GOI and GOG officials. However, the conclusions and recommendations recorded
here, are subject to confirmation by the International Development Association.

1.3   The mission wishes to express its appreciation of the assistance received
from all concerned in the Government of Guj arat and in particular for the
arrangements made for visiting many of the project sites. A list of officials
met is enclosed as Attachment 1.

2.    Civil Works

Progress of the works

2.1   The project involves construction, reconstruction or improvement of about
4000 kilometers of village roads in seven districts of Gujarat where the dairy
industry predominates. The project is rescheduled to be completed in seven years
from the time it became effective on August 27, 1987.       After some initial
difficulties, a marked improvement in project implementation was recorded in
March 1989, but this positive trend did not continue. The project is now almost
two years behind schedule and continues to suffer on account of poor funding,
inadequate equipment, delays in acquiring land or removing       encroachments,
delayed technical sanctions (TS) and administrative (AA) approvals, poor
enforcement of contract conditions and specifications, inadequate staff and
frequent staff turnovers. None of the works started has been completed in the
past 30 months. Road works are only partially completed on about 400 km. i.e.
less than 10 percent of the total program length,unless immediate corrective
measures discussed in the following paras are taken, the project will barely
reach a 30% completion during the project period.

Situation of A.A., T.S. and Procurement (Table 1).

2.2   Government's administrative approvals for the agreed programs of project
works to he taken up for execution during 89-90 was considerably delayed, with
the result that none of the works included in FY 89-90 budget would commence
                                                                     ANNEX 1
                                                                     Page 2 of 7

before the end of the financial year.       Consequently, the works program for FY
90-91 has not been approved so far. This    program would include all the remaining
jobs.   Early approval to this program      is extremely important in view of the
larger tender packages envisaged in the     future (see para 2.7).

2.3    Due to shortage of staff, detailed engineering of the works included in
the FY 89-90 program has not been finalized.    Since detailed engineering and
technical sanction are required for all the jobs included in a package before
bids are invited, detailed engineering works need to be carried out
expeditiously. The field units will have to revise their programs for carrying
out detailed engineering of different jobs, on the basis of the agreed modified
packaging of works.    During the field visits, the mission has also observed
deficiencies in the final engineering carried out by the departmental engineers
and reviewed by the highest technical authority (Chief Engineer). The mission
urges GOG to apply stricter control on the quality of design and take measures
to strengthen the field staff without delays.

2.4   So far, bids have been accepted for 409 jobs totalling 1380 kms and bids
received for 118 jobs totalling 1,522 kms are being processed. However, none
of the jobs started has been fully completed, partly because of land acquisition
problems, but mainly because of the Department practice to contract works well
in excess of its available budget.      Due to political pressure, works are
initiated simultaneously in several districts and then completed in two or three
years even when the contract amounts are as small as 2.5 or 3.0 Rs. million.
The mission has expressed its concern about this practice and recommends that
each contract be allocated sufficient funds to be completed within the
contractual completion period.      In as many as 33 contracts, the bank's
procurement guidelines were violated and contracts were rejected without
informing the Association. GOG has assured the mission that such instances will
not be repeated and requested the Association to condone the past violations.

Quality of works inspected

2.5   The mission visited eleven works in the four districts of the State with
the hope that the improvements noted by the Feb-March 89 mission in contract
execution and project supervision would have enhanced the quality of works being
executed by all the field units. Unfortunat.ely defects noted by the past mission
persist.   Major shortcomings noticed during the mission visit are caused by
ineffective supervision, absence of minimal equipment at construction sites,
lack of trained equipment operators, improper sequence of operations during
construction, poor enforcement of technical specifications and poor standards
of acceptability of the finished works. Most commonly noticed defects are:

            not following the proper sequence of operations such as carrying out
            bituminous layers(WBM/LBM/SDC) before completion of formations and
            side supports;

            using oversized. not properly graded, handbroken stones for WBM
            construction;

            absence   of   control   on   camber,   grade,   super   elevation     during
                                                                       ANNEX 1
                                                                       Page 3 of 7

                 construction of the subgrade. subbase. and base layers;

                 dumping of earth in heaps for the work of widening of formations.
                 absence of layering for earth works construction and absence of
                 compaction in lower layers;

                 digging borrow pits close to the toe of embankment;

                 non building of    longitudinal gutters   for   the   road sections   in
                 cutting;

                 inadequate side slopes for the earthworks in embankment;

                non completion of earth work true to the designed section, especially
                in the reaches of high embankments;

                 lack of effective and appropriate hand tools (the only tool used is
                 the hoe);

                excessive dependence on static rollers and refusal to use modern
                equipment;

                tackling works allover the length of the road without concentrating
                on completion section by section;

                poor construction of masonry and concrete for the hume pipe culverts.

    Programming and Packaging

    2.6   Some of the roads included in the original(SAR) program have been, in the
    Ineanwhile, executed by Panchayats; others have been dropped by R&BD because of
    excessive cost after detailed engineering was carried out. GOG is therefore
    proposing to reduce the scope of the project from 1,025 to 922 roads, with a
    corresponding reduction in total length from 4,042 km to about 3,670 km. The
    cost of civil works for the reduced program is estimated by R&BD at Rs.l,620.5
    million, inc luding contingencies, 1. e Rs. 103.4 million lower than SAR estimates.
    However the mission informed R&BD that some flexibility is allowed in the
    original SAR program and that alternative road sections could be replaced in
    the project, provided an economic evaluation is undertaken for these roads and
    the Association's approval is sought before implementation.

    2.7   The mission discussed the status of procurement of civil works with R&BD
    officials in relation to the size of bid packages. Average value of contracts
    is in fact about 240,000 US$ equivalent and not even one contract reaches the
    value of 500,000 US$ equivalent agreed as a minimum value of bid packages,
    pursuant to Schedule 1, Section I, Part C.S of the Project Agreement. Two of
    the main project's objectives are the modernization of the construction industry
    and the application of higher technical standards and these can only be achieved
    through contracts large enough to justify the acquisition by the contractors of
"   the equipment required to satisfactorily execute the works.
                                                              ANNEX 1
                                                              Page 4 of 7

2.8   It was therefore agreed that R&BD will review its packaging criteria for
the 1989/90 and 1990/91 program so that, works will be rearranged in packages
of 500,000 US$ equivalent or more.

Funding Requirements

2.9   In spite of the commitments made under Section 3.01 of the Development
Credit Agreement, GOI has not been able to cause Gujarat to perform in accordance
with the Project Agreement. In the past 2.1/2 years, the funds provided by the
GOG amounted to only 30 percent of the appraisal estimates, and the situation
is not expected to improve during FY90-9L       If the project is to follow its
schedule, the level of funding will have to be more than doubled (Table 2) from
now on.

2.10 This budgetary Crunch is in fact the direct result of financial rules which
require GOG to provide in its budget for 100% of the project expenditures despite
the fact that IDA finances 70% of the project. After all, IDA financing should
be considered additional to GOG financing because otherwise, IDA assistance would
not be needed.    In the current situation the IDA money goes to the general
revenue section of the budget.       The mission strongly recommends that DEA
authorize GOG to input the IDA financing directly into the project account so
that GOG'S limited budgetary resources can be used to their full effect to
finance exclusively GOG's share of project cost. One possibility could be to
split payments to contractors into 2 parts, one part corresponding to IDA's
share, paid directly out of the project special account or by using IDA's
disbursement procedure III, and the remaining part paid by GOG's usual means
using budgetary resources.

Prequalification of Contractors

2.11 The mission noted that out of 33 on going contracts, 18 are not completed
more than 6 months after the contract completion date and 10 are delayed by
more than 9 months. Still, no action has been taken by R&BD against those non-
performing contractors and they have been all prequalified for the current
1989/90 construction reason. The mission regards this situation as unacceptable
and it has been agreed with the Department that contractors whose contracts have
expired by six months or more be automatically disqualified from future bids.
Furthermore, a liquidated damage clause will be added to contracts and strictly
applied,unless GOGrecognizes that the delays are due to factors outside of the
contractor's control and revisions of the completion dates are submitted to and
agreed with IDA.

3.    Equipment

3.1   The mission expressed concern to the Department officials for the
unsatisfactory situation of equipment procurement and deployment, which is
summarized below for some of the most urgently needed items:
                                                                ANNEX 1
                                                                Page 5 of 7

  Plate compactors                      20                5              NA

The mission noted that out of the three small tandem rollers seen, two had the
vibration control unusable and the third one was being used as a static roller.

3.2   Bids for equipment procured under ICB were received on September 1, 1989
and bid evaluation is nearly completed. The mission urged R&BD to expedite the
remaining administrative steps so that the bid evaluation report be submitted
to the Association for review without further delays.

3.3   In view of the critical need for adequate equipment to ensure an acceptable
quality of the works the mission has recommended. and the Department has agreed,
to complete the procurement of necessary equipment within the current year. In
particular it has been agreed that R&BD will revise the list of equipment
required and, after review by the Association, start the procurement procedure
for all items at once and without further delays.

3.4   However GOG has expressed its intention to procure equipment in amounts
well below the SAR estimates and to require the contractors to provide the bulk
of the necessary equipment. The mission concurs with GOG's position, subject
to the the following :

       (i)    contractors will be entitled to a mobilization advance and a
              machinery advance. each of them in the amount of 10% of the contract
              value, covered only by a bank guarantee;

       (ii)   interests rates charged by GOG on the above advances, at present in
              the amount of 20% per annum, will be reduced to more reasonable
              levels, acceptable to the Association: and

       (iii) strict enforcement of Schedule C of Clause 7 of the general
             conditions of contract. which specifies in detail the equipment to
             be provided on site by the contractors before starting the works.

3.5         The mission would like to draw the attention of GOI and GOG that
reductions in equipment procurement are likely to generate unused project funds
which will have to be cancelled. at the Credit's closing.

Land Acquisition

4.1   Posts for the 21 surveyors and the 3 land acquisition officers needed to
                                                                   ANNEX 1
                                                                   Page 6 of 7

process land acquisition cases have been sanctioned but no staff is in place yet.
Frequently, farmers refusal to settle the cases through private negotiation is
resulting in stoppage of works on part or even the entire length of 29 new roads
and in substandard improvement and rehabilitation works because of farmer's
encroachment on the right-of-way. GOG has given formal assurance that the survey
teams and the acquisition officers will be posted at their duty stations by March
15, 1990.

4.2   I t was further agreed however that, effective immediat.ely, R&BD will submit
for review by the Association, before tenders are announced, the list of roads
included in such tender together with a certification that the land acquisition
process has been completed for the entire length of the road and for the full
width of the right-of-way.

5.    Studies

5.1   Technical proposals for the Road Maintenance Study have been received on
December 4, 1989 from four of the five prequalified consultants. Evaluation of
the proposals by R&BD is under way and the evaluation report is expected to be
submitted to the Association for review by February 28, 1990.

5.2   Preparation of the Road Safety Program, agreed during project appraisal,
will start shortly and GOG has undertaken to submit the program for comments to
the Association by December 31, 1990.

6.    Staffing

6.1    For the satisfactory completion of the project according to the
implementation program set forth in Schedule 2 of the Project Agreement, the
personnel needed to man the field establishment (1 CE, 4 SEs, 17 EEs, 68 DEs)
should have been sanctioned promptly.       However, only about half of this
establishment has been sanctioned (1 CE, 3 SEs, 9 EEs and 34 DEs) and high
turnover rates are reported, thus preempting the results of the training programs
and preventing the effective utilization of the experience acquired in the
execution of the project. The unsatisfactory staffing situation is affecting
not only the quality of works under execution (see para 2.5 & 2.6.) but also
the quality and pace of execution of the engineering designs, which are well
behind schedule. In addition the scattered location of the works and the lack
of transport for site supervision staff is creating serious difficulties and
jeopardizing any effective quality control of the works. The mission strongly
recommends that GOG    take the necessary measures to correct the situatiun,
including the hiring of consultants, at least on a pilot basis. for the
supervision of some of the contracts.

7.    Training

7.1   To date. some short term training courses have been arranged in the Engg.
Staff College Ghandhinagar, but the slow progress and the turnover of the staff
are denying this training of much of its effectiveness.

7.2   Regarding   overseas   training   included   in   the   project   and   agreed   at
                                                             ANNEX 1
                                                             Page 7 of 7

negotiations, no decision has yet been taken by the three ministeries of GOI
involved.   DEA is urged to give its early approval to the overseas training
courses so that the experience gained may be put to use in the project.

8.    Design Specifications

8.1   The mission discussed with Depart.ment officials the pavement design
specifications; in particular it was agreed that the Scm of LBM (lean bituminous
macadam), presently adopted instead of the 10cm of grading 3 machine-crushed
stone which is not easily available from commercial quarries, is proving too
expensive and disproportionate to the standards required for rural roads.

8.2   The mission recommends the return to the original SAR specifications with
the possible exception of replacing the 10cm of machine-crushed stone with an
equal thickness of handbroken, hand-laid, WBM laid and compacted under the
strictest condition of quality control and enforcement of specifications.

9.    Audit Certificates

9.1   Audit certificate for the GOG's FY 1988-89 expenditure has been received
on January 2, 1990. However this does not contain the certificates for the audit
of SOEs as detailed in para 3.22 of the SAR.

10.   Compliance with Covenants

10.1 Since the Road User charge study, being carried out under the NH Project
(Ln 2S34-IN), has not been finalized it. would not be possible for GOG to review
these changes and discuss the findings with the Bank before December 1990.

10.2 The project roads are getting completed at pace slower than expected. The
Secretary, R&B has promised that the project roads would be given maintenance
budget according to the norms recommended by the Eighth Finance Commission.
