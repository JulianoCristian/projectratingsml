which is\n            being supported under an ongoing Bank-financed National\n            Extension Project. The project finances research on plant\n            breeding, particularly on crops other than rice, and also on\n            small-farm systems to develop technology which will\n            effectively integrate crops and backyard livestock. It aims\n            to improve the plant and livestock regulatory services of\n            the Ministry of Agriculture and strengthen the\n            Ministry's capability to plan, prepare and implement\n            projects. It is expected that the expanded services will\n            raise agricultural productivity and output, and will enhance\n            rural incomes, particularly of small farmers. Through\n            support of the second nationwide nutrition survey, the\n            project will also strengthen the data base for the\n            Government's Food and Nutrition Plan. Although the\n            project's benefits do not lend themselves to precise\n            quantification, a large proportion of the country's\n            2.35 million farm units could benefit from it, at a\n            relatively small average cost per farm family."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
