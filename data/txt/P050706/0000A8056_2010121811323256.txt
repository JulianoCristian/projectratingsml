                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective is to create sustained utilization of human and financial resources in the administration. To this end, the project would help put in place core
                         personnel and financial management systems, establish a mechanism to reduce the number of unqualified civil servants, and initiate a restructuring process in
                         individual ministries. To make this foundation as solid as possible, another objective of the project is to upgrade the management capacity in the civil service.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Civil Service Modernization project (CSMP) closed on June 30, 2010 with mixed results. Both of the two main core systems have been provided: AFMIS and the biometrics

                         systems. Furthermore, CSMP has made progress including in (i) providing civil service reform legal framework, (ii) enforcement of retirement regulations, (iii) creation of Civil Service
                         Fund (CSF) to process surplus staff and start reduction of surplus civil servants, and (iv) building capacity through analytical work and training.

                         Although the final biometrics system (BIS) was provided, the system is not operational yet. A large work program remains for the Government to make the biometrics system and
                         related employee database operational. Realistically speaking verification of data, having an operational biometrics system and printed ID cards can be expected at the earliest In the
                         first quarter of 2011. The re-engineering and government mandate component has provided a number of studies, with limited actual implementation progress or impact. Efforts to link
                         civil service reform with wage restructuring are highly ambitious and have not come to fruition. Wage increases coupled with very limited redundancies caused the wage bill to more
                         than double between 2006-10.
