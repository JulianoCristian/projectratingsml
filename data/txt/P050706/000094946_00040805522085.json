The project has five components: 1)\n            improvements in core systems will require technical\n            assistance for the selection, and preparation of priority\n            reforms, to be later implemented in Phase II.\n            Computerization of core systems will be established, and,\n            extensive training will be provided, through specific\n            modular courses on new core systems, and skills.\n            Sub-components include financing, and training for human\n            resources, and personnel information management development,\n            including payroll, and accounting information management\n            best practices; 2) technical assistance will be provided to\n            create a civil service fund, and establish its policy\n            framework regarding retirement, redundancy, and severance\n            options; 3) the re-engineering process will streamline, and\n            rationalize organizational structures, simplify business\n            processes, and establish basic information systems; 4)\n            capacity building will focus on the a) skills needed to\n            sustain the reform program, and, b) managing skills to\n            administer civil service; and, 5) the component aims at\n            providing a program management structure, through technical\n            support to accomplish standard supervision, and performance audits."}, "docdt": "2000-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
