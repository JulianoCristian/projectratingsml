Some lessons learned included: the project\n            reflects the numerous and often painful lessons learnt from\n            now 30 years of Bank support to civil service reforms:\n            projects of this kind need to be much more focused and in\n            line with the country's context and administrative\n            capacity. The phasing of reform needs to ensure that the\n            basic human and financial resources management functions and\n            processes are in place or addressed before envisaging\n            complex IT solutions. The approach needs to be more\n            incremental and opportunistic, thus requiring more\n            flexibility. Given the highly political nature and\n            sensitivity of government reengineering and civil service\n            reforms, their feasibility needs to be based on a thorough\n            analysis of the country's political economy,\n            governance, and corruption situation. Whenever, public\n            employment plays an essential welfare function, like in\n            Yemen and many other countries, credible alternatives, such\n            as social transfers or safety nets need to be envisaged to\n            alleviate the social impact of streamlining and thus\n            opposition to the reform. At operational level, this project\n            highlights the importance of specific and realistic results\n            framework, based on a reform strategy with a detailed and\n            time bound implementation plan and informed by an\n            appropriate monitoring and evaluation system at project\n            level. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangement\n            need to be clear from the start. It further, shows the\n            importance of a detailed and candid risk analysis and a\n            realistic assessment of the mitigating measures. The\n            project's ambitions and scope need to reflect this risk\n            assessment. It also shows the need for continuity in project\n            management and an ongoing dialogue with the project\n            counterparts and main stakeholders. This requires a strong\n            and clear involvement of the field office."}, "docdt": "2010-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
