Several lessons were learned from this\n            project. A lesson learnt is that to achieve the benefits of\n            a partnership with donors, it is essential that joint\n            financing be sought. Other mechanisms of funding should be\n            explored that ensure that funds come in simultaneously and\n            well before implementation e.g., basket funding. Overly\n            Ambitious Project Designs are a stumbling block to\n            implementation:   It is important to ensure that the natural\n            resource goals of the project are well integrated into the\n            wider developmental needs of the community such as access to\n            water, energy and food requirements. There is a need to make\n            a determination, during preparation and the early stages of\n            appraisal, about the level of Government commitment to the\n            project. If it is perceived to be lacking, there is a need\n            to engage in discussions with the government, at a higher\n            level, to determine where the problem lies. In some cases,\n            this may be due to a financial crisis in the government or\n            changing priorities in the government's agenda or\n            perhaps even a failure to engage the appropriate Ministers.\n            Once the exact problem is determined, there are many ways to\n            address it including scaling down the project, reshaping it\n            to address particular priorities, etc. However, early\n            diagnosis is important to ensure that this does not\n            adversely affect the project. Monitoring and evaluation\n            needs and capacities should be assessed in the first two or\n            three supervision missions to determine whether the team is\n            correctly setting up the M&E system. Where M&E\n            experience is lacking, the mission should make a concerted\n            effort to ensure that capacity building issues are addressed\n            by the implementing agency. For projects with a long time\n            line such as NRMP, the project should consider establishing\n            a separate M&E unit to increase effectiveness.\n            Legislative procedures and creation of by-laws is a slow\n            process that could confound the project if these are a\n            necessary first step for core implementation. A lesson\n            learnt is that in some case, legislation should be attained\n            prior to effectiveness to ensure that this process is\n            completed quickly."}, "docdt": "2004-01-16T00:00:00Z"}
