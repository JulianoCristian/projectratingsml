This\n            environmental impact assessment identifies the impacts the\n            project may have on biophysical and socio-economic\n            environment and describes mitigative measures to reduce such\n            impacts.  Wood processes could generate toxic chemicals\n            which will cause air pollution.  These processes will\n            require emission control.  Harvest activities may lead to\n            soil compaction and rainfall runoff, and thus reduce\n            groundwater recharge and increase flows of streams and\n            rivers.  During harvesting operation, best practice\n            guidelines will be followed to minimize the negative impacts\n            on hydrology and water quality, and prevent soil erosion.\n            Silvicultural techniques will regenerate new floral species\n            removed from the forest because of plantation establishment.\n            Plantations may also reduce biodiversity and cause a threat\n            to wildlife now present on degraded sites. Forest management\n            plans will be prepared to protect important wildlife\n            habitats and identify the important biodiversity areas."}, "docdt": "1997-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
