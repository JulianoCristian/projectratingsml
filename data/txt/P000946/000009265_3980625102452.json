There are five\n            project components.  First, high forest resource management\n            will establish forest resource management policy and legal\n            framework; design and test integrated forest reserve\n            management systems and mechanism to encourage private sector\n            involvement in both on-  and off-reserve settings.  Second,\n            Savanna resource management will develop new\n            multidisciplinary institutional arrangements for drylands\n            management; and pilot test and implement improved systems\n            for community-based management of savanna woodland and other\n            resources.  Third, wildlife resource management will retrain\n            personnel in the Wildlife Department; and prepare and\n            implement park and reserve management plans.  Fourth,\n            environmental management coordination will support district\n            level environmental management planning and monitoring\n            capacity; and improve information flow among sectoral\n            agencies.  Fifth, biodiversity conservation will develop and\n            implement integrated reserve management plans."}, "docdt": "1998-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
