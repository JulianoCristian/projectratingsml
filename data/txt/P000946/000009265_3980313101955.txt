SUMMARY
. Statement of Purpose
The purpose of this environmental impact assessment (ELA) is to identify' the potential
impacts that the Natural Resource Management Project (NRMP) may have on aspects of
the biophysical and socio-economic environment. The document describes environmental
benefits that will occur as a result of the project and the likely mitigative measures that will
be required to avoid and/or minimize the negative impacts. An outline of an environmental
management plan is also included.
. Natural Resource Management Project
The project's primary objective is to establish the institutional and operational framework,
within the public and private sectors, for sustainable, participatory management of
Ghana's soil, water, wildlife and forest resources; conservation of biodiversity; and,
rehabilitation of degraded areas. It will assist communities to take lead responsibility in
management activities and strive to ensure that land and forest resources are sustained at
their optimum level of production and that opportunities for income generation are
widened, particularly for the growing numbers of disadvantaged rural poor who's actions
constitute a potentially serious factor in the degradation of these resources.
The project will be comprised of four components: high forest management (including
programs for collaborative forestry management, biodiversity and plantation
establishment), savanna resources ranagement, wildlife resource management, and,
environmental management coordination. Project support activities will include policy,
planning and institutional reforms, capacity development, resource infornmtion systems,
and the monitoring of land use changes.
Rationale
Ghana's forest resources are dwindling rapidly as a result of annual harvesting levels that
far exceed the country's allowable cut. As a result, certain timber species are scarce, flora
and fauna populations are being threatened as habitat is reduced, and in general, the
country's biodiversity is being reduced. If the current trend continues, the country could
lose most of its high forest resources over the next 25 years.
Communities that traditionally rely on forest products, particulrly the non-timber forest
products (NTFPs), are finding access to these products increasingly more difficult. Since
these products play such an important role in rural people's everyday lives and the local
economy, rural commumiies are feeling the impacts of resource demal in many ways, not
the least of which is a steady decline in overall well-being.
The project will address both of these major issues with a focus on sustainable forest
management and an involvement of local communities in the planning and implementation
1



process. In fact, local comnmunities will become more directly involved in the custodialship
of forest resources.
. Institutional and Legal Framework
. Forest and Wildlife Policy
The policy that will provide the basis of the project is the Forest and Wildlife Policy
(1994) which has the following objectives:
. Manage and enhance the permanent estate of forest and wildlife resources for the
preservation of soil and water resources, conservation of biological diversity and the
environment, and for sustainable production of domestic and commercial produce;
. Promote the development of viable and efficient forest-based industries, particularly in
secondary and tertiary processing;
P Promote public awareness and involvement of rural people in forestry and wildlife
conservation in order to maintain life-sustaining systems, preserve scenic areas and
enhance the potential of recreation, tourismn and income-generating opportunities;
. Develop effective capability at national, regional and distnct levels for sustainable
management of forest and wildlife resources.
Strategies relating to each of the policy objectives are outlined in the policy document.
These strategies are to be further expanded within the corporate statements and
operational plans of respective insitutions, and have been incorporated in the Forestry
Development Master Plan (1996-2020).
. Forestry Devdopment Master Plan (1996-2020)
A forestry management plan has been prepared to guide the implementation of the Forest
and Wildlife Policy and its successfil implementation is intended to maximize the rate of
social and economic development of the country and secure optimum welfare and
adequate means of livelihood for all Ghanaians.
The objectives of the Plan are scheduled into three time hoizons. Phase I (1996-2000)
will consolidate forest management systems to ensure that timber can be certified as
"sourced from sustainable managed forests" by the year 2000, and ensure implementation
of a Protected Areas Plan; development and launching of flexible schemes for investments
in commercial forest planons, tree farming and propagation of nontimber products and
wildlife; creation of an enabling climate for rationalization of the timber industry and
consolidation of fiscal measures for efficient uilization and increased value-added
processing. In Phase II (2001-2010) it is envisaged that maintenance of sustainable forest
and protected areas management systems will continue with maitenance of commercial
2



forest-based production systems and development of product harvesting, handling and
marketing facilities, as well as promotion of total value-added processing and competitive
marketing. Phase m (2011-2020) would include the continued maintenance of sustainable
forest and wildlife management systems, commercial production systems, improved
product harvesting and marketing, and competitive value-added processing industries.
. Methods for EIA
. participation
A team of nine members, representing different disciplines (environmental assessment,
forestry, ecology, management, sociology, economics, and forest industry) was assembled
for preparing the EIA. Limited field visits were conducted, particularly to the reserves and
communities surrounding the reserves, and to a cross section of the forest wood
processing industry. The main purpose of these visits was for the team members to
familiarize themselves with the project concept and to discuss with project stakeholders,
perceptions of impacts and issues as these relate to the project. The general public, NGOs,
communities, and other govenument agencies were all invited, through press notices, to a
general workshop on the ELA of the project.
data
Apart from information gained from the field surveys, secondary data was used for the
analysis.
. assessment
The basis of the assessment has been the identification of 27 important environmental
components (IECs). These are those segments of the envirownent that are likely to be
affected in one way or another by aspects of the project and which are deemed worthy of
attention. For each potential impact, six criteria (severity, extent, duration, probability,
frequency and reversibility) were considered. Each of these criteria were assigned
numerical ratings for levels of intensity. Totals for each imnpact situation were added to
determine the scale of significance for each impact.
. The Environment
. biophysical environment
Tropical high forests occur in the south-western third of the country and form part of the
Guinea-Congolean phytogeographical region. The high forest covers 8.2 million ha and
contains over 70% of the country's biodiversity. Two evergreen types (wet and moist)
occur in the extreme south-west comner of Ghana and receive the highest annual rainfall of
1,500-2,100mm. This is a floristic rich zone and supports many species which are absent
or rare elsewhere. The compleit of the high forest provides a variety of habitats, and
3



flora and fauna species. Excluding the mosses, Ghana has over 3,600 plant species and
2,214 of these are high forest species. The country is also home to 225 mammal species.
721 bird species, and 250 species of fish. There is a large number of threatened and
endangered species, including several primates, most of which rely on the habitats
provided by the high forest.
socioeconomic environment
Ghana has a population estimated at 12.5 million in 1994 and this is estimated to reach
20.0 million by the turn of the century. Farming and other agricutural activities supported
the main population in the rural areas and in 1984 approximately 61.1% of the population
was engaged in these activities. Employment in the timber industry is estimated at
130,000. In addition to the forest base providing jobs, both directly and indirectly, the
forest provides a large number of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) that supplement
rural fanily incomes. These products are essential for the day to day lives of rural
communities. In southern Ghana forests contribute to all aspects of rural life, providing
food, fodder, fueL medicines, building materials, materials for various household items, as
well as many more intangible benefits such as cultural symbols, rural artifacts and locales.
Impacts
In balance, the NRM is enviromnentally benign. It is a project that will lead towards
sustainable forest management and the involvement of people in the management of forest
areas in order that they can share equitably in the forest resource. The project will lead to
effective sustainable management of the resources of the savannah.
Of the 27 IECs identified and examined, the project would have both impacts on, and
benefits for, 17 of them. The project would provide only benefits for the remaining 10
EECs. Impacts by level are snumarized in Table 1. This table also summarizes the residual
impacts by level of significance. Table 2 indicates by level of significance the number of
cumulative impacts that would be expected.

Prior to mitigation, taking both impacts and benefits into account, Table 7.6 provides a
summary of overall significant ratings for IECs

As indicated above, the NRM is highly environmentally supportive and many of the
impacts on various IECs will be mitigated through various programs and components of
the project. Of the 17 EECs that will be negatively affected by the project, impacts on 7 of
them will be mitigated through planned project activities with an additional three being
mitigated through a combination of planned project activities with additional non-project
actions. Impacts on four EECs will be mitigated through the application of 'best practice
guidelines', and the remaining three impacts will be mnitigated through new additional
activities.
The most serious potential impacts that will, or could be, caused by the project are those
rated very high and highL These are briefly described below. As indicted in Table 1,
above, only one of these would result in a high residual impact.
s



. 'ery High impacts
Rare and endangered species and their habitats
Forest harvesting practices, if not carnied out judiciously and without consideration
to other forest values, can be very destructive towards plant and wildlife species
and habitat. Without the knowledge of biological resources in any particular area
to undergo harvesting, timber extraction could be devastating to rare and
endangered species that may inhabit these areas. A loss of these species would be a
very high impact. This potential impact will be avoided through project activities.
Surveys will be conducted to determine floral and faunal content of reserve and
non-reserve areas and where important species and habitats are located, these will
be protected from logging activities. These steps will be conducted through the
biodiversity protection program of the project. There will be no residual impact.
. Jobs and poverty
Reducing timber harvesting to allowable cut levels will reduce harvesting jobs.
This will reduce will output, and thus mill and other related forest industry jobs
will be reduced. For these workers, their dependents, and others in supporting
roles, poverty would be a real possibility. Loss of jobs and poverty creation is a
very high impact of the project. However, by taking these reduction steps now, it
means that the jobs that will be retained in a much reduced forest industry will be
sustainable. Through training, better resource management through the
collaborative forestry program and the savannah resource management program,
and with additional jobs created in the wood processing sector as a result of more
efficient wood recovery, most of the effects of the lost jobs will be reduced, if not
totally eliminated. Better resource management in the high forest and the savannah
will contribute to poverty reduction. The residual impact will be highL This residual
impact of losing some jobs has to be considered in view of a 'do nothing'
alternative which would lead eventually to a complete loss of the forest industry as
forests would be eliminated over the next 25 years.
High Impacts
. fauna and biodiversity
There are three potentiaBy high impacts and these relate to fauna (two impacts
related to harvestng and plantation development) and biodiveity. As with the
rare and endangered species and habitats described above, these are impacts that
could possibly occur as a result of harvesting operations (and plantation
development). For the same reasons, these potential impacts would be avoided
almost entirely through the location identification of important species and habitats
and forest management plans that ensure the protection of these values. Since
6



harvesting and plantation establishment will affect some animal populations and
habitats, the residual impact will be moderate.
Benefits
The project will provide a large number of environmental benefits. For each of the  7
IECs the project will produce a benefit, albeit many would be relatively insigriificant As
indicated in Table 1, ten of the [ECs yield only environmental benefits, and no negative
impacts. What is most important is the net overall effect of the project on the environment.
There are only four negative net effects against 13 positive effects. This does not include
the ten IECs for which there is only a positive benefit. This is conclusive evidence that the
project, assuming fill and effective implementation, will be overall environmentally
beneficial.
. Project Altermatives
There are no real project altematives other than the alternative of 'do nothing'. The
report provides several alternative paths that a project concept development could have
followed but it is clear that the concept of NRMP as it currently stands would be the most
environmentally supporive. If other alternative paths had been followed, the negative
impacts would have been greater in number and significance, and the overall net effect
would not have been as favorable.
. Environmental Management
An environmental management plan has been prepared. It outlines the mitigative actions
that will be required for each impact. It also indicates the inputs required, the outputs and
results expected, the responsibilities for enswring implementaion, and, in very broad
tenns, the cost and scheduling required. Indicative costs for implementg mitigative
measures total US $ 955,000.

1. INTRODUCTION and BACKGROUND
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this environmental impact assessment (EIA) is to identify the potential
impacts that the Natural Resource Management Project (NRMP) could have on aspects of
the biophysical and socio-economic environment. The document describes environmental
benefits that will occur as a result of the project and the likely nutigative measures that will
be required to avoid and/or minimize the negative impacts. An outline of an environmental
management plan is also included.
1.2 Natural Resource Management Project - A Concept
Although referred to as the NRM, at the time of preparing the EIA the project is oni ;n
the conceptual stage and a full project design has yet to be prepared. Consequently.
EIA is carried out on the basis of the project concept document which lacks final prc.
detail. The assumption made whilst the EIA was conducted was that forest management,
which is the nucleus of the Project, will be implemented along the lines descibed in the
forestry development management plan, 1996-2020. As well, it was assumed that the
principles and guidelines that have been developed by the Forestry Department (FD) for
collaborative forest management will be a focus of the Project.
The EIA will provide a number of environmental giidelines relevant to forest management
and these should be considered as the FD proceeds from the project concept stage to
detailed project design.
It is noted that the project concept is based on the need for Ghana to institute an effective
sustainable resource management and development progrm Accordingly, the objectives
and strategies of the concept are environmentally sound in principle and yield a number of
benefits that will offset the few negative impacts likely to occur.
1.3 Ghana's Forestry Sector
1.3.1 Forest Resources
At the turn of the century the forest zone of Ghana covered about 34% of the total land
area. However, by 1987 over 75% of the land area originally covered by forests had been
cleared. This corresponds to a deforestation rate of 0.84% (684km2) per ann although
the deforestation rate appears to have been decreasing in recent years. The total volumc cf
timber extracted between 1986-92 was 7.8 million m3 or 7.5% of the standing v' ne.
Ghana has established 266 forest reserves, 204 of which occupy 1.6 million ha   ie high
forest zone and 62 which occupy 0.6 million ha in the savanna zone. Forest res. .s were
origially created for purposes of ecological stability, watershed protecuon and
8



windbreaks, while at the same time contributing to socio-economic welfare through a
continual flow of products and services.
Production reserves constitute almost 45% of the total forest estate, with the rest
designated for protection, conservation and research. Reserved forest areas have been
demarcated and managed as permanent forest estates for the preservation of vital soil and
water resources, conservation of biological diversity and the environment, and
sustainability production of domestic and commercial produce. The forest reserves
provide the source from which the bulk of the nation's timber is produced.
Based on the 1986-87 forest inventory, 32% of the total forest reserve area is in a
degraded state requiring rehabilitation.
In the off-reserve areas forested land has been widely exploited and deforested, resulting
in a residual forest cover of only approximately 400,00ha of forest cover. The off-reserve
areas have high potential for private forestry and farming activities and are destined to be
appropriated for agriculture. These areas consist of intact forests, bush fallows and
agncultural areas. The intact forests are located mainly in the Western Region of the
country and have substantial forest canopy cover with forest composition similar to the
reserved areas. The bush fallows are secondary growth from abandoned farms with high
potential, assuming adequate management, for maturing into high forest. The agricultural
lands are characterized by a relatively high density of trees on farms. The off-reserve areas
contain about 268 million m3 of standing timber of which about 101 million m3 is reported
to be contained in trees exceeding the minimum felling size.
Farmers on whose land much of the off-reserve timber is located have no right to fell or
sell timber trees. Farmers do not benefit from timber exploitation on their farms, and
compensation for damage caused by felling and hauling is inadequate. Farmers whose land
is under concession often destroy all timber trees when clearing new ground in order to
avoid the risk of damage to the farm by the concessionaire. As long as timber on the farm
has no value to the farmer there will be no replenishment of indigenous timber trees
outside the reserves. The principle of enhancing or modifying forest management systems
to ensure that they address local needs and engender local cooperation is enshrined in the
new Forest and Wildlife Policy as described in Section 2.
The annual sustainable yields from the timber production area of forest reserves is
currently estimated at close to 0.5 million m3 and includes 64 economic timber species. A
recently completed inventory confirms that a harvest of 0.5 million m3 can be sustained for
99 years from off-reserve areas, provided proper use is made of all timber species (Scarlet,
Red and Pink Stars). This harvest, together with the increasing yield from plantations as
they mature, will provide an estimated annual sustainable level of 1.0 million mn3. Assuming
that this level of harvest can be maintained during the next twenty years and that
encroachment and fire damage can be minimIzed, the condition of the forest estate should
steadily improve. At the same time, savanna woodland management, afforestation and
9



aroforestry initiatives should result in an expansion of forested areas and general tree
cover.
It is necessary that proper controls are maintained to forestall fuirher encroachment by
farners, poachers and illegal chainsaw operators. Wildfires, over-exploitation of preferred
species and resurgence of speculative felling must also be controlled. The annual allowable
cut will have to be strictly enforced by an effective forest service while increased stumpage
fees are applied to encourage greater efficiency of utilization and better retums to the
forest owners.

1.3.2 Timber Management
The average annual rate of deforestation in Ghana since the tum of the century has been
estimted at about 75,OOOha ApproXimateY one third of Ghana's forest area of 8.3
million ha has been removed between 1955 and 1972 as a result of excessive harvesting.
Salvage logging practices of the early 1970s allowed unlimited feUing of the largest or
over-mature trees on a 15 year felling cycle. As well, the high grading of high value
species before the log export ban that was introduced in 1979 contributed significantly to
forest degradation and depletion. Since this time, due to the increased acfivity of a larger
number of desirable species, recent logging activities have been more intensified in the
semi-deciduous zone than in the evergreen forest. However, illegal harvesting has
increased and some of the drier zones are currently in critical condition.
In the past the forestry sector lacked an updated and clearly defined forest policy that set
out goals, objectives and strategies for the development of the count ry's forest resources
and the fiuture direction for the iber industry. In the absence of an effecve
administration there was widespread trade indiscipline, failure to pay royalties and other
statutory fees, speculative felling; illegal trading in Property Marks and unauthorized
subletting of concessions to illicit timber operators. Outdated legal sanctions and very low
fine structures offered no deterrence to offenders. The situation was further aggravated by
1o



a lack of local community involvement in forest resource protection and an absence of
comprehensive and coordinated medium to long term planning.
In addition, loggers and chainsaw operators could operate illegally with impunity as a
result of the lack of cooperation from the law enforcement agencies and the judiciary. As
well, the logging and sawmilling subsectors have been dominated by illiterate and ill-
informed operators, a misinformed print media, lack of unity within private sector trade
associations and a problem of financial intermediation.
While efforts were being made to strengthen regulatory agencies, both forest and wildlife
resources were subjected to a dramatic rise in the rates of exploitation, mainly by logging
and sawmilling interests, as well as by illegal chainsaw operators and hunters. A significant
increase in the rate of timber harvesting began to occur in 1992 in the off-reserve areas, an
activity that was encouraged as a result of the increased vigilance on reserves and the
emergence of Far East log export markets. In order to contain these threats to the
sustainability of the nation's resources, a series of ad hoc control measures were
introduced and have succeeded, to a degree, in stabilizing the sector. These measures
have included: regulations to control illegal chainsaw operators; temporary suspension of
log exports; and, a timber auction to clear the stockpiled logs. Subsequently, other
initiatives have been taken, including a mobile forest protection action group, the
temporary suspension of log exports, and, the felling controls for off-reserve harvesting.
The recent Forest and Wildlife Policy, approved in November 1994, provides the
foundation upon which to build an effective sustainable resource management program for
the country.
1.3.3 Forest Management System
Early management was based on the principle of sustained yield management using low
intensity selection harvesting and natural regeneration. However, management was carried
out in the absence of proper forest inventories. The Modified Selection System was
applied during the period 1956-1970. In 1970 the Girth Limit System (GLS) was
introduced. Since 1989 when reliable inventory data was made available the forty year
felling cycle was adopted. Today the reserve forests are grouped into 52 Forest
Management Units (FMUs). Each FMU has a management or working plan covering a
period of 20 years and which is based on the designation of each reserve into zones
according to management objectives. Objectives could include timber production,
watershed management, and commercial production of NTFPs. Agreements with forest
resource users are entered into and these include Timber Utilization Contracts (TUCs) and
Social Responsibility Agreements (SRAs).
Three major forest management systems have been employed, including the Uniform, the
Selection and the Emichiment Systems. For vaTious reasons the Unfform and Emiclunent
Systems have been all but abandoned and Reserve management is presently carried out
under the Selection system.
11



In the off-reserve areas the local communities held allodial title over forested areas for
purposes of local revenue generation. Since Independence in 1957, however, the state has
attained control over the timber resource in the off-reserve areas even thouah land title
was retained by the stools. in recent years, as a result of sustainable management being
practiced in the reserves, exploitation has been high in the off-reserve areas as operators
and wood processors stnve to maintain their output volumes. Table 1.2 indicates the
timber harvesting trend in recent years. A significant increase in production in the early
1990s was due to an increase in log export to Southeast Asia which in turn brought about
a temporary suspension of log exports in 1995.

1.3.4 Forest Industry'
Officially recorded levels of harvest have risen from under 1.0 million m3 per year in the
late 1980s to 1.8 million e3 in 1994. The acual level of cut is higher due to illegal logging.
The sustainable level of amnual harvest is probably about 1.0 million m3 per year, of which
0.3 million e3 would come for the most valuable and heavily exploited species on
reserves. Domestic demand may be in the order of 0.7 million n3 per year suggesting that
it would be possible to continue to export around 0.4 million m3 per year of roundwood
equivalent without importng or exceeding the sustainedable cut; this compares with
export of around 1.5 million e3 of roundwood equivalent in 1994.
The wood processing industry contributes about 6% of GDP and earned DM 354 million
for exports in 1994. In addition, the economy benefits from other forest products,
including fuelwood, charcoal and non-timber forest products. This may raise the GDP
contribution to perhaps 8%. It is also possible to take a broader view of the overall
contribution of the sector to the economy, taking account of non-market benefits and
other outputs which are not recorded in official statistics. The forest timber industry
employs some 130,000 people.
'Foresly Conissimi 1995.
12



There is evidence of a rapidly growing over-capacity in the industry, with potential
sawmilling capacity of perhaps 2 million m' per year. This over capacity is associated with
a profitable industry based on access to a cheap resource and high export demand. As a
result of these cheap resources, there is no incentive for improving upon the existing low
recovery rates. The wood processing industry recognizes that there is likely to be a
problem with resource availability in the future. Although a few companies have helped to
develop the resource through the establishment of plantations, the general view is that this
is a responsibility of Government. Some companies are successfully finding markets for
finished products manufactured from lesser known species.
The impact of continuing exploitation at the 1993194 levels would include comnmercial
extinction of the 38 main timber species by 2015, together with the associated loss of jobs,
economic activity and export earniings. About six of the species would become
commercially extinct over the next five years. At some time between 2005 and .2015
Ghana would become a net importer of wood in order to meet domestic demand.
Initiatives aimed at improving marketing of value-added products, for training and for
research into utilzation of lesser used species should continue. The current range of
industrial investment incentives available to the wood processing industy should be better
targeted and, in particular, these initiatives should not be available for investment in new
sawmilling primary breakdown equipment.
The timber industry is comprised of three categories of operation including primary
(logging), secondary (sawmilling/plymilling/veneering) and tertiary (furniture, mouldings,
flooring, etc.). The industry is dominated by private ownership and is comprised of a
number of establishments as indicated in Table 1.3.
Sawmilling dominates the secondary industry and almost all of the sawmill production
from the larger and medium size mills is exported. Sawuilling capacity is about 2.7 million
m3per annum. This capacity far exceeds the total annual allowable cut of I milion m.
Most mills lack sufficient resaw capacity to achieve a higher recovery rate than the current
38%.
Over the past few years there has been an increasing demand for kiln dried. lumber and kiln
drying facilities have been increasing in number to take advantage of this value added step.
In the five year period between 1991 and 1995 exports of kiln dried lumber have increased
almost five fold. The total inaed capacity of the 16 veneer and plywood plants is I
million m . An explanation for the low capacity ufilization is the fact that the annual
allowable cut is also equal to this figure.

The tertiary sector is comprised of 40 large and medium scale furiture companies and
45,000 registered small scale carpenters. The sector relies heavily on illegal chain saw
operators for its raw material supply since material from the sawmills is almost exclusively
exported.
Under current management plans for the reserves and the proposed management of off-
reserve areas, the timber industry faces a grim future. Harvested volumes, and thus, wood
supply to the secondary industry, will be reduced significantly. The industry, in general,
continues to experience below capacity utiliion and in many cases some plants will no
doubt be forced to closed. For others, improved recovery rates will be necessary if they
are to remain solvent.
1.3.5 Biodiversity
Habitat loss and degradation, the major causes of biodiversity loss, have been rapid and
dramatic in Ghana. Within the last 100 years 80% of the high forest has been cleared
mainly for conversion to agncultural crops. Heavy losses have also occurred through
logging, bush fires and mining. Clearances, with irreversible loss of biodiversity, have bee
most severe in the high and savanna forest types. To a lesser extent, wetland and
mangrove forests have been similarly affected. The genetic vanation of terrestrial fauna
and flora continue to be threatened. In the past the gathering of minor forest products
such as wild plants and animals from the forest was insignificant since it was only carried
out on a non-commercial basis. However, in recent years the pracuce has become
signficantly commerciazed with an increased demand for non-timber forest products
(NTFPs) as the country's population ises. Ghana now experiences levels of resource
utilization far exceeding the productive capacities of the exploited species to be sustained.
1.3.6 Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs)
Although the FD put back into place the fundamental elements of sustainable forest
management trough centralized planning, yield regulation and protected areas, it
recognized that some forest values had been neglected. Notably these included the
14



provision of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), spiritual and cultural values, and broad
environmental services. Whilst the original reservation policies embodied elements of
participatorv forestry, notably the encouragement of local by-laws for reserve
management, over time forest management planning and harvesting have been regulated
through a svstem of expensive short term permits which has not encouraged stewardship
amongst the NTFP gatherers. Revenue earned from permits is not re-invested in NTFP
management.
"For those who come face to face, without relief, with the harrowing experiences
of ill health, hunger and other forms of deprivation, the reality is the enormous
contnbution NTFPs, in all their variedforms, make to all aspects of their lives
(Falconer, 1993)2
NTFPs are important among the rural poor, particularly as economic buffers. They
provide opportunities for earning cash, for paying medical expenses, school fees, or to buy
food during the 'hungry season'. It is estimated that about 75% of the population regularly
consumes wild animals, fish, insects, caterpillars, termites and snails. About 80%o of the
rural population depends on wild resources for their basic protein requirements.
1.4 Ghana's Wildlife Sector
Ghana displays a rich faunal community of mammals and bird species. lt has the richest
and most diverse butterfly populations in the region. However, inspite of this richness, the
attitude of most Ghanaians towards wildlife is utilitarian. It is widely recognized as an
important component of the diet and cash income of nrral populations.
The first game reserves were legally constituted in 1909, with the promulgation of the first
wildlife laws going back to 1901. From this time up to independence in 1957, the Forestry
Department and other departments were given the responsibility of administering the
Game Preservation Ordinance. Clearly wildlife prior to independence was of secondary
concern to the colonial government, as exemplified with the creation of the Game Control
Unit in 1953 that was given the responsibility of eliminating game and the removal of
riverine habitat for purposes of tsetse control. Soon after independence Ghana's first
Game Department was established.3 Most of the existing wildlife reserves were largely
designated during the 1970s and since that time only two additional areas have been
gazetted.
Ghana's wildlife protected area system comprises six National Parks, six Resource
Reserves, one Strict Nature Reserve and three Wildlife Sanctuaries. The total area for
legally gazetted protected areas is 12,685 km2 which represents about 5.32% of Ghana's
land area. With the current establishment of five coastal wetland protected areas, along
2 Dcpa=ment of Foestry. 1995.
3GWDIIUCN. 1994.
15



with the Kvabobo Range National Park, the total protected area system will cover over
13,385 kmn.
Until as recently as 1994, there was very little difference in wildlife manazement
objectives. With the latest Policy Statement (1994) from the WD a standard system of
zoning has been prepared as well as definitions and management objectives.
Wildlife resources of Ghana are not currently a focus of regional tourism. With the
exception of three areas (Mole, Shai Hills, and Kakum) the protected areas receive few
visitors. Mole NP, which has accommodation facilities, receives 3,000-5,000 visitors
annually and Kakum NP receives up to 750 visitors a week.4
1.5 Related Donor Activities
1.5.1 Forest Resource Management Project (FRMP)
This project became effective in November 1989 and is due to be completed in June 1997.
A number of key reforms have been implemented in the areas of logging concessions,
forest revenue, policy and administration. Specifically, the FRMP has (i) strengthened
management capacity within the ULF, leading to improvements in forest sector
monitoring and regulation; (ii) improved timber royalty collection and disbursement to
local traditional authorities (Stools); (iii) improved capacity of the Wildfire Departnent for
protected area (PA) management and facilitated development of ten PA management
plans; (iv) achieved limited progress in on-fann tree planting through reorienting the
Agroforestry Units towards supportng community nurseries and implementing a
promising pilot for locally-based savanna woodland mement in the Upper East Region
through the Rural Forestry Division; and, (v) strengthened research and training capacity
through support to the Forestry Research Insttute of Ghana and the Institute of
Renewable Natural Resources.
1.5.2 Environmental Resource Management Project (GERMP)
The GERMP became effective in March 1993 and will close December 1997. The project
explicitly recognizes the intersectoral nature of environmental management and has
provided support for institutional strengthening of the Environmenal Protection Agency
(EPA) in its central role as a coordinating and regulatory body to stimulate reforms within
the sectoral ministries and agencies to improve environmental monitoring and
management. A coherent body of regulatory guidelines, standards and monitoring
protocols have been adopted for implementation by the sectoral agencies. The principal
lesson from the project has been the value of investing in strengthening capacity of
sectoral agencies for elements of sectoral activity.

1.5.3 Coastal Wetlands Management Project (CWMP)
The CNWMP is financed by the GEF as an integral component of the ERMP, within the
same time frame as the CAWP. It has addressed the issue of maintaining- the ecological
integrity of coastal wetland ecosystems under a multiple use management regime. The
project has been carried out with significant input from local stakeholders in both the
planning and implementation phases.
2. POLICY, LEGAL and ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
2.1 Forest and Wildlife Policy
TThe needfor specific government guidacme and control offorestry activities in Ghana
has become necessary due to changes that have occurred in the nature of Ghana 'sforests
since the adoption of the 1948 Forest Policy. This need also underpins our sensitivint to
the serious reduction in the forest land area and the increasing local and international
outcry over environmental issues relating to the forest Besides, forestry plays a major
role in the growth and development of the Ghanaian economy and the maintenance of
environmental quality. With increasing demandfor forest landfor agricultural purposes
due to population pressure, advances in science and technology, growing ecological
importance of the forest in terms of genetic biodiversity apnd wildlife, izstitutiontal
changes, and the increasing needfor popular participation in resource management, the
under)ving justification for the earlier policy (1948 forest policy) no longer appeared
applicable. There is the needfor a newforest policy that provides a new set ofprinciples
for sustainable forest management and establishes key priorities for its future
development.
(Foreword to Forest and Wildlife Policy, 1994, by Dr. Kwabena Adjei Minister of Lands
and Forestry)
The importance of sustainable forest management is recognized in the Forest and Wildlife
Policy of 1994. The Forest and Wildlife Policy of Ghana aims at conservation and
sustainable development of the nation's forest and wildlife resources for maintenance of
environmental quality and perpetual flow of optimm benefits to all segments of society.
The guiding principles of the policy statement are based on national conviction and
international guidelines and conventions.
The objectives of the policy are to:
Manage and enhance the permanen estate of forest and wildlife resources for the
preservation of soil and water resources, conservation of biological diversity and the
environment, and for sustainable production of domestic and commercial produce;
- 17



Promote the development of Viable and efficient forest-based industries, particularly in
secondary and tertiary processing;
Promote public awareness and involvement of rural people in forestm and wildlife
conservation in order to maintain life-sustaining systems, preserve scenic areas and
enhance the potential of recreation, tourism and income-generating opporrunities,
. Develop effective capability at nationaL, regional and district levels for sustainable
management of forest and wildlife resources.
Strategies relating to each of the policy objectives are outlined in the policy document.
These strategies are to be further expanded within the corporate statements and
operational plans of respective institutions, and have been incorporated in the Forestry
Development Master Plan (1996-2020).
Forestry policy instrumentation that should be put into practice5 include:
!higher species-differentiated forest fees
l Iog export levies phased in as bans phased out
. implementation of competitive concession allocation with social criteria
. realistic sanctions and effective enforcement by foresters and the judicial system
c consideration of market-based instruments, such as forest certification, as complements
to regulatory and fiscal approaches
. farner rights to fees for timber trees on farm land
. compensation to farmers for farm damage from logging, enforced on a district basis
. adaptive local projects involving co-management of forests at village and concession
level as learning vehicles for improving policies
2.2 Forestry Development Master Plan (1996-2020)
The master plan has been prepared to guide the implementation of the Forest and Wldlife
Policy and its successful implementation is intended to maximize the rate of social and
economic development of the country and secure optimum welfare and adequate means of
livelihood for all Ghanaians.
The Plan recogmizes that success in management and sustainable development of
renewable resources is dependent on effective institutions as well as an enabling
environment in which all players can operate optimally. It recognizes the dynamic
interaction of socio-economic activities and envionmental effects, within and impinging
on the sector. It outlines a series of scenarios which would ultimately arrive at the
projected aim of the Forest and Wildlife Policy and proposes a schedule of programs,
project profiles and activities by which scenarios can be reaized. The goal of the Plan is
5Forsey Dpa=nt. 1996.
18



identical to the aims of the Policy, and the objectives of the Plan are the same as those of
the Policy
The objectives of the Plan are scheduled into three time horizons. Phase I (1996-2000)
will consolidate forest management systems to ensure that timber can be certified as
"sourced from sustainable managed forests" by the year 2000, and ensure implementation
of a Protected Areas Plan; development and launching of flexible schemes for investments
in commercial forest plantations, tree fanming and propagation of non-timber products and
wildlife; creation of an enabling climate for rationalization of the timber industry and
consolidation of fiscal measures for effcient utilization and increased value-added
processing. In Phase II (2001-2010) it is envisaged that maintenance of sustainable forest
and protected areas management systems will continue with maintenance of commercial
forest-based production systems and development of product harvesting, handling and
marketing facilities, as well as promotion of total value-added processing and competitive
marketing. Phase m (2011-2020) would include the continued maintenance of sustainable
forest and wildlife management systems, commercial production systems, improved
product harvesting and marketing, and competitive value-added processing industries.
2.3 Logging Manual for Forest Management in Ghana
The logging manual sets out a number of environmentaly related requirements for timber
operators. These include requirements for road location, road standards, construction and
maintenance. As wel, requirements for log dumps, skidding, felling, the size of logging
machinery and guidelines for fire protection are given.
The requirements provided in the Logging Manual are in accordance with the provisions
of the:
. Forest Protection Decree 1974, NRCD 243
. Forest Protection (Amendment) Law 1986, PNDCL 142
. Trees and Timber Decree 1974, NRCD 273
. Control of Bush Fires Law 1990, PNDCL 229
The Chief Conservator of Forests or his representative shall be responsible for the
monitoring and enforcement of the conditions contained within the manual.
2.4 Biodiversity Protection
There is no comprehensive legislation in Ghana relating to the protection of biodiversity,
however, there are several pieces of sector based legislation. These include the Wildlife
Animal Preservation Act, 1961 (Act 43); the Wildlife Conservation Regulation, 1971 (LI
685) which issues permits and certificates for endangered species, and the Forest
Ordinance (CAP 157).
19



The Ghana National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, a commitment to Ghana's
signatory status of the Convention on Biodiversity, is proposed to determine the future
direction of biodiversity management in Ghana. The plan is currently being prepared and
wiU focus on improving the scientific knowledge base through inventories, and
documentation of biodiversity in Ghana, and the identification of potential threats and how
these can be controlled. The plan also intends to enhance sustainable utilization of
biological resources.
Relevant to the biodiversity strategy and action plan is the forest protection strategy. A
comprehensive survey of forest plant diversity survey undertaken in 1992 resulted in the
development of a framework strategy for protecting the forests' genetic diversity. This
strategy prioritizes a range of protective uses for forest reserves to support environmental
stability, plant genetic conservation and for rehabilitation of degraded reserves. lIn these
areas logging is not allowed but NTFP extraction is permitted in some categories.
Fine grain measures ensure that specific forest species are given differential protection
based on a relative conservation priority system. Each forest species has a 'star rating'
based on its national and international distribution with subsidiary consideration of its
ecology and taxonomy. The ratings of black, gold, blue, red,  and green denote
'biodiversity merit'. The highest priority species for protection in Ghana is, or are, very
rare both nationally and internationally. These are given ultimate protection within the
forest management system.
2.5 Environmental Protection'
The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1994 (Act 490) transformed the
Environmental Protection Council (EPC) into an Agency having, inter alia, regulatory and
enforcement roles. The EPC had been established by the Environmental Protection
Decree, 1974 (NRCD 239) and was subsequently amended by the EPC (Amendment)
Decree, 1976 (SMCD 58).
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was formally established in December 1994
and given the responsibility of regulating the environment and ensuring the implementation
of Government policies on the environment. Under the EPA Act (1994), the EPA will,
amongst other duties: "ensure compliance with any laid down environmental impact
assessment procedures in the planning and execution of development projects, including
compliance in respect of existng projects".
The Environmental Assessment and Audit Department of the EPA has the overall
administrative oversight of the Agency's mandate to ensure compliance with established
EIA procedures in the planning and execution of development projects in Ghana

2.6 Other Relevant Policies and Legislation
. National Agricultural Policy
The National Agricultural Policy aims at ensuring food security, and will influence
biodiversity.
. National Land Policy
The National Land Policy aims at protecting the variety of habitat types. The policy
categorically states that "all lands declared as forest reserves, strict game reserves, national
parks, wildlife and similar land categories ...... are fully protected for ecosystem
maintenance and biodiversity conservation.
. Long Term Development Plan (Vision 2020)
Ghana's Long Term Development Plan (Vision 2020) is conunitted to the conservation of
biological diversity and to ensuring that its components are utilized in a sustainable manner
for the continued progress and socio-economic development of its people.
2.7 International Policies
Ghana has endorsed certain international principles including those of the Tropical Timber
Organization, the Rio Declaration, the African Convention on Wildlife Conservation, the
Convention on Intemational Trade in Endangered Species, and others.
A non-legally binding statement of Forest Principles was negotiated at the Rio Conference
in 1992. The statement recognized the need to conserve, manage and sustainably develop
all types of forests as well as recognizing the sovereign rights of nations to utilize their
forests. Agenda 21 contained programs for the protection and sustainable management of
forests. The International Tropical Timbr Organization has developed guidelines on the
sustainable management of forests, with the aim that by the year 2000 timber exports from
member countries will originate from sustainably managed forests.
Sustainable management of forests will continue to have high profile as an issue on the
international agenda. However, it is unclear how far the environmental arguments could be
used to persuade the World Trade Organization (the successor body to GATT) to accept
the pragmatic need for such measures.
Ghana is signatory to a number of international conventions related to the environment
and aspects of these conventions will affect how forests will be managed in the future.
These conventions are briefly described below.
21



. Biodiversity
Ghana is a signatory to the Convention on Biodiversity which came into force in 1993. As
a signatorY, Ghana agrees that biotic wealth is the basis of life and livelihood and that
greater efforts are required to protect, understand and wisely use the earth's biodiversity
Under the terms of the Convention. each country is responsible for developing a strategy
for the conservation of its natural biological diversity. A central prescription for the
implementation of the Convention is the strengthening of protected areas which calls upon
nations to "identify national and international priorities for strengthening protected areas
and enhancing their role in biodiversity conservation".
. Desertification
Ghana is signatory to the Convention on Desertification. A National Corrmittee on
Desertification has been constituted and a National Action Plan (NAP) on Desertification
has been prepared. The purpose of the NAP is to transform the provisions of the
convention on desertification into concrete actions and measures to combat desertification
and mitigate the effects of drought.
. Wetlands
The RAMSAR Convention is intended to identify and protect wetlands of international
importance, particularly those that are required habitat for migrating bird species. Ghana is
a signatory to the Convention and its commitment is reflected in the current establishment
of five coastal wetland protected areas.
, Montreal Protocol (Ozone Layer Depletion)8
In July 1989 Ghana ratified the Montreal Protocol and ratified its London Amendments in
July 1992. Ghana has established an Ozone Office to oversee the implementation of
various projects to phase out ozone depletion substances from Ghana by 2010.
2.8 Administrative Framework'
2.8.1 General
The proposed project will be comprised of a number of components. The management and
administration of the project will be canied out under the auspices of a number of different
agencies within the Ministzy of Lands and Forestry. The relevant agencies are described in
the following sections.

22



2.8.2 Ministry of Lands and Forestry
Institutional support for the forestry sector is provided through the Ministry of Lands and
Forestry (MLF). The MLF is responsible for policy formulation and implementation of
natural resource conservation and management programs.
The MLF is responsible to the Cabinet and Parliament. It includes two line departments:
Forestry Department (FD) and the Department of Wildlife (WD). These departments are
the 'managers' of the country's forest and wildlife resources, respectively. In addition, the
ministry includes two quasi-government institutions: the Timber Export Development
Board (TEDB) and the Forest Products Inspection Bureau (FPIB). An organogram
displaying forest administration in the country is provided at Figure 2.1.
2.8.3 Forestry Department
The FD is responsible for the development of an integrated forest management system for
the permanent forest estate and collaborative approaches to management of off-reserves,
as well as the latter's regulation in matters of exploitation. The FD has carried out its
responsibilities through an organizational fiamework employing various instruments of
conservation, management and working plans, allocation of timber rights, inventory
planning and a series of regulations to ensure moral responsibility regarding forest
conservation and protection.
The FD has four Deputy Chief Conservators of Forest which direct programs for forest
resource development, rural forestry, and taining. It also has an extensive regional and
district network.
Currently proposals are being considered for the conversion of the Forestry Deparnment to
a Forest Service with a semi-autonomous staus, permitting a mandate to determine its
own sources and levels of revenues, management options and a new direction of
accountability.
2.8.4 Department of Wildlife
The Department of Wldlife (WD) is responsible for the conservation of the country's
wildlife resources. It is mandated to establish, protect and manage wildlife sanctuaries and
game protection reserves as well as carry out sinilar responsibilities for wildlife outside
the conservation areas. The WD is under the direction of a Chief Wdidlife Officer who has
the equivalent status of the Chief Conservator of Forests. The Department has 29
professional officers.
2.8.5 Forestry Commission
Forest administration is governed by a complex set of laws. Developments in the national
economy over the past 40 years have seen an expansion in the scope of laws, extending
23



bevond the provisions under the Forest Ordinance of 1927 for a forest policy
implementing arm of government to the establishment of laws mandating specialist
agencies to oversee forest utilization. The 1979 and 1982 Constitutions have developed
and sustained a concept of establishing Comrnmissions to regulate utilization of Ghana's
natural resources, bringing into being a Forestry Commission (FC).
The main role of the FC is to provide advice on policy and related implementation issues.
It manages the peripheral linkages of relevance to MLF's policy objectives. The FC is
responsible for the regulation and management of the utilization of forest and wildlife
resources of the country. The FC is also responsible for monitoring and coordinating
policy implementation relevant to forest and wildlife resource management and utilization.
The FC is currently active in the area of policy analysis.
The FC is comprised of heads of forestry policy implementation agencies and
representatives of stakeholder group interests including the private sector. The FC
Secretariat consists of two divisions with professional staff.
2.8.6 Ghana National Biodiversity Strategy ind Action Plan
The strategy and action plan is proposed to determine the future direction of biodiversity
management in Ghana. Under World Bank sponsorship the document is still in its
preparatory phase. Its main strategies and action plans include improving the scientific
knowledge base through inventories and documentation of biodiversity in Ghana and
identiISring any potential threats and how to counter/control them. It also plans to enhance
sustainable utilization of biological resources including use of biotechnology.
In forest reserves and GWD protected reas, communities at the present time are not
involved in direct biodiversity management. However, a collaborative program is currently
being developed by the FD to involve local communities, particulariy those living near
forest reserves, in the planing and management of forests.
3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION'°
3.1 Project Objectives
The project's primary objective is to establish the institonal and operational framework,
within the public and private sectors, for suainable, participatory management of
Ghana's soil, water, wildlife and forest resources; conservation of biodiversity; and,
rehabilitation of degraded areas. It will assist communities to take lead responsibility in
management activities and strive to enure that land and forest resources are sustained at
their optimum level of production. It will provide opporauities for income generation
"'World Bak. 1997.
24



expansions particularly for the growing numbers of disadvantaged rural poor who's
actions constitute a potentially senious factor in the degradation of these resources.
3.2 Rationale
The expected programs for managing the land, water, vegetation and animal resources.
including rehabilitation of degraded areas, would place priority on private sector
responsibility, particularly the rural communities taking ownership of the operations,
including poverty alleviating activities. While some communities are already aware of the
declining productivity of the land, the shrinking natural resource base, and the increasing
poverty among substantial numbers of the growing population, the magnitude and
seriousness of these problems is not generally appreciated. There is also inadequate
general recognition that simple practical measures to halt or reverse degradation trends
and restore at least in part, the natural balance on the land, are available and could be
implemented locally with modest inputs. These programs would be formulated on a broad
basis within the framework of sound land use planning, and in accordance with the
capability of the land. The project would assist communities, acting through local trade
groups and producer associations, families, schools, individuals and other stakeholder
entities, to restore degraded areas, and manage the resources for efficient and sustainable
production. This would build on experience gained during the last decade with community
approaches to improving local enviromnental and living conditions.
3.3 Project Components
In support of these objectives the project will adopt a broad sectoral lending approach and
will have the following components:
3.3.1 High Forest Management
This component will support the inplementation of policy and institutional reforms
designed to streamline public forest sector agencies and strengthen their technical
capacity. Institutional restructuring will emphasize the role of public agencies in providing
technical assistance in the development of collaborative forest management plans with the
private sector, in monitoring and surveitlance of management plan implementation, and in
extension of good forest management practices into non-reserve areas.
The core objective of this component will be to facilitate the transition from central
govemnment management to community-based collaborative management of the
approximately 200 national forest reserves within the high forest zone. This will involve,
inter atia, restructuring of the Forestry Department into a smaller more autonomous
forestry service with the possible incorporation of more independent forest operation/log
movement, coupled with concessionaire performance bonding, and a new royalty structure
to properly reflect the real value of the timber resource and to protect scarce species. To
this end, the project will finance training, technical assistance and operational costs
associated with the institutional reform programL
25



It wil also support the collaborative forest management initiative through assistance with
participatory planning and institutional development, preparation and implementation of
forest reserve and forestry district level management plans, promotion of low impact
logging methods and direct involvement of local communities in forest reserve
management. It will finance training and technical assistance for implementation of
participatory planning and co}laborative management of forest reserves, operational
support for implementing management plans, and technical support for monitoring and
surveillance of forest management initiatives.
Financed by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), the project will identify and
document priority areas of global importance for biodiversity conservation to be excluded
from future logging, develop community based management plans for protection of these
areas, finance alternative livelihood schemes for affected communities, and provide for
ongoing monitonng and evaluation of biological and social indicators of program
performance.
The project will promote the development of privately owned plantations to supply an
increasing proportion of wood to the processing industry when, as planned, harvesting of
natural forest declines. Plantation development would take place on private lands off-
reserve, and on degraded reserve lands. The project would establish a privately managed
Plantation Development Fund/Company to be managed within an appropriate
administrative framework; facilitate reserve land allocation to approved investors and
private plantation management companies; establish a seed bank and support development
of a privately operated, decentralized, seed distribution system; and support plantation
related research, extension and stakeholder training.
3.3.2 Savanna Resource Management
This component will concentrate on four main groups of activities in the Upper East,
Upper West and Northem Regions.
Woodland reserve management proposals involving participation of communities would
be developed on a pilot basis and tested for effectiveness and sustainability. The new
approach would broaden the current restrictive encroachment protection objective to give
the communities a key role in on-reserve management including shared operational
responsibility and a stake in revenues derived from improved forest and woodland product
harvesting and marketing.
Participatory programs would be formulated to rehabilitate non-reserve areas degraded by
poor land use practices; and to sustainably manage all the savanna zone natural resources,
enabling more efficient productive use of these resources and improved marketing. The
programs would be based on integrated land use plans startng on mini-watersheds from
headwater areas building on the expenences of the land and water management
component of GERMP. They will take into account not only the physical resources, but
also the market situation, the culture, needs and capabilities of the communities which rely
26



on the land resources for their livelihood. Involvement of district environmental
management commnittees in development of local land management plans would ensure
compatibility with Local Environmental Action Plans (LEAPs).
Support would be provided for capacity building within participating conmnunities, the
statutory Development Planning Sub-Committee and Environmental Management
Committees of the District Assemblies, and also NGOs concemed with the programs.
Training would focus on front line staff and private service providers such as NGOs,
conducted through local institutions and training agencies equipped with the necessary
facilities and skills for integrated management of land, water and vegetation cover for
sustainable economic activities. A savanna implementation coordinating unit would be
established to take the lead role in the planning and implementation of the programs.
This component would contribute to development of a National Action Program against
Desertification as provided for in the International Desertification Convention to which
GoG is a signatory. This program would be planned in cooperation with the national
EPA and relevant arrangements would be made for implementation.
3.3.3 Wildlife Resource Management
The wildlife management component will support institutional strengthening through
restructuring and realignment of the Department of Wildlife to enhance the economic and
social sustainability of wildlife management programs. It will also foster close
collaboration between the WD and rural communities, the private sector, non-
governmental organizations and other partners in management of protected areas, and
wildlife in general. The component would support implementation of management plans
and infrastructure improvements for selected protected areas, technical assistance and
operational support for establishment of community managed reserves. It will also finance
both infiastructure improvements and operational support to upgrade and modemize the
management of the zoological gardens in Accra and Kumasi. There will be a general
initiative to improve environmental education and outreach efforts by the Department to
be undertaken in partnership with national NGOs.
The project would also seek to promote increased private sector/commurnity involvement
in wildlife related economic activities such as eco-tourism and game ranching; and
inprove understanding and support for wildlife conservation and management through
public education.
3.3.4 Environmental Management Coordination
The NRMP will provide resources to assist capacity building of the Environmental
Protection Agency at national and regional levels and provide operational support to assist
with the implementation of the new 5-year strategic plan for environmental management
coordination, including human resource development. It will also develop sector specific
guidelines in support of the activities of the NRMP. The project would also support the
27



EPA program to provide training and technical support to district assemblv level
.environmental management commiittees in the preparation of local environmental action
plans and to bolster their capacity for local-level land use planning.
Support will be given to further develop the Environmental Information System
established under the ongoing Environmental Resource Management Project. and to
encourage its wider use as a planning tool in Ghana. Support will be provided to address
land administration issues influencing sustainable use of natural resources.
3.4 Project Support Activities
3.4.1 Policy, Planning and Institutional Reforms
The project would assist the goverment in designing and implementing firther sectoral
policy and institutional reforms for enhancing revenue capture and improving sustainability
of the forest industry. This would be accomplished through streamlinin the mandates and
expenditures of forest sector agencies and strengthening their implementation capacity.
Various agencies within the forestry sector are expected to devolve a considerable share
or their responsibilities to the private sector. The project would assist private sector
producer associations, NGOs and community-based organizations to extend their
participation in the commercial forestry sector. It will complement ODA financed technical
support for the restrucnring of the Forestry Department into a more efficient service-
providing agency.
3.4.2 Capacity Development
In view of the importance of participatory approaches for the identification, planning and
implementation of the programs, priority would be given to strengthening or developing
the capacities of interested communities to phy a leading role in land and natural resource
management. Such capacity building would take advantage of exising capabilities and the
potential of local institutions such as training and research institutes and NGOs, as well as
individuals, with the requisite skills for undertaking the specific activities. Support would
also be provided to strengthening the capacity of relevant NGOs in the rural areas to
complement regional and district extension services and subject matter specialists, in
training the communities.
3.4.3 Resource Information Systems
The present remote sensing equipment at the Planning Branch of the MLF at Kiumasi
would be upgraded into a Forestry/Wildlife/Biodiversity sectoral resource information
node. This would be operated under the NRNP and supported by the Remote Sensing
Appicaions Uit (RSAU) at the University of Ghana in LegonL A regional sub-node
would be developed at Tamale, with the appropriate capacity to facilitate the planning and
monitoring activities of the savanma component.
28



3.4.4 Monitoring Land Use Changes
The countrywide land use/land cover information generated by the RSAU, based on
satellite images dating back to 1990/91, will be updated. Support will be given for the
purchase of satellite data from 1999/2000 images in compatible format in order to
generate new data on land use and land cover changes during the current decade.
Information on changes in land cover and utilization during the 1990s, when combined
with other socio-econbmic information, would provide a powerful tool to study and assess
the impact of recent policies and development activities on natural resources and the
environment.
3.5 Project Financing
Total project costs are tentatively estimated at US$ 52 million over five years, of which
IDA would finance about $18 million, and other bilateral and multilateral cofinanciers who
have already expressed interest would finance an equivalent amount. A proposal is
currently under consideration by the GEF to finance approximately US$ 9 million in
incremental costs for biodiversity conservation within the high forest zone. The remaining
$7 million would come from the GoG, the District Assemblies and participating
communities.
3.6 Implementation Arrangements
The Ministry of Lands and Forestry will be the lead implementing agency operating
through its Project Coordinating Committee chaired by the Technical Director. The
Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) and the Environmental Protecdon Agency
(EPA) would also be involved in implementation of aspects of the project. The different
components would be managed by specific decenralizd management units within the
collaborating agencies. The details of operating procedures for these units are currently
under discussion. The implementation framework would be in line with the policies of
GoG to decentralize the public service, and to give the District Assemblies operational
responsibilities for development and provision of services within their districts.
3.7 Project Sustainability
An important provision for long term sustainability of the NRM is Government's
commitment to policy and institutional reforms which places a greater responsibility on the
private stakeholders, improvements in staff quality and performance in key support
agencies, and appropriate funding, particularly at the regional and district levels. The
participatory approach, which will give major management roles and bring greater direct
benefits to the respective communities and other pnvate sector or stakeholders, will
provide the essential element of ownrhip to ensure enduring maintenance. Wlthin the
high forest estate, Government's commitment to stabilizing sustainable harvest potential,
increasing the share of benefits realized by the communities and improving both the
knowledge base and management capacity for effective stewardship of the natural
29



resources, will ultimately be a major factor in sustaining these resources and their value for
the welfare of the rural population.
3.8 Lessons Learned from Past Operations
Experience from previous Bank lending operations in the forestry sector indicates the
importance of addressing key policy and institutional reforms in parallel with strengthening
technical management capacity including more direct. involvement of landholding
communities and other stakeholders. This project will support the implementation of
policy and legislative reforms concerning irnproved forest royalty collection, more
equitable and transparent distribution of revenues to stakeholders, introduction of
improved sectoral guidelines for environmental protection and enhanced fiscal and
technical monitoring and surveillance. The project will underwrite implementation of a
major policy shift towards collaborative management of forest and other natural resources.
Rural communities and other stakeholders will have much more direct participation in
resource management decision making and greater realization of economnic returns from
the resource.
3.9 Special Program Emphasis
The proposed program will give specal emphasis to sustainable management of the
natural resources and the environment, and poverty reduction through: (i) policy reforms
that will improve the logging, milling, and marketing of forest products and provide a
greater share of the benefits to rural landholding communities; (ii) targeted interventions
to improve the management of land and water resources as a means of increasing
agricultural productivity for farmers, to reduce poverty particularly among women in the
disadvantaged rural areas and improve food security and employment opportunities; (iii)
special emphasis on community participation in the selection, planning, implementation
and ownership of programs.
4. METHODOLOGY
4.1 General
The NRMP is currently only at the conceptual stage and detailed project design has not
yet been prepared. Accordingly, the EIA is based on the project concept. The concept has
been agreed upon by the Ministry of Lands and Forestry and accepted as the basis for
detailed project design.
Since the project is country wide, the assessment could not be canried. out at each
individual site where an aspect of the project may have an effect of one type or another on
a component of the environment.
30



Only sample reserves and non-reserve areas have been selected as well as a sampling of
communities adjacent to these area and of industries, for purposes of collecting pnrmary
data. This data has been collected and analyzed by the EIA team primarilY to verify issues
and potential impacts that have been described in various documents.
The EIA has been carried out by an interdisciplinary team consisting of nine members as
indicated in Section 4.7.
4.2 Baseline Data
4.2.1 Socio-economic Data
Existing data on socio-economnic conditions of the country's rural population, one of the
major stakeholders of the project, has been used to provide this group's profile. To
supplement this secondary data, 25 communities (Table 4.1) representing the two major
forest regions (high forest and savanna) and the far north (Guinea savanna) were selected
in which to conduct an informal questionnaire focusing on general community conditions
and perceived issues and problems as these relate to existing forest resources, forest
products, and their views towards collaborative forestry. The questiomnaire was directed
to community leaders in those communities where they were available. Other members of
the communuities were interviewed when leaders were not available.
The communities visited represent communities adjacent to the following forest reserves:
Keni-Keni Forest Reserve and Mole Game Reserve (North); Bobri and Domi Forest
Reserves in Ashanti: Atewa Forest Reserve East); Assin Atandanso Game Reserve,
Kakum Nature Reserve, Nkukuasa Forest Reserve (Central); Nueng North Forest Reserve
and Nueng South Forest Reserve (West); and Shai Hills Resource Reserve in the Greater
Accra area. Two off-reserve areas to the northeast of Bawku were also included in the
survey. Six of the 25 communities are not situated near reserves but play an important role
in either the production of fuelwood or use of fuelwood for food processing.

4.2.2 Biophysical Data
All biophysical data is secondary and has been sourced from a variety of existing
documents as referenced in Section 9.
4.3 Stakeholder Participation
The stakeholders of the project are many and varied, including the Government of Ghana,
the Ministry of Lands and Forestry (including the Forestry Department and the
Department of Wildlife), the forest industry, and the people of Ghana. Of particular
importance, and the group that could be affected most directly, are the local communities
in the vicinity of the forest reserves and wildlife areas, and the communities that rely on
the forest products industry, particularly timber harvesting and sawmilling, as a basis of
their economy.
In view of the direct effect that the project will have on communities in the vicinity of
forest reserves and wildlife areas, a sampling of these communities was visited to gain a
sense of their concerns towards forest management and other aspects of the project.
Similarly, a sampling of the forest industry was selected in an attempt, through an informal
questionnaire, to deternine conces and impacts that the project is likely to have on the
industry.
The Ministry of Lands and Forestry, the Forestry Department and the Department of
Wildlife partHipated actively in the preparation of the EIA Five staff members of these
agencies w   assigned to the EIA team. In addition, a member of the EPA participated in
the three da session for determining impacts and mitigative actions.
32



A presentation of the initial draft of the ELA was made on September 30, 1997 The
presentation was made to invited govemrnent departments, the forest industry, the general
pubhc, and NGOs. Representatives of the communities adjacent to a selection of Reserves
were invited and were provided with transportation to attend the presentation. The
presentation allowed for input to be made and based on the feedback from the input, the
final EIA document was prepared. A iist of organizations invited and in attendance at the
presentation is provided in Appendix 1.
In addition, notices was placed in the Daily Graphic (a facsimile of which is provided on
the back cover of this report) and Ghanaian Times newspapers to offer the opportunity for
anyone interested in reviewing the draft document prior to the presentations, to do so at
the Ministry of Lands and Forestry.
The World Bank was also given the opportunity to review the initial draft document and
provide comments which were used in the preparation of the draft final and final
documents.
4.4 Scoping and Bounding
The basis of scoping has been the identification of the Important Environmental
Components (1ECs). These are the features of an area for which an EIA is being carried
out that are deemed important enough to ensure that they are not lost or damaged. They
are features that stakeholders agree are worthy of protection and agree to devote
resources to this end. The IECs provide a focus for the ElI. The EICs were initially
identified by the participants of the EIA workshop held in June. As the assessment was
carried out this initial list was modified and a final list of IECs was agreed upon. The EECs
are listed in Section 7.
The bounds of the EIA have been set arbitrarily. Boundaries for activities within reserves
and in off-reserve areas, and the communities adjacent to the reserves, have been set to the
extent of the reserves and the contiguous forested area of the off-reserve area, and the
immediate area occupied by the relevant communities. Impacts of timber harvesting on
groundwater and surface water systems were considered for the portions of the systems
within the forested areas and for a length of surface water system not exceeding one km
beyond the forested area under consideration. In some instances, such as the downsizing
of the timber industry, the boundaries for impacts extended regionally. Impacts occuring in
the savanmah region have been treated in a sinilar fashion.
4.5 Criteria for Impact Assessment
Several criteria were considered for determining the significance of an impact. Criteria
selected were sevety, extent, duration, frequency, possibility of occurrence, and
possibility of reversibility. These are briefly described.
33



4.5.1 Seventy
. Very High
biophysical impacts: major losses or system disruption, system unable to function
without mitigation or major compensation.
socio-economic   impacts:   major   socio-economic   losses/disruption.
communities/individuals unable to function traditionally without mitization or
major compensation.
. High
biological impacts: substantial losses or system disruption; system would
probably still fimction, albeit at a lower level and mitigation would be required for
restoration.
socio-economic impacts: substantial loss to existing conditions; communities and
individuals would probably still function, albeit at a lower socio-economic order;
communitiesfindividuals would require mitigation/compensation to maintain level.
. Moderate
biological impacts: measurable losses, or system disruption; system able to
continue without mitigation but at a slightly lower level.
socio-economic impacts: measurable socio-economic losses; communities/
individuals would be able to fumction quite well without mitigation but at a slightly
lower level.
.Low
biological impacts: small changes, possibly measurable
socio-economic impacts: small changes, possibly measurable
4.5.2 Extent
. Site (local): within close range of a specified component or activity, extent of range is
dependent on the nature of the impact. Where many sites are involved (e.g. logging at site
in many reserves in any one year, scale would be increased from site to general area [see
below]).
. General Area: within the general area; could refer to extent as great as the watershed;
covering an area beyond the boundaries of site but not to the extent of the region.
. Regional: within a specified area of Ghana; could be an ecological region (e.g. the high
forest region, the coastal region, the savama)
. National: country wide
. International: where an impact would be of concem to other countries (e.g. trans-
boundary impact, loss of a species, severe impact on people)
34



4.5.3 Duration
. Temporary: occurrence for a period of up to 5 years
. Medium term: 6 - 20 years duration
. Permanent: effects of impact will be felt forever
4.5.4 Frequency of Occurrence
. Once
. Several times
. Many times
4.5.5 Probability of Occurrence
. Definite: no doubt that the impact will occur
. Probable: probability of impact occurrence judged to be greater than 50%/c
 Possible: probability of impact occurrence judged to be less than 50%/c
4.5.6 Possibility of Reversibility
 Probable: probability of impact being reversed is greater than 50%/.
. Possible: probability of impact being reversed is less than 50%/.
. Not likely: highly unlikely that reversibility will occur
The significance of an impact is determined by the total score of the various criteria for-
each impact. The significance ratings are indicative only, allowing the consideration of any
one impact relative to the others. The values assigned to each level of each criteria are
subjective. The numerical ranges for detemining the different levels of significance are
arbitrary.
. Very High (total score of 24-26)
. High (total score of 19-23)
. Moderate (total score of 13-18)
. Low (total score of 9-12)
35



4.6 Scoring System for Significance of Impact
This scoring system (Table 4.2) has not been prepared on the basis of other scoring
systems. It is a simple system using few criteria, but essential criteria that will result in an
appropriate ranking system of the various impacts. A complex system has been avoided,
simply because the increasing use of numbers (or scores) tends to cloud the analysis.
particularly in the absence of real quantifiable data. In the end, a more complex system
using weightings, multiple impact analysis, etc. would in all likelihood not modify the
impact significance ratings significantly. A review of the final impact significance ratings
appears to bear this out.

5. DESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
5.1 Location and Topography"l
Ghana has an area of 238,500km2 and it is situated along the Gulf of Guinea, extending
from 4045 N at Cape Three Points to 1101 iN at the northem boundary with Burkina
Faso. To the east (1014E) it is bordered by Togo and it stretches to 3007W  at the
boundary with Cote d'Ivoire. It is roughly rectangular in shape with an average width of
350km, an inland extension of 675km and a coast line of 5671kn. The Greenwich Meridian
runs through eastern Ghana about 241an to the east of Accra, the capital.
The topography of Ghana is undulating with prominent scarps seldom exceeding 600m in
height, occ-ring at Akwapim, Kwahu, Mampong, Ejura and Gambaga. The highest hills
run in a northeast direction between Volta Lake and the Togo border. This lake was
created in 1964 through the damming of the Volta River. It is the largest artificial lake in
Africa and covers an area of 8,500ktn2 when at its normal operating level.
5.2 Physical Environment
5.2.1 ClimateU
The tropical climate of Ghana is governed by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone or
Inter-Tropical Front (ITCZ). The ITCZ is a surface discontinuity separating northeasterly
dry continental air masses from southeasterly wnnds (moist air flow from the Gulf of
Guinea). It moves in relation to the sun's movement and is associated with rainfall. Five
11GWDI1UCN. 1994.
'2GWD/IUCN. 1994.
37



'climates' from the climate classification of Troll and Paffen (1964) are found within the
Tropical Zone and three of these are represented in Ghana as indicated in Table 5.1.
Table 5.1: Climates of the Tropical Zone Represented in Ghana
Cl}aima::_:R - ..'  x,.  ..2   .    i._.< ' Period t(=I8tIL)
VI Tropical rainy climates       0 - 2.5
V2 Tropical humid-summer climates  2.5 - 5
V3 Wet and dry tropical climates  5 - 7.5
The zone with Tropical rainy climates (VI) more or less corresponds with the high forest
zone. The rest of Ghana, with the exception of the southeastern corner, falls within the
Tropical humid-sumrner climates (V2). The eastem coastal plains have a wet and dry
tropical climate (V3). The area in proximity to Accra with rainfall below 760mm can be
classified as transitional between V3 and V4 climates, with V4 being Tropical dry climate
with 7.5 to 10 and months.
Harmattan winds from the Sahara blow between December and March, lowering humidity
and temperatures and bringing fine dust particularly to the northern parts, though its
effects are felt as far south as the coast.
The average rainfall decreases with increasing distance from the coast from more than
2000 mm/yr to about 1000 mm/yr in northern Ghana. The rainfall in the eastern coastal
area does not follow this general pattern and is as low as 714 mm/yr. Rainfall is ermatic and
intensities up to 200 mm/yr lead to high runoff and soil erosionL High temperatures and
wind cause high rates of evapotanson. The northern third of the country has a net
precipitation of less than 300 mmlyr while the southern sector has over 500 mm/yr.
Ghana can be divided into two c)imatic types according to temporal rainfall patterns. The
northern part (roughly north of 8o - S9) has a climate of the Sudan type with a rainy season
extending from April to October/November. The climate in the southern part is of the
Guinea type with two rainy seasons (March to July and October to November) separated
by and periods. The eastern coastal area forms the western end of the Ghana dry belt (the
So-called Dahomey gap). This belt comprises the littoral of eastern Ghana, Togo and
Benin and is bordered by tropical humid areas to the east and west. This low rainfall is
caused by winds paralle to the shore causing frictional divergence, and by a cool pool or
current of water in the region.
In addition, the southeast coastal plains are in the rain shadow of the Akwapim Togo
Ranges and the few inselbergs m the generally flat plains are not high enough to doirb
the maritime air masses, causing them to rise, cool and rain.
The average annual temperature range in the coastal area is 5° - 6C and 7° - 90C in the
interior. The mean diumal range also shows a marked increase with increasing distance
from the coast. It is 70 - go C at the coast and up to 110 - 14° C in northern Ghana. The
38



mean monthly temperature is always above 250C in the whole of Ghana. March and April
are generally the hottest months while August to December are the coolest months.
Humidity is generally high during the rainy season and during the night and eariy
momings. The overall humidity declines with increasing distance from the coast. Relative
humidity between 95 and I O10/o is common along the coast during the night and early
mornings and drops to 65-75% in the afternoons. During the period when northern Ghana
is influenced by maritime air masses the relative hunmidity can reach 80% and drops as low
as 20-30% under the influence of dry continental air.
5.2.2 Physiography13
The country contains seven distinct regions ranging from the coast through to fold
mountains that form the easter boundary of the Voltaian Basin. The Votaian Basin is the
largest of the seven physiographic regions, comprising about 41% of the total area of the
country.
5.2.3 Geology and Soils14
Most of Ghana lies within the Precambrian Guinean Shield of West Africa. Precambrian
rocks are widespread in Ghana and are overlain by the sandstones, shales, mudstones,
conglomerates, limestones and tiUites of the Voltaian Systern. Younger rocks are found at
several locations along the coast. Different masses of granitoids are intruded into the
Birmian rocks (Precambrian).
The country has three soil groups and these correspond to a large degree with the
distribution of the vegetation types. The soils of the forest zone range from Forest Oxysols
in the wettest parts to Forest Ochrosols in the areas with semi-deciduous forest. The soils
of the savanna zone are mainly Savanna Ocbrosols and Groundwater Laterites. Soils of
the coastal savanna are comprised of a complex mosaic of different soil types, reflecting
the complex geological structures of the 'Dahomeyan System' which occupies the
southeastem corner of Ghana.
5.2.4 Water Resources'5
The Black and White Volta Rivers form the dominant river system draining the northemn
and eastem parts of the country. the Volta River basin covers 70% of the country and
drains the entire interior savanna region. The wetter west area is drained by the Pra,
Ankobra and Tano rivers. Volta Lake covers about 4% of the area of the country and
retains about 25% of the combined flow of the basin's rivers.

Many of Ghana's water courses are seasonal and less than 1% of Ghana is underlain by
exploitable aquifers. Groundwater is generally of high quality.
5.3 Biological Environment
5.3.1 Major Ecozones
High Forest
Tropical high forests occur in the southwestem third of the country and form part of the
Guinea-Congolean phytogeographical region. Both flora and fauna composition is closely
linked to those of Cote D'Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone but to a lesser extent, Nigeria,
as a result of the separation by the and "Dahomey gap".- High forest covers 8.2 million ha
and contains over 700/0 of Ghana's total flora diversity. Seven vegetative types within the
closed forest are recognized in Ghana, each with a distinct association of plant species and
corresponding rainfall and soil conditions. Two evergreen types (wet and moist) occur in
the extreme southwestem corner of Ghana and receive the highest annual rainfall (1,500-
2,100 mm/annum). This is a floristically rich zone and supports many species which are
absent or rare elsewhere. Table 5.1 provides a summary of the vegetation fornation
groups in Ghana'6, including the seven types withi the closed forest and the savanna
vegetation.
Figure 5.1 indicates the country's major ecological zones and Figure 5.2 indicates the
location of the country's forest reserves and the forest zones within which they are
located.
The vegetation formations indicated in Table 5.1 are described in detail in Appendix 1.
Savanna Woodland
Savanna covers 66% of the total land area and is represented in the north, eastern and
coastal regions. There are two types - coastal and interior savanna woodlands. The coastal
savanna is part of the Guinea-Congolean/Sudan regional transition and only occupies a
narrow wedge-shaped area flanking the south of the high forest and extend north
eastwards to a drier type of savanna which is not truly transitional. Coastal savanna
includes mixed subdivisions broadly grouped as the strand and mangrove, and the grass
and coastal thicket communities.

The Sudan types are dominant in Ghana and two distinct zones are recognized; the narrow
discontinuous derived savanna zone lying adjacent to the forest region, and the entire
breadth of the Guinea savanna zone to the north.
The Guinea savanna zone supports a typical fire controlled tree savanna community of
deciduous trees, densely distributed in a continuous ground cover of perennial bunch
grasses and associated forbs.
5.3.2 Biodiversity - Species Composition and Distribution
Flora
Excluding mosses and other lower plants a total of 3,600 plant species have been recorded
in Ghana. From a recent botanical inventory"7 2,214 are high forest species with 680 being
trees greater than 5cm dbh. The remainder are savanna zone species. However, an
imbalance exists in the knowledge of the composition of plant species.
Most of Ghana's forest plant species are also fairly widespread in Afica. 85% of ruderal
(weed) species typical of farms or paths have a wide tropical distribution, even extending
outside of Africa, whereas 3% of primary forest species occur outside of Africa. About
half of the non-ruderal forest species are at least Guinea-Congolean species, with a range
usually from western Ghana to the Congo basin or beyond. A firther 20% of forest
species are widespread in West Africa, occurring to the east and west of Ghana.
"Haw'hn D. and hi Abu-Ju- 1995.
41



Species of the savanna are part of the Sudanian regional center of endemism. The Guinea-
Congolian/Sudanian region has less than 2,000 plant species, most of which are Guinea-
Congolian or Sudanian wides, or link species with an even wider distribution.
Fauna
The wildlife of Ghana can be divided into the two broad ecological zones: savanna and the
closed forest. Vertebrate species include 221 amphibians and reptiles, 721 birds, 225
mammals, and 250 species of freshwater fish. The herpetofauna includes 70 species.
Avifauna comprises 402 non-passerines and 319 passernes of which 587 are African
species. Migratory species comprise mainly palearctic and Afrotropical migrants with a
few vagrants from the Holarctic, Nearctic and Antarctic regions. Keystone species such as
hombills, parrots and other birds of prey are well represented in the country. However, of
the 721 bird species listed in Ghana, one, the white breasted Guinea fowl Agelastes
meleadrides, is endemic to the Upper Guinea forests. There are about 1,200 species of
butterflies and 12,000 species of moths in Ghana, and a conservative estimate is that there
are more than 100,000 species of invertebrates.
Savanna fauna is comprised of no fewer than 93 mammal species, about half of which can
be considered to be large. This group also includes several species of carnivore including
lion, spotted hyena and hunting dog. Over 350 bird species have been recorded from the
savanna as well as nine amphibians and 33 reptile species.
The fauna of the closed forest is more diverse. There are 200 of the 250 species of forest
mammals recorded from Ghana. These species include 60% of the primates recorded from
the country and at least 74 species of bat. Infonnation on the distribution of forest birds is
incomplete, but at least 240 are found associated with the forest, and 12 with marine
habitats. The wet evergreen and the moist evergreen forests of Ghana are the most
important repository of butterfly diversity in West Africa, and by implication, of the
diversity of other insects. Of the 860 recorded butterfly species in Ghana, 83% are
associated with the forest while 13% are associated with the savanna species. Twenty-
three of these species are endemic.
5.3.3 Threatened Wildlife
A number of wildfire species are under threat in Ghana. Table 5.2 provides a list of these
species and a brief summary of the current status of each species. Some of these species
are globally endangered.

5.3.4 Important/Threatened Wildlife Habitats
. The Closed Forest
A distinct guild of forest species occurs throughout the Upper Guinean region, with a
discontinuity in the fauna between the Sessendra and Bandama rivers in south_eastern
Cote dlvoire. The forest fauna in southwest Ghana and southeast Cote dlvoire is distinct
from the other Upper Guinean forests.
The Wet evergreen forest, which is restricted to the highest rainall zone of southwest
Ghana contains the highest concentration of rare and endemic species in Ghana. It is the
least disturbed forest type in Ghana with 700/% of the forest still relatively inact and it is
the ecosystem in which the greatest diversity of animal and plant life exists.
All other tpes of forest are equally important for the survval of forest funal species but
these habitats are under confinual threat from barvesfing operations, poaching and
encroaching agricultural activities.
. The Savanna Woodland
The short grass savanna (sometimes referred to as Coastal savanna or grassland), a unique
formation group with very limited distribution in Afica, is a highly sigificant habitat. East
of the Volta River it is well represented within the Kalakpa Game Reserve. The ACcra
Plains, however, which exhibits an ample variety of sites at the dnest extreme of the
'Dahomey Gap' is represented only by the Shai Hills RR (50km2). The vegetation along the
44



Abunr scarp is aimost completely deforested and extremely degraded, showing signs of
severe erosion.
Tall-grass Savanna
The tall grass savanna zone is adequately represented in the Protected Areas svstem. Of
the seven protected areas within the tall grass savanna zone, the Mole National Park is the
largest and most important.
The largest populations of roan, hartebeest, oribi, waterbuck, warthog, Buffoon's patas
monkeys and savanna elephants are found in Mole National Park, a protected area
sufficiently large enough to support these populations.
Mole National Park also supports the last remaining populations of lion, hyena and
possibly, side-striped jackal.
. Wetlands
There are six Ramsar sites in Ghana. Five are along the coast and comprise of either open
or closed brackish lagoons, estuaries, river deltas and adjacent seashores. The five coastal
Ramsar sites provide habitat for internationally significant populations of 11 species of
migratory shorebirds as weUl as nesting sites for three endangered species of marine turtles.
. Environmental Contributions
The forests and savanna grasslands of Ghana fulfill important environmental functions
including soil conservation, hydrological stabilization, amelioration of the agricultural
microclimate, and the protection of biodiversity and endemic species. Catchment
protection is an important consideration in Ghana. Lake Volta provides jobs for 30,000
fisherfolk and is the basis for 912 mW of hydroelectric generating capacity, irrigation
water, and provides an important navigation route. Without the maintenance of savanna
woodlands in the catchment annual soil losses could increase from less than one ton/ha to
in excess of 100 tons/ha.
Maintenance of tree cover in the savanna woodland prevents the leaching of valuable soil
nutrients and transfers deep lying leached nutrients into the trees and eventually back to
the surface soil in the form of litter and roots.
5.4 Socio-economic Environment
5.4.1 The Ghana Economyl"
Agriculture accounts for almost 50%/. of the GDP and industy accounts for a further 15%.
Services generate the remaining 35%. Within the industry sector, forestry contributed
$153 million in 1993. However, this would diminish over time as a result of non-
ISGWD/IUCN. 1994.
45



sustainable forestry practices and a suspension of round log exports. The forest industry is
-described in Section 1.3.4. Gold is the largest single source of export earnings at $468
million in 1993. Bauxite, diamonds and sea salt are significant export minerals. The single
most important agricultural crop is cocoa which supplies about one third of the country's
export earnings. Tourism is reported to be the third largest foreign exchange earner in
Ghana after gold and cocoa and it is expected to displace cocoa in export eaniungs over
the next few years.
5.4.2 Population19
The 1984 census indicates that Ghana's population was 12.3 million in that year. At an
annual growth rate of 3.4% from 1980 to 1990, and with an estimated reduction to 3.0%/o
from 1990 to 2000, the population is expected to reach 20 million by the turn of the
century and 34 million by the first quarter of the next century. The population is very
young with about 47% of the population below the age of 15.
Two thirds of the country's population is located in rural areas and is highly dependent on
natural resources for survival. However, according to census figures over the past 35
years, the rural population of the counry is decreasing. Over 50%0 of the population is
concentrated in the Ashanti, Eastern, Greater Accra and Central regions which constitute
less than a quarter of the country's.land area. Whilst the Greater Accra area has a
population density of up to 441/mi2, the Northem Region has a density as low as 17/mi2.
Urbanization for the 1990s is estimated to include 34% of the population and is expected
to reach 39.2% by 2000.
The rural population, which is the focus of the nanural resource project and which will be
the prnmary direct benefactor of the project, for the most part lives below the poverty line,
is uneducated or only semi-literate, and has limited access to social amenities such as
health and education facilities.
5.4.3 Administration
Ghana has a democratic system of government with the seat of this centralized
govemment situated in Accra. Although decentralizaon policies have been in place since
1990, to a large extent the government still operates under the centralized system. The
country is comprised of ten administrative regions and frther divided into 110 districts.
The regional head is the Regional inister who has a Deputy. Distncts are headed by
District Chief Executives.
The traditional system of the chieftaincy in the rwual areas paranllels the administrative
system and this is described in Section 5.4.6.
'9 GWD/IUCN. 1994.
46



5.4.4 Economic Activity, Income and Poverty
Farming and other agricultural activities are the main occupation in the rural areas of
Ghana, although other occupations such as trading and various service activities are
important. ln 1984 about 61.1% of the employed population was enraged in agricultural
activities. Fallow rotation is widely practiced and this has placed intense pressure on forest
resources.
The Ghana Living Standards Survey (1988-92), indicates that about 31% of the Ghanaian
population is poor or very poor. Rural areas which contain about 66% of the country's
population account for almost 75% of the country's total poverty. However, regional
variations are found and the rural savanna, although containing only 23% of the total
population of the country, accounted for 28% of the total poverty and 31% of the very
poor.
Poverty is greatest amongst farmers and the least amongst those employed in the formal
sector, either in goverment or the private sector.
Employment in the timber industry is conservatively estimated at 130,000. This number is
based on the number of operations in each of the timber industry activities as indicated in
Table 5.3.

5.4.5 Culture
. Ethnicity and Religion
Ghana is comprised of a variety of ethnic groups and there are believed to be 185 different
tribes although there are only about 30 major groups. The major groups are distinguished
primarily by language and to a lesser degree by their political, social and cultural
organization. The largest and most predominant is the Akan ethnic group which is found
in five of Ghana's 10 regions. The;group is identified by a common language which is
differentiated amongst the sub-groups by dialects. These sub-groups include the Ashanti,
Fante, Kwabu, Akwapin and Assin. The Akan has a common system of inheritance which
47



is matrilineal and is differentiated from other groups through a unique set of cultural
charactenstics and insititutions.
The other major groups of southern Ghana include the Ga - Adangbe, the Ewe, and the
Guan. There are, as well, a number of other smaller ethnic groups in the south.
In northern Ghana the people are grouped by three language types including the Gur. Kwa
and Mende language groups. The two well known Gur speaking groups include the
Dagomba and Mamprusi. The Kwa group consists of the Gonja and Nchuburung, and the
Mende consists of the Busansi and Ligbi speaking groups.
Religion of the country is dominated by Christianity and Islam with the latter prevalent in
the northemn regions. In the northern regions, the earth priest (Tindaana) holds a religious
position although not as authoritative as in the past prior to the introduction of Islam and
Christianity.
African traditional religion which is very much a part of the daily lives of many Ghanaians.
It is based on the belief that the links amongst the unbom, the living and the dead provide
an unbroken chain. Whatever is carried out by the living can bring upon them favour or
disfavour with the dead.
. Taboos, Beliefs and Mores
A system of taboos, beliefs and mores are used to establish and maintain socially
acceptable behavior in communities. However, the introduction of fomWal education,
organized religion, as well as two-directional migration have eroded these traditional
controls. Today, many of the taboos related to farming, entry into sacred groves and other
traditional values, are flaunted with impunity. Chiefs, elders and other persons of authorit
do not have the legal instrumentation with which to enforce compliance with traditional
beliefs.
Common beliefs include the sacredness of land, and the belief that the living are only
custodians for the land on behalf of the dead. There is a belief of the commonality of
traditional institutions and laws on resource use. Sacred groves, for example, are conmnon
to all tribes in the country.
While the family head is usually the link between a family and its ancestors, and the chief is
the link between tribal ancestors and the people, the fetish priests are seen as links
between their different gods and the community.
The primary duty of the earth priest is to ensure the prosperity of the community through
capturing the goodwill of the earth. He is required to pierce the soil when a new grave is
dug and he must turn the first sod when a farm or house is to be established on virgin
ground. He allots land previously unclaimed for faniing and building. All lost property
that the community chief is not entitled to goes to the earth priest.
48



. Sacred Groves
There are a variety of sacred plants and animals which may be associated with particular
spirits in sacred groves and rivers, with fetish priests, or with clans of people. Several
forest plants are believed to be sacred throughout the entire region: the forest emertem,
odii, the 'odum' tree and the liana, 'ahomakyem' were found to be sacred in all of the
communities studied in southern Ghana. Some sacred plant species may be used to protect
an entire community. Even some animals have sacred or fetish value and are used in
spiritual healing and for protection. The presence of sacred groves throughout southern
Ghana indicates the high value placed on forest vegetation and its spiritual associations.
. Inheritance
Two systems of inheritance are practiced in Ghana. In the matri£ineal system which is
practiced by the Akans, the lineage can trace descent from a common female ancestor. A
child is considered to belong to it's mother's lineage and is expected to accrue all rights,
benefits and responsibilities through that lineage. Properly of a women will be passed on
to her sisters and her daughters while a man's property will be passed on to his sister's
sons who are deemed as belonging to the same lineage rather than his own children who
belong to their mother's lineage.
The patrilineal system which is practiced by the other tribes. Under this system of
inheritance an individual belongs to the same lineage as his/her father. A lineage is
comprised of a group of persons that can trace descent through a common male ancestor.
The heirs to a man's property are commonly his brothers and his sons.
To ensure that those who do not inherit directly from a person are not neglected and left
destitute, custom demands that the heir to a deceased's property takes care of the
remaining dependents. Education, urbanisation, migration and the introduction of 'wills'
has affected these traditional systems and has left a g  in many places between heirs and
dependents of deceased persons. Government has attempted to correct this through the
Intestate Succession Law.
Cultural Erosion
Urbanization has broken down famnly and kinship ties which in the past compelled people
to conform to socially accePted behavior of communities to which they belonged. No
longer does a person's day to day existence, well being and protection depend on family
and kinship.
5.4.6 Social Structure and Institutions
Traditional authority is usually vested in chiefs, both divisional and paramount, and in the
elders. Their basic function under this system is to perform executive, legislative and
judicial functions. However, in recent times with modern western style government
49



systems. much of the authority of the chiefs has been eroded. The lowest in the hierarchv
of authority in an Ak-an society is the Abusua Panyinr, or family head.
Today the chief s main role in the community is ritual. All community land is vested in the
chief on behalf of his people. The chief directly administers stool land and the elders
directly administer family land which are lands that each family began working when the
tribe or sub-tribe first settled. He is expected to administer justice, see to the well being of
his people spiritually and physically. In order to ensure the well being of his people, his
duty is to maintain close communications with ancestors to ensure that he does not incur
their wrath upon his people. He is also to invoke their blessings and protection upon his
people.
In the Akan community control is maintained through tribal taboos and laws which usually
have spiritual sanctions attached. Penalties for offenses, depending upon their seriousness,
could be the slaughter of a sheep or the provision of alcohol for pacification rites.
5.4.7 Livelihood
The pnmary source of income for rural communities is agriculture. Agriculture based
income comprises 71.7%/ of the rural income in the savamnn region and 58.6% of the
income in the high forest region. Non-farm self employment is a significant source of
income and in the rural communities of the coastal region it comprises 46% of the total
rural income, leading agriculture related income in this region. All rural communities have
economies connected to forest and wildlife resources. The reliance on these resources is
described in Section 5.4.1 1.
5.4.8 Health and Education
Average life expectancy is 54 years for women and 50 for men. Average nutrition levels as
measured by per capita calorie intake have fallen from 1,950 in the 1960s to 1,759 in
1988. In a 1988/89 survey, 34.0%/ of rual children have been found to be malnourished.
The national figure for the same period was 11.8%. Infant mortality is around 90/ and is
14.5% for those under five years of age. Of the country's 251 hospitals only 57 are found
in rural areas2o and only 3% of rural households live in communities with access to a
doctor.
The country has a literacy rate of approximately 54% and primary school enrollment is
approximately 50.6%. Of those above the age of 15, 32% are able to read, 30%/0 able to
write, and 41% able to carry out calculations. Eighty-seven per cent of all rural
communities have primry schools and 64% have schools offering junior secondary and
technical levels. The majority of schools in the rural areas are public.

In a survey for 1988/89, only 57.2% of those 15 years and older in the coastal area had
ever attended school. For the rural forest area and the rural savanna area the rates for the
same age group (15 years and older) were 63.6% and 29.7% respectively2'
5.4.9 Services
Treated water or water from boreholes is available to only 23% of households in rural
areas. The remaining communities depend on wells without pumps and natural sources
including springs, rivers, lakes and rainwater. 82% of all rural communities are without
electricity. Although 82% of all rural communities are accessible by road, only 54% have
access to public transport. Thus, access to medical centers, markets and other services
normally available in urban centers is impaired. Access to public transport is a 1-20 mile
walk for 18% of all rural people2.
5.4.10 Rights to Resources
Land usually belongs to a division of paramountcy within an ethnic group. It is either
divided into stool lands and family lands, or clan lands depending on the social structure of
the people. Rights are normally for land use and not for the sale of land. Security of tenure
of land- is based on the continual worling of the land in addition to the rendering of all
necessary customary services to the stool or family that owns the land.
All lands in Forest Reserves are vested in the President in trust for the stools. The
President has the right -to execute any deed or do any act as trustee". However, any
revenue derived from land and these vested rights must be placed into a Stool Land
account "for the benefit of people in the areas in which particular lands are situated" (Act
123 17,20). Thus the beneficiary rights remain with the traditional owners.23
Outside reserves the rights to timber and trees are also vested in the Government, in trust
for the owners. In 1994 the Forestry Department was given responsibity for the control
of off-reserve felling of trees. Timber concessions are used to grant timber harvesting
rights both on and off reserves. Currently there is a total of 810 concessions of which 282
are on-reserve24.

5.4.11 Relationship with Natural Resource Base25
NTFPs
In addition to the estimnated 130,000 jobs that the forest provides through timber
extraction and associated activities and the secondary and tertiary industries, the forest
base provides a number of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) that supplement rural
family incomes. These are essential for the day to day lives of communities. Forests
co,.Lribute to all aspects of rural life in southem Ghana. They provide food (including fish
fronm forest rivers), fodder, fuel, medicines, building materials, materials for various
household items, as well as a number of intangible benefits including cultural sy mbols,
-iral artifacts, and locales. In addition to the gathering of NTFPs for personal use, many
ouseholds gather, trade and process forest products to supplement their income. In some
cases these activities form the main source of livelihood. In the Kumasi market alone, 700
people are involved in the forest product trade on a full time basis. The NTFPs trade is
widespread and very robust, including an export trade where cola nut is the main and
significant income earner. Locally, in the Kumasi market in a three month period (April,
May, June) a total of 15,604 animals were available for trade with the most common
species being grasscutter, duiker and warthog. This volume represents only a small
fraction of the total amount of bushmeat captured and sold in the Kunasi area and the
indication from hunters is that there is as much bushmeat caught outside of the forest as
there is within the forest. However, there is the general opinion from elders and hunters
that hunting success is diminishing as a result of increased land clearances, increased
hunting pressure and umproved hunting equipment as well as an increase in bush fires.
. Fuelwood and Charcoal
Of the 26.5 million m3 of roundwood production in Ghana in 1995, only about 1.2 million
m3 was timber denved from the high forest; 20.7 million n3 was fuelwood, of which 4.5
million ln3 was converted to charcoal. This latter figure represents a yield of about
430,000 tons of charcoal. Other figures indicate considerably higher annual charcoal
production and consumption. Most of the charcoal is made from savanna wood, the
preferred raw material for charcoal. Rural households use fuelwood that is collected as
their main source of cooking fuel. The urban consumption of charcoal can be viewed as an
opportunity since it provides revenues for those of the savanna. As well, if the savanna
woodlands are sustainably managed, the burning of wood fuels would be carbon-neutral,
emission being balanced by sequestratior Villages in the savanna zone which have access
to natural woodlands can increase cash earnings, not only by selling fuelwood and
charcoal, but also by makdng and selling fuel-demanding products such as pottery and
beer, activities that can be carried out during the agricultural off-season.

Other Minor Forest Products
MXinor' forest products include other uses of wildlife, medicinal plants, edible plants. dyes.
canes, leaves for wrapping food, resins and gums, chewsticks, honey, thatching for roofs.
etc. The following information provides an indication of the value of these products:
.In 1985, close to 21,000 wild animnals were exported alive, worth US$344,032
The most important trade animal was the gray parrot, 9,500 of which were sold in
1985. The second most important group were monkeys used for medical research.
.Almnost I 00°/o of the rural population and about 60% of the urban population use
traditional medicines, many of which are forest-derived. Some forest plants are
exported.
.At least 300 forest trees in Ghana produce edible fruit. The forest also produces
considerable quantities of mushrooms, honey and palm wine. It is assumed that
these additions to the diet are more important for the lower-income groups.
5.4.12 People's Views and Values of the Forest2'
In the past the forest was highly valued as a source of food reserves during times of food
security, war and other emergency. In recent times people rely on the marketplace for
foodstuffs when there is a scarcity, but some people have indicated that this is so due to
the scarcity of food stuffs in the forest. Only a few people have recognized the most
important value of the forest as a source for timber. Forests are most highly valued for
NTFPs for subsistence trade, for the protection of the local environment, and in a few
villages as sacred sites. The most highly prized products are bushmeat and pestles
followed by canes and building materials. With regard to the local environment, rural
people value the forest as a windbreak, and in maintaining water resources, encouraging
rain, maintaining soil fertility, for reguating tenperture and for helping to maintain a
stable climate. Forests are also valued as land banks known to protect, improve and
restore soil fertility. In Ashanti villages many people associate forest cover with perennial
stream flow and they attibute dry season low water supply with forest clearings. Forests
outside of reserves are generally considered as farm land for future generations. Some
people feel that degraded farm land should be reserved for forest establishment in
exchange for land currently under reserve.
In communities most dependent upon forest reserves, people's fear and contempt for
current forest management is high.

5.4.13 Gender Concerns28
Rural women are responsible for producing 70%^/ of the national crop output. Thev play a
leading role in post-harvest activities including storage, processing and marketing of all
grains and starchy foods. And yet, in the rural areas, they are rewarded ittle for their
efforts and significant contributions to the household and national welfare.
Women's value in society has been strongly based on their reproductive functions, and
their ability to produce goods and services.
In rural areas the traditional power structure is still dominated by men and there are still
situations where major community decisions and life occasions are only taken by a
committee of men. Development committees in the villages that initiate, plan and
implement development projects such as the provision of school buildings, clinics, and
market places are dominated by men, primarily because the women are too busy carryng
out household duties. As elsewhere in the country, women hold few positions of power
and authority. Cultural and institutional factors restrict women's access to productive
resources including land, credit, training facilities, technological inputs and extension
services.
In both matilineai and patriLineal societies, traditional legal systems, religion and
perception of female roles ensure that the allocation of resources favor male authonty and
interests. Some negative traditional practices including female circumcision, superstition,
taboos and restrictions on pregnant and lactating mothers, worsen the terrible and
vulnerable situation of the majority of women.
Many women are given the most onerous, time consnuming, labor intensive and poorly
rewarded chores, both inside and outside of the home. Frequent child-birth and the
carrying out of domestic chores come at the expense of other productive roles and
participation in the wage economy for income generation. Hence, women rely exclusively
on spousal support. Those without such support fice worsening poverty-stricken
positions. Hard work affects their health and health problems are compounded by a
generally poor diet. They are found to be more undemourished than men :36% of women
in the lean season are underweight compared to 23% for men; 190/% during the rest of the
year for women and 3% for men. Women are on the receiving end of family violence and
there is a higher percentage of iliterate women than men.
During visits by the EIA team to the field to collect basic social infonnation, the major
concems identified by women who were interviewed in a selection of villages included
their status, inheritance issues, the fact that they had to work very long hours and that the
work load was very heavy, and there was very little capital input to help ease their burden.

5.4.14 Issues
Field work conducted by the ELA team in a number of communities revealed a number of
issues, or perceived issues, identified by the residents of these commnunities. As people
were asked to discuss their major concerns with the field team, not all issues are directly
related to the forest base.
need for non-timber forest products
Most rural economies are at the subsistence level and rely on non-timber forest products
to supplement their income and to provide a variety of goods to meet their day to day
needs. However, communities are denied access to forest reserves for collection purposes.
As the non-reserve areas become increasingly depleted communities see the lack of access
to reserve areas as a serious problem.
. pressure for farmland
More than 50r/. of the communities visited and are adjacent to forest reserves would like
to have land from the reserves for fanning purposes. The original settler communities are
now too large to be sustained on the basis of the original land areas allotted. The need for
additional land is further emphasized by the fact that the current share cropping
arrangement does not provide the cropper with sufficient crop return to support his family.
unemployment
Seventy-two per cent of the communities visited indicated that the unemployment of youth
was of major concern. Commurities adjacent to forest reserves would like to see timber
contractors hire local youth for their harvesting operations.
. public transport
Twenty-four per cent of communities visited have to walk approximately 2km or less to
access public transport. The absence of regular transport in most rural communities makes
it difficult for people to transport produce to market and generally to conduct any sort of
business in an efficient manner.
poverty and food security
The rural communities of the northern part of the country are characterized largely by
subsistence economies based on agriculture. Food resources are scarce and many families
deplete their food stores well before the next harvest is available. Lack of food and general
malnutrition results in disease and general poor health. Communities would like to see
activities introduced that would provide themn with a means for generating income that
could be used to supplement their food supplies and as well to improve their standard of
lving.
SS5:



. depleted soils
Fortv per cent of the communities visited indicated that their soils were depleted and that
their soils would no longer provide reasonable crop yields. This is a reason why the
communities in the reserve areas wished to see the Taungya system reinstated.
. benefits from reserves
Sixty-two per cent of communities visited indicated that they receive no benefits from the
reserves. Although communities have benefited from water supply, education and hospital
access projects, they felt that they were deserving of direct benefits as a result of their
proximty to the reserves. They wanted to have their youth employed by timber
contractors and some benefit from the royalties paid on timber extracted.
. tree planting
Although communities generally supported the idea of afforestation and reforestation,
their enthusiasm is hampered by the lack of seedlings, and in the northern areas, the lack of
support for protecting recent plantings from livestock. As well, the lack of sufficient water
for community nurseries is a deterrent to tree establishment.
The main issues brought forth during the public presentation in Kumasi centred around
loss of jobs in the industry and solutions to these losses including training and financial
support for various activities including wildlife rearing and forest nurseries.
6. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
6.1 Importat Environmental Components
Important Environmental Components (IECs) are those components of the environment
that have been considered worthy of attention and protection. They have been identified
(Table 6.1) and provide the basis for the identification and analysis of impacts. In the
analysis of impacts to follow, some EECs have been combined and some have been left
out, the latter as a result of analysis indicating no relevant benefit or impact
6.2 Benefits and Impacts
6.2.1 General
The overall purpose of the project is to alleviate poverty. This will occur relatively early in
the project in the savanma area where a comprehensive resource management component
will be implemented. However, a program of sustainable resource management in the high
forest area will contribute only in the long term, with initial forest industry job losses
occurring as a result of reducing harvests to the level of the allowable cut. A major benefit
56



to be realized by the project will be the retention of a stable, permanent and slowly
expanding workforce in the forest industry under a sustainable forest management
program. 'ithout this sustainable approach all jobs in the industry would ultimately be
lost.
Sustainable resource management provides many long lasting benefits to both rural
communities and the country as a whole. A resource that is managed on a sustainable basis
will contribute to a stable national economy and this in turn will provide social and
political stability. These advantages are felt even more at the community level, particularly
where the rural population has an economic stake in the management of the resource base.
Benefits, or positive impacts of the project, and the negative impacts are discussed in the
following section under each of the EECs. A subjective significance rating of each benefit
is provided (very high, high, moderate, low, or none) as well as a rating for each impact
based on the various criteria as previously described in Section 3.
An overall impact rating for each EEC is given. This is derived through consideration of
both the negative impact and the benefits. In some cases the negative impact (before
rnitigation) will outweigh the benefits to be gained. A MODERATE negative impact could
be lowered to an overall negative impact of LOW as a result of a benefit to be gained. In

6.2.2 Summary of Benefits and Impacts
Of the 27 IECs identified and examined, the project would have both impacts on, and
benefits for, 17 of them. The project would provide benefits only for the remaining 10
IECs. Impacts by level are summarized in Table 6.2. This table also summarizes the
residual impacts by level of significance. Table 6.3 indicates by level of significance the
number of cumulative impacts that would be expected.

Table 6.4 provides a summary of overall significantratin  for IECs, prior to mitipaion.
As indicated above, the NRMP is highly environmentally supportive and many of the
impacts on various IECs will be mitigated through vaTious programs and components of
the project. Of the 17 EECs that will be negatively affected by the project, impacts on 7 of
them will be mitigated through planned project activities, an additional three will be
mitigated through a combination of planned project actvities with additional non-project
58



actions. Impacts on four EECs will be mitigated through the application of 'best practice
guidelines', and the remaining three impacts will be mitigated through new additional
activities.

6.3 Impact Analysis
6.3.1 General
Many of the impacts described below are currently occurring under present forest
harvesting practices.
A number of impacts occur in one location within a reserve in any one year - but over the
years, the reserve will receive a number of these impacts - and country-wide many
reserves will receive these same impacts. This is cumulative but for purposes of identifyng
the impact, all reserves are dealt with as one, and the cumulative aspect, in this case, is
ignored.
6.3.2 Description of Impacts and Benefits
. Physical Environment
CLIMA TE
Impacts:
During the harvesting of individual trees, or groups of trees, canopy openings will occur.
Cover removal will bring about temprature increases and possible wind speed increases
within the forest. These changes could affect the establishment, growth and survival of
some speces. Forest floor exposure to sunlight could cause the introduction of unwanted
pioneer species and competition with desirable species. Increased temperatures could
affect wildlife hatitat. However, with harvesting activitY reduced to meet allowable cut
requirements, microclimatic modifications will be fewer than that which presently occur.
59



Impact would occur in a general area (multiple sites), would be of moderate duration,
would probably occur but only once during each cutting cycle, of low severity, and would
be reversible with time. Rating: LOW.
Mitigation: none
Benefits:
Forest cover regulates local climate, determines the microclimate within which various
lesser flora and the fauna communities of the forest exist. Regional climate, to some
extent, is also detemiined by forest cover, particularly where large forest tracts exist.
Precipitation, humidity and temperatures are all affected by the existence of large
contiguous tracts of forest cover. A sustainable forest management program will promote
the protection of large tracts of forest cover through a system of selective logging within
allowable cut limitations. A savanna management program will provide forest cover on
appropriate sites that will promote improved local climatic conditions including
temperature, wind and humidity.
At the local leveL small savanna plantations (e.g. windbreaks) and small farm plantings
provide shelter (for both people and crops) from wind (particularly important during the
harmattan) and high temperatures.
Globally, the maintenance of existing forest cover will allow Ghana to continue to
contnibute to the combat against the greenhouse effect by maintaining the tree cover that
removes CO2 from the atmosphere. Expansion of total forest cover will increase the
country's contribution to the prevention of global warming.
The benefit to micro- and local climates, and the contnbution to offsetting of global
warming outweigh the low inpact on microclimate and, thus, the overall effect would be
positive.
Sustainable forest management will not include clear cutting of large areas of forest nor
will the program include the establishment of huge (thousands of hectares) contiguous
blocks of plantation. By pursuing a course of sustainable forest management, existng
macroclimatic conditions would not be effected.
Overall effect: (+) LOW
AIR QUALITY
Impacts:
Through improved udlization, a broader range of tree species would be harvested and
processed. The use of additional species could result in new processes which could include
the use of a variety of chemicals that could contribute to air pollution.
60



The impact would cover a general area, be permanent, would be of low severity, could
possibly occur many times, and would possibly be reversible. Rating: MODERATE
Mitigation would include the careful planning and development of wood processes that do
not include toxic chemicals, or their by-products, that could be released to the
atmosphere. If such toxic chemicals are used in wood processing, air pollution control
mechanisms would be required.
Benefits:
With mill downsizing as a result of reduced raw material supply, and through improved
efficiency of the wood processing industry, fewer mill and processing plant residues will
be bumed, thus reducing the impact on air quality. Extension activities to control the
burning of crop residues will improve air quality during the seasons when burning
normally occurs.
Overall effect: (-) LOW
HYDROLOGY
Impacts:
Road development and skidding trails promote rapid runoff of rainfall which prevents full
recharge of groundwater resources and causes reduction of surface water flows.
The impact would cover a general area, would be temporasy, of moderate severity, would
probably occur frequently in any one reserve, but would be reversible. Rating:
MODERATE.
Mitigation: Best practice guidelines (logging manual) to be followed.
The establishment of a plantation in the savanna could contribute to the drawdown of the
water table which could result in hardship for local farmers. This could lead to reduced
crop production and lost incomes. It could also affect village weU water supplies.
The impact would cover a general area, would be pernanent, of low severity, would
possibly occur, only once, and would not be reversible. Rating: MODERATE
Mitigation would include holistic resource management to ensure that plantations that may
have an effect on the water table are not established m areas where the water table is
critical for other uses (current or future) such as agriculture (irrigation) and for domestic
and municipal requirements. Mitigation would also include the use of species that do not
have high water requirements. These mitigation measures will be part of the project
design.
61



Benefits:
Forest management practices that reduce harvests to the level of the allowable cut and
plantations established on degraded sites will provide good land cover which in turn will
reduce runoff and improve groundwater recharge. Surface waters will be better regulated,
particularly where reforestation is carried out in heavily degraded areas. Comprehensive
resource management in the savanna areas, including range management and the
establishment of plantations, will promote reduced runoff, recharged groundwater
resources and improved regulated surface water flow.
Overall effect: (+) MODERATE
WATER QUALITY
Impacts:
During the building of access roads, bare soils, are vulnerable to erosion and runoff into
waterways, affecting water quality. Soils on skidding tracks become bare and vulnerable to
erosion during rainy periods, particularly where tracks are located in steep terrain. Water
quality of forest streams and rivers could be affected.
Harvesting operations include the use of slddding vehicles, bulldozers for road-  ding,
and chainsaws. This equipment requires dieseL gasoline and lubricant oils. ImAproper
storage and handling of these materials, and the handling and disposal of waste products
(e.g. used oils) can lead to groundwater and surface water contamination.
The impact would cover a general area, would be for a medium term, of moderate
severity, probably occur many times, and is possibly reversible. Rating: MODERATE
-- Mtigation would include following best practice guidelines (logging manual), including
construction guidelines to minimize soil erosion during road construction. Guidelines
would also include stipulation that forest access roads would only be constructed during
the dry seasons. Where practical, road embankments would be vegetated. Skidding trails
would not be located on steep terrain. Regulations fbr the proper storage and handling of
petro-chenJicals would be provided. Waste oils would be stored and removed from the site
to proper permanent storage/recycling facilities.
Through improved utilization, a broader range of tree species would be harvested and
processed. Additional and new processes could include the use of a variety of chemicals
that could contribute to groundwater and surface water cotamination.
The impact would be local permanent, of moderate severity, could possibly occur and
frequently, and would possibly be reversible. Rating: MODERATE
62



Mitigation would include the careful planning and development of wood processes that do
not include toxic chemicals that could be released into soiL groundwater and surface water
svstems. If such toxic chemicals are used in additional wood processing, control
mechanisms and proper disposal of waste products would be used.
Benefits:
Plantation establishmnent and comprehensive savanna land management, including range
management, will lead to improved surface water quality.
Overall effect: (-): LOW
SOLES
Impacts:
Removal of the forest canopy dunng harvesting would allow direct impact of rain on the
forest floor which in turn could cause soil erosion. Skidding of logs increases soil
compaction which in tum decreases the ability of vegetation to recover and increases the
period of time that soils are exposed.
Impact would cover a general area, be of moderate duration, of moderate severity, would
be continuous, would probably be reversible and would probably occur. Rating:
MODERATE
Mitigation would include following best practice guidelines with the careful siting of
harvesting operations to avoid steep slopes and places where runoff could present a
serious problem. Best practice guidelines would also include restrictions on the size of
harvesting machines in order to reduce the degree of soil disturbance.
Benefits
Soil fertility will be improved with the use of leguminous species in plantations,
particularly where small plantations may be established in savanna and transition zone
areas. Effective forest management in off-reserve areas and comprehensive land
management in the savanna areas will reduce soil erosion. Site specific management in the
reserves will reduce soil erosion.
Oveall impact: (-): LOW
63



. Biological Environment
FLORA
Impacts:
Industry improvements and diversification will result in a demand for additional species.
Species that have been traditionally ignored would now be harvested. Although this would
reduce the pressure from species that are currently in high demand, harvesting pressure
would now be placed on these additional species. Additional species of the overall floral
composition of the forest would be removed and other lesser floral species (trees and
otherwise) associated with these new harvestable species could be affected.
The impact would be regional, of moderate duration, of moderate severity, occur many
times, and would possibly be reversible. Rating: MODERATE
Mitigation would involve sound sustainable forest management (a project objective). For
example, an adequate number of seed trees required for natural regeneration would be
maintained, and other conditons required for regeneration would be provided.
Biodiversity protection (a project objective) would address the impact to include the
exclusion of any scarlet stars from the list of new species to be harvested. Plantations
under the regeneration component would include these additional species to be harvested.
Plantation establishment in the transition zone and as part of the savanna management
program, could eliminate grassland and other species from the area being planted.
The impact would be over a general area, permat, of moderate severity, would likely
occur once, and would probably not be reversible. Rating: MODERATE
Mitigation would include surveys to determne best non-conflicting sites for plantation
establishment. This would be part of the overan savanna management program.
Benefits:
The biodiversity component of the forest management and savanna management programs
will ensure that important plant species, once surveyed and located, are provided with the
necessary protection.
Overall impact: (+) HIGH
FAUNA
Plantations are relatively simple ecosystems that will not provide the plant species mix and
other conditions required for the provision of suitable habitat for a wide variety of wildlife



species. Species could disappear from the sites where plantations are established and total
species populations in the area would be reduced.
This impact would be regional in extent, permanent, highly severe, would probably occur
several times, and would not likely be reversible. Rating: HIGH
Mitigation would include the minimal use of the plantation method of regenerating
commercial species within forest reserves and the assurance that plantations are small in
size in reserves where important faunal populations are large and complex. This mitigation
is in conflict with mitigation for the loss of biodiversity where it is important to retain as
much natural forest cover as is possible and rely more heavily on plantation wood for
industrial purposes.
Harvesting of individual trees and groups of trees reduces wildlife habitat and in some
cases can eliminate corridors (e.g. primates using arboreal habitats). Reduction of habitat
could result in a reduction of population and species from a particular reserve.
This impact would be regionaL of a moderate term, of high severity, would occur many
times uithin any one reserve, is reversible with time and would definitely occur. Rating:
HIGH
Mitigation would include forest harvesting to be carried out only in those areas where it is
known that wildlife populations will not be unduly disturbed and where recovery of
population numbers and composition will not be difficult. The biodiversity component of
the forest management program will ensure that important areas (e.g. important primate
species habitat) are excluded from harvestng..
Benefits:
A well implemented wildlife managemnent program will ensure that wildlife population
numbers and composition are maintained and increased where the carrying capacity
aDows.
The collaborative forestry and savanna management programs will include the
management of wild}ife resources for the benefit of the communities. Commercial
extraction and poaching will be more effectively controlled as a result of the community
benefiting from resources and revenues. Wdldlife resources will be managed on a
sustainable basis.
Through the provision of taining, vehicles and equipment, policy related to the protection
of endangered fauna species and habitats will be imlemented.
The biodiversity and insitutional support components of the project will enmure that the
biodiversity action plan is implemented, thus providing support to the protection of the
country's biodiversity.

Overall effect: (+) HIGH
RARE AND ENDANGERED SPECIES AND HABITA TS
Impacts:
Community fiuelwood plantations and pasture land development under the savanna
management program. could occur in areas of natural grassland containing rare and
endangered species and habitats that would be eliminated. These species would be
replaced with an exotic (to the area) monoculture. Reforestation in reserves and in off-
reserve areas could eliminate endangered species habitats through habitat modification.
Harvesting of individual trees and groups of trees reduces wildlife habitat, some of which
may be rare and endangered. In some cases harvesting can eliminate corridors (e.g.
primates using arboreal habitats). Reduction of habitat leads to reduction of population
and reduction of species, possibly those that are rare and endangered, from a particular
reserve.
The impact could be internationaL permanent, very severe, could possibly occur many
times, and would not likely be reversible. Rating: VERY HIGH
Mitigation would include the assurance that any plantations established in the savanna are
not sited in areas containing endangered species and endangered habitats. The savanna
management program is holistic in nature and would take these concems into account
when designating various areas for program activities. Surveys conducted under the
biodiversity component of the forest maaement program, and implementation of the
biodiverst action plan through the project, will ensure that important habitats and
populations of rare and endangered species are protected from timber harvesting and
reserve (and off-reserve) reforestation acfivities. In both the reserve and off-reserve areas,
mitigation would include the identification of critical areas of reserves and off-reserve
areas where rare and endangered species/or habitats occur. Each reserve and off-reserve
area would be assessed for these species and habitats prior to the finalization of harvesting
plans. Where such features exist, these areas would be excluded from harvesting. These
steps will also be included in the biodiversity component of the forest management
program.
Benefits:
Reduction of harvesting in order to achieve annual allowable cut volumes will reduce the
total reserve and off-reserve areas that will be disturbed. Both the wildlife management
component and the biodiversity component of the forest management program will
provide surveys and programming acivities that will identify and protect rare and
endangered species and habitats.
Oveall effect: (+) VERY HIGH
66



BiODIERSITY
Impacts:
Plantations will be established either within high forest areas (reserves and off-reserve
areas) or, in small blocks as fuelwood plantations in the savanna. Within the hieh forest
areas plantations would occupy areas that formerly would have displayed complex forest
communities. In the savanna areas plantations would occupy grasslands which, in their
natural state, would display biodiversity unique to the savanna. Plantations can never
provide the biodiversity that the natural high forest and savanna sites would originally
display since plantation forestry usually focuses on only a few species and species that are
often exotic. Plantation establishment promotes the reduction of biodiversity.
The impact would be country wide, permanent, very highly severe, would definitely occur
once, and would not likely be reversible. Rating: HIGH
Mitigation would include a greater reliance on convalescence (natural regeneration),
enrichment, and where plantation establishment is necessary, local species should be
considered. The biodiversity component of the forest managernent program would ensure
that important areas of biodiversity would not be lost to plantation establishment in the
savanna.
Harvesting of specific high value species only (without species utilization expansion)
reduces species mix and modifies habitats. Biodiversity of species and habitats is reduced.
Increasing the number of species to be used by the industry could reduce species
biodiversity and habitat biodiversity.
Fire protection can have a positive or negative effect on biodiversity protection. Fire
protection for high forest -reserves will contribute towards biodiversity protection but in
circumstances could prevent natural succession from occurring, thus limiting biodiversity.
Fire used as a management tool could prevent systems (e.g. in the savanna woodland)
from developing further stages of succession and thus prevent biodiversity development.
Mitigation, provided through the project forest management program, particularly the
biodiversity component, would include silvicultural prescriptions that would ensure the
protection of a minimal number of individual trees of each species. This in turn would
ensure natural regeneration of the species.
Benefits:
The project contains a biodiversity protection component which will contribute to the
imnplementation of the biodiversity strategies and action plan. Implementation of this plan
will ensure that the biodiversity of the country's forest and savanna regions is protected.
As well, the comprehensive savanna management program will ensure that areas of
67



important biodiversity are protected. It is likely that the program would only select the
most highly degraded sites for fuelwood plantation establishment.
Overall effect: (+) HIGH
. Socio-economic Environment
TRADITIONAL RIGHTS
Impacts:
The establishment of plantations in the savanna could lead to the loss of conummon grazing
areas from local communities as well as areas that are used for a variety of other
traditional uses.
Impact would be regional, over a prolonged period, highly severe, would probably occur
several times, and would be reversible. Rating: MODERATE
Mitigation could include careful planning and implementation of a comprehensive
pastoral-silvicultural system. This mitigative action will be part of the savanna
management program.
Benefits:
Over the years local communities have lost their traditional rights to non-timber forest
products as reserves have been closed to their access. The collaborative forestry
component would compensate for the loss of this traditional resource access. In addition,
the savanna management program will provide, in selected locations, small plantations that
will be accessible to local communities for fuedwood, building and other materials.
Overall effect: (+) HIGH
JOBS and POVERTY
Impacts:
An overall goal of forest management on a susmainable basis will result in a significant
reduction in annual harvested timber. This in turn will reduce the workforce significantly
on harvesting operations as well as in the wood processing sector. However, in the long
tern, a reduced number of jobs will be preserved. If the goal of sustainable forest
management is not pursued, the outcome would be the loss of most forest industry jobs by
the year 2020. This would result in a general increase in poverty since this prinary
industry supports a number of secondaTy and tertary activities and a large number of
service activities and jobs. Currentdy it is estimated that there are 130,000 direct jobs in the
68



industry and these are supplemented with a large number in the tertiary industry and
supporting sectors.
Improved wood utilization through the use of offcuts and other waste material in the
manufacturing process, would deny the use of these materials by other groups (e.g. coastal
people who use wastes in the food processing industry). The loss of a supply of low cost
(or free) materials could result in increased poverty,
The impact of downsizing the industry on jobs and poverty would be national, permanent,
very highly severe, would occur continuously over time, would not be reversible and
would definitely occur. Rating: VERY HIGH
The rating of VERY HIGH is misleading since the impact is necessary to ensure that total
job loss and the poverty associated with such job loss in the forest industry are avoided. A
significant number of jobs will be lost in order to preserve the majority of the jobs in the
industry.
Mitigation for the jobs that will be lost and for the poverty that the resulting
unemployment will cause will include the creation of new jobs in the wood processing
industry as a result of improved wood utilization, improvement of rural socio-economic
conditions through the collaborative forestry, reforestation and savanna land management
programs.
Benefits:
Implementation of a sustainable forest management program will ensure that those jobs
remaining following the downsizing of the industry, will be secured to perpetuity. The
savanna management program will provide the basis for some poverty alleviation, and the
collaborative forestry program will provide oppormnities for non-timber forest products
collection and sale that will further contribute to the alleviation of poverty. The wildlife
management program will include support of community conservation groups. A major
task of these groups will be to identify resource related income generating activities that
can be initiated by various donor groups. As well, the conservation groups will provide
guidance and advice to Tural communities for the establishment and rearing of captive
wildlife species for food and revenue.
The establishment of plantations (reforestation component) in the savanna and in off-
reserve areas, and individual trees on farms will provide increased availability of goods and
income for rural families and communities. Plantation establishment will create a number
of jobs, initially in the establishment and tending stages of plantation development and
later, in the harvesting and processing stages. Jobs in the local wood market will be
created as communities become involved in the collaborative forestry program.
Improved wood utilization will bring about new processes and less waste. Additional jobs
will be created and the total number of jobs per unit of raw material volume should
69



increase. Through effective resource management of national parks and wildlife reserves,
including the development and maintenance of infrastructure, tourism potential will be
developed and jobs for rural people will be created.
Income generation schemes could be developed as an inducement to enter into the
collaborative forestry program.
Overall effect, in the sbort term: (-) HIGH
Overall effect, in the long term: (+) HIGH
NON TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS
Impacts:
Implementation of the biodiversity management plan will result in the removal of reserve
and off-reserve areas from harvesting. Food stuffs, fuielwood, building materials and
medicinal plants would no longer be collected from areas brought under biodiversity
management.
The impact would be regional, permanent, highly severe, would definitely occur once, and
would not be reversible. Rating: HIGHI
Other project components including reforestation, collaborative foresty, and savanna
management would mitigate the losses incurred as a result of biodiversity management and
the removal of certain areas from non-timber product harvesting. Areas to be placed under
protection would be assessed for their contribution to improving local (for personal use)
socio-economic conditions. Compensation for community losses could also include the
provision of community infrastructure. Provision of community infiastructure will be
provided as part of an inducement for communities to participate in the collaborative
forestry programn
The savanna management program will include the protection of areas important for the
production of NTFPs, including grasses for crafts and household items, as well as
additional areas to be established and managed for NTFP production. Fuelwood
plantations in the savanna would be established in areas not curently required for other
important community uses, and where possible, they would be established on degraded
sites.
Benefits:
As indicated for mitigation above, the sava management, collaborative forestry and
reforestation programs will provide opportueis for developing a number of NTFPs
outside of the reserve areas.
Overall effect: (+) MODERATE
70



AESTHETICS
Impacts:
Timber harvesting results in open canopies, slash piles, high and unsightly tree stumps.
damaged standing trees and damaged lesser vegetation. During harvesting, operation
machinery, mud, and noise all contribute to a loss of aesthetics relative to those
experienced in an undisturbed area. However, it is not likely that this loss of aesthetics
affects a large population and the effect would be temporary until the forest recovers.
The impact would be at site, for a medium term, of low severity, would possibly occur,
many times, and would be reversible. Rating: LOW
The aesthetics of degraded sites will be improved through the project's plantation
program. Aesthetics of harvesting sites will be improved with the practice of good
standards.
Mitigation could also include the non-harvesting of areas that are important or potentially
important to tourists and for local recreation and environmental education.
Benefits:
The level of harvesting will be reduced as a result of implementing the principle of
sustained yield management and thus reducing the amount of logging damage. The project
will also provide funding for the implementation of national park and wildlife reserve
managIement plans. These will be developed in an aesthetically positive way in termns of
building and other structure location and layout, design, building materials used (e.g. local
materials), and color schemes.
Overall effect: (+) LOW
MIGRATION
Loss of forest related jobs in both harvesting and the processing industry will encourage
out-migration to areas where jobs exist or where it is perceived that jobs exist. This could
put pressure on the services of such major urban centers as Accra, Kumasi and Takoradi.
Urban social problems with additional unemployed families would increase.
The impact would be regional, medium term, of low severity, possibly occur, once, and
would probably be reversible. Rating: LOW
Alternative job opportunities in the community areas that will be most affected by forest
industry downsizing could be developed. Training programs could be introduced that
would provide forest and mill workers with skills that would allow them to obtain senii-
skilled or skdlled jobs in their communities or elsewhere in the general area.
71



Benefits:
The collaborative forestrv and plantation programs will provide income opportunities and
contribute to the alleviation of poverty. Improved socio-economic conditions will
encourage rural people to remain in communities, thus minirizing the degree of migration
to the urban centers.
Overall effect: (-) LOW
LAND USE
Land use in the savanna and off-reserve areas will change as a result of the savanna
management and plantation establishment programs, respectively. Depending on how land
resources in these areas are currently being used, the changes could be negative in terms
of affecting people's livelihoods and the socio-economic conditions of people and their
conmnunities.
The impact on land use could be moderate in area, prolonged, of low severity, possibly
occur, once, and would probably by reversible. Rating: LOW.
Mitigation is built into the project through careful planning, preceded by relevant surveys.
This would be particularly true in the savanna where a comprehensive savanna
management program will be implemented. Sites that play an important role both socially
and economically in community affairs would not be modified. Land use changes would be
for purposes of improving degraded sites and improving socio-economic conditions of the
commities in the area.
Benefits:
The savanna management program will promote good land use which will likely include
some land use changes to better serve the socio-economic needs of the communities and
to improve site condition and productivity. Improved extension activities as these relate to
collaborative forestry practices and on-farm tree establishment, will promote good land
use practices. The savanna management program will include soil and water conservation
activities. Reforestation in both on- and off-reserve areas will remove areas
from natural forest conditions and thus, reduce biodiversity, but in doing so, it will remove
long term harvesting pressure from exsting natura forest areas.
Overall effect: (I) MODERATE
72



GEN'DER ISSUES
The biodiversity component will exclude access to certain areas. This could require that
women from communities adjacent to these areas travel fiirther afield to collect firewood
and other forest materials essential for their subsistence.
The collaborative forestry component and the savanna plantation program of the
reforestation component may result in additional tasks for rural women to perform, thus
increasing their work burden.
The impacts on women could be widespread, permanent, moderately severe, possibly
occur, many times, and would probably be reversible. Rating: MODERATE
Mitigation could include, based on an assessment of women's roles through a public
consultative process, identification of activities that would ensure that the burden for
women, as a result of the project, is not increased. Enhancement could include the
lessening of women's burden, the provision of economic opportunities for women, an
increased role of women in decision making in terms of species to establish, areas to be
reforested, etc. and the provision of training for women.
Benefits:
The collaborative forestry program will provide, as an inducement for communities to
participate, community infrastructure facilities that will benefit women (e.g. village water
supply, health center). The savama management program and the reforestation program
will include the establishment of small comU muity fuelwood plantations dose to the
communities that will use them. These facilities and services will reduce the distances that
women will be required to travel for fuelwood, water and health services.
Overall effect: (+) MODERATE
FUELWOOD
Impacts:
A reduction in harvesfing levels, improved wood utiization and biodiversity protection
within reserves and off-reserves will reduce the amount of fuelwood available to local
communities. Traditionally local communities have collected waste wood following a
harvesting operation. The current level of the use of waste wood is not known and it is
possible that waste wood available following reductions in harvesting intensity and
improved ufilization may still meet local demand. However, if local requirements are not
met, the effect of reduced fuelwood availability would include increased cost to local
families for the purchase of fuielwood and an additional burden on women to search
further afield to meet their fuel needs.
73



If reduced fuelwood supplies present a hardship to local communities, the impact will be
regionaL prolonged, moderately severe, definitely occur once, and would probabil be
reversible. Rating. MODERATE
Mitigation would include implementation of the collaborative forestry program, fuelwood
plantations establishment in the savanna (savanna management program), on-farm tree
establishment, and a program of introducing and making available to rural people efficient
wood burning stoves.
Benefits:
The collaborative forestry program, the reforestation program and the savanna
management program will all contribute to an increased supply of readily available
fuelwood.
Overall effect: (+) MODERATE
6.3.2 Other Benefits
FORESTPROTECTION
Improvements in fire detection, prevention and suppression will reduce the loss of valuable
timber and imnature stands as well as valuable ecosystems, providing a host of non-timber
forest products. Biodiversity will be protected. Institutional support to the ministry will
allow more effective policing of regulations including illegal operators in both the forestry
and mining sectors. Policing of operational regulations within forest reserves will also
contribute to effective resource conservation, particularly where mining activities occur.
Benefit: HIGH
TREE TEN-URE
Trees on farms, unless planted by the farmer or tenant, are owned by the government or
the communities. Previously, to remove the tree a ^utsider only required penrission from
the gover-nment. The policy towards tree tent  will be implemented through the
institutional support component of the project. It - include the requirement of the land
owner to provide permission for the removal of th,    by another party. The project,
through public education, extension and the coll&    i ve program, will ensure that the
land owner is aware of the policy.
Benefit: MODERATE
74



FOREST PRODUCTION and a SUSTAJVABLE ECONOMY
Through all components of the project, forest productions both timber and non-timber,
will increase in the long term and production will be sustainable. Eventually, production
will be increased as plantations mature. Sustainable production will ensure permanent jobs
and incomes for those in the industry, as well as steady foreign earnings from exports.
With the increasing popularity of importing countries insisting on imports being certified
as 'sustainable forest origin', Ghana will be in a position to establish favorable long term
timber export relations.
Benefit: HIGH
ASSETS
Community assets will increase through the savanna management program and the
collaborative forestry program. Individual assets will increase through on-farm tree
establishment. Such assets will contribute to conmunity stability and individual household
stability as they provide a variety of products (food, fuelwood, building materials,
medicines and fodder) a steady source of income, and in the case of the savanna plantation
program, jobs.
Effective management of wildlife resources within reserves and national parks will ensure
that populations are maintained at carrying capacity levels. Under such management
wildlife will be less of a threat to communities and farn lands adjacent to the reserves and
parks. Assets such as trees, kraals, dams and stored crops will be better protected from
wildlife damage.
Skills leaning through the project's various programs (e.g. savanna plantation
establishment, soil and water conservation) is an asset that will allow rural people to
generate income.
Benefit: MODERATE
INFR4STRUC71TRE
The Timber Rights Bill will be implemented through the project. The bill includes a soial
responsibility contract between the communities and timber contractors to provide
infrastructure to communities. As well, communities will be provided with infiastructure
to encourage communities to participate in the collaborative progam.
Benefit: MODERATE
75



EDLUCA TION AND TRIA7NG
Through the institutional strengthening component, forestrv and wildlife staff members
will receive training that will allow them to effectively carry out the project's sustainable
management objectives.
Participants in the collaborative forestry scheme will be given training and will be made
environmentally aware to better appreciate the need for sustainable resource management.
In some instances, those who have been given training to maintain nurseries will possess
skills that can be used elsewhere. Plantation establishment in the savanna and on farms,
and community plantation establishment, will be combined with an effective extension
program that will train the farmer, and the community, in the establishment and tending of
the plantations and the harvesting and marketing of products from the plantation.
With a reduction in wood supply, the industry will be requirecd to become more efficient
in processing the supply with which it is provided. Training opportunities will be extended
to the industry to ensure that a high level of wood utilization efficiency is achieved.
Benefit: MODERATE
RELIGIOUS, CULTURA1L and ARCHAEOLOGICAL FEA4TURES
Where archaeological features are found in parks and game reserves these will be
protected and their interpretation and display will be enhanced to contribute to tourism
development and the protection of local culture. Anv such features within forest reserves
and off-reserve areas will be recognizca and pvit'a: i from harvesting damage. Physical
and biological features (e.g. sacred groves,! i-.- tE zignized and protected.
Benefit: LOW
PUBLICHEALTH
With the provision of rural jobs and an income, rural poverty in the long term will be
alleviated. As families move out of poverty they are able to direct more of their income to
adequate amounts of nutntious foods (preventative medicine) and to medicines (curative
medicine), thus improving family health.
The collaborative forestry, plantation and savanna management programs will contribute
to the establishment, maintenance and harvesting of medicinal plants on a sustainable
basis.
One of the responsibilities of the TUC is to provide public health faciities. These will be
provided as an inducement to communities to enter into the collaborative forestry
program.
76



Benefit: MODERATE
OCCUPATIONAL HEAL TH AND SAFETY
The problem of health and safety in the work place, particularly on harvesting operations
and in mill and other processing operations, prevails. Although the project will contribute
to the occurrence of fewer accidents and health problems through the downsizing of the
industry, the conditions leading to health and safety problems will remain. Workers in the
forest on harvesting sites as well as mill workers, often work in unsafe conditions and
without the benefit of safety equipment. Workers in the industry do not use hard hats,
safety footwear, ear protection, or other specialized safety clothing or equipment.
Environmental enhancement could include incentives and enforcement of relevant
regulations to reduce health and safety risks.
Sawdust recovery for production of sawdust briquettes will reduce the amount of sawdust
in the air, thus reducing the risk of respiratory problems amongst mill employees.
Benefit: HIGH
RECREATION
Management plan implementation of wildlife reserves and national parks within close
Proximity of urban areas will provide recreational opportunities, particularly to a growing
middle class that is becoming increasingly aware of its environment.
Benefit: LOW
6.4 Cumulative Effects
Of the 17 EECs upon which the project could have an impact, the project will have a
cumulative effect on 12 of them. Table 6.5 provides an analysis of the cumulative effects
of the project. The ratings on effects are given for each EEC for 'before mitigation'
conditions.

contributes insienificantly to overall water quality
degradation.
Soils               Low         Soil compaction and erosion is mainly caused by
large scale farming and inappropriate farming
techniques. Erosion is also caused by inappropriate
construction (e.g. roads, buildings) techniques.
Contribution by the project is small.
Flora               Low         Flora is lost primarily through agricultural
expansion, mining and urbanization. The project will
contribute to these losses in a minor way.
Fauna               Low         Loss of habitat through agricultural expansion and
urbanization as well as illegal felling in off-reserve
areas, as well as illegal hunting, are the primary
causes of loss of wildlife resources. Sustainable
forest management will contribute only slightly to
this overall loss.
Rare and endangered  High       As above, the contribution to the overall loss of rare
species and habitats            and endangered species is low, compared to losses
as a result of illegal capture, and loss of habitat.
However, any loss, even through the project, is
viewed as a significant contnbution to the overall
loss.
Biodiversity         Moderate  Off-reserve removal of forest vegetation for mining,
agricultural expansion, urbanization are the major
contributors to biodiversity loss. However,
harvesting activities do make a moderate
contribution.

Jobs and poverty     High       It is assumed that as the country's economy
expands, job opportunities increase. It is unlikely
that there are other sectors contributing to overall
job loss in the short term equivalent to those that

constantly throughout the countrv as a result of
urbanization and agriculture.

6.5 Residual Impacts
Residual impacts are those impacts that can be expected to persist once all mitigation has
been carried out. With the assumption that alD mitigation, as indicated in the impact
statements, and as detailed in the management plan, will be implemented, Table 6.6
describes the residual impacts to be expected and these are the impacts that have to be
taken into consideration when determining if the project should proceed in its present
form, if it should be modified, or if it should proceed at all. An examination of the residual
impacts- clearly portrays a project that is enviromnentally benign, and in fact, will
contribute significantly to the country's overall environmental health. A total of eight
LOW residual impacts and one each in the moderate and high categories will result from
the project. However, these residuals have to be considered in context to the many
benefits, as indicated in Section 6.2.2. With perhaps the exception of the one high residual
impact (loss of jobs - but only in the short to medium term) the benefits provided by the
Project far outweigh the residual impacts. In fact, a case could be made that the project
benefits outweigh the impacts before mitigation occurs!

6.6 Environmental Enhancement
Often projects with residual impacts will include environmental enhancement measures as
a way of compensating for permanently lost environmental values. However, the NRM
can be considered to be primarily an enviromnentally supportive project and many of its
actions are enhancing. A range of activities including the continuation of sustainable forest
management in reserves and the intent of the same for the off-reserve areas, to the
collaborative forestry and savanna management programs, and the biodiversity and wildlife
management components of the forest management component, all contribute to the
enhancement of the environment.
7. ANALYSIS OF PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
7.1 Concept Analysis
The NRMP has evolved over a period of several months through discussions between the
World Bank and the Ministry of Lands and Forestry. The project is not one that has been
selected from a number of alternative projects. However, dunng the development of the
project concept any one of the following five direcfions could have been taken.
. no project
. a continuation of the current FRMP project
. a World Bank type forest management project of the distant past which focused on
timber and not people
. a project that did not include a comprehensive savanna component
. the current project concept
Each altemative concept is briefly discussed in terms of the IECs that would be most
affected.
7.2 Alternative 1: No Project
Without the institutional strengthening that the project will provide, it is questionable that
all of the regulations relevant to sustainable forest management would be addressed. If
sustainable forest management is not fbllowed, a host of biophysical impacts would occur
81



including the loss of species, habitats, and, consequently, biodiversity. Although industr
jobs would be maintained, in the long term they would all be lost as the industry eventuallv
exhausts the merchantible timber supply. Local communities would receive no long term
benefits that sustainable forest management would have to offer. Poverty would not be
alleviated but instead would be aggravated.
7.3 Alternative 2: Continuation of Current FRMP
Although this project has been reasonably successful in achieving its objectives, it has
focused mainly on institutional issues. Extension of this project would provide the
additional institutional strengthening that the MLF requires in order to ensure sustainable
forest management, and thus, the benefits that NRMP will provide in this regard would
also be achieved by an FRMP extension. There was no specific biodiversity component in
FRMP. As well, it did not address wood processing issues, particularly underutilization of
raw materials. Apart from the support for community nurseries and the establishment of a
pilot for locally based savanna woodland management, it did not contain a substantial
conmunity forestry component. To continue the existing FRMP rather than adopting the
current concept, would not lead to any specific inputs towards biodiversity protection, or
protection of forest resources through a collaborative approach. Local communities would
not be able to take advantage of socio-econoniic improvement that a collaborative forestry
component would provide. Without a comprehensive savanna management component,
communities in the savanma would not be able to improve their overall socio-economic
situation.
7.4 Alternative 3: Historical Forestry Project
If a forest management project of the type that had been designed and implemented 20
years ago with WB support was considered, the impacts would have been significant. The
project probably would have been based on the concept of sustainable forest management,
and would have included many of the elements of the currently conceptualized project in
terms of istitutional support and development, and support to the private wood
processing sector. However, it probably would have also supported the replacement of
indigenous forests with fast growing plantations, would not have included a community
development component, and in fact, probably would have ignored local community issues
and needs as these relate to the forest resource. Biodiversity would have been significantly
reduced.
7.5 Alternative 4: Current Concept but Without Comprehensive Savanna
Management Component
This concept would experience most of the benefits and impacts that the current concept
will have with the exception of those associated with the savanna management component.
There would be no additional impacts, but without the component the net benefit that the
comprehensive savanna management component would have would be lost. The most
82



important benefit to be lost would be the opportunity to have a significant positive effect
on poverty alleviation of the people of the savanna.
7.6 Alternative 5: Current Concept
The current concept provides an overall environmental benefit to Ghana and particularly
to the rural communities. However, this benefit will only be achieved through a
tremendous effort made by Government in the implementation of the project. The project
will be complex, and institutionally chaUllenging to implement with a high degree of
efficiency and success. The public liaison mechanism to be designed and put into practice
in order to succeed with the savanna management component and the collaborative
forestry component will be extremely challenging and risky, particularly in a climate of
suspicion that local communities have for the FD. The capacity of the FD and other
relevant agencies is questionable in terms of being able to successfully implement the
project as presently envisaged.
7.7 Summary and Conclusions
To do nothing (alternative 1) would be folly and irresponsible. Resources would continue
to dwindle, industry jobs would eventually all be lost, poverty would worsen, and
biodiversity would be diminished.
To extend the current FRMP (alternative 2) would be to provide 'more of the same' and
although implementation would be relatively easy since 'more of the same' would
probably be implemented at a more efficient level. However, the real problems of rural
communities relative to the natural resource base would not be addressed and poverty
would not be significantly, if to any degree at aLl, reduced.
To follow the path of historical forestry projects (alternative 3) would be a regression.
Although sustainable forest management would be practiced, other forest values would be
ignored and local communities which depend on forest resources would receive no
benefits from the project. Biodiversity, in all likelihood, would suffer appreciably.
Alternative 4 (the current concept without the savanna management component) would
be neglecting a very important sector of the country's natural resource base. Although all
of the impacts and most of the benefits associated with the current concept (alternative 5)
would be realized, the overall benefit would be less. The project would be relatively easy
to implement under alternative 4, and therefore would have a greater chance for success.
Alternative 5, the current concept, is the most comprehensive of all of the alternative
concepts but it is also the most complex and will be the most difficult to implement
successfibly. The concept focuses on a number and variety of serious issues including rual
poverty, resource degradation, biodiversity protection, and non-sustainable forestry. The
insiutional challenges to address these problems effectively will be substantial.

8. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
8.1 Purpose and Intent
The environmental management plan is based on the results of the EIA. The purpose of
the plan is to provide the blueprnt for clear and timely actions that will be required to
mitigate and compensate for the impacts that have been identified through the ElA. Costs
indicated here are only indicative as to what will be required to implement the necessary
actions that have to be taken. The environmental management plan has to be further
developed and the Govemment of Ghana will have to indicate its committment to the
expenditures necessary to ensure that mitigation is completed.
8.2 Description
Since the project will have few negative impacts and the project is itself generally
environmentally supportive, few actions in addition to the implementation of the project
will be required. This management plan addresses the activities of the project that are
mitigative towards the impacts described, best practice guidelines for mitigation, and
additional actions that should be considered in order to ensure that all inpacts are
addressed. In the following sections the various activities, in addition to project activities,
required for mitigation are described. For each activity a description is provided for the
acivity, inputs required and outputs expected, responsibility, costs and scheduling.
Descriptions are provided for the impacts to be expected on 17 IECs.
8.3 Mitigative Measures
8.3.1 Impact on Air Quality
. Description
Since a broader range of tree species will be used in the wood processing industry,
additional wood processes may be employed. These processes could include chemicals
potentially toxic either in their current form or in their altered form. Air quality could be
compromised.
. Actions to be Taken
Industries contemplating new processes will be required to submit development plans to
the MLF for comment and approval. These plans will include the chemicals to be used in
the new processes and how they will be handled, used and disposed of Processes that may
lead to air pollution will require emission control. Industries will be required to install the
appropnate technology to ensure that emissions meet with country air quality standards.
84



. Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
Through the project, industries will be assisted in the identification of additional species
and processes that can be used. Industries will be required to advise the MLF of any new
processes to be adopted, including chemicals to be used and details of the processes.
Industries will be required to install appropriate technology to control emissions that may
exceed air quality standards. MLF should assign a staff member to the responsibility of
approving industry applications and for ensuring that monitoring (through the EPA) is
carried out and acted upon. New processes adapted by industry will not produce emissions
that exceed the country's air quality standards.
. Expected Results
Air quality will meet national standards.
. Scheduling and Costs
At this stage it is not known which additional chemicals, if any, will be used in new wood
processing activities. Studies will have to be conducted to determine appropriate
processing technologies to be considered for the industry. Such studies will take into
account air quality requiremnents.
Without knowledge of processes and chemicals to be used, at this stage, costs of
mitigation can not be determined.
8.3.2 Impact on Hydrology
Description
Harvesting activities lead to soil compaction and rainfall runoff. As a result, groundwater
recharge is reduced and flows of streams and rivers are increased. Without proper
selection of species and sites, plantations can cause groundwater drawdown that could
affect adjacent land uses such as irrigated agriculture and the water supply for villages.
. Actions to be Taken
Best practice guidelines during harvesting operations will be followed. These will include
the use of relatively light machinery for harvesting, avoidance of locating skidding trails on
steep slopes, and appropriate road building methods, particularly in the area of streamn
crossings.
During detailed planning for plantation establishment, consideration will be given to
groundwater needs of adjacent land uses and built up areas. Water requirements and the
effect on groundwater levels will be considered when species for reforestation are being
selected.
8S



. Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
Forest harvest planning will be carried out between the contractor and the FD, and the FD
will monitor harvesting operations to ensure that best practice guidelines are applied.
Silviculture planning to determine site and species selection will be carried out by the FD.
Outputs will include minimal runoff from skidding trails and logging roads. As well,
plantation establishment will not lower groundwater levels significantly.
. Expected Results
Groundwater recharge in forest areas will not be appreciably affected and stream sedimem
loads and flow rates in forest streams and rivers will be mininal. Stable habitats for
aquatic flora and fauna will be protected.
. Scheduling and Costs
Planning and the monitoring of the application of best practice guidelines will occur
immediately at project inception. No additional costs for mitigation will be required.
8.3.3 Impact on Water Quality
D Description
Water quality can be affected by the project from two sources. During harvesting
operations, runoff can add sediment loads to the surface water systen and can cary
spilled fuels and waste lubricants into the surface and groundwater systems. Through the
use of a broader range of species, the wood processing industry could introduce new
processes which could include the use of different chemicals that, if not comntned and
disposed of properly, could contaminate both groundwater and surface water systems.
. Actions to be Taken
Best practice guidelines will be applied during harvesing operations. Skidding will take
place and roads wil be maintained and built in such ways as to enure msinimal damage to
trail and road surfaces, and to mnimize runoff and erosion. Fuei, and lubricants will be
handled in a safe manner and will be stored properly. Waste lubricants will be stored and
carried out of the area to be deposited (recycled where possible) in a safe site and manner.
Operators could be required to use vegetable-based chainsaw lubricatmg oils, if these are
available.
. Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
The FD will ensure that best practice guidelines are applied on all harvesting operations,
including road location, construction and maintenance. Concessionaires will ensure that
86



these guidelines are followed. The FD will develop a set of guidelines for the safe
handling, storage and disposal of fuels and lubricants at the harvesting sites and it will
ensure that these guidelines will be followed. The FD should investizate the possibility and
feasibility of importing and using vegetable based chainsaw lubricants. The wood
processing industry will submit plans for new processes that utilize chemicals. Such plans
will indicate how these chemicals will be utilized, stored and handled, and how wastes will
be disposal. The FD will monitor the use and handling of chemicals for new processes.
. Expected Results
Groundwater and surface water quality will not be appreciably affected in harvesting areas
or at wood processing sites.
. Scheduling and Costs
The FD should provide sufficient funds to develop, at project inception, a set of guidelines
for the handling and storage of fuels, lubricants and other chemicals used on harvesting
operations. These guidelines will be appended to the existing Logging Manual. The FD
will provide an enviroDmental monitoring team (see description in Section 8.5) that will
ensure that guidelines are followed. Monitoring could be carried out on a spot check basis
anywhere in the country. The monitoring team would be responsible for all aspects of
environmental monitoring for forestry and the forest industry.
The wood processing industry would be required to finance the planning for new
processes that would require the use of chemicals. Such plans would describe in detail
how chemicals would be used, handled and disposed. Monitoring would be caried out by
the FD.
8.3.4 Impact on Soils
. Description
Soil erosion and compaction which will lead to a loss of productivity base, stream
sedimentation and runoff will result from poorly planned and implemented harvesting
plans.
. Actions to be Taken
Best practice guidelines as described in the Logging Manual will be foliowed in order to
minimize these impacts.
. Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
The concessionaire will be responsible for ensuring that roads are located, constructed and
maintained as per guidelines. He will also ensure that only equipment of the correct type
57



and size is engaged in the harvesting operation, and that skidding trails are not located on
steep slopes or in areas vulnerable to erosion. The FD) will be responsible for the
environmental monitoring of harvesting operations.
Outputs will include the proper construction of roads and siting of sk-idding trails, and the
use of appropriate skidd ng equipment. The FD will provide periodic monitoring reports
that will receive follow up action where required.
. Expected Results
Soil erosion and soil compaction on harvesting sites will be kept to a minimum.
. Scheduling and Costs
Mitigative measures, including environmental monitoring, will begin at project inception.
The FD will support an environmental monitoring unit and should provide sufficient
fiunding for the preparation of an environmental monitoring guidebook. Concessionaires
wi1 be responsible for the cost of appropriate machinery to be employed on the harvesting
operations.
8.3.5 Impact on Flora
* Description
Industry diversification will require new tree species. Additional species from the overall
floral composition of the forest will be removed and associated lesser forest species may
be affected. Plantation establishment in the transition zone and small fuelwood plantations
established in the savanna could eliminate grassland and transitional zone plant species.
. Actions to be Taken
The project will promote sustainable forest management practices including silvicultural
techniques to ensure that new species removed from the forest would be regenerated.
Through sound forest management and biodiversity protection, the project will protect the
important star species. Plantations to be established on degraded sites under the project
would include the new marketable species, thus eventualy removing pressure from the
desired species in their natural habitat.
. Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
No inputs additional to those required for implementing the project will be required.
Sustainable forest management, including reforestation, will be the responsibility of the
FD.
Outputs will include plantation development of the most commercially favorable species.



. Expected Results
Harvesting of additional species will be conducted in accordance to sustainable forest
management principles. Silvicultural techniques employed in forest manazement will
ensure that new species harvested will be able to regenerate naturally, and that associated
species will not be negatively affected.
. Scheduling and Costs
As per the project scheduling and budget.
8.3.6 Impact on Fauna; and Rare and Endangered Species and Habitats
. Description
The establishment of plantations provides relatively simple ecosystems that will not
support the variety of species and population densities of wildlife that the natural forest
would support. Wildlife species now present on degraded sites could disappear with a
conversion to plantations. Haesting of individual trees and groups of trees in the natural
high forest will reduce wildlife habitat. Of particular concern wil be the possible
elimination of corridors such as the forest canopy corridor used by some primates.
Reduced habitat leads to reduced populations and species mix.
. Actions to be Taken
The project will ensure that plantation establishment will not occur in areas that are
important wildlife habitat. Each potential site for plantation establishment will be carefully
surveyed to determine existing wildlife habitat and population values. Where natural forest
areas are to be harvested, each area will be examined for wildlife habitat and population
species values. Forest management plans will be prepared, taking the protection of
important wildlife habitats into consideraion.
. Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
As part of the project, important areas of biodiversity will be surveyed and demarcated as
such. These areas wil be removed from fiuture harvesting. The FD will be responsible for
carrying out the biodiversity survey and for ensurng that forest management plans will
exclude important wildlife habitats from harvesting. The ED will also be responsible for
determining areas for reforestation.
No additional costs or staffing already indicated in project inputs will be required. Outputs
wull include the exclusion of important wildlife habitats from harvesting and from areas to
be reforested.
89



. Expected Results
Important wildlife habitats and populations will be protected.
. Scheduling and Costs
As per project scheduling and budget.
8.3.7 Impact on Biodiversity
. Description
The high forest and savanna regions contain their own unique mix of fauna and flora and
together they contribute to a complex and unique national biodiversity. Conversion of high
forest areas to plantations and management of the savanna resources which may alter
natural grasslands, will reduce biodiversity. Forest plantations can never provide the same
biodiversity found under natural high forest conditions. Savanna grasslands converted to
fuielwood plantations or to new grasses and crops for increased agricultural and livestock
production, likewise will lead to a reduction in biodiversity.
A ctions to be Taken
The project, through its sustainable forest management approach and programs of savanna
management and biodiversity protection, will ensure that areas of important biodiversity
values are not violated. Surveys will be conducted to identify these important areas.
I lnputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
Project inputs will include biodiversity surveys and biodiversity protection to be conducted
and implemented by the ElD and the WD.
Outputs wil include the exclusion of important biodiversity areas from harvesting,
plantation development and agricultural related development.
. Expected Results
Biodiversity in the high forest and savanma regions of Ghana will be protected.
. Scheduling and Costs
As per project scheduling and budget..- 
:0



8.3.8 Impacts on Traditional Rights
. Description
The establishment of fuelwood plantations in the savanna could lead to the loss of
common grazing areas to local communities. Areas removed from access through the
biodiversity protection program could affect traditional rights.
. Actions to be Taken
Actions to be taken are within the scope of the project and include careful planning for the
location of plantations and the design and location of pastoral-silvicultural systems.
. Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
No additional inputs to those already described in the project will be required. The FD and
MoAF will take on the responsibilities of ensuring the protection of areas that include
opportunities for local communities to practice traditional rights.
Outputs will include the protection of traditional rights.
Expected Results
Communities will be satisfied with the DF and MoAF actions in the protection, and
possibly the enhancement, of their traditional rights activities.
S Scheduling and Costs
As per project scheduling and budget.
8.3.9 Impacts on Jobs and Poverty
. Description
The forest industry will be required to downsize as a result of achieving the goal of
sustainable forest management and reducing the annual harvest to within the limits of the
sustainable allowable cut. Many jobs will be lost in the short and medium term. However,
by meeting the goal of sustainable forest management, the jobs that are retained will be
available to perpetuity, not withstanding further downsizing through mechanization and
other actions to improve efficiency and productivity input/output ratios.
. Action to be Taken
The collaborative forestry program and the savanna management program will provide
opportunities for improving rural socio-econoric conditions and thus will contribute
91



substantially to the alleviation of poverty in these areas with opportunities for resource
product harvesting and improved productivity of farm and grazing lands. As well, project
support to the industry will identify downstream wood processing technologies that will
provide additional jobs, possibly to some who will be released from the existing mills as
mill productivity is reduced.
In addition to project programs, additional training of those to be downsized should be
provided in order that these 'new jobless' will develop skills that can be used elsewhere.
Inputs will require formal and 'on the job' training in areas where there is demand for
semi-skilled and skilled individuals. Inputs in the forn of grants to individuals to attend
formal training sessions already available to the general public, or to place these
individuals in apprenticeship programs, will be provided. Income generating opportunities
(e.g. domessticating wildlife for sale, utilization of forest wastess, bee keeping) will be
researched.
A comprehensive training and work placement plan will be developed.
. Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
MLF should provide adequate fimding for the preparation of a human resource
development plan that will include a survey of people who will lose their jobs as a result of
meeting allowable cut volumes. It should also provide fimding towards implementation of
the plan. Funds could be sought from the donor community. MLF could also provide a
staff member to oversee the development of the training plan and the monitoring of its
implementation. Outputs will include a human resources development plan (training)
directed towards those who will be downsized from the forest industry. Output will also
include training courses and apprenticeships being provided to a minimum of 25% of all of
those who will lose their jobs as a result of industry downsizing.
Training will likely occur in existing training ceners and in programs already being
provided. Implementation of the training plan would be monitored by an outside agency.
Funds for researching alternative income generating activities should be provided.
Expected Results
At least 25% of all of those who lose their jobs as a result of the project should be
provided with sutable traing to allow them to gai employment in other areas. At least
75% of those who receive training should be gainfmlly employed within a year of
successfully completing their training program.
. Scheduling and Costs
The training plan would be developed within the first year of the project and
implementation of the plan would be carried out during the life of the project.
92



8.3.10 Impacts on Non Timber Forest Products
. Description
Implementation of the biodiversity management plan will result in the removal of reserve
and off-reserve areas from harvesting. Foodstuffs, fuelwood, building materials and
medicinal plants would no longer be collected from areas designated for biodiversity
management.
. Actions to be Taken
Project components including fuelwood plantation establishment in the savanna areas and
other savanna management activities, and the collaborative forestry program will provide
NTFPs for local use, to compensate for losses as a result of biodiversity losses.
Compensation for community losses, and as an incentive for communities to participate in
the collaborative forestry programn, will include the provision of community infrastructure.
The savanna management program will include the protection and development of areas to
produce NTFPs.
Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
No additional inputs to those already being provided by the project will be required. The
FD and the MoAF will be responsible for managng the appropriate sections of the project.
Outputs will include the development of NTFPs for rural community use to compensate
for those NTFPs that will no longer be available as a result of various management
activities.
. Expected Results
Local communities and families wil not be deprived of traditional NTFPs that are
important to their local economies.
. Scheduling and Costs
As per project scheduiing and budget.
8.3.11 Impacts on Aesthetics
. Description
Timber harvesting results in open canopies, slash piles, high and unsightly tree stumps, and
damaged trees and lesser vegetation. During harvesting operation, machinery, mud and
noise all contribute to a reduction of aesthetic values.
93



. Actions to be Taken
Degraded sites, following logging, will be replanted, as part of the project. Through the
practice of good standards, aesthetic values of harvesting sites will be retained to the
extent possible. Trees will be felled with stumps close to the ground and in such a way as
to not cause damage to other standing trees. Skidding trails will be located in a manner
that will minimize damage to vegetation, particularly standing trees. Slash piles will be
broken down.
. Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
The FD will be responsible for monitoring to ensure that good practices are applied. The
FD will also ensure that plantations are established on degraded sites. The concessionaire
will be responsible for practicing good standards.
Outputs will include the retention of aesthetic values to the extent possible at a harvesting
site, and reforested degraded sites.
. Expected Results
Aesthetic values will be retained as much as possible on harvesting sites and degraded sites
will be improved with plantation establishment.
. Scheduling and Costs
As per project scheduling and budget.
83.12 Impacts on Migration
. Description
Downsizing of the forest industry will lead to a certain degree of migration as people drift
to the cities and other urban areas in search of work. The MLF will provide sufficient
funding to those Government agencies that implement income generating progmms. Funds
will also be provided to encourage industries to locate in the rural areas in order to
provide jobs for local people.
. Actions to be Taken
A number of project programs and components (savanma management, colaborative
forestry component) will assist n minimizing migration. Additional activities should be
carred out to further encourage people from migrating to the rural areas. These could
include the development of income generating activities, particularly the support and
expansion of cottage industries based on the forest resource. Training could also be
94



provided so that those who do mizrate will have marketable skills. lncentives for small
industries to locate in rural areas should also be provided.
. Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
Inputs required should include a cash contribution from MLF to cottage industry and
other income generating programs to assist downsized forest industry workers to gain
meaningful local employment. An outside agency will monitor progress.
Outputs will include downsized forest industry workers retrained and employed in
alternative jobs in the local area. Migration from the rural areas as a result of forest
industry downsizing should be reduced by 40%.
. Expected Results
Migration to urban areas will not be great, resulting in fewer than expected new
unemployed people in the major cities. A stable social and political urban environment will
be maintained.
. Scheduling and Costs
An adequate contribution will be made to the appropriate government agencies. The
programming will begin as soon as the forest industry begins to downsize.
8.3.13 Impacts on Fuelwood
. Description
A reduction in harvesting levels, improved wood utilization and biodiversity protection
within reserves and off-reserve areas will reduce the amount of fielwood available to local
communities. Traditionally local communities have collected waste wood following
harvesting operations.
. Actions to be Taken
The collaborative forestry component will provide the opportunity for local communities
to share the NTFP resource of the reserve and off-reserve areas. Plantations in the
transition zone and fuelwood plantings as part of the savanna land management program
will also provide fuelwood supplies to local communities in proximity to these plantations.
. Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
The FD has overall responsibility for the project. It will establish plataions, and in
conjunction with MoAF and local communities, will manage savanna resources, for
g5



amongst other products, the production of fuelwood. No additional inputs apart from
those identified in the project concept will be required.
Outputs wil include the provision of adequate fuelwood supphes for local communities.
E Expected Results
Economic conditions of local communities will be improved as they are provided with a
source of fuelwood and a number of jobs associated with the establishment and tending of
plantations, and the harvesting and marketing of fuelwood. Women's burdens will be
reduced with the availability of fuelwood in close proximity to their communities.
. Scheduling and Costs
As per project scheduling and budget.
8.3.14 Impact on Land Use
. Description
Land use in the savanna and off-reserve areas will change as a result of the savanna
management program and the reforestation program, respectively.
. Actions to be Taken
Comprehensive resource planning will be part of detailed project design to ensure that
appropriate land use changes are made and that such changes will not disadvantage local
communities or important ecological systems.
. Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
The FD will be responsible, in conjunction with local communities, for determining land
use changes to be made. Input involves comprehensive resource planning in a team
environment with other relevant ministries and departments (e.g. MoAF, WD). Outputs
will include prudent land use.
. Expected Results
Land use changes will result in more effective utilization of the land base on a sustainable
basis. Where applicable, the land use will serve local communities more effectively.
Scheduling and Costs
As per project schedule and budget.

8.3.15 Impact on Gender Issues
Description
The biodiversity component will exclude access to certain areas This could require that
women from communities adjacent to these areas travel further afield to collect firewood
and other forest materials essential for their rural subsistence livelihood. The savanna
management program will include a number of resource management activities that could
affect women in terms of additional tasks that they may be required to carry out. The
collaborative forestry component and the reforestation programs may also affect the daily
lives and schedules of women.
Actions to be Taken
Through the collaborative forestry component, the savanna management and the
reforestation programs, potentially there will be a number of opportunities that will assist
in easing the lives and daily schedules of women. In the detailed designing of each of the
project programs and components, the effects on women will be considered. The project
should ensure that jobs provided through the project are equally distributed between men
and women, where women desire such jobs. As well, any training activities that the project
provides must be available to women and men equally.
Income generating activities through the collaborative forestry program and the savanna
management program should be made available to both men and women equally. Decision
malang regarding reforestation, savanna management and collaborative forestry activities
will involve local participation and this participation will include, and indeed, seek out,
women.
I Inputs, Outputs and Responsibilities
The FD will be responsible for implemening the project components and will ensure that
women will have the opportunity to provide input and take advantage of project benefits
on an e:jual basis with men. In doing so, the FD should ensure that a gender issues.
spec.iist is included as part of the detailed planning of the project. The environmental
monitor uf the FD will monitor the impact that the project wifl have on women and other,
generally considered, disadvantaged groups. No additional costs will be required to ensure
that women are provided with a share of the project benefits.
Outputs will include implemented project programs and components that have taken
women's concerns into consideration.
. Expected Results
Women will share equally in community related project decision making and in project
benefits. They will not be dadvantaged in any way by project activities and results.
97



. Scheduling and Costs
Women's concerns will be incorporated at the beginning of the detailed project desin
stage. Additional costs should include $10,000 to include a gender issues specialist dunrng
detailed design stage.

included here in 'soils' for convenience.
8.5 Training
The Forestry Departmnent will be responsible for implementing the environmental
managmentplan and for ensuring that other measures through project implementation
required for mitigation are carred out and that they achieve their objectve in this regard.
In order to do so the ELJF will designate an individual to be responsi-ble for monitoring the
.  .~ ~~~~'



progress of the plan and the project as it relates to addressing the impacts. Currentlv the
MLF does not have an individual trained in either environmental assessment or
monitoring. An individual in the Ministry should be designated the position of
environmental officer and be given the opportunity for short course training, possibly
abroad, in environmental management and environmental effects monitoring. The
environmental monitor will also oversee monitoring of harvesting sites through district
forestry field staff. Individuals in the field who will have responsibility for monitoring
harvesting sites will receive in-house and on the job training from the environmental
monitor and possibly from an external source.
8.6 Monitoring and Reporting
Environmental effects monitoring is necessary to ensure that predicted impacts are
addressed effectively and efficiently through the mitigative measures indicated. Three main
objectives of monitoring are: i) to ensure that any additional impacts not identified in the
EIA document are addressed appropriately; ii) to ensure that the mitigative actions are
appropriate for addressing the impacts; and, iii) to feed infonnation back to management
in order that appropriate modifications can be made to either the operational activities or
to the enviromTental management plan in terms of mitigative measures to be applied.
To ensure that environmental effects are mitigated effectively a monitoring section should
be established in the MLF. This section would consist of the monitoring officer described
in Section 8.4. The individual would be assisted on a part time basis by district field
officers who will have received basic monitoring training.
The monitor will carry out monitoring duties in accordance to a manual for monitoring
that would be prepared by MLF. The manual should be specific to the project and should
clearly explain the procedures for effective field monitoring. Such a manual would contain
sections on baseline data requirements and how these should be identified, collected and
used, identification of key indicators, monitoring schedule, measurement techniques,
interpretation of results and presentation of findings, and the application of findings to
management decision making.
Monitoring should be carried out on an on-going basis and on harvesting sites it should be
done regulary through random sampling. Monthly monitonng reports would be provided
to the management team for information, discussion and action.
An environmental management plan will only be effective if effective monitoring is
carried out and if the management team is prepared to act upon monitoring results and
recommendations. A series of penalties and enforcement mechanisms must be put in place
and must be enacted upon when the management plan is contravened. For exaunple, if a
concessionaire is skidding logs on steep slopes contray to the harvesting plan and this is
reported through regular monitoring, management must penalize the concessionaire
accordingly.

Appendix 1: Description of Ghana's Major Vegetation Types
1. Wet Evergreen Forest (WE)
The Wet evergreen ecotype can have over 200 species in 25rn sq. plots (Hawthorne and
Juam Musah, 1993) and is the least disturbed forest type with endemic species. They are
both closed ana are rich in commercial timber and lesser-known economic tree species
(LKS). Species diversity include the endemic Cola umbratilis and Monocyclanthus sps.
The Neung Forest Reserves. Some members of the plant associations often referred to as
Tropilochiton - Celtis - Tarrietia and Piptadeniastrum - Lophira Associations are:
Triplochiton scieroxylon                    (Wawa, Obeche)
Pericopsis elata                            (Kokrodua, Afrormossia)
Celtis mildbraedi                           (Esa)
Guibourtia ehie                             (Anokye-hyedua)
Piptadeniasvum aficanum                     (Dahoma)
Lophira alata                               (Ekki, Kaku)
Khaya anthothecalK ivorensis                (Mahogany)
Nesogordonia papaverifera                   (Denta)
Pycnanthus angolensis                       (Otie)
Milicia excelaformerh Chlorophora ercelsa   (Odum)
Canarium schweifurthii                      (Camnanumn, Bediwonua)
Daniella ogea                               (Shedua)
Entandrophragma utile                       (Utile, Sipo)
Entandrophragma angolense                   (Edinm)
Turracanthus afncamns                       (Avodire)
Mansoniaaltissima                           (Oprono, Mansonia)
Nauclea d&derichii                          (Kusia)
Heretiera utilis formerly Tczietia utilis   (Nyankom)
Lovoa trichilioides                         (Afiican Walnut)
Terminalia superba                          (Ofram)
Sterculia rhinopetala                       (Wawabima)
Terminalia ivorensis                        (Emire)
This closed canopy forest covers only 65701kn sq. or 2.75% of the forest land.
2. Moist Evergreen Forest ((ME)
This ecotype has slightly less diverse association members than the wet evergreen forest.
ME is heavily logged and has often open canopies. Biodiversity shows numerous plant
species and genetic richness.  Plant species include Dialium aubreville, Strombosia
glaucescens, Lophira alata, and Cola laterata. Due to richness the 17,770hn sq. area
(7.45%/*) is fast being decimated.
103



3. Upland evergreen forest (UE)
This forest ecotype is unique in its composition of pioneer and secondary species. It
covers only 292 km sq. or 0.12% of the forest estate, the greater par of which is found in
the Atewa range. Many rare plants and animal species are found here. They include some
of the floristic species of 'WE and MIE as well as the rare and endangered Hvmenocoleus
mulainervis and Cyanthea manniana, a palm  sized tree term  and   Trilepisium
madagascanense.
Other tree species such as Cedrela odorata and Ficus macrosperma Pienanthus angolensis
(Otie, Carboard) Nesogordonia Papavenfera (Danta, Kotibe) Chlorophora regia (Odurr;
African Oak). make the smaD are covered a treasured ecotype. Hall and Swaine (981)
found the envirownent of the Upland evergreen forest, the habitat for several sunumits,
swamps and thickets need a special 'protection strategy'.
4. Moist - Semi-deciduous Forest (MS)
Species diversity is MS is relaively lower than in WE. The height of mature economic
species average 60m. Because of the wide amplitude of its area coverage two sub-
ecotypes, the North-West and South -East vegetation formations have been identified. The
Southeast ecotype representing 40%r/ of MS forest area of 32,8901ak sq. harbours elephant
populations and has about 100 commercial timber species under exploitation. For
example, Truplocuiton scelroxyon (Wawa) is endangered from over exploitation. The
same applies to Celtis Mildbraedii (Esa).
5. Dry Semi-deciduous Forest (DS)
This ecotype is prone to fire but occupies 21,440km sq. (8.99%) of the forest estate, the
second largest group. Convering a trasition zone between the north and east of MS,
species diversity is relatvely low with 40-100 species in 25mm x 25mm sample plot. Two
types corresponding two rainf  peaks 1250mm and 1500mm characterise fire tender
plant species and drier fire zone. The Nsemre Forest Reserve with typical composition of
Elaies Guineensis, Lannea Nigritana, Afzelia qfricana, Aubrevillea Playca  form
forest - islands with intruding savanna represented by some tall -grasses.
6. Southem Marginad Forest (SM)
A wedge shaped area from Takoradi to Akuse is classified as Coastal thicket grassland
(Taylor, 1952). This forest ecotype is really species poor due to low and emrtic
precipitation on shallow soils. The area of 2,60km2 (0.99%) extended as a narrow belt
from Cape Coast to Akosombo.
There is heavy anthropological activity on the mostly small ftgments of forest on rocky
hills. Tree species are caa isticaUly short-statned and include the endemic species
(e.g. Sapawsu F.R.)
104



Dalbergwa setnfera
Turraea ghanensis
Talbotiella gentii
Afzelia africana
Antaris toxicaria
Hymenostegia afteii
Hildegardia bargeri and Dialium guineense,
-which form monospecific stands.
7. Southeast Outlier Forest (SO)
This forest ecotype is characterised by several understoreys (strata) of plant associations.
Occupying just 201an sq. (0.0083%), the ecotype is species rich.
Millettia thmmingli (occupies the upper strata)
Diospyros abyssinica
Drypetesparvifolia
Grewia egalocarpa
Cammiphora daizielil
Eugenia coronate and the dominant association Vefiveriafulhibarbis, Fimbristilis.ovata,
and Andropogon canaliculams, occupy other positions in a highly structured species
profile. Schmitt and Adu-Nsiah (1993) conducted a survey and evaluted the biological
diversity which is reproduced elsewhere in this report.
Essentially the short-grass savanna Vetivena fulvibarbis and Brachiaria falcifera form a
plant community on the Vertisols of the Plains around the Shai Hills. Although floristically
very uniform, the South-east outlier forest has other plant species for its rich fauna. The
include the trees Azadirachta (Neem) which is exotic,
i     Adansonia dgitata (Baobab)
*     Combretumfiragras
*     Lonchocapus serwceus
and the herbs
*     Eriosema molle
*     Cassia mimosoides
*     Indigofera subulata
*     Polygala guinneensis and Parenaria, and Striga linearifolia.
Due to poor draingage of the Vertisols, water-logging alternate with seasonal drought.
The short grass vegetation wnth shrubs/evergreen trees is an assemblage of high
conservation value (Hall and Swaine, 1981).
8. Tall-grass Savanna (TDS)
Often referred to as Interior or Guinea savanna, is the largest vegetation single vegetation
ecotype in the countly. It covers 144,948 km2 and that is 60.77% of the forest estate.
105



The vegetation made up of tal grasses interspersed with fire-tolerant trees such as:
Butyros permum paradoxum
Adansonia digiuata            (Baobab)
Acacia sps                     (for fuel wood)
Parkia biglobosa              (dawa dawa)
X tellariaparadoxa             (Shea butter)
Tectona grandis                (exotic Teak)
Leucaena leucocephala          (fodder)
Magnifera indica               (Orchard mango)
This is a transitional zone of tall-short Sudan-grass (Schmitt and Adu-Nsiah, 1993),
dominated by Isoberlinia doka and Burkea fricana
Throughout the dense populated area between Navrongo and Gambaga, huge areas of the
northern savanna have been converted to 'Parldand' and Game/Nature reserves due to
human activities e.g. hunting, fuelwood and biodiversity (shea nuts, baobab, dawa dawa
and medicinal plants) collection. Rose Innes (1977) described huge areas of the
ecosystem as farmed parkiand. After many decades of cultivation, protected trees emerge
as donaint features in the park-like landscape. The vegetation stmcture then culminates
in a ground-layer dominated by low annual grasses with shrubs of high biodiversity value
(herbs) and an upper storey of the afore-mentioned trees.
9. Short-grass Savanna (SGS)
This border ecotype is sometimes referred to as coastal savanna or gssland. its limited
distribution over an area of 10,540km sq. (4.42%) and unique formations make it ripe for
current biodiversity protectve strategies.
Again, Jenik and Hall(1976), and Schmitt and Adu-Nsiah (1993) report that the short-
grass savanna is mainly determined by eisting soil types and rainl distnbution. The
entire south-east of the southern marginal and dry semi-deciduous forest zone is
characterised by low eratic rainfal and soils different from those of the forests and guinea
savanna (See section on Soils and Geology backed by Maps/Figure in Appendices
Section).
The gassland barbours floristically and physiog-nomically, a vegetation formaton apply
described as Sudan-grass savanna. Characteristic grasses are:
V-ertiveria fudvibarbis, Brachiarie falcifer. Sedges also form a major plant association
with Fimbnstyla ovata and Fimbristyla pilosa dominant. A recent field study by Dua
(1997) found Isoberlinia doka, Daniella olivieri, and Detarium microcarpum, reported as
trees of the Guinea - savanna either completely absent Rare communities of the species are
found in northern Ho - Keta Plains, and also in the Kalakpa Game Production Reserve.
106



10. Mangrove Forest (MA)
Mangrove forests which once covered much of Ghana's coastline todav represents only
about 1.670km sq. (0.7%) of known and surveyed wetlands. They are found himited to a
narrow strip from Cote d'Ivoire to Cape Three Points in Ghana.
The present day declining mangrove ecosystem in Ghana (IUCN, 1992) have been
described in Biodiversity Review.  The ecosystem  is dominated by Laguncularia
racemosa and Rhyzophora racemosa Avicema mitida occurs on the landward edges. The
remainder and unaccounted for mangroves can be found dotted within estuarine and
riverrne ecologcal niches (Dua, 1997) Within the wet and moist evergreen forests there
appear in plant communities of bamboo and Raphia palms. Mangroves are extensively
used as fuelwood, building materials, and for charcoal production local entrepreneurs and
farmers were found in some southern ecologies constructing and harvesting Crabs and
Prawns from pens in mangrove Swamps (Dua, 1997).
