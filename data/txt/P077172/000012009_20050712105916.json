Following are some\n            factors that conditioned program implementation, and thus\n            become important lessons for future operations. There is an\n            urgent need for the Bank to monitor the economic and\n            financial situation of Uruguay more closely. This was\n            evident given both the 2000 Country Assistance Strategy\n            (CAS), as well as the Bank work in the financial sector\n            early in 2002, failed to perceive the risks threatening the\n            Uruguayan economy, as a result of the financial crisis in\n            Argentina, which hindered the initial preparation of the\n            operation. Had the program been backed by stronger\n            foundation within the CAS, and by the Bank's economic\n            and sector work, there would have been greater information,\n            and closeness with government officials, which no doubt\n            would have led to an improved operation. Notwithstanding,\n            actions implemented by the Bank team helped overcome some\n            serious problems, such as the lack of a unified social\n            policy authority in the country to act as a counterpart,\n            forcing a program design and supervision at preparation with\n            no Government support. As it happened, the Ministry of\n            Economy was just a contact facilitator, with no power to\n            develop the preparation of the program, particularly\n            regarding social protection. Furthermore, there is need to\n            maintain a dialogue with the Government on relevant\n            structural reforms/policy actions with a long-term\n            sustainable impact on the social sectors. A more consistent\n            social development strategy would have helped design a more\n            ambitious reform agenda. In retrospect, the project was\n            effective given the seemingly medium and long term\n            sustainable impact, in areas such as transparency,\n            coherency, safety net, social information, and, monitoring\n            and evaluation of the programs."}, "docdt": "2005-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
