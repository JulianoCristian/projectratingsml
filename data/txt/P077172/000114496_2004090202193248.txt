SCHEDULE 2
Amortization Schedule
1.
The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment Date 
(Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) the total principal 
amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the 
Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayment amount to be adjusted, as 
necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a 
Currency Conversion applies.
Installment Share
Payment Date
(Expressed as a %)
On each April 15 and October 15
Beginning April 15, 2008
through October 15, 2017
5%
2. 
If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal 
Payment Date shall be determined as follows:
(a)
To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as of the 
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and outstanding as 
Page  13
of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule.
(b)
Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts determined by 
the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of 
which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the Original Installment Share) and the denominator 
of which shall be the sum of all remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment 
Dates falling on or after such date, such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to 
deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies.
3.
(a)
Withdrawals made within two calendar months prior to any Principal Payment 
Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on any Principal 
Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date 
commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of  withdrawal.
(b)
Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, if at any 
time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on or after 
the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer 
apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system. 
4.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan to an Approved 
Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall be repayable on any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank 
by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to said 
Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in said 
Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the 
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 
5.
If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time shall be 
denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply 
separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate 
amortization schedule for each such amount.
SCHEDULE 3
Actions Referred to in Section 2.02 (e) of this Agreement
Macroeconomic/Fiscal Actions
1.
The Borrower has not increased non-financial public sector wages (wages of the central

Page  14
and autonomous agencies), in the period comprised between July and December 2002.
2.
ANCAP, ANP, ANTEL, and UTE  have signed new agreements (
convenios colectivos de 
trabajo
)
with each of the labor unions representing the employees of said ANCAP, ANP, 
ANTEL, and UTE, and in said new agreements, remunerations linked to productivity have been 
reduced (in aggregate) by at least 50% in real terms, as evidenced by the new version of (i) the 
ANCAP Agreement, (ii) the ANP Agreement, (iii) the ANTEL Agreement, and (ii) the UTE 
Agreement.
Social Protection
3.
The databases containing information of beneficiaries of the following social protection 
programs managed by the Borrower’s Ministry of Health (databass: 
Registro Único de Asistencia 
Formal –RUCAF- 
and
 Identificación Positiva de Beneficiarios –IPB
),  
Banco de Previsión 
Social 
(program: 
Asignaciones Familiares
,
database: 
Registro de Activos
)
and Ministry of 
Housing, Urban Planning and Environment (program: SIAV, database: 
Registro Nacional de 
Postulantes
)
have been adapted to allow the Borrower to cross-check information among each 
other regarding said beneficiaries.
4.
A report on the consolidated national and local social spending of the Borrower and local 
government entities (departments and municipalities) for 2000, 2001 and 2002 has been issued. 
5.
A
new information system –satisfactory to the Bank- covering all national and local (run 
by departments and municipalities) social protection programs of the Borrower is in operation. 
6.
The following national and local social protection programs of the Borrower have been 
evaluated: (i) 
Apoyo a Instituciones Públicas y Privadas –AIPP-, Programa Nacional de 
Complementación Alimentaria –PNCA-, Centro de Atención a la Infancia y a la Familia –CAIF-, 
and
 Servicio de Asistencia Alimentaria Colectivizada –SAAC- 
(executed by INDA (
Instituto 
Nacional de la Alimentación
); (ii) SIAV; and (iii) 
Asignaciones Familiares 
(executed by 
Banco 
de Previsión Social
).  Such evaluation shall include an efficiency analysis, a targeting analysis, 
and a comparison of the prices at which the agencies executing said programs acquire goods and 
the market prices of said goods.
7.
The Borrower’s budget allocation for each of the Protected Social Programs for 2003 is 
not lower than the 2002 allocation for each of the Protected Social Programs as set forth in 
Annex 2 of the Letter of Development Policy (adjusted according to the change of public wages).  
8.
An evaluation of the Borrower’s 
Programa de Alimentación Escolar
 (executed through 
ANEP) and 
Programa de Capacitación Laboral
 (executed through the Ministry of Labor and 
Social Affairs of the Borrower) has been carried out through an assessment of beneficiaries of 
said programs.
Unemployment Insurance
9.
The Congress has enacted a new unemployment insurance law including provisions to: 
(i) allow unemployment insurance benefits only during an initial eligibility period of six months; 
(ii) reduce unemployment insurance benefits over time and require recipients of unemployment 
Page  15
insurance to perform community services while receiving said unemployment insurance; (iii) 
limit the provision of unemployment insurance benefits to workers receiving severance payments 
totaling less than one hundred minimum wages; and (iv) establish a lifetime limit of thirty-six 
months of unemployment insurance benefits per worker.
10.
The Borrower’s training program for the unemployed (Article 317 to 331 Law 16,320 as 
amended) has been refocused to target preferentially workers receiving severance payments 
totaling less than one hundred minimum wages, as evidenced by a report reflecting the results of 
the last six months of said training program including: amount of beneficiaries, social and 
economic condition of said beneficiaries, and amount of trained workers that have found jobs 
after said training (specifying whether the skills received in such training are used in the new 
job).
