STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN (SAL) and SPECIAL STRUCTURAL
ADJUSTMENT LOAN (SSAL)
LOANS AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower                 Oriental Republic of Uruguay
Amount and Terms         US$252.54 million (including the capitalized front-end
fee), of which US$151.52 is a regular Structural
Adjustment Loan (SAL), and US$101.02 is a special
Structural Adjustment Loan (SSAL).   The SAL is
commitment-linked payable in 15 years, including 5 years
of grace; level principal repayment; at six-month LIBOR
and fixed spread for Fixed Spread Loans denominated in
US dollars, and with a commitment fee of 0.85% during
the first four years and 0.75% thereafter. The SSAL is
commitment-linked payable in 5 years, including 3 years
of grace; level principal repayment; at six-month LIBOR
plus fixed spread (4%), loan denominated in US dollars,
and with a commitment fee of 0.75%.
Description              The proposed Loans are intended to help Uruguay
withstand the large external shocks that have been
affecting its economy over the past three years and to
advance the Government's structural adjustment program.
Policy conditionality covers (A) fiscal and debt
sustainability issues, including (i) reduction in public
expenditures, particularly the wage bill; (ii) increasing the
tax on wages and pensions; and (iii) curtailing wage
benefits in the public enterprises. (B) reform of the public
mortgage bank (BHU), including (i) changing its organic
chart to limit its lending activity to housing finance to
individuals and only as far as it can sell these mortgages to
the private sector; allowing only deposits for ahorro
previo; and prohibiting BHU to build; (ii) a thorough
internal- restructuring of the institution to fit its new
functions; (iii) improving supervision of the public banks;
and (iv) develop- the market for mortgage-backed
securities. (C) social protection measures, including (i)
developing a mechanism for cross-checking eligibility of
beneficiaries of various social protection programs; (ii)
evaluating selected social programs to enhance their
efficiency and effectiveness; (iii) protection of social
programs that attend poor children; and (iv) reform of the



- ii -
unemployment insurance system to improve its operation
and expand its coverage. The Loans will be carried out in
close in close coordination with the International
Monetary Fund and the InterAmerican Development
Bank.
Benefits and Risks       The principal benefit of the proposed Loans would be to
help Uruguay withstand the huge external shocks that it is
facing as well as to advance the country's structural
reform process. In addition, the Loan would help mitigate
the social consequences of the crisis on poor children and
other vulnerable segments of the population. However,
this is a high risk operation. In particular, if the situation
in Argentina and Brazil continue to deteriorate and/or if
confidence is not restored and deposits continue to leave
the banking system, the crisis in Uruguay would deepen.
Also, Uruguay faces a potential debt sustainability
problem.  In particular, if the fiscal targets are not
achieved and/or the real depreciation accelerates, the debt
to GDP ratio would reach worrisome levels and could
raise concerns about the ability of the country to meet its
commitments. In that respect, the risk that the political
establishment would not provide full support to the
Government's program, including a rapid approval of the
reform of BHU, need to be kept in mind. In addition,
since over 50% of Uruguayan exports are agricultural and
agricultural-based products, the country is vulnerable to
large commodity price fluctuations, natural disasters and
diseases, such as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
last year, which paralyzed the processing and export of
meat products for five months. While several of these
shocks are clearly exogenous, the Government is making a
strong effort to mitigate risks where possible.  In
particular, the measures included in the SAL program,
together with those supported by other international
institutions, would help address these risks and increase
the probability of Uruguay recovering from its current
economic crisis and establishing a more solid basis for
future growth.
Poverty Category         The proposed Loans have a social protection component,
including a comprehensive reform of the Unemployment
Insurance system.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
DRAFT PROGRAM DOCUMENT
FOR A PROPOSED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN (SAL) AND A
PROPOSED SPECIAL STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN (SSAL)
TO THE
ORIENTAL REPUBLIC OF URUGUAY
I. BACKGROUND
1.   The Government of Uruguay has requested a World Bank Structural Adjustment
Loan (SAL) to support implementation of a stabilization and structural reforms program
and help the country withstand the recent external and internal shocks and restore
economic growth. Initially, the Government requested a Deferred Drawdown Option
(DDO), which would have ensured access to funds on a contingency basis. However,
given the unexpected magnitude of the Argentinean crisis and its impact on the
Uruguayan economy, as well as the nature of the structural reforms to be included in the
program, structural adjustment loans - on regular and special terms - appear to be more
appropriate lending instruments.
2.    Since 1999, the Uruguayan economy has been hit by a series of external and
internal shocks that pulled the economy into a recession that is worsening this year. The
main external shocks have been the Argentinean crisis, the terms of trade shocks
associated with the rise in oil prices and the fall of export prices, the devaluation of the
two principal trading partners, Brazil and Argentina, the increased capital flows volatility
affecting the whole region, and the world growth slowdown experienced in 2001. Since
1998, the Uruguayan terms of trade have fallen by at least 12%. The outburst of the foot-
and-mouth disease during 2001 stopped meat exports, disrupted other agricultural
activities, and had a substantial negative impact on economic activity (estimated at about
2% of GDP) and on the balance of payments.
3.    The contagion from the Argentine crisis has been far deeper than expected. A key
transmission channel was the banking sector, which at the end of 2001 had total deposits
equivalent to about US$15.7 billion, of which over US$6 billion were of non-residents
(mostly Argentines). The Uruguayan banking system has been experiencing a run on
deposits, mainly from non-residents, but also from residents. In January-June 2002, the
system has lost around US$5 billion, or about one-third of total deposits. The Central
Bank of Uruguay (BCU) has provided liquidity assistance plus forbearance to ensure that
domestic banks meet deposit withdrawals; foreign-owned banks have financed the
withdrawal with their own liquid dollar assets, including their deposits at the BCU. That
resulted in a substantial drop in the level of international reserves (see below).
4.    The ongoing recession has had a negative impact on poverty, although less on the
distribution of income. In particular, poverty grew from 20.1% in 1999 to 21.7% in 2000
(see Table 3) After improving in the early 1990s, income equality has worsened
somewhat, with the Gini coefficient increasing from 0.43 to 0.44 between 1999 and 2000



-2 -
(compared to 0.49 in 1990). The rate of unemployment has increased from 11.3 % in
1999 to 15.3 in 2001. This has been accompanied by an incipient process of social
exclusion -- a relatively new phenomenon in Uruguay, which has traditionally been
characterized as the most homogeneous society in Latin America (see paras. 16-18).
5.    The World Bank approved, in FY00, (i) a Financial Structural Adjustment Loan
for $80.9 million, for improving competition in the banking sector, restructuring public
banks, strengthening banking regulation, supervision and inspection, improving
transparency of the financial sector and modernizing the financial sector legal
framework; and (ii) the APLI - OSE Modernization and Systems Rehabilitation Project,
$27 million loan - for improving the competitiveness of the state water company,
maintaining the reliability of water service investments and expanding sanitation
investments in the interior.  In FY01, the Bank approved the Public Services
Modernization TAL, $6 million loan - for improving the efficiency and sustainability of
public services in Uruguay through support for regulation and increased competition. In
FY02, the Bank approved (i) a Foot & Mouth Disease, $18.5 million loan - emergency
loan to help address impacts of the foot and mouth disease crisis and prevent future
outbreaks; and (ii) the Basic Education 11I, $42 million loan - continuation of earlier
successful work at pre-school and primary school level (earlier education loans), with
great focus on performance of low income students.
6.   In March 2002, the International Monetary Fund approved a 24-month, SDR 594
million Stand-by arrangement to support this program, and in June 2002 it approved an
enhancement and expansion of the program for an additional SDR 1,158 million. The
Government has also requested additional support from the InterAmerican Development
Bank, which has approved a special loan for US$180 million in June 2002, and is
preparing another loan for US$320 million.
7.   The proposed Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) and Special Structural
Adjustment Loan (SSAL) are part of a concerted international effort to help Uruguay
withstand the impact of the strong external shocks and set the stage for medium and
longer term fiscal sustainability. The Loans aim to: (i) take advantage of the window of
opportunity provided by the current crisis to advance Uruguay's structural reform
program, particularly in addressing the costs of public services and defusing a major
potential fiscal liability embedded in the public mortgage bank; and (ii) mitigate the
impact of the crisis on vulnerable segments of the population by protecting expenditures
of selected social programs, improving their efficiency, and reforming the
Unemployment Insurance system. Following an overview of the macroeconomic
framework and prospects, this Program Document (PD) presents the main structural
issues in each of these areas, and describes the specific measures that the Government
will undertake to address these issues in the context of the program supported by the
Loans.
8.   The proposed Loans, however, are high risk operations. The main risks include: (i)
continuing contagion from the Argentine crisis, which could be aggravated by the
deterioration in Brazil; (ii) a deepening of the confidence crisis, with the outflow of bank
deposits continuing unabated; and (iii) a worsening of the public debt sustainability
indicators, resulting from a failure to close the fiscal gap and/or a substantial real



-3 -
devaluation of the peso. The Government's program, supported by the International
Financial Institutions, constitutes an effort to mitigate these risks.
II. COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
9.   The 2000 CAS program (R2000-82, discussed by Executive Directors on June 6,
2000) was very selective as part of transition toward graduation. The program continued
the 1997 CAS emphasis on economic and social development, with increased
concentration on activities that affect long term sustainability, address pockets of poverty,
and protect for economic vulnerability. The 2000 CAS proposed base case lending from
$150 million to $200 million for FY01-05, with about 1-2 operations per year. This
implied a reduction in lending of 50% compared to the 1997 CAS (in terms of average
annual commitments). The main factors taken into consideration in proposing this
smaller program in 2000 were: (i) Uruguay's superior social indicators, (ii) Uruguay's
perceived relatively modest external vulnerability and investment grade, and (iii) the high
existing and planned lending levels of the IDB (planned average annual commitments of
approximately 1% of GDP).
10. The 2000 CAS scenario is no longer appropriate under the current crisis conditions.
The situation now calls for additional support to assist Uruguay to weather the current
crisis and to continue the program of reforms critical to a more competitive economy.
The implications of a material change in the economic environment were foreseen in the
original CAS, specifically noting that a significant external or domestic shock might
imply that Uruguay would face serious financing constraints despite its investment grade.
Under these circumstances, the Bank could play a catalytic role with higher lending to
secure economic reforms. The situation now calls for revising the country program. A
CAS Progress Report is under preparation and will propose a truncated program of
assistance (FY03-04 in comparison to the FYO1-05 program of the original CAS), with
an envelope of US$400 million. The revised Bank strategy focuses on pursuing the 2000
CAS agenda, but within a crisis environment.  It targets three broad objectives
corresponding to the main challenges facing Uruguay, namely, (i) fiscal sustainability
and adjustment; (ii) competitiveness of the economy; and, (iii) social protection. The
program supported by the proposed SAL and SSAL addresses mainly points (i) and (iii),
and it is therefore central in implementing the new Country Assistance Strategy.
III. MACROECONOMIC FRAmEWORK AND PROSPECTS
A. Recent Economic Developments
11. As mentioned above, Uruguay was hit by strong external and domestic shocks over
the past three years. As a result of these shocks, GDP declined by an average 2.4% per
annum in the past three years (Table 1).  Declining economic activity has been
accompanied by rising unemployment and persistent fiscal deficits. These were financed,
until recently, at a marginal cost of 250 basis points spread over US Treasury bonds,
which was among the lowest in Latin America thanks to the country's investment grade
rating and its strong credit history. The unraveling of the Argentinean crisis in late 2001
that affected some Uruguayan banks owned by Argentine citizens, plus the persistence of



-4 -
stagnation and fiscal deficits, have had a debilitating impact on the county's ability to
withstand additional shocks. These shocks and uncertainties were reflected in a 37% loss
in international reserves (from $2.95b. to $1.9b.) in January-February 2002, and a further

loss of nearly $ 1.0 billion in March-May 2002. Sovereign debt spreads, that traditionally
oscillated around 250 bps, jumped to over 600 bps in February, 1300 bps in May, and
over 1800 bps in mid-July (graph 1). With real interest rates in dollars of about 10% to
12% and no growth, the country's debt burden is reaching very high levels, as has the
cost of capital, creating a vicious circle that dims future growth prospects. The debt to
GDP ratio has increased sharply in 2000-02 largely as a result of the real depreciation of
the peso during those years (see below). In response, the Government has already
adopted a fiscal stabilization plan, supported by a new Stand-by arrangement with the
International Monetary Fund, with the objective of cutting the fiscal deficit and

12.    In order to improve competitiveness, and facing a deteriorating external
environment, the exchange rate band was adjusted in June 2001 and again in January
2002, to a width of 12% with the rate of crawl fixed at 2.4% per month. For 2002, the
Government's macroeconomic program projected (prior to floating the exchange rate) a
33% nominal depreciation, while annual consumer inflation would remain around 12%.
The assumption of partial pass-through was based on the ongoing recession, and on
econometric evidence of real exchange rate overvaluation. The evolution of the prices of
tradable and non-tradable goods suggests that the real exchange appreciation is explained
by the prices of public sector services and wages.' When the tradable goods index is
substituted with a group of "regional" goods2, the misalignment is more evident. The
misalignment level and trend estimated this way coincides with results of a structural
model of REER determinants for a panel of 53 countries (Nabli & Veganzones). This
model estimates an overvaluation of about 30% for Uruguay (graph 2) 3.
' The long run or equilibrium prices for tradable and non-tradable goods is estimated based on the work of
Bergara, Dominioni and Licandro (2000) and Fernandez (2002). The equilibrium prices of tradable goods
are determined by international prices, while the long run price of non-tradable goods is determined by
wages and public services.
2 Bergara, Dominioni and Licandro, as well as Fernandez, use the concept of regional goods referring to a
subset of goods that is tradable within the Mercosur region, that includes some construction (given its
weight in tourist areas), restaurants and other items generally not considered as tradable goods.
3Nabli and Veganzones estimate a panel for 53 countries since 1970. Following Edwards, the authors
estimate the equilibrium exchange rate as a function of the investment ratio, the degree of openness of the
economy, the terms of trade and capital inflows.

13.   The original Government program   would have resulted in a substantial
devaluation of the real exchange rate, gradually closing the gap between the actual and
equilibrium real exchange rates. However, following mounting pressures on international
reserves, the Government allowed the domestic currency to float on June 20th, 2002. As
during similar events in other countries, there was an initial overshooting of the exchange
rate, but it shortly stabilized at about 19 peso/US$ (a depreciation of about 12%). The
exchange rate depreciated. to about 23 peso/US$ in the second week of July 2002, as
Government made a large share of its monthly payments.  The level at which the
exchange rate will stabilize is crucial, since a steep depreciation of the currency in an
economy that is widely dollarized puts high stress on firms and persons who earn in
pesos but owe in dollars, and consequently also on the financial sector. The Government
is in a similar situation, since it is indebted mostly in US dollars.
14.   As mentioned above, the Argentina crisis has had an additional perverse effect on
Uruguay, namely, its effect on the banking sector. Initially, the impact had been limited
to the two largest private banks, Banco Galicia and Banco Comercial, which had about
13% and 17% of deposits in private banks respectively, but by late April the contagion
had expanded to the rest of the system. Since the beginning of the year, deposits have
dropped by about one-third (Table 2), and the banking sector is probably the main factor
of vulnerability in the economy.  The Government expects that as the recent fiscal
measures start showing positive results and the external financial support materializes,
spreads will decrease and the volume of deposits will stabilize.

15.  In response to the mounting crisis, the authorities adopted a fiscal austerity package
in February 2002, and a second package in May of that year, both supported by the IMF.
The bulk of the adjustment is obtained through a tax on pensions and wages, which was
purposefully biased toward public sector employees and pensioners. Other measures
included new excises on water, electricity and telecommunications, a broadening of the
VAT base to include health services and a reduction of exemptions for the tax on net
worth and the tax on banking assets. These revenue measures yield about 3 percent of
.GDP. On the expenditure side, the key measures are cuts in real wages and pensions in
the order of 1% of GDP . Other measures include cuts in overtime payments, elimination
of two ministries, and reduced implementation of the investment budget. The expenditure
measures amount to 0.7 percent of GDP. By December 2002, the Government intends to
send to Parliament a comprehensive tax reform package, which would help ensure
sustainability of the fiscal accounts. The tax reform envisages streamlining the system to
only 4 taxes: VAT, excises, income tax and tariffs, and making permanent several
measures that were approved by congress on a transitory basis.

the labor market, some families could no
longer afford the housing costs in the center of town and thus moved to the emerging
marginal neighborhoods surrounding the city. Others came to these neighborhoods from
the interior of the country.  The marginal neighborhoods, which are mostly near
Montevideo, are often geographically isolated, have higher levels of crime and violence,
lower levels of services, and little public space.
4 The poverty index presented in Table 3 may be overestimating the level of poverty due to technical
problems in the construction of the consumption basket. The methodology used in the construction of the
basket is currently under review.

17. It is important to note that Uruguay had made substantiai progress on poverty ana
social indicators since the mid-eighties, largely due to its extensive social policy and
relative macroeconomic stability in the 1990s (Table 4). Uruguay is noted for its very
low level of extreme poverty and for having one of the most equitable distribution of
incomes   in    the

Argentina      (.51,

policies serve as a useful model for other countries struggling with problems of poverty,
equity, and social development.
18. As mentioned above, preliminary estimates indicate that in the current recession,
which is longer and deeper than any other, social conditions have deteriorated in terms of
poverty, unemployment, and to a lesser extent income distribution (para. 4). While it is
difficult to estimate the impact of an economic crisis on the population, evidence from
other countries shows that the effects would be felt by households through declining
incomes, falling labor demand and the resulting increases in unemployment,
underemployment and lower wages (also a result of inflation), and price increases due to
exchange rate devaluation, particularly of the prices of traded goods. Furthermore, a
decline in public spending and loss in essential services such as health, education, and
nutrition, could lead to a rise in malnutrition, worsening health care for the population,
higher school dropout rates and a rise in crime and violence. For illustration, in
neighboring Argentina, GDP fell by an estimated 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2001
compared to the same quarter of 2000, and by an estimated 16.3% in the first quarter of
2002 compared to the same period of the previous year. Consequently, the rate of
unemployment went up from 14.7% in 2000 to 18.3% in 2001, while poverty rose from
26.7% in October 2000 to 35.9% in October 2001.
C. Macroeconomic Projections
19.   As mentioned above, Uruguay is greatly affected by developments in Argentina
and Brazil, which in 1998 were the destination of 52% of its goods exports. In non-factor
services, trade concentration is even higher, since Argentina itself represented 68% of
total tourist arrivals in 2000. Given the close integration and the relative sizes of the
three economies, it is not surprising to see their long run co-movement (Graph 3). This
stable long run relationship is verified by econometric methods, which suggest that the
impact of Argentinean growth is at least three times as large as that of Brazil (the long
run Cointegration coefficients are 0.7 and 0.2, respectively). The close association
between growth in Argentina and Uruguay in particular helps explain the stagnation in



- 9 -
Uruguay (Graph 4)5. Preliminary evidence suggests that there may be an asymmetry in
this relationship between booms and busts, so that the long run coefficient is actually
lower - about 0.5, during recessions. Based on these coefficients, with all other factors
held constant, an 15% fall in Argentina's GDP and a 2% increase in Brazil's GDP would
be associated with a fall in Uruguayan GDP of about 7%. GDP growth is affected also
by other factors; For example, while the recent increase in spreads could have a negative
effect, the recovery of meat exports after the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak is
expected to lead to a strong recovery of this important sector of the Uruguayan economy.

20.    The projections presented in Table 5 are based on a successful implementation of
the program supported by the IM4F, the LkDB, and the World Bank. After a deep
recession this year, the economy is expected to recover and achieve growth rates of 3%
per year in 2003-05. That would still leave it in a lower growth path than prior to the
crisis. The central element of the Government program is the reduction of the fiscal
deficit from an average of about 4% of GDP in the past three years to 2.5% of GDP in
2002, to 1.5% of GDP in 2003 and close to zero in the following years. Containing the
growth of public expenditures is the key element for success. The current account is
projected to be in balance between 2002-04, due to the lack of capital inflows. The
external indebtedness ratios are projected to grow somewhat, and therefore the pressure
on the cost of international borrowing would persist (see below).
5 Causality analysis shows that growth rates in Argentina Granger-cause growth rates in Uruguay, while
that hypothesis is rejected for Brazilian growth. Similarly, the impulse response function of a simple vector
autoregression (VAR) shows insignificant response of Uruguayan growth to shocks in Brazilian growth,
while there is a significant impact of Argentinean shocks on Uruguay.

21.      The    total foreign     currency    financing     requirements,       excluding     IMF, would
amount to about US$1.8-2.0 billion per year in 2002-03, and to about US lb. in 2004-05
(Table 6). The Government's initial plan called for raising about one-half of that sum in
international and domestic capital markets, while the other half was to be covered by FDI
and by official creditors. However, the steep increase in the spreads of Uruguayan debt
and the difficulty in accessing international markets imply that the country would have to
rely more heavily on financing by the International Financial Institutions. Thus, the
support to be provided by the World Bank is crucial for achieving the country's targets.

22.     The fiscal accounts. Since 1999, the fiscal deficit has been     about 4%   of GDP,
while the primary balance has also been negative in the order of 2% of GDP. These
fiscal imbalances were accompanied by rising current account deficits. Public sector
wages did not adjust to the recession as much as in the private sector. In addition,
although a major reform in the pension system was implemented in 1996, public
expenditures on pensions as a fraction of GDP increased from 10.9% of GDP in 1989 to
15.9% of GDP in 2001. The deficit of the public pension system is currently about 7% of
GDP. Altogether, social security benefits and wages account for over 70% of non-
interest public expenditure. The public sector primary deficit, together with servicing the
debt, results in gross borrowing needs in the order of US$1.5-1.7 billion per year, apart
from projected assistance to banks, in 2002-05 (Table 7).

23.     The public debt burden. The persistent fiscal deficits during the past three years
resulted in the rapid growth of public debt, from 34% of GDP at end-1998 to 59.6% of
GDP at end-2001. 7 Uruguay's loss of investment grade in February 2002 resulted in an
imrnediate and sharp increase in the cost of capital for the country and in the burden of
servicing the debt. Further, under the most likely scenario, the gross public debt ratio
will jump to 68.6% of GDP in 2002, to 74% in 2003, and then gradually decline (Table
5). However, under a more pessimistic scenario, with a deeper recession, a larger than
anticipated depreciation of the peso and higher spreads, the ratio of public debt to GDP
could approach 80%      of GDP in 2003 (Graph 5).8         Given the Government's strong
commitment to meet all obligations, it has already started to implement a strong
stabilization program to correct the imbalance in the fiscal accounts and to regain

were withdrawn from the CBU in the first half of 2002.

the real exchange rate at the end of the year. If that level turns out to be higher, the debt ratios would be
higher too.

investment grade. Successful implementation of the program should lower the cost of
financing and the burden of debt, thereby improving the prospects for future growth.

IV. MAIN STRUCTURAL ISSUES AND THE GOVERNMENT ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
A. Macro/fiscal aspects
a. Main Structural Issues
24.   Uruguay faces two key structural problems:  First, it has persistent budget
imbalances that originate in sharp increases in social security expenditures during the
1990s and a rigid expenditure structure. Second, the large capital inflows to Latin
America during the 1990s and the rising prices of non-traded goods and services resulted
in a real appreciation of the currency and lower competitiveness of Uruguayan exports in
world markets. Furthermore, shocks to Uruguay's productive structure are positively
correlated with what happens in Argentina.  For instance, a fall in the price of
commodities affects Uruguay directly and indirectly because Argentina is also affected
by the same shock.   Hence, this positive correlation makes hedging practically
impossible. In large part, the appreciating trend of the real exchange rate resulted from
rising wages and prices of public sector services. At the same time, rising wages and
pensions are at the root of current fiscal imbalances and the long term structural problem
in public finance.
b. Main policy measures.
25.   The Government's stabilization and adjustment program includes short and
medium term measures designed to restore fiscal balance, gradually reduce the public
debt burden, and facilitate the adjustment of the real exchange rate.  As mentioned



- 13 -
above, that adjustment would improve the competitiveness of Uruguayan exports in
international markets and contribute to the diversification of its export base. The main
measures are the following:
* On the expenditure side, the Government has cut total public spending,
including the wages, operating expenditures and public investment, by 6.3% in
real terms in 1999-2001.  The Government will further contain public
expenditures, particularly wages and consequently also pensions, and make
strong efforts for improving the efficiency in public expenditures on goods,
services, and public investment. In order to have an adequate supply of public
services, the Government will encourage increased participation of the private
sector.
*  On the revenue side, at the end of May, the Parliament approved a fiscal
stability law, which includes raising the rate of the IRP tax on wages and
pensions by approximately 1.2% of GDP annually. The total package of reforms
would provide additional revenues in the order of 3% of GDP. By December
2002, the Government will submit to Congress a proposal for comprehensive
reform of the tax system, based on four main taxes (VAT, excises, income and
custom duties), with further elimination of exemptions and loopholes.
* The Government will pursue a change in the productivity sharing clauses for
public enterprise employees, which amount to about US$35 million, or 0.2% of
GDP per year, and greatly increase production costs. The revised clauses will
reduce this expense by at least 50%, and reformulate the payments to reflect the
true contribution of workers to the productivity gains. The reform would help
lower utility tariffs and enhance the competitiveness of the Uruguayan economy
(see below).
* While the Government was forced to introduce some restrictions on the import
of goods over the past few months, they will be phased out within the next 12
months and the opening the economy will continue. These measures may be
complemented by diversifying from MERCOSUR toward seeking trade
agreements with other trading blocks (EU) or other countries (NAFTA) to
promote Uruguayan exports.
26.   Public Enterprises.  As mentioned above, the appreciating trend of the real
exchange rate in the first half of the 1990s, which discouraged diversification of the
economy, resulted in rising cost of public utilities services measured in dollar terms.
While the degree of service coverage and overall service quality in Uruguay has been
relatively good compared to other countries in the region, public enterprises operate in
poorly regulated markets that enable them to charge high rates, extracting monopolistic
rents. The concern, therefore, is not the financial drain of the enterprises on the
Government's budget, but rather their negative impact on Uruguay's overall
competitiveness. Past attempts of outright privatization of the utilities have met public
opposition; therefore, the strategy chosen was to gradually open these markets to
competition between public and private players through concessions, licensing and other
contractual arrangements.



- 14-
27.   The Government of Uruguay is well aware of the cost that monopoly service
provision is exerting on its economy, and it has begun the process of de-monopolization
in the electricity, natural gas, oil, water and sanitation, transport, and telecommunications
sectors (all except fixed telephony), complemented by explicit support for private sector
participation. In particular, the Government has begun to develop a legal and regulatory
framework for gas, oil, electricity, water and sanitation, and telecommunications. To
continue these efforts, the Government intends to: (i) establish an independent
multisector regulator agency for water, sanitation, electricity, gas and oil - URSEA, to
ensure an even playing field for private providers; (ii) equalize tax treatment between
public and private providers; and (iii) remove limitations on public enterprises as to the
selection of financial intermediaries they can use, the insurance they buy, the purchase of
advertisement, etc. These reforms, however, will entail a fiscal cost due to the dissipation
of monopoly rents and the resulting reduction in transfers from the enterprises to the
central Government, which have averaged over 1.2% of GDP per year in the past three
years. While these reforms would entail big benefits for Uruguay in the medium term,
financing from the International Financial Institutions would help in the short run to
smooth the adjustment to the new public sector structure. Another Bank project may
address these issues in the near future.
28.   Social Security. As mentioned above, Uruguay implemented a comprehensive
pension reform in 1996, whereby the retirement age of women was raised, the number of
years of contribution required for normal retirement was increased, and the replacement
rate lowered substantially. Also, but perhaps most important, for individuals aged 40
and under, at the time of the reform, at least half of the employee contribution was to be
diverted to individual accounts managed by specialized pension funds. While this reform
stopped the explosive trend in the costs of the pension system, financing pension
expenditures still is, and will remain for a long time, one of the key structural problems of
the fiscal accounts. Although in the short term the impact on the budget would not be
large, addressing pension issues would have a major impact on the long term fiscal
position.
29.   Thus, in the medium term, the Government intends to undertake additional
reforms in the pension system in order to reduce its burden on the fiscal accounts: (i) the
Government has sent a proposal to Congress to open the possibility of international
investments by pension funds of up to 10% of their portfolio, to expand their investment
opportunities and enhance their risk management; (ii) it would shortly submit to
Parliament comprehensive reforms of the policy and military special pension regimes;
and (iii) in the longer run, the most important measure would be to switch the indexation
of pensions from wages to consumer prices, which is the most common practice in Latin
America and around the world. That would put BPS on a sound financial position and at
the same time it would protect the purchasing power of the elderly.
B. Banco Hipotecario del Uruguay (BHU)
30.   BHU is the second largest bank in the country, with assets totaling US$ 2,669
million in December 2001 and US$2,349 million as of May 2002. It had more than
350,000 saving accounts and deposits totaling US$1,705 million in December 2001, and
US$1,462 million by May 2002. While there are no official figures of housing loans in



- 15 -
Uruguay, it is estimated that BHU's loans account for 90% of the stock of mortgage
credits in the country (a current portfolio of about 105.000 loans).
31.   The Uruguayan banking sector is characterized by (i) the dominance of the public
sector, whose banks have 35% of total assets and enjoy several privileges, and (ii) heavy
dollarization, with about 80 percent of its deposits and about 70 percent of loans
denominated in foreign currency. The number of financial institutions in Uruguay has
been relatively stable during the last few years. Forty domestic financial entities currently
operate in the country, including 2 state-owned banks, 23 private banks (of which 4 are
intervened), 9 financial houses, and 6 saving-and-loans cooperatives. In 1999, the degree
of monetization in Uruguay-as measured by a M3/GDP ratio of 0.40-was larger than
those of Argentina and Brazil.
Box 1: The IMF Program on the Financial Sector
The IMF program for the financial sector is aimed at rebuilding confidence in the
banking system. This will be achieved through the establishment of a source of last
resort support, with adequate financing and safeguards, for which a specialized fund
(Fondo de Fortalecimiento del Sistema Bancario, FFSB) is being created. While
nonresident deposits are expected to continue to flow out, the program seeks to halt and
eventually reverse the outflow of resident deposits.
The FFSB is a new vehicle to provide adequate support to banks and reassure
depositors. The rationale for the FFSB is twofold: on the one hand, the Charter of the
Central Bank places limits on its ability to provide the liquidity needs in the context of a
systemic banking crisis; on the other it is crucial to adopt a comprehensive approach to
liquidity and capital support. The FFSB is being established outside of the central bank
and operated by a professional staff, without political interference and subject to
external audit, which will facilitate accountability. The FFSB will have an authorized
capital of US$2.5 billion (equivalent to about 40 percent of domestic banks' dollar
deposits), US$1.2 billion of which could be used to provide loans or equity support,
including for state owned banks. The conditionality attached to the FFSB support
(penalized interest rate, stand-by guarantee or high quality collateral, regularization and
recapitalization plans, write down of original shareholders, etc.) is designed to limit its
use and avoid any bailout of existing shareholders.
Apart from the reform of BHU, financed by the proposed SAL loan, the IMF program
also envisages accelerating the reforms in BROU, which include strengthening of
internal control systems and better compliance with prudential loan classification and
provisioning-rules.
Finally, bank supervision will also be strengthened. Public banks will be subjected to
the same prudential oversight that private banks, including penalties. In addition, on-site
examination procedures will be enhanced and staffing and training increased; prudential
regulation will be evaluated and improved in order to comply with international
standards; and the quality and frequency of published financial information will be
improved.



-16-
32.   The financial strength of the Uruguayan banks has been steadily weakening and
many of the domestically owned need major recapitalization, estimated at about US$400-
US$500 million, excluding BHU. This figure already takes into account the deterioration
in the dollar-denominated loan portfolio of peso earners, that is to be expected from a real
exchange rate devaluation of 20 percent for the remainder of year 2002. In addition,
dollar-denominated deposits have declined by about one-third since January 2002. The
Government will established a Fund for the Strengthening of the Banking System (FFSB)
to deal with these problems, which will provide-subject to strict conditionality-either
liquidity or capital resources, or both, as needed. The resources of this fund would
amount US$2.5 billion, subscribed in the form  of tradable dollar-denominated
Government securities, up to US$1.2 billion of which could be rediscounted at the BCU
for liquidity needs. The IMF will provide up to US$1.5 billion for the FFSB.
Additionally, the IMF is helping to strengthen financial supervision in Uruguay (see
Box).
33.   One of the main components of the strengthening program is the solution of the
BHU. Obviously, it will benefit from the financial assistance of the FFSB, but the overall
reform of this bank is an essential element in dealing with Uruguay current crisis.
Coordinately with the IFIs, the World Bank has taken the lead in this aspect; thus the
proposed loan is a key component of the management of the crisis.
a. Current Financial Situation and Main Issues
34.   Status of Loan Portfolio, Provisions and Capital. BHU has extremely high
levels of arrears in its portfolio, and it lacks an integrated information system that could
support efficient and prudent management. The ratio of non performing loans (net of
provisions) to total loans was 41% as of December 31, 2001, and reached 45% in May
2002 -- much higher than that of the whole banking system. The provisions for future
losses of the loan portfolio amounted to US$150 million as of December 2001, equivalent
to 22% of total non performing loans, far below international standards, which tend to be
in excess of 100%. Taking into account the "promitentes compradores" ("quasi
borrowers", who occupy housing but did not formalize mortgage agreements) which are
classified under "investments" and amounted to US$687 million (around 30,000
borrowers) as of December 31, 2001, the ratio of overdue portfolio could be higher. As
conditions are deteriorating this year, the bank would likely need new provisions of over
US$150 million. Given BHU's lack of operational profits, this would imply an
equivalent equity loss.
35.   The effect of currency, term and rate mismatches.  One of BHU's main
problems as a financial institution is the significant currency, term and interest
mismatches between assets and liabilities. The maturity mismatch is evident in that the
average term of its housing loans is 15 years, while the maturity, of its liabilities is eight
months. BHU has also a serious interest rate mismatch: the interest rates charged by the
BHU do not cover the cost of funds plus the lending risks, let alone operating costs. The
currency mismatch is even more worrisome. Most mortgages are indexed to wages,
while most deposits are denominated in US dollars. During most of the 1990s, due to the
above trend faster growth of salaries compared to the exchange rate, the currency



- 17 -
mismatch acted in favor of BHU, since its assets adjusted at a faster pace than its
liabilities. This resulted in accounting gains and large increases in its net worth. Since
1999, however, the rate of devaluation has outpaced the growth of wages, leading to an
important loss in BHU's equity position. Further, the projected real devaluation of about
25-30% this year would result in an additional loss of equity of about US$400-450
million by the end of 2002.
36.   Organization structure. The organizational structure of BHU is basically flawed:
it lacks both a finance and a credit manager, as well as an integrated information system
to support efficient and prudent management. In addition, the bank is overstaffed. Thus,
the BHU needs to reduce its personnel, to enhance its management policies and
procedures, and to implement a comprehensive information technology plan to support an
efficient management at all levels, particularly in the area of loan recovery. To reduce
the fiscal cost and partly finance the repayment of deposits, the BHU will sell non-
productive assets (mainly, non performing loans, fixed assets, and "promitentes
compradores") as fast as the market permits. However, the real value of those assets is
not available yet, and a due diligence process will be carried out to assess the market
value of these assets prior to their sale. As soon as the appraisals are finalized (September
2002 for the loan and "promitentes compradores" portfolios and December 2002 for real
estate) BHU will agree with the Bank a divestment plan for these assets. The authorities
plan to put these assets up for sale once economic activity starts recovering and market
conditions improve.
37.   The financial problems of BHU are, in the end, a fiscal problem that needs to be
addressed by Uruguay's Government and society. Up to now, BHU has had two major
capitalizations as a result of exchange and management problems in 1964 and 1982.
Another capitalization was carried out early this year, when the Central Bank of Uruguay
(CBU) converted an outstanding loan of US$664 million into a subordinated loan, of
which US$550 million were assumed by the Government and converted into capital. In
the coming years, the Government will need to provide to BHU, through the FFSB,
around US$500-700 million in the form of subordinated and regular bonds to finance the
phase out of deposits while maintaining an appropriate capitalization of the bank. To
minimize the fiscal burden, the BHU will need to sell assets as quickly as possible. In
order to prevent the recurrence of these problems and to develop the mortgages and
capital markets, the Government intends to implement a thorough structural reform at
BHU, addressing not only its financial and management problems but also the focus and
nature of its operations in the Uruguayan financial sector.
b. Reform measures
38.   As mentioned above, BHU is now a large contingent liability of the public sector
as well as a factor of uncertainty in the financial sector. However, the Government
believes that (i) BHU is the only institution that can satisfy the housing finance needs of a
large segment of the population; and (ii) the objectives of providing housing finance and
of developing a mortgage market could be reached more efficiently by refocusing the role
of BHU. Thus, the BHU will continue to provide housing loans to individuals, at market
conditions, through its network of branches around the country. BHU will then package
the mortgages for sale to financial institutions, which, in turn, would securitize these



- 18-
mortgages, passing along the credit risk. Since this would be a gradual transition, the
Government in the meantime will implement an action plan to slow down any further
deterioration in BHU, including the following steps (Annex I of the Letter of
Development Policy presents a more detailed Action Plan for restructuring BHU):
*  Strengthen BHU's governance and management.
*  Discontinue the financing of housing construction, except for projects in execution or
with legally binding financing agreements.
* Limit new mortgage credits to either housing loans to individuals or to finance the
sale of houses in stock or recovered through legal action and to regularize the
situation of the "promitentes compradores", which are currently recorded as
"Investments".
*  Submit a plan to improve BHU's standards for the evaluation of risks associated with
the mortgage credits referred to in the point above.
*  Carry out a quarterly evaluation and control of the progress of the strategic and
operational plans of the public banks, in order to ensure the proper management of
these institutions.
*  Ensure that BHU maintains sufficient capital to meet current minimum regulatory
requirements.
*  Gradually phase out the stock of Buhl's deposits, apart from deposits under the
program of horror previous (savings for housing).
39. Transformation of BHU. The Government is designing, in consultation with the
World Bank, a plan of structural reforms to transform BHU, including the required legal
and regulatory framework. To implement this plan, the Government is preparing and will
promote the required changes in the Organic Charter of the BHU. This transformation
will ensure that the BHU: (i) will discontinue the use-either directly or indirectly
through the BROU-of deposits from the public to finance its lending activities; (ii) will
originate new mortgage loans to individuals only for the acquisition or construction of
their personal houses and only as far as it can obtain funding from the private sector; (iii)
will no longer have the mandate of promoting the building industry, and (iv) will no
longer build real estate directly or indirectly in its own behalf. At the same time, BHU
could help to develop the secondary mortgage market through mobilizing long term peso-
denominated resources, preferably CPI-indexed, through the securitization of mortgage
packages, a process that would be expanded and accelerated as future mortgages are
designed in a more homogeneous way.
40. The restructuring and refocusing of BHU will eliminate a major distortion in the
Uruguayan market for housing finance. Currently, the BHIU make loans below market
conditions and its collection rate is dismal. This, in turn, prevents private banks from
participating in housing finance, apart from segments in the upper side of the market.
Provided that the playing field is leveled, private banks are expected to become more



- 19-
active in providing housing finance. While it is not be likely that private banks will
immediately fulfill the role of BHU, which currently provide as much as 90 percent of
housing lending in Uruguay, the BHU presently has US$227 million in real estate
available for sale, which can be put immediately in the market to alleviate supply
shortage. In addition, the proposed loan will collaborate to de-activate the explosive
situation of BHU-the sooner the Government assumes the cost of resolving the bank,
the less costly it will be.
C. Social Protection Programs
41. The Government is fully cognizant of the negative impact of the recession on the
poor. In order to address the most pressing problems, several groups have been already
identified as particularly vulnerable, including: (i) Children in poor households: children
that are born into poor families, and are more exposed to problems of nutrition, education
and health because of their poverty. The crisis could compromise the progress that the
country has made in the area of infant mortality, affecting the education quality and
nutritional status (children ages 5-11) and lowering education levels due to high drop-out
and repetition (children ages 11-14). and (ii) Unemployed, underemployed particularly in
poor households. There are now about 200,000 people unemployed, and the drop in their
income affects not only them but also their dependents.
a. Main structural issues
42. Given the large share of public expenditures on social programs and the urgent
need to correct the current fiscal imbalances, the Government is determined to make
special efforts to enhance the efficiency and productivity of social spending, in order to
provide for the growing needs under the tighter fiscal constraints. In particular, given the
depth of the current crisis, it might be necessary to widen the scope of those programs
that are currently performing well and serving beneficiaries effectively. At the same
time, programs that do not fulfill their objectives, or which do so only partially, may be
restructured or even be eliminated in order to free up resources to expand more effective
and efficient programs. In parallel, it will be necessary to establish more complete
information systems, perform systematic evaluation of programs, and make them more
efficient.
43. Uruguay has been building a social protection network for several decades, and the
network has been recently modified to respond to the new social problems that are
emerging and the specific requirements of the new poverty profiles. Their execution and
results to date indicate that the new and modified programs have performed well, and
could be useful examples to replicate. Family Allowances (Asignaciones Familiares) is a
well focalized program that reaches 45% of children through age 18. Other programs
that are performing well include, for example, Centros de Atencion a la Infancia y la
Familia (CALF), Programa Joven (Pro-joven), PAE/ANEP (school food), Maternal-
Child Feeding, and MEVIR (rural housing). On the other hand, programs which are less
efficient in terms of poverty reduction impact include university education, urban housing
programs (SIAV and Cooperatives), Comedores Universitarios (subsidized meals for
university students), Comedores para empleados publicos (subsidized meals for public



- 20-
employees) and Trabajadores en Seguro de Desempleo (training for people receiving
unemployment insurance).
b. Reform measures
44. In the area of social protection, the Government program focuses on increasing the
productivity of public spending and on ensuring that populations in need receive benefits
and services more efficiently, thereby offsetting the potential adverse affects of the fiscal
adjustment. Specific issues and steps to address them include the following:
* There are 50 social protection programs being run by various central Government
institutions, in addition to the programs operated by local Governments (for
example, 30 programs are currently being run by the Municipality of
Montevideo). These programs are generally being carried out independently, with
cases of overlap and duplication for some beneficiaries, while potential
beneficiaries remain unattended. Thus, in the medium term, the Government will
create an Integrated System of Beneficiaries.  Initially, it will introduce a
mechanism to cross-check the data bases of beneficiaries included in the Ministry
of Public Health Sector (RUCAF, Registro Unico de Covertura de Asistencia
Forma and IPB, Identificacion Positiva de Beneficiarios), MVOTMA (Registro
Nacional de Postulates) and BPS (Registro de Activos). This mechanism would
help to improve the effectiveness of the programs, minimize duplication of
benefits and ensure that the needy actually get the benefits that accrue to them.
This will be implemented by starting to identify all beneficiaries using a single
element: the identity document that is mandatory for all inhabitants as from 45
days from birth. This database would then be used to cross-check in order to
identify duplication and/or gaps.
* As mentioned above, current fiscal pressures require cutting public expenditures.
Therefore, a selected group of Social Protection Programs that focus on children
will be protected from budget cuts (Annex 2 of the LDP). These programs were
selected from a complete inventory of the social programs, and an operating
procedure will be designed to identify, monitor and guarantee the resources
assigned to each of the selected programs. The Office of Planning and Budget
(OPP) will coordinate the monitoring process, including beneficiary assessments,
in two of the selected programs (PAE and MTSS/FRL).
In order to increase the efficiency of public expenditures, the Government is
conducting economic and social evaluations of important programs: SIAV,
Family Allowances and the programs managed by INDA. Those evaluations will
be used to improve the operation of these programs. The evaluations include:
targeting analysis, efficiency analysis and they will also check whether purchases
carried out under these programs were done at competitive market prices (SIAV
and 13NDA). The results of these evaluations will be used for improving the
efficiency and efficacy of the programs.



- 21 -
The Government has assigned the Office of Planning and Budget (OPP) the task
of setting up and implementing an information system for the monitoring of
public social spending. The system will be used to regularly monitor social
programs on the basis of pre-defined indicators. To do so it will be necessary to:
I) define the scope of social spending (the sectors and items to be covered); ii)
define the desegregation within each sector; and iii) include spending by
departmental Governments with a breakdown similar to that for the central
Government, with the resulting submission of a report on consolidated spending
for 2000, 2001 and 2002. This will be the first time that consolidated spending
will have been calculated in Uruguay, and the process will be further improved in
future. In addition, OPP will facilitate the monitoring of international
commitments assumed by the State for support in the social sectors, and help
coordinate central Government and municipal programs to minimize duplication
and increase synergies.
D. Unemployment Insurance Reform
45.   Uruguay has a Unemployment Insurance (UI) program funded out of general
Government revenues and administered by the Blanco de Prevision Social (BPS). The
Government spends about 0,4% of GDP (US$80 million in 2001) in the program. To be
eligible, unemployed workers must have been working for a minimum of six months in
the year before they lost their job. Thus, the program is geared for workers in the formal
sector. The insurance covers six months of benefits, which could be extended for an
additional 12 months. The benefit has a minimum equivalent to 50% and a ceiling of 70%
of the previous wage of the worker, and it is capped at 8 minimum wages (the minimum
wage is around US$60 ger month). Currently, about 15% of the unemployed workers are
covered by the program .
a. Main Structural Issues
46.   The existing program  has several features that lead to inefficiencies and
misspending. In particular: (i) unemployed workers receiving benefits have little
incentives to search for another job. There is clear evidence in Uruguay as in other
countries, that the exit rate from unemployment of the workers receiving benefits is
substantially lower than of others; (ii) the actual use of the program is very limited,
resulting in no coverage for a large fraction of the labor force; and (iii) enterprises use
the program to manage their workforce and reduce their labor costs.
b. Reform measures
47.   To address these issues, the Government will implement a thorough reform the
Unemployment Insurance system.  Specifically, the new system will include the
following features:
9 Includes people who seek a job for the first time.



- 22 -
(a) The period during which unemployment insurance benefits are paid will not
be extended beyond the original period of six months, and people will be
required to perform community services or attend retraining programs while
receiving unemployment insurance;
(b) Monthly unemployment benefits will decrease over time, to provide an
incentive to workers to find a new job. However, this will be done by paying
a higher benefit than now in the first part to the period, and a lower benefit
than now in the second part, so that the total benefit will not change;
(c) Workers receiving severance payments in excess of about 100 minimum
wages will not be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits; and
(d) Impose a lifetime limit of 36 months on the amount of unemployment
insurance that a worker can receive over their working lifetime. That would
also be another incentive for an unemployed worker to find another job as
soon as possible. Given current rates of job destruction and creation, the
probability of being unemployed for more than 36 months in a lifetime is
extremely low for people that actively seek a job.
48.   Helping the unemployed poor. The Government will restructure the Training
Program for workers receiving unemployment insurance (TSD), which is financed by the
Fondos de Reconversion Laboral (FDL), to cater to the needs of the unemployed who are
in the worst economic and social conditions. At the same time, the Government will
continue to operate the Programa Joven, which provides training to 1,500 young people
per year, helping them to reenter the labor force.
V. THE PROPOSED LOANS
A. Description and Objectives
49. The proposed Loans will support the Government adjustment program described
above as well as help Uruguay withstand the impact of the huge external shocks that have
hit the economy in the past three years and mitigate the social costs of the crisis. The
program supported by these Loans has a fiscal focus, responding to the current economic
crisis and also setting the stage for medium and longer term fiscal sustainability. It
includes policy measures in three main areas: (i) fiscal policy, including both revenues
and expenditures; (ii) the public mortgage bank, which is a major contingent liability of
the public sector; and (iii) social protection programs, which need to respond both to the
increased demand during the recession as well as to the tighter fiscal constraints.
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement
50. The Government of Uruguay has requested the Bank's help in dealing with the
worst economic crisis in the country's history. As mentioned above, the 2000 CAS
scenario is no longer appropriate under the current crisis conditions. The implications of
a material change in the economic environment was foreseen in the original CAS,
specifically noting that a significant external or domestic shock might imply that Uruguay
would face serious financing constraints despite its investment grade. Under these



- 23 -
circumstances, the Bank could play a catalytic role with higher lending to improve the
prospects of longer term fiscal sustainability, secure structural reforms in the financial
sector, and improve the efficiency of the social protection system. The proposed
operations would provide Bank support for these efforts and it is fully consistent with the
Bank's revised Country Assistance Strategy.
C. Loans Amount and Tranching
51. The proposed Loans would be for US$252.54 million (including the capitalized
front-end fee), of which US$151.52 is a regular Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL), and
US$101.02 is a special Structural Adjustment Loan (SSAL). The SAL will be disbursed
in two tranches: (i) an initial tranche based on actions already taken or expected to be
taken by the time of Board presentation, which would be disbursed upon effectiveness;
and (ii) a second tranche will be disbursed upon approval and enactment of the new
Organic Chart of the BHU. The SSAL will be disbursed in one tranche, conditioned on
specific actions that would be implemented by the authorities (see section D (b) below).
Disbursement of the second tranche of the SAL is envisaged around 3 months after the
first tranche, and of the SSAL around 9-12 months thereafter.
D. Loans Conditionality
a. Second Tranche of the SAL
52. Reform of the Organic Chart of BHU: Articles 137 through 145 of the bill
presented by the Executive to the Congress on June 30, 2002 (Proyecto de ley referente a
la rendici6n de cuentas y balance de ejecuci6n presupuestal correspondiente al ejercicio
2001) have been enacted by the Congress in a manner substantially similar -as
determined by the Bank- to the bill presented by the Executive.
b. SSAL
(i) Macro/fiscal
53. The Borrower has not increased non-financial public sector wages (wages of the
central and local -departmental and municipal- government, state owned companies, and
decentralized and autonomous agencies), in the period comprised between July and
December 2002.
54.  2ANCAP, ANP, ANTEL, and UTE       have signed new agreements (convenios
colectivos de trabajo) with each of the labor unions representing the employees of said
ANCAP, ANP, ANTEL, and UTE, in which new agreements, remunerations linked to
productivity have been reduced (in aggregate) by at least 50% in real terms, as evidenced
by the new version of (i) the ANCAP Agreement, (ii) the ANP Agreement, (iii) the
ANTEL Agreement, and (ii) the UTE Agreement.



- 24 -
(ii) BHU
55. Reform of the Organic Chart of BHU: Articles 137 through 145 of the bill
presented by the Executive to the Congress on June 30, 2002 (Proyecto de ley referente a
la rendicion de cuentas y balance de ejecuci6n presupuestal correspondiente al ejercicio
2001) have been enacted by the Congress in a manner substantially similar-as determined
by the Bank- to the bill presented by the Executive.
56. Deposits from the general public in BHU, excluding those appertaining to the
horror previous system, are being phased out as outlined in Annex 1 of the Letter of
Development Policy, and total outstanding deposits in BHU, apart from those related to the
horror previous (savings for housing) system, shall be not more than $750,000,000 equivalent.
57. A due diligence, i.e., valuation and appraisal to determine the market value of the
credit and investment portfolios of BHU, has been carried out by an entity satisfactory to
the Bank.
58.  A divestment plan (including semi-annual targets for non-performing credit
portfolio, foreclosed assets, real estate for sale, and real estate promised to be sold when
the person to whom such real estate has been promised (promitentes compradores) is in
arrears) has been approved by the board of directors of BHU. BHU has complied with
the targets of as many calendar (i.e., January through June and/or July through
December) semesters (with a minimum of one semester) as have transpired between the
approval of said divestment plan and the Tranche Release Date.
59. The board of directors of BHU has approved a new BHU credit manual.
60. An integrated information system for BHU's asset and liability management is
being implemented.
61.  A restructuring plan -approved through, inter-alia, resolutions (Actas) 13770,
13775, 13779, 13786, 13789 and 13790 of the board of directors of BHU (including the
appointment and accession of professional management, creation of new loan recovery
and finance departments, and a substantial downsizing of BHU) is being implemented as
set forth in such resolutions.
62. A bill removing existing differences between BCU's supervision powers over state
owned and private banks, including powers of BCU to impose fines on state owned banks
presented by the Executive to Congress on September, 20 2001 has been enacted,
regulated and is being implemented. When enacted, said bill shall also prescribe BCU to
inform the Executive about said fines for the Executive to consider imposing sanctions on
the members of the board of directors of said state owned banks, as regulated by article
197 of the Borrower's Constitution,
(iii) Social Protection
63. The databases containing information of beneficiaries of the following social
protection programs managed by the Borrower's Ministry of Health (databases: Registro
Unico de Asistencia Formal -RUCAF- and Identificaci6n Positiva de Beneficiarios -



-25 -
IPB), Banco de Previsi6n Social (program: Asignaciones Familiares, database: Registro
de Activos) and Ministry of Housing, Urban Planning and Environment (program: SIAV,
database: Registro Nacional de Postulantes) have been adapted to be able to cross-check
information among each other regarding said beneficiaries.
64. A report on the consolidated national and local social spending of the Borrower and
local entities (departments and municipalities) for 2000, 2001 and 2002 has been issued.
65. A new information system -satisfactory to the Bank- covering all national and local
(run by departments and municipalities) social protection programs of the Borrower is in
operation.
66. The following national and local social protection programs of the Borrower have
been evaluated: (i) Apoyo a Instituciones Publicas y Privadas -AIPP-, Programa
Nacional de Complementaci6n Alimentaria -PNCA-, Centro de Atenci6n a la Infancia y
a la Familia -CAIF-, and Servicio de Asistencia Alimentaria.Colectivizada -SAAC-
(executed by INDA (Instituto Nacional de la Alimentaci6n), (ii) SIAV and (iii)
Asignaciones Familiares (executed by Banco de Previsi6n Social). Such evaluation shall
include an efficiency analysis, a targeting analysis, and a comparison of the prices at
which the agencies executing said programs acquire goods and the market prices of said
goods.
67. The Borrower's allocation for each of the Protected Social Programs for 2003 is not
lower than the 2002 allocation for each of the Protected Social Programs as set forth in
Annex 2 of the Letter of Development Policy (adjusted according to the change of public
wages).
68. An evaluation of the Borrower's Programa de Alimentaci6n Escolar (executed
through ANEP) and Programa de Capacitaci6n Laboral (executed through the Ministry
of Work and Social Affairs of the Borrower) has been carried out through an assessment
of beneficiaries of said programs.
(iv) Unemployment Insurance
69. The Congress has enacted a new unemployment insurance law including provisions
to: (i) allow unemployment insurance benefits only during an initial eligibility period of
six months; (ii) reduce unemployment insurance benefits over time and require recipients
of unemployment insurance to perform  community services while receiving said
unemployment insurance; (iii) limit the provision of unemployment insurance benefits to
workers receiving severance payments totaling less than one hundred minimum wages;
and (iv) establish a lifetime limit of thirty-six months of unemployment insurance
benefits per worker.
70.  The Borrower's training program for the unemployed (Article 317 to 331 Law
16,320 as amended) has been refocused to target preferentially workers receiving
severance payments totaling less than one hundred minimum wages per, as evidenced by
a report reflecting the results of the last six months of said training program including:
amount of beneficiaries, social and economic condition of said beneficiaries, and amount



- 26 -
of trained workers that have found jobs after said training (specifying whether the skills
received in such training are used in the new job).
E. Program Management and Loan Administration
71.   The Oriental Republic of Uruguay would be the Borrower of the proposed Loans.
The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be the principal executing agency and would
have overall responsibility for coordinating and overseeing all aspects of the program.
The Office of Planning and Budgeting (OPP) will also have key roles in executing the
program and would work closely with the Ministry of Economy and Finance in executing
program components under its jurisdiction. The closing date of the Loans would be
December 31, 2004.
F. Disbursement and Auditing Arrangements.
72.   Disbursement arrangements would follow  the simplified procedures for
SAL/SECALs approved by the Board on February 1, 1996. The Borrower would open an
account in Central Bank of Uruguay (Banco Central del Uruguay). Once the Bank
formally notifies the borrower that a tranche is available for withdrawal, the borrower
may submit a simplified withdrawal application so that the proceeds of the tranche are
deposited by the Bank in this account for use in accordance with the Loan Agreements.
Disbursements would not be linked to specific purchases, and supporting evidence for
disbursements is therefore not required. The proceeds of the loan would not be used to
finance expenditures typically excluded under the Loan Agreement. Although a routine
audit of the deposit account would not be required, the Bank would reserve the right to
conduct one.
G. Implementation and Monitoring
73.   Uruguay is strongly committed to move ahead with the ambitious, yet realistic
reform program. This contains several prior actions on which the Government has acted,
particularly in the fiscal and financial sector areas. The loans' design incorporates
lessons learned from previous adjustment operations. Implementation would be
monitored through regular reviews and would be supported by provision of technical
assistance as needed in the context of supervision missions.
H. Consultation with Stakeholders
74. Many of these measures were discussed with various segments of civil society, in
order to hear their views and identify priorities, to achieve a greater ownership of the
program, and to facilitate its monitoring and implementation in the future. The
consultations will help design social communication strategies in various thematic issues.
The Consultations were coordinated by the Office of Planning and Budget (OPP), and on
the civil society side, the main counterpart was the Foro Consultivo Econ6mico Social
del Mercosur (FCES). The Foro is a coordinating entity made up of a federation of
entrepreneurial entities, PIT-CNT (central national trade union) and representatives from
non-profits organizations and academia, ANONG (national association of NGOs), the



- 27 -
federation of cooperatives, and the university professional association. As result of these
consultations, the coordinating team should produce a set of indicators -and an action plan
for monitoring reforms in social protection programs. The monitoring reports would also
serve as inputs for the Bank supervision missions of the proposed SAL.
I. Collaboration with IMF & IDB and Burden-sharing
75. The proposed Loans will be part of the US$3.3 billion package of support pledged
by the International Financial Institutions to Uruguay after the magnitude of the
Argentina shock became apparent early this year. Since the crux of the problem is a
liquidity issue., the IMF is taking the lead in terms of financial support. The IDB and the
World Bank are augmenting their programs with new loans, partly on special terms, to
provide additional financing as-well as to advance structural reforms.
76. On June 25, 2002, the IMF Board approved a supplement of about US$1.5 billion,
on top of the US$744 million Stand-by approved in March this year. (para. 15 and Box
1).
77. The IDB's program in Uruguay includes five new projects for a total amount of
US$745 million in June 2002 - March 2003, with disbursements of US$410 million
during that period. On top of regular commitments for 2002-2003 of about US$300
million, the IDB has prepared two additional operations: (i) a $180 million multi-sector
credit line operation supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (approved in June
2002); and (ii) a $320 million Emergency Loan under special terms to be presented
shortly. The SME's loan supports credit for Uruguayan private enterprises, in order to
help make up for the shortfall in domestic financial market, which are not mobilizing
sufficient medium and long-term savings to fund private sector productive investments.
The proposed Emergency Loan will support the social sectors.
J. Benefits and Risks
78.   The main benefits of the proposed Loans would be to support Uruguay during the
deepest economic crisis in its history, while at the same time advancing the country's
structural reform agenda. In particular, the Loan supports a comprehensive reform of the
public Mortgage Bank (BHU), thereby putting the financial sector on a more solid basis
and defusing a major contingent liability of the public sector. In addition, the Loan
would help mitigate the social consequences of the crisis and would set the stage for a
more efficient and effective social protection system.
79. The proposed Loans, however, are high risk operations. The main risks include: (i)
continuing contagion from the Argentine crisis; (ii) a deepening of the confidence crisis,
with the outflow of bank deposits continuing unabated, thereby further weakening the
financial system; and (iii) a worsening of the public debt sustainability indicators. The
latter would occur either because of difficulties in raising revenues and in reducing
expenditure in the midst of the recession, and/or as a result of a sharper exchange rate
depreciation resulting from the recent floating of the peso, which lowers GDP in terms of
dollars and results in higher debt to GDP ratios. These risks are discussed in more detail
below.



-28 -
80. Geographical Contagion. A further collapse of the Argentine economy, beyond
the currently projected 15-17% drop of real GDP in 2002, could result in a decline of the
Uruguayan economy by as much as 8 to 10 percent in real terms this year, compared with
the current projection of a 7 percent real GDP decline. A more severe economic
downturn could exacerbate the fiscal problems, increasing the public debt-to-GDP and
the fiscal adjustment required to keep this ratio at sustainable levels. To prevent that
outcome, the Government is implementing its adjustment program and has already
adopted several measures to encourage production and exports.
81. Financial contagion. A related (and more immediate) risk is that the pace of
deposit bank withdrawals continues unabated, draining dwindling international reserves.
Since the beginning of the year the Uruguayan banking system has already lost around
US$5 billion, or about one-third of bank deposits. There are still nearly US$10 billion
deposited in the banking system, of which about 40 percent belong to non-residents. The
probability of an accelerated run on bank deposits should is significant, and this risk
continues to require close monitoring.
82. Public banks. A related risk is the ongoing difficulties facing the public banks.
State owned banks are extremely vulnerable to a further economic slowdown, since the
Mortgage Bank (BHU) and the Bank of the Republic of Uruguay (BROU) are highly
exposed to domestic borrowers. If the deposit run becomes impossible to finance, the
Government will most probably lack the means to honor its guarantee on public bank
deposits and will need to consider alternative solutions. Second, Congress may not
accept the amendments to the Organic Charter proposed by the Government. In that case,
the Government would go ahead with the reform, but with a weaker legal framework,
which could make it easier to reverse. Also, the BHU is vulnerable to exchange rate
realignments because of a currency mismatch between assets and liabilities, although its
recent swap of assets with the Central Bank (para. 37) has lessened this mismatch,
reducing this risk at least in the short run. The far-reaching reform of BHU contained in
the SAL program would defuse these risks substantially, as the bank will cease to
function as a financial intermediary that is financed by deposits from the public, and will
grants new mortgages only as long as it can sell them to the private sector.
83. Debt sustainability. Uruguay also faces a potential debt sustainability problem.
Fiscal deficits averaging around 4 percent of GDP over the last three years left the
country with a 57 percent public debt to GDP ratio at end-2001. Since the public debt is
almost entirely denominated in dollars, the large devaluation of the currency following
the abolition of the band could bring the public debt to GDP ratio to more than 70 percent
by end-2002. Such high levels of external indebtedness, combined with higher interest
rates and low levels of economic growth, will require a primary surpluses in the order of
3 to 4 percent of GDP to ensure debt sustainability over the medium to long run (paras.
22, 23).
84. Other external sector vulnerabilities. Beyond the more immediate financial and
fiscal risks, Uruguay faces external sector vulnerabilities-that reflect the concentration of
merchandise and service exports to neighboring countries. At end-2002, Argentina and
Brazil still accounted for over one third of Uruguayan exports. Also, Uruguay is very
dependent on the export of agricultural and agricultural-based products (over 50 percent



- 29 -
of exports), which exposes the country to large commodity price fluctuations, natural
disasters (droughts, floods), and diseases, such as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
that paralyzed the processing and export of meat products for five months last year.
85. Political risk. While the Government is fully committed to implementing its
reform program, its coalition base in Parliament and the strong opposition imply a risk
that important measures may not gain approval. In particular, attaining primary fiscal
surpluses in the 3 to 4 percent of GDP range will require unprecedented efforts by
various segments of society. However, the measures already approved in the first months
of this year indicate a strong political base for implementing the required reforms. The
political establishment provided full support to the Government's program, ensuring the
approval of two packages of tax increases this year, which would raise Government
revenues by about 3 percent of GDP on an annualized basis. This achievement is
encouraging since not long ago the opposition blocked Government initiatives to end of
State monopoly over crude oil imports and to allow private participation in the mobile
phone sector. These initiatives are going to be presented again to Parliament soon.
Ensuring cooperation across the political spectrum is essential, since further increases in
the primary surplus will require difficult structural reforms that cannot be approved and
implemented without broad-based political support.
86. In summary, Uruguay is facing the worst economic crisis in its history, and it has
requested support from the International Financial Institutions to overcome the crisis.
The proposed SAL and SSAL would be part of that support, and they would also advance
the structural adjustment agenda of the country. However, these are high risk operations.
Several of the risks discussed above are addressed by the actions already taken by the
Government this year. In particular, the Government has shown strong commitment to
correcting the imbalance in the fiscal accounts. In addition, the reforms included in the
program supported by the SAL and SSAL would contribute to mitigating other risks.
However, there still is a substantial residual risk that is beyond the Government's control.
That risk is associated to two aspects that are closely interrelated: (i) external
developments and contagion; and (ii) the situation in the financial sector, where restoring
confidence is essential for stopping the ongoing deposit drain. A turn for the worse in
those or other aspects could derail the adjustment program. On the other hand, under the
current projections, the program supported by the SAL and SSAL would help Uruguay
overcome the crisis and improve the future prospects of its economy.
