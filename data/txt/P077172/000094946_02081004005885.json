external\n            shocks that have been affecting its economy over the past\n            three years and to advance the Government's structural\n            adjustment program. Policy conditionality covers fiscal and\n            debt sustainability issues, including reduction in public\n            expenditures, particularly the wage bill; increasing the tax\n            on wages and pensions; and curtailing wage benefits in the\n            public enterprises. It also covers reform of the public\n            mortgage bank (BHU), including changing its organic chart to\n            limit its lending activity to housing finance to individuals\n            and only insofar as it can sell these mortgages to the\n            private sector; allowing only deposits for \"ahorro\n            previo\"; and prohibiting BHU to build; a thorough\n            internal restructuring of the institution to fit its new\n            functions; improving supervision of the public banks; and\n            developing the market for mortgage-backed securities. policy\n            conditionality also covers social protection measures,\n            including developing a mechanism for cross-checking\n            eligibility of beneficiaries of various social protection\n            programs to enhance their efficiency and effectiveness;\n            protection of social programs that attend poor children; and\n            reform of the unemployment insurance system to improve its\n            operation and expand its coverage.
