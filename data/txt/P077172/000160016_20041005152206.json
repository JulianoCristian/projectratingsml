The program was part of a\n            concerted effort with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n            and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to support\n            Uruguay's efforts to withstand the impact o f strong\n            external shocks, address domestic weaknesses and set the\n            stage for sustainable growth over the medium and long term.\n            As a result of tight fiscal, monetary and financial sector\n            policies and reforms, Uruguay was able to reverse the\n            downward trend in bank deposits, freely float its exchange\n            rate without jeopardizing price stability, and reduce\n            sovereign risk premia to manageable levels. After\n            contracting sharply in 2002, the economy recovered in 2003\n            and is projected to grow at least 9% in 2004. In view of the\n            overall performance, progress with the implementation of the\n            program as described in the Letter of Development Policy,\n            and compliance with most of the specific conditions agreed\n            in Schedule 3 to the Loan Agreements, the granting of two\n            waivers (out of 18 conditions) as requested by the Borrower\n            is recommended on a no-objection basis for release of the\n            second tranche of the Loans 7137 and 7138. The basis for the\n            evaluation of Borrower performance and the recommended\n            waivers is set forth in this report."}, "docdt": "2004-10-04T00:00:00Z"}
