{"cdata!": "The Third Road Rehabilitation and\n            Maintenance Projects aims to reduce the total cost of road\n            transport on Bangladesh's most traveled roads. The\n            project will consist of construction of the Nalka-Bonpara\n            road, rehabilitation and improvement of the Dhaka-Sylhet\n            road, and construction of several small but important\n            bridges. During construction phase, soils and general waste\n            matters will be handled and deposited safely. The project\n            will create large waterbodies as a result of excavation of\n            sand borrowpits. These borrowpits will become permanent\n            lakes due to their depth and dimension. The lakes will be\n            rehabilitated after construction. Few dozens of clay\n            borrowpits will be created due to excavation for the\n            cladding of the slopes. The topsoil from the clearing and\n            grubbing will be used for this cladding. Air pollution will\n            be controlled by collecting dust with cloth filters, or\n            spraying water at construction sites. Transport equipment\n            will be furnished with silent boxes to reduce noise. The\n            road design includes large-scale plantation of the\n            embankment with trees and bushes, which will reduce the\n            lateral transmission of noise during operation. To mitigate\n            the risk of floods, culverts are required to be provided for\n            proper drainage. In places where erosion is to be expected,\n            wind grasses will be planted."}, "docdt": "1998-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
