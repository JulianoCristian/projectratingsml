O            SUMMARY
0.1          Resettlement Schedule according to ToR
In this report the Consultants have worked out the Resettlement Program for NGO's as indicated in the
ToR of the Contract related to the Construction Program Schedule. From the land acquisition plan it
appears that approx. 3,000 plots area affected. Each plot may have an average of more than 3 owners,
totaling to 10,000 EPs. The land acquisition is a lengthy procedure and will take at least 12 months.
0.2          Terms of Reference for NGO
The ToR for the NGO(s) were made up for the Socio-econoniic Survey and the preparation of the
RAP as well as for the IGPs and the MIS.
0.3           Selection of NGO's
The Consultants have invited NGO's socio-economic survey and the preparation of the RAP. A long
list was made up and recommendations are made
0.4          Alternative Time Schedule
After studying the Resettlement programs of RRMP-II and Jamuna Bridge both project were visited.
As the total procedure of landacquisition and identification of F'APs and EPs is very time consuming,
an alternative program was made to shorten the time period and to improve the process.

1              GENERAL
The Consultants hereby submit the report on the Resettlement Issues as specified in the ToR.
The procedure as required per ToR will take approx. 16 months till the start of the works by the
Contractors (see Part A, chapter 4, time schedule). This enables the Contractors to start the works in
January 1998. This procedure according to the ToR is given in Part A of this report.
However, the Consultants do not envisage this as the most favourable solution for the following
reasons.
a      Start of the works
The most convenient period for contractors to start the works is right after the monsoon. This
is ending September, start October. If there is still water in the rivers, he can mobilize partly
by waterways. This way of transport is required for a large part of the project area as
adequate infrastructure on land is not available. Also, if the works are started halfway the dry
season, the number of workable month are considerably reduced. This contains automatically
an increase of the tender price.
b)     Resettlement
With the program as stipulated in the ToR there does not exist any interaction between the
PCC (Project Controlling Consultant). A smooth execution of resettlement together with
execution of the works will unfortunately not be possible. If a relation is made between the
execution of the works and the resettlement, time and money saving advantages can be
obtained.
c)     Time Schedule
The resettlement is closely tied to the time schedule as imaposed by the award of contract to the
Contractors. Therefor it is necessary that the NGO's as swell as the DC's adhere strictly to this
time schedule. Every delay in time schedule will finally end up in a claim  from  the
Contractors, being unable to execute the works.
d)     Logistics and coordination
Related to the time schedule are the logistics to execute the Joint Verification Survey. The
timely information as well as the transport for officials from districts, thanas, ministry, etc.
are to be accurately integrated.
For the above mentioned reason the Consultants propose an altemative plan to assure a smooth
execution of phase I of the resettlement. This altemative is given in part B of this report.

1     Introduction
The Roads and Highways Department (RHD) of the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has
undertaken detailed Engineering of Nalka-Hatikamrul-Bonpara New Road Project (NHBNRP) to
improve the accessibility and infrastructure of the NW area of the country. The Nalka-Hatikamrul-
Bonpara road is seen as an important link to the Rajshahi Division and is expected to have a
significant effect on the economic development of this region. The construction of the Jamuna
bridge wit be completed by the end of 1997 and it is very likely that the traffic will increase
tremendously. To facilitate the traffic of Greater Rasjahi and Greater Pabna District, a improved
shorter road connection is essential. The first 4 km from Nalka to Hatikamrul follows the existing
alignment of the Sirajgonj - Hatikamrul road. This section ends in Hatikamrul at the junction of the
Kashinathpur-Bogra road. The Hatikamrul-Bonpara section would start at this junction and would
cross the Chalan beel from east to west. This 50.5 kIn would be a new road which will cross rivers,
lowlands, embankments, agricultural land and some homesteads.
The infrastructure development project generally causes involuntary displacement of people and there
by give rise to severe physical, economic, social, environnrLental, and other problems, dislocate
production systems, delink income sources and lose productive assets, reduce productive skill in new
environment where there is greater competition for resources. New location weakens the community
structure and social network of kinship, mutual assistance, cultural identity, traditional authority and
identity. This may causes severe long term hardship, impoverishment and environmnental damage
unless the resettlement and rehabilitation is carefully planned and implemented with appropriate
mitigative measures.
To address and to minrimize the adverse impact associated with acquisition and requisition of
immovable properties due to construction of the road on the land of the affected land users,
households, and other directly or indirectly affected persons, the GoB intends to prepare and
implement a Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy/Program (RRP) for the Project Affected Persons
(PAPs) and prepare Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) which would include:
(i) Physical Resettlement Action Plan (PRAP)
(ii) Economic Rehabilitation Action Plan (ERAP)
(iii) Management Information System (MIS).
1.1    Terms of Reference
According to the Terms of Reference in the Contract the scope of services for the Consultants include
the following for Resettlement Issues:
1     The submission of the land acquisition plan
2      Review RAPs from Jamuna Bridge Project and RRMP II
3      Optimize route alignment to minimize homestead loss
3      Define time schedule and target date for appointment of NGO's
4      Prepare ToR for RAP
5      Make shortlist of NGO's
6      Formulate selection criteria for NGO's

1.2    Resettlement and Compensation Policy
1.2.1 Policy
The resettlement and rehabilitation policy as per OD 4:30 of the donor agency likes to ensure that the
population displaced by this project should be the best beneficiaries of the project as compensation to
their losses.
It is therefore, stipulated that the involuntary resettlement is an integral part of the project design and
should be dealt with from the earliest stages of project preparation, i.e. from the feasibility study
stage, for the following reasons:
*      To avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement wherever feasible, through altemative
realignment of roads.
*      To evolve development programmes in consultation with resettlers including training and cash
credit for work participation, investment and opportunities for economic pursuit to derive and
share project benefit.
1.2.2 Objectives
According to the OD 4.30 of IBRD/IDA the borrower i.e. RHD should ensure that the displaced
persons and Project Affected Persons (PAPs) are fully resettled and rehabilitated after meeting the
following objectives and tasks:
-      To compensate their losses at full replacement cost prior to the actual move.
-      To assist with the move and to support during transition period in the resettlement site.
-      To assist in their effort to improve their former living standard, income or earning capacity,
production levels or at least to restore them.
-      To resettle the poorest and vulnerable groups in particular.
-      To encourage for community participatory planning and implementation of resettlement with,
establishment of an appropriate patterns of social organization.
To support through the use of existing social and cultural institution of the resettlers and of
their hosts communities for resettlement through mutual consultation.
To integrate the resettler socially and economically into the host community for better
resettlement planning through consultation with the future hosts.
To provide for compensation against land and all other immovable properties on the land
including common properties, infrastructure and other direct and indirect losses including
income and resources of PAPs as would be identified by PAPs survey.
To ensure compensation to the squatters, uthulis and tenants on land, even in absence of any
legal title to the land.

1.3    Review of Current Norms and Practices on Resettlement Issue
The human concerns associated with acquisition and requisition of immovable properties and
resettlement of persons affected by such infrastructure development project are addressed to some
extent by the World Bank's guidelines and the existing laws of the GoB requirements.
1.4    Operational Directive 4.30 (OD 4.30) of the World Bank
In view of the afore-mentioned problems, the World Bank has published and established principles
and guidelines for involuntary resettlement of the Project Affected People (PAPs). The OD 4.30
stipulates that involuntary resettlement should always be conceived as an integral part in the design of
all development projects the PAPs, affected directly and indirectly, must be compensated for their lost
properties and income in a manner so that their previous living standard is restored, and there should a
sincere attempt to improve upon it.
The 1982/1989 Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance of Bangladesh:
This Acquisition Ordinance of 1982 and 1989 as declared by the Government of Bangladesh stipulates
that it will pay compensation for both movable and immovable properties acquired for such projects.
However, it was established during the acquisition process for the JMBP, RRMP-II and other projects
that the existing laws are not adequately responsive to the reality of the situation. This ordinance does
not take into account the indirect losses suffered by the people who do not lose land or other
properties, but may lose access to their present sources of income. In recognition of the reality during
the JMBP land acquisition, some special compensatory arrangements were made reflecting the
principle set forth in the OD 4.30 without violating the inherent principle and intent of the present
acquisition ordinance.
Review of JMBP and RRMP-n RAP:
*      The Resettlement Action Plan (RAPs) of the JMBP and RRMP-II projects reflect that how the
OD 4.30 of the Bank and the Land Acquisition Ordinance of GoB as well as the subsequent
special provisions made for compensating the people affected directly and indirectly, have
been utilized in view of the uniqueness of issues identified in these project environment.
*      The RRRMP-ll resettlement action plan (RAP) does not address the issue of economic, social
and infrastructural rehabilitation of the PAPs. Where as RAP of JMBP has tried the same but
in practice could not achieve more than 20%, may be due to nonsuitability of the chosen
vocation. The implementation of the resettlement of squatters & uthulis and the landless PAPs
due to the acquisition of their rights and properties. T'hey were compensated only through
CCL and TG and sometime with the cost of temporary resettlement due to non availability of
the suitable land at determined market price or due to location a away from their source of
income.
*      The additional compensation to purchase replacement land by the landless PAPs against the
right of residence is always falling short of the market price due to non availability of sellers
for very small or very big plot at a place. This situation is giving rise to more squatters and
uthulis than it was before. Uthulis and squatters are being financial assisted to purchase 2.5
decimal land only.
*      On the West Bank of JMBP the resettlement sites purchased by the GoB for consolidated
resettlement at one or two places were not accepted by the PAPs.

NHB/GMi/REPORTStRESETTLNVER.2                                                August 1996

*     In RRMP-II project at Natore, the resettlement site purchased by the NGO at a place away
from  their earlier place of residence were accepted by less than 20%  of the PAPs.
Furthermore, there is no provision of minimum infrastructure like drinking water tube-well
and sanitation facility.
*     But the RRMP-II RAP address the physical loss mostly but do not really address the direct and
informal loss of common right, social and common infrastructure and over and above income
resources. The PAPs who are resettled are landless and de-linked from their source of
agriculture and other related income. The women of these household are also delinked from
their marginal employment and income for their sustenance.
It is therefore extremely necessary to run an Economic Rehabilitation Programme for these PAPs who
are incapable to adopt any altemative occupation.
1.5    Project Area Profile
The proposed NHBNRP is proposed to have 50m RoNV where description of PAP for the
understanding of the land and people living within 25 meters on either side of the center line of the
Nalka-Hatikamrul-Bonpara New Road Project is given below.
Human habitations along the proposed road starting from Hatikamrul to the south-west up to Bonpara
is sparsely distributed in small hamlets situated on raised grounds. Between Hatikamrul and Atrai river
crossing on the north of Katchikata and on the west of Atrai river the human habitations are relatively
dense contiguous and large in size. The proposed road would cross the south of the Chalan beel. The
beel is totally submerged during the monsoons, and on an average under 3.6 meter flood water on the
east of Atrai river and under 2.0 meters on an average on the west of Atrai river. As such population
size, density and diversity of the PAP to the west of Atrai is quite different from that of the PAPs on
the east of Atrai river. The later area is thinly populated and mostly occupied with agricultural

1.6    Sample Socio-Economic Survey of PAPs
The Consultant had therefore carried out a Pre-RAP Socio-Economic survey of the likely PAPs for the
proposed alignment of Nalka-Hatikamrul-Bonpara New Road Project, in July '96. Environmental
Impact Assessment Study of the alignment that satisfies the cost effectiveness and reduced resettlement
and rehabilitation requirement of both human resettlement and resources is to be adopted in the
project.
Many issues relating to Socio-Economic and Demographic Characteristics are relevant for the
preparation of resettlement programme and action plan have been identified in the pre-survey as
carried out between June-July, 1996.
Based on the above this Terms of Reference for the complete enumeration of all PAP households
within 25 meters of the center line of the Hatikamrul-Bonpara New Road Project covering 54.5 km to
be carried out by a NGO.
It is estimated that approx. 3,000 agricultural plots having owners as estimated to be 9,500 EPS and
60,000 PAPs are affected by this alignment as well as approx. 118 households estimated to have 150
EPS and 1,000 PAPs would be displaced. It is also estimated that another 500 to 600 person are
indirectly affected by the construction of the road. As per thLe detailed physical EPs survey of Nalka-
Hatikamrul-Bonpara New Road would require acquisition of an estimated 300 hectare.

1.7    Resettlement and Rehabilitation PolicyJProgramme (ORP)
Resettlement policy includes entire rehabilitation issues vide Or, 4.30. The Resettlement Programme
(RP) to be prepared on the basis of an approved development strategy, land acquisition procedures,
compensation policies and resettlement packages to be arrived at for improving or at least restoring the
economic base for those relocated. Preference would be given tc, land based resettlement strategies for
people dislocated for agricultural settings. But in absence of any seller of suitable replacement land for
purchase and to address the land to land compensation criteria, the strategies of nonland based
employment and rehabilitation in secondary/tertiary sector occupation with training and credit facilities
may be adopted.
In absence of any comprehensive published Resettlement & Rehabilitation Policy/Programmne for
involuntary displacement of people by the Government of Bangladesh (GoB), it is advisable to prepare
a detailed RRP for the NHB New Road Project and obtain approval from RHD and World Bank,
before preparation of RAP. This RAP will also be a major input in preparation of Tender Document
for Development of Resettlement Sites. The resettlement policy programme should spell out the
policies and methods of resettlement, rehabilitation, compensation and outline definitions of PAPs and
EPs with time table and budgetary provision for Implementation of RAP including Economic
Rehabilitation Action Plan (ERAP) and CMIS.
2      Optimization of Route to Minimize Homestead Loss
As specified in the ToR of this contract the route alignment was to be optimized to reduce the number
of affected homesteads. In the Feasibility Study it is indicated that 294 homesteads are affected. These
294 homesteads having an overage of 2.53 families this comes to 744 households as defined in 1993.
With ain annual population growth in rural areas of 2.3 % this gyives 796 households in 1996.
The alignment according to the feasibility study bisected several villages like Goja, Khalkula,
Hamkuria, Dori Hansmari and Baraigram. Also sensitive places like mosques, graveyards, schools
were affected.
The Consultants have carefully studied the alignment as given in the Feasibility Study and, together
with technical amendments, the number of affected homesteads could be considerably reduced. By this
adjustment of the alignment the affected homesteads were reduced to 58 with 128 affected households.
This optimization of the alignment will increase the road length with approx 500 m, but the savings on
affected homesteads as well as savings on construction will largely compensate for the additional
length. In the revised alignment some schools are still affected but the condition of these schools is
very poor and actually only consist of a tin roof with deteriorated walls.
The total number of affected plots could not be reduced. The alignment requires an odd 245 ha and
with the given plot size this could not be altered. The total ntumber of plots within the 50 m RoW is
3,000. This will slightly increase as the final level of the bridge approaches is yet to be determined.
The junctions in the low land areas will also cause a slight widening of the RoW. On the other hand,
the embankment height in Gurudaspur and Baraigram Thanas is in some areas significantly lower than
in the rest of the project. Here the RoW can be reduced so that the distance between the toe of the
embanknent and the border of the RoW does not exceed 10 m over long stretches.

All above mentioned NGO's were contacted, but unfortunately only four out of them gave a positive
response. These four are:
-      CCDB
-      RDM
-   WORLD CONCERN
-      SHARB
Out of the above four, CCDB, SHARB and RDM have gained experience in Bangladesh regarding
resettlement issues and well in RRMP-II and JMPB projects respectively. On the other hand World
Concern appears to have large experience with IGPs (Income Generating Project). Therefore of the
above mentioned NGO's, CCDB, SHARB and RDM are recommended for the Socio-economic
survey, joint verification survey and the preparation of the RAP. It is to be considered if a separate
contract is to be made for WORLD CONCERN regarding IGP's (training).

1      Introduction
The main reason for submitting an alternative time schedule by the Consultants is the time consuming
procedure of various activities such as land acquisition, placement of personnel, etc.. This alternative
part B does not vary much from Part A and differs only on these items as mentioned hereunder. This
alternative planning is to ensure not only time savings but also a close cooperation between the
NGO's, the RHD and the PCC (and consequently the Contractors'.
2      Project Distribution
The total number of affected plots amounts to approx. 3,000 in IIos. As far as our study goes now a
plot according to the Mouza map has an average of more than 3 owners. This implicates that there are
in principal 9,500 EP's. If a household has 6 members on average, there will be over 60,000 PAPs.
To these 9,500 EP's the affected homesteads and utholis are to be added. These large numbers of EP's
are due to the elongated shape of the project. To maintain these PAP's in a manageable number, the
Consultants propose to divide the project into two parts and to appoint at least two NGO's to execute
the socio-economic survey and the joint verification survey. The Consultants fear that it is almost an
impossible job to interview an odd number of 10,000 EP's and determine their losses within a period
of 3 months to be executed by only one NGO. The division into two sections also has a geographical
reason as the Atrai River and Nimaicharai Khal make a natural barrier for more than 8 months per
year and to travel from one side of the project area to the other side takes more than half a day.
3      RRP
In chapter 1 under Part A it is already mentioned that as there is no Resettlement and Rehabilitation
Policy (RRP) in Bangladesh, the Consultants feel that before starting any resettlement or RAP it is
necessary to develop an RRP. In the approach to the resettlement issue of this contract the Consultants
have tried to avoid resettlement of  PAP's  beyond their own village. Previous resettlement
programmes have shown that settling people beyond their own community creates a lot of problems
and a lot of work in the host community. If the PCC for the supervision is involved in the
resettlement, it is possible to integrate resettlement areas in the contract and let the Contractors
develop the resettlement areas. Clay borrowpits are required for the construction of the new road.
These clay borrowpits can be converted into fish ponds and adjacent to these fishponds resettlement
areas can be developed. The selection of the borrow pits/fish ponds has to be done in such a way that
it avoids resettlement to a location far from the original habitat. Secondly, to ensure a smooth
resettlement, these resettlement areas should be arranged along with the Land Acquisition Plan. If the
resettlement areas are  not available at the time the DC hands over the acquired land to RHD,
temporary resettlement is unavoidable.
Therefor a RRP is required to avoid additional cost for temporaly resettlement, delay in execution of
the works, etc.
4      Time Schedule
To allow the works to start at an effective time for the Contractor the time schedule as submitted under
Part A is to be reduced. A critical point in the time schedule are the notifications under section 3 and
section 6 as well as the approval of the project and the RAP by RHD and IDA. These dates indicated
in the time schedule as given under Part A, are to be brought forward. This is possible if the execution
of the landacquisition and the resettlement are done in collaboration with the PCC and the NGO's.

5    RAP
The Nalka - Hatikamrul - Bonpara New Road Project is considered as one project for the financing.
The funds to be made available by the fmnancing agency will only be released when the RAP is
approved. This implements that the RAP for both sections are to be more or less identical. Also the
data as obtained by the Full Socio-economic Survey are to be processed in the same way to avoid
different approaches. Therefor it is proposed that the PCC coordinates these activities and assures
identical approaches of RAP and resettlement.
6      Coordination and Logistics
Taken into consideration the tight time schedule, the elongated shape, the poor accessibility and the
seasonal inundation of the project area, it is really necessary that the coordination between the
different authorities, NGO's and the PPC is very well organized. Therefor the Consultants propose to
organize part 1 of the resettlement according to the organigram as attached under this chapter

DHV CES DDC DUL
Field Coordinator West
Responsible for the physical organisation of joint verification surveys, transport and all other
activities requiring immediate action.
Resettlement Specialist (expatriate)
Prepares frame work for resettlement, prepares RRP, prepares RAP in cooperation with
NGO's, prepares ERAP, defines criteria for MIS and IGP's
Socio-economist (expatriate)
In cooperation with NGO's he prepares the questionnaires, works out and elaborates data,
defines values and assures similar data processing for all EP's and PAP's
Non Governnent Organisation (NGO)
Represents the PAP's, appoints the required qualified personnel, prepares questionnaire in
cooperation with PPC's Resettlement Specialist and Socio-economist, defines the extent of
losses, executes PAP census, elaborates data of PAP census in cooperation with PPC's Socio-
economist, executes the landmarket survey, participates in the joint verification survey,
prepares RAP in conjunction with PPC, prepares MIS, training schedules and IGP(s) for
PAP's in cooperation with PPC's Resettlement Specialist.
The abbreviations for phase 2 are the same. There is off course an idea of the responsibilities and tasks
for phase 2 but these cannot be defined yet as the extent and impact of land loss can only be defined
after the PAP census. So the RAP can only be made after the results of the PAP census are know. It is
therefor proposed to award part 2, Implementation of RAP, only after the completion of the PAP
census. Alternatively the contract can be awarded to the NGO's, but the extent of the works (total
manmonths, period, etc.) is to be determined after the PAP census.
8      Conclusion
Resettlement is a complicated and delicate issue. In previous road projects with resettlement not
everything went as desired. A lot of experience is gained in these projects by the NGO's and without
any doubt in next projects there will be extensive improvement compared to earlier executed
resettlement projects. The main problem noted by the Consultants during the study of the RRMP-II
and JMPB projects was the lack of an integrated approach in design as well as in execution of the
works. Therefor the Consultants propose that, if the project is to be executed after the design is
approved, it is desirable that the Consultants responsible for the preparation of the design and the
Consultants responsible for the supervision of the project, work closely together with the NGO's for
the resettlement under supervision of RHD to ensure a smooth execution of the resettlement as well
the works. If this cooperation is successful, the resettlement can be completed at its definitive stage
before the start of the works. This approach will favour the PAP's, the Contractor as well as the RHD
as claims from contractors, due to delay because the site is not available, are avoided.
Once again this approach asks a careful planning and a constant availability of the Consultants on site
during the different surveys is required.
