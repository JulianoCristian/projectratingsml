          Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project are: (a) to provide\n            and improve critical road links in the overall transport\n            system; (b) to improve the institutional capacity of the\n            Roads and Highway Department (RHD) in road maintenance and\n            improved financial management; (c) to improve road safety by\n            developing the institutional capacity in RHD to identify\n            hazardous locations and to design and implement physical\n            measures to reduce road accidents at these locations while\n            at the same time improving policy capacity for better\n            enforcement of traffic rules and regulations; (d) to promote\n            private sector devilment through contracting out Feeder road\n            Type A (FRA) road works now undertaken by smaller and less\n            sophisticated contractors; and (e) to use labor-intensive\n            methods for road construction and maintenance to create\n            employment and reduce poverty. The project components\n            include: (a) construction of Nalka-Hatikamrul-Bonpara Road;\n            (b) rehabilitation of FRA in the northwest and southwest\n            regions of Bangladesh; (c) rehabilitation of Dhaka-Sylhet\n            road; (d) reconstruction of narrow bridges on periodic\n            maintenance contract roads; (e) maintenance of national and\n            regional roads; (f) road safety; (g) land acquisition and\n            resettlement, and relocation of utilities; (h) axle load\n            control equipment; (i) reflectorized traffic signs and\n            thermoplastic road markings; (j) police training equipment;\n            and (k) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1998-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
