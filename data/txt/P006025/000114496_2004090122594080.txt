Re: Loan No. 3643-AR (Maternal and Child
Health and Nutrition Project) Amendment
Dear Mr. Minister,
Please refer to the Loan Acreement, dated August 30, 1993, between the 
Argentine Republic and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
for the above Project.
After discussions with Mr. Roberto Pagano, head of the Project Coordinating 
Unit (PCU), during the week of January 11, 1994, we noticed that the Loan 
Agreement did not provide for the financing under the Loan of equipment and other 
materials required for the operation of the PCU and the provincial units in 
charge of coordinating the execution of provincial subprojects.  In order to 
enable the Bank to finance such equipment and materials, it is necessary to amend 
the wording of Categories (3) and (4) of the table in paragraph 1 of the Loan 
Agreement, which we propose to be as follows:
" (3) Goods and consultants' services under Part C. 1 of the Project"
"(4) Goods and consultants' services under Part C.2 of the Project".
If you agree with the proposed amendment, please so indicate by signing one 
copy of this letter in the space provided below, and return it to us.
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
