rated\n            satisfactory, although its sustainability is unlikely,\n            unless new Federal funding mechanisms are developed, or\n            priorities changed at the provincial level. Among the many\n            lessons learned, and in the context of financial\n            sustainability, political priorities should have taken\n            place, to reflect ownership of the program by health sector\n            leaders, emphasizing, at the provincial ministries level,\n            institutional arrangements for the execution, operation, and\n            expansion of the program, an emphasis which would have\n            forced a resolution to the issue of institutional isolation\n            of child development activities, long before the end of the\n            project. Regarding investments, and although Argentina is\n            among the region's richest nations, the health sector\n            remains in a poor state of physical, and technical\n            development; thus investments in civil work, equipment, and\n            training have not been enough to infuse changes in the\n            culture of health care provision. Rather, project design\n            should have focused on a long-term health system, aligning\n            organization, and financing to achieve results in response\n            to demand, and partly, in a reform-oriented vision.\n            Monitoring, and evaluation should have been strengthened,\n            considering that the knowledge output of the project, was as\n            important as physical outputs, and, structuring financing,\n            but contingent on producing monitoring data."}, "docdt": "2000-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
