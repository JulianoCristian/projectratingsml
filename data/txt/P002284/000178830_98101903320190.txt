APPRAISAL OF DAKAR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of Senegal is planning the improvement of the airport
at Dakar, a strategic location on the routes from Europe to South America, and
from New York to East and West Africa.  The improved airport will permit the
economical operation of long-range jet aircraft, including large new equipment
such as the B-747 and DC-10. Without the proposed improvements, air traffic
would tend not to use Dakar as a stopover point.
ii.       The project is part of a Master Plan for the development of Dakar
Airport prepared by the Agence pour la Securite de la Navigation Aerienne en
Afrique et a Madagascar (ASECNA). This organization is a multinational
agency of 14 African States and France set up to control air navigation and
to operate airports and other air services, as agreed between ASECNA and the
countries concerned. The Dakar Airport is operated by ASECNA under such an
agreement with the Government of Senegal.
iii.      The proposed project consists of lengthening the existing runway
so as to reduce weight limitations on flights with long stage lengths, and
construction of two new parking aprons for B-747 and DC-10 type aircraft.
iv.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$4.0 million, of
which US$250,000 in local taxes. The proposed loan of US$3.0 million will
be made to the Government, and will cover 80% of the total net project cost,
including the entire foreign exchange cost (US$2.4 million) and a portion
of the required local currency; the Governnent will provide the remaining
local costs.
v.        The cost estimates for the project are based on preliminary en-
gineering studies carried out by ASECNA, and are considered reasonable.
Detailed engineering will be undertaken by ASECNA as soon as arrangements
for financing the project have been finalized.
vi.       ASECNA will be responsible for execution of the project.  Procure-
ment will be by international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
guidelines.
vii.      The quantified economic benefits of the project consist of the in-
cremental net revenues to Senegal as a result of the retention and growth of
the various services provided to aircraft in transit through Dakar, mainly
on the South American route. On the basis of these quantified benefits, the
economic rate of return of the project over the life of the investment is
about 15%. In addition, the project is expected to benefit the economy of
Senegal by providing favorable conditions for the growth of tourîsm and for
the export of Senegalese products by air.



- ii -
viii.     ASECNA has experienced and competent staff, and is well managed.
The Dakar airport does not function as a separate financial entity, but its ac-
counting system is such that the financial status can be determined at any
time. The operating revenues of the airport fully cover its operating expenses
and debt repayment, and aleo produce a modest annual surplus; they are expected
to continue to do so.
ix.       The project is suitable for a loan to the Government of Senegal in
the amount of US$3.0 million equivalent. A ternm of 25 years including a
grace period of 5 years wlll be appropriate.

APPRAISAL OF DAKAR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Senegal has requested the Bank to assist in fi-
nancing the development of Dakar International Airport. The project includes
the extension of the runway and of the aircraft parking areas, and is estimated
to cost US$4.0 million, including US$250,000 in local taxes. The proposed
Bank loan of $3.0 million will cover 80% of the estimated net project cost,
and will comprise the foreign exchange costs and a portion of the local cur-
rency required.
1.02      The Government will be the Borrower.  The airport is operated by
the Agence pour la Securite de la Navigation Aerienne en Afrique et a Madagas-
car (ASECNA) under an agreement with the Government, and that agency will
control and disburse the funds.  The Bank will enter into a Project Agreement
with ASECNA for the execution of the project, and for the management and opera-
tion of Dakar Airport.
1.03      The project forms part of a phased development of the airport with-
in a Master Plan prepared by ASEGNA.
1.04      Previous Bank lending in the transportation sector has been for
port, railway and highway improvements totalling US$25 million. A recently
signed railway project has stressed the need for some improvement in trans-
port coordination, and provided technical assistance for this purpose. A
highway maintenance and reconstruction project is presently under appraisal.
1.05      This report is based on the ASECNA study, and on the findings of a
March 1972 appraisal mission comprising Messrs. A. Douglas (Aviation Engineer),
D. Elliott (Financial Analyst), and B. Bostrom (Economist).
2. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2.01      Senegal is situated on the western tip of Africa bordering on
Mauritania, Mali, Guinea and Portuguese Guinea, vith Gambia in the south-
west. Out of the approximately 3.9 million inhabitants, some 600,000 live
in Dakar, the capital and the center for industry and commerce. The latest
estimate of per capita Gross National Product (GNP) in Senegal is about
US$250 for 1971, the highest in West Africa after Ivory Coast and Liberia.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in constant prices increased by 2.6% per year
between 1961 and 1965, but by only 1.5% per year between 1966 and 1970. A
recent economic mission considers that this downward trend is likely to be
reversed because of better prospects for agriculture, trade, services and
industry, and that the annual growth rate should reach 4.5% within the next



-2-
few years. Part of this growth is expected to be achieved by the contribution
of the expanding tourism industry, and by additional exports of high-value
agricultural commodities. The proposed airport development at Dakar will
facilitate these attempts to diversify the economy.
2.02      The transport sector provides about 6% of GDP as compared with
agriculture (30%), industry and Government services (16% each), and commerce
(20%).
B.   The Transport Sector
2.03      Senegal's transport system in terms of rail, road, ocean shipping
and air services meets most of the country's demands for internal, interna-
tional and transit traffic. Animal transport is still important in rural
areas. River transport and coastal shipping are presently insignificant,
but the possibility of using the Senegal river for inland transport has
recently been investigated under a UNDP-financed study. The Gambia River in
that country is not used much by Senegal, although the navigable upstream
branches of this excellent waterway reach deep into Senegal's interior.
2.04      The most important mode of transport is the railway (1,032 km),
which in 1970 accounted for an estimated 65% of total freight traffic. The
bulk of this traffic is concentrated on the main export commodities --
groundnuts and phosphates -- and on transit traffic for Mali, which accounts
for about 13% of the railways total. Passenger traffic has declined substan-
tially with the expansion of the road network and of the vehicle fleet.
2.05      Senegal has over 9,000 km of roads, of which 2,000 km are paved.
The network is concentrated in the coastal regions and the groundnut areas,
with the main roads for the most part parallel to the railway lines. The
vehicle fleet comprised about 53,000 units in 1968, and is increasing at an
average rate of about 5.5Z per year.
2.06      Dakar's seaport and airport form the focus of Senegal's international
transport links. The seaport accounts for some 90% of the imports and exports
to and through Senegal. It is the terminal of Senegal's railway which provides
landlocked Mali with its main route to the sea; 36% of Mali's exports and 63%
of its imports are estimated to pass through Dakar. These proportions are
expected to increase over the next five years as a result of measures to be
taken by Mali to route more traffic through Senegal. The port accounts for
about 10% of passengers entering or leaving the country, excluding local
cross-border traffic. The three main secondary ports are Ziguinchor on the
Casamance River, Kaolack on the Saloum River, and St. Louis on the Senegal
River.
C.   Aviation in Senegal
2.07      Domestic air traffic is insignificant, although Air Senegal, with
an unduplicated route mileage of 2,070 km, provides scheduled air services
to 13 of the 18 airports and airfields in the country. (See Map IBRD 10055.)
In 1971, only about 8,900 passengers used these scheduled services, and about
2,000 passengers travelled in air taxi operations. In addition to passenger



- 3-
and cargo traffic, Air Senegal is also engaged in crop-spraying using
specialized aircraft.  International services to Senegal are provided by six
foreign airlines and by Air Afrique, a multinational company of which Senegal
is a member.
2.08      Aviation in Senegal is centered on Dakar Airport where one of
ASECNA's Flight Information Centers (FIC) is located. The FIC serves flights
over Senegal, as well as over several other West African states and part of the
South Atlantic. With its ancillary facilities such as the meteorological
office and the communications center, the FIC assists all flights between
Europe and South America, including the 25% of these that actually land at
Dakar.
2.09      Before the advent of long-haul jet aircraft, it was technically
necessary for international flights to land at Dakar, which lies close to the
great circle route between Western Europe and the east coast of South America.
Direct flights are now possible between Rio de Janeiro and many cities in
southern Europe, but an intermediate stop is still required for flights origi-
nating from or destined to northern European cities. This stop is also necess-
ary for flights between southern European cities and Buenos Aires if severe
payload restrictions are to be avoided. Dakar also serves as the entry/exit
point for the growing traffic between many African countries and places
in Brazil, Argentina and Chile; this is traffic generated mostly by commercial
and diplomatic requirements, and by international institutions.
2.10      Dakar's pleasant climate and good hotel facilities contribute to
making it an attractive stop-over rest point for aircraft crews after the long
journey over the southern Atlantic. Direct flights between Buenos Aires and
airports elsewhere in West Africa would necessitate payload restrictions in
the form of greater fuel to be carried, or intermediate stops in South America
at consequent extra cost. For these reasons, Dakar has kept and could continue
to retain a significant share of the rapidly growing traffic between South
America, Europe and Africa; this will only be possible, however, if the runway
and apron facilities at Dakar airport are improved to a ostandard where they
can serve the new generation of larger, heavier aircraft being introduced into
service on the route.
D.   Existing Air Traffic at Dakar
2.11      During the past six years, the average annual growth in passenger
traffic to and from Dakar has been 9.5%. However, the introduction of larger
aircraft has meant that commercial aircraft movements have increased at an
annual average rate of only 2% over the same period.
2.12      Most of the 347,000 passengers in 1971 were travelling on interna-
tional services; there were 101,000 arrivals, 96,000 departures and 139,000
passengers in transit. Only 11,000 passengers travelled on domestic flights.
Of the 35,500 total aircraft movements in 1971, 6,300 were international
scheduled flights, 1,000 international non-scheduled flights, and 1,750
domestic services; the rest were private, test or training, search and
rescue, and some military flights.



-4-
E.   Traffic Forecasts
2.13      As part of their feasibility study, ASECNA prepared forecasts of
passenger, cargo and aircraft traffic based on past air traffic trends and
on other forecasts prepared by international air carriers and international
organizations. These forecasts cover the period 1972-80, and are considered
reasonable.
2.14      For projection purposes, international passengers were divided into
four categories with separate growth characteristics. The dominant category
[s local residents in which there has been a rapid increase during the past
few years at the expense of sea travel.  The effect of the change-over from
ocean travel to air transport has now run its course, and future growth of
local resident travel by air is estimated at 6% per year.
2.15      Business passenger traffic depends on the development of the
Senegalese economy and on the expansion of trade. Dakar's geographical loca-
tion and cultural level make it attractive as the site for an increasing
number of international congresses, and these are expected to contribute
greatly to further increases in this business traffic which is estimated to
grow at 8% annually.
2.16      The growth of tourist traffic depends essentially on the provision
of appropriate infrastructure. Dakar now has 650 hotel rooms; the construc-
tion of a further 100 rooms started in 1971, and is planned on another 250 for
1972/73, a rate which should double the hotel capacity by 1975. Hotels in the
interior will offer over 300 rooms by 1975 following the completion of con-
struction of hotels at Nianning and Cape Skirring. When shortage of rooms in
no longer a constraint, tourist traffic is expected to increase at 13% a year.
2.17      The number of transit passengers at Dakar declined until 1968, but
has recently been increasing at an average yearly rate of 11.6%. The num-
ber of scheduled flights between Europe, Africa and South America has also in-
creased since 1968 at a yearly average of 15.6%. The project will facilitate
retaining Dakar's share of this traffic, and so a continued growth of 11% per
year in the number of transit passengers has been projected.
2.18      Air cargo is faced with strong competition from marine transport,
and this leaves it limited scope for an increase more rapid than the almost
9% experienced over the last few years. In spite of the development in exports
by air -- such as shellfish and vegetables -- which has taken place and is
likely to continue, the expected slowing down of the rate of growth of imports
by air is likely to keep down the overall rate of air cargo growth. An
increase of 8% per year has therefore been forecasted.
2.19      On the basis of these forecasts and the plans of the various air-
lines, the number of commercial aircraft movements is estimated to increase
at 3.6% per year. The following table summarizes past and projected traffic:

F.   ASECNA
a.   General
2.20      L'Agence pour la Securite de La Navigation en Afrique et a Madagascar
(ASECNA) was formed by the Treaty of St. Louis of December 12, 1959. This
treaty between France and 14 African States, including Senegal, laid down three
main tasks for ASECNA, and defined the method of financing each of them.



2.21      These tasks are as follows:
(a)  to control air navigation over the territories of the
African member states, and approach and landing aids at
the main airports;
(b)  to manage and operate, if requested, ground facilities
of member states' airports; and
(c)  to construct, if requested, airport facilities for its
member states.
2.22      The total cost of ASECNA's operations in its member countries is
about CFAF 7 billion (US$27.4 million equivalent) a year. This is financed
by receipts from airlines (40 percent), and subsidies from France (34 percent)
and other member governments (26 percent). ASECNA's operations require
subsidies principally because the cost of providing aerial navigation is
subsidized throughout the world and, in the absence of a change in the
universal system of subsidies, ASECNA is not able to charge the airlines for
all services provided. Senegal's annual contribution to ASECNA amounts to
about CFAF 300 million (US$1.2 million equivalent), of which about half goes
to support the cost of aerial navigation. The remainder is used to finance
the operation of Senegal's regional airports (excluding Dakar) which, owing to
the limited traffic, are not financially self-supporting despite efficient
management by ASECNA. In contrast, Dakar airport, taken in isolation from the
rest of ASECNA's operations, is financially self-supporting. Detaila regard-
ing ASECNA's financial structure are shown in Annex 1.  ASECNATs buget does
not cover construction of airport facilities, and such financlng is therefore
the sole responsibility of the Government.
2.23      Construction of the proposed project facilities would be ASECNA's
responsibility, and would be the subject of a separate contract betvean the
Government and ASECNA. Tlhe draft contract was reviewed by the Bank during
negotiations, and is satlsfactory.
b.   Organization
2.24      ASECNA is governed by a Board of Directors designated by the member
states which lay down the broad lines of policy. Day-to-day running of the
Agency is in the hands of the Director-General who ls assisted by experts
drawn from the various states. The he*dquarters of the Agency are ln Dakar,
and there is a Representative of ASECNA in each member country. The repre-
sentative has his own technical staff to deal with local matters, and he
can call on the expertise of the Headquarters staff.
2.25      The organization of ASECNA is well conceived, and the staff is com-
petent and effective. Relations between ASECNA and the Government of Senegal
are excellent. ASECNA operates its own training school at Niamey ln Niger
for the technical training of air traffic controllers, meteorological techni-
cians, and radio technicians who, upon graduation, are assigned to the various
member countries. Some technical training is provided on a amaller scale ln
Dakar.



- 7 -
2.26      ASECNA currently employa about 6,000 persons, of whom about 500 are
expatriates; this level of expatriate staff represents a reduction from a
total of about 600 two years ago, in line with ASECNA's program of Africani-
zation. Employees in Senegal total about 800, of whom about 140 are expa-
triates; the high proportion of expatriate staff is accounted for by the
location in Dakar of ASECNA's Beadquarters office and of a FIC.
3. THE PROJECT
A.   Investient Program
3.01      The six-year investment program (1971-77) for Dakar Airport amounts
to US$12 million as shown in Table 1; the suggested financing for repayment
of loans is at Table 2. The investment program includes widening of the
existing runway and taxiway and installing new lighting, construction of
new apron areas, runway lengthening, and an extension to the air terminal
building. These improvements will provide for the needs of long-range jet
aircraft, and for the new larger jet equipment to be introduced (B-747 and
DC-10).  Provision is made for the development of an industrial area at the
airport. These developments will be in accordance with the approved Master
Plan for Dakar Airport prepared by ASECNA and included in the feasibility
study dated May 1971. The work will be financed in a combination of the
following ways: (i) Government of Senegal funds, (ii) ASECNA's multilateral
resources, and (iii) Bank loans.
3.02      The program as detailed above is ambitious, but the priorities and
sequence of projects appear reasonable. However, the economic justification
of each element should be analyzed by ASECNA and reviewed by the Bank before
any investments are made. Assurances to this effect vere obtained during
negotiations. In any event, it appears doubtful that all the projects will
be completed in the time allotted.
B.   Description of the Project
3.03      The project provides for the facilities necessary to allow large
long-range jet aircraft to operate economically out of Dakar Airport. It in-
cludes:
(i) lengthening of the existing 01-19 runway from 2,900 m to
3,550 m, including runway lighting;
(ii)  construction of two additional aircraft parking positions;
(iii)  relocation of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) localizer;
(iv)  relocation of a road.
It also includes acquisition of land and enlargement of transit facilities
to accommodate additional passengers, but these two items are not being
financed under the loan.



- 8 -
3.04      The proposed extension will be at the north end of the existing
runway, and will necessitate the relocation of the present highway between
the airport and the city (see Map IBRD 10056). Most of the land required for
this relocation is already owned by the Government, and action has been
initiated to acquire the remaining property.
3.05      The proposed runway extension accords with the Master Plan for
development of the airport; any further extension will be provided at the
south end of the runway. The runway lighting will be high intensity to meet
the requirements for the ILS.
C.   Design and Engineering
3.06      ASECNA will be responsible for the construction and subsequent
operation of the project under the terms of the agreement between the Agency
and the Government of Senegal. The design and engineering will be performed
by ASECNA's own staff which is competent and experienced. As indicated earlier
(para 1.02), ASECNA has agreed during negotiations to enter into a Project
Agreement with the Bank.
3.07      During discussions with ASECNA, it became clear that its normal
practice for supervision of such work is to have the contractor share the
inspection work with ASECNA, for example, materials testing work would be
arranged and paid for by the contractor. Such arrangements are, however,
likely to lead to conflict of interest and be abused, and are therefore not
considered satisfactory. It vas agreed at negotiations vith the Government
and ASECNA that the latter is to be responsible and to pay for all supervision
and inspection services, and would not in any way delegate to the contractor
any part of the responsibility for project supervision and inspection.
3.08      The preliminary design was based on flexible pavement; however,
recent bidding on an apron-paving contract at the airport has indicated that
rigid pavement was fully competitive in price. A decision on the type of
pavement to be used will be taken when the final engineering is being done.
D.   Environment
3.09      The existing air traffic imposes little noise or pollution at
Dakar Airport. At the north end of the runway, the approach and departure
path is largely over the sea. At the south end, the path does cover some
residential and institutional areas, but noise and pollution are not signi-
ficant because these areas are sufficiently far from the end of the runway.
The introduction of larger aircraft such as the B-747 and DC-10 is not
expected to aggravate environmental problems appreciably.

E.   Cost Estimates
3.10      The project is estimated to cost the equivalent of US$4.0 million;
the foreign exchange costs are about US$2.4 million. The breakdown of these
costs is shown below:

Total          400.6    624.2 1,024.8  1,565   2,445   4,010 100.0
3.11      The above estimates of construction cost are considered reasonable.
They are based on preliminary studies by ASECNA which has extensive know-
ledge of the site conditions and of recent similar contract pricing. In view
of the straightforward nature of the runway and apron extension work, the
preliminary engineering carried out is a satisfactory basis for arriving at
reliable cost estimates. A physical contingency of 10% has been included
and is considered adequate at this stage in view of ASECNA's wide knowledge
of the airport and of local conditions. Escalation of construction costs
during the construction period has been estimated at 5% per year for both
the local and foreign components. The estimates of 4% for design and 4% for
supervision are lower than usual since this work will be performed by ASECNA
rather than by outside consultants.

serving South American and other transit traffic at some other location,
including the costs of building up ancillary services in the private sector,
would outweigh those expected at Dakar as a result of the proposed improve-
ment.
B.   Effects of the Project
4.02      The most direct and immediate advantage for Senegal of the project
is the retention and growth of services provided to aircraft intransit through
Dakar mainly on the South American route. This route has changed in structure
with the advent of long-range jet aircraft, so that now the traffic between
Brazil and southern Europe goes directly without requiring a refueling stop;
for longer stage lengths, however, refueling enroute will remain necessary
to avoid severe payload limitations. The project will enable Dakar to serve
the new aircraft which most of the airlines plan to introduce on their route
to South America.
4.03      Without the project, there would be stringent payload limitations
for large aircraft over long stage lengths to North and South America. Since
the economic advantages of using such aircraft on these routes are very
significant, airlines would start to use other refueling points, and Dakar
would gradually lose most of its transit flights. For the direct service
between Dakar and Europe, airlines would retain flights by existing aircraft
rather than accept stringent weight penalties on larger aircraft and the very
high costs that would result.
C.   Direct Benefits to Senegal
4.04      With the project, Dakar would retain the transit traffic, serving
the same number of aircraft but of a larger type.  These larger aircraft
would also provide direct services between Dakar and Europe. This anticipated
change in aircraft type would increase the net value added to the economy of
Senegal from the Dakar airport operation. It is the difference between the
two situations outlined in para. 4.03 and in this paragraph that determines
the economic benefits of the project.
4.05      The immediate benefits of the project are the net incremental in-
come earned by Senegal from the retention and growth of transit flights.
Since the principal airport charges are progressively related to aircraft
weight, very significant incremental airport revenue is derived from flights
by larger aircraft.  It is projected that the increase in transit traffic
will be accommodated by the introduction of larger aircraft without a sig-
nificant increase in flight frequency. The incremental revenues have there-
fore been calculated on the basis of a small increase in the frequency of
flights, and without a change in the charge structure. The gradual introduc-
tion of new aircraft compared to retention of existing aircraft types is
likely to lead to a net gain in landing charge revenue of US$550,000 by 1975,
growing to US$720,000 by 1980.
4.06      In addition, the Senegalese economy derives a net income from the
services made available to these aircraft such as provision of fuel, catering,
accommodation for resting crews, etc. A significant proportion of this net



- 12 -
income is in the form of foreign exchange payments by the airline users.
Since the aircraft fuel is provided by a local refinery, a calculation has
been made of value added in refining and handling the additional quantities
necessary for the larger aircraft. This gives economic benefits for Senegal
of about US$330,000 by 1975, growing to US$430,000 by 1980. The incremental
net income to Senegal from the stay of airline crews is conservatively esti-
mated at US$100,000 per annum.
4 .07     The total benefits to Senegal are thus estimated to be about
US$980,000 by 1975, growing to US$1.25 million by 1980, and conservatively
assumed to remain constant thereafter.
4.08      The services provided in connection with transit flights, such as
airline catering and sales in the transit area, involve significant employ-
ment at the airport which would grov in relation to the scale of operations.
Without the project, a serious reduction in this employment could be expected
over the long term because of the inevitable losses in transit flights.
D.   Project Return
4.09      On the basis of the quantified benefits accruing directly to the
Senegalese economy, the economic rate of return of the project over the lfe
of the investment is about 15%. Details of the analysis are shown in Annex 2.
An assessment of the optimum timing was made by means of a first year return
analysis; the first year return is 12%. The sensitivity of the rate of re-
turn to possible variations in costs and benefits has been tested with satis-
factory results.
E.   Other Benefits
40        In addition to the direct impact of the project on the airport and
on related operations, several additional benefits to Senegal vill result.
These benefits have, however, not been quantified, and are not included in
the economic return calculated above.
4.11      As a result of its advantageous position in relation to sea routes,
Dakar had long served as the administrative center for the former French West
African region. Although that administrative function has declined as more
states became independent, Dakar remains an important sea port and commer-
cial center. More than half the GDP of Senegal is generated by industry,
services and commerce; the frequent air services which are expected to be
maintained and improved by the project are an important support for many of
these activities.
4.12      The provision of additional carrying capacity resulting from the
use of larger aircraft will facilitate and encourage the development of air
cargo. It will make possible the expansion of exports by air of green table
vegetables. A pilot project for the development of such exports suitable for
':r shipment has been assisted by the Bank Group through IFC participation.
4.13      The added aircraft capacity at lower unit operating cost vill
iacrease the possibilities for promotional fares and lower air cargo rates.
At the moment, the loaest round-trip fare Parie-Dakar is US$535-.00, whereaas



- 13 -
Paris-Las Palmas for two-thirds of the distance has a lowest fare of only
US$213.60. Fares could therefore become more competitive than at present,
such as through the introduction of special fares and increased charter
group travel. This would provide a good basis for the expansion of tourism,
once other constraints such as limitations in hotel capacity are removed.
5. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Accounting
5.01      Accounting for Dakar Airport is the responsibility of ASECNA.  As
mentioned in para. 2.21, ASECNA has three distinct tasks which are accounted
for and funded in different ways. These are as follows:
a)   The navigational control center which is located in Dakar
and forms part of facilities financed by the 15 member
states. Only part of the services provided by this control
center relate to Dakar Airport, and only part of the cost
is borne by the Government of Senegal.
b)   The ground facilities of airports in Senegal which are
operated and maintained by ASECNA for account of the
Government of Senegal, with France participating in the
costs of the minor airports. Accounts are kept on a
country-wide basis. Only part of the cost relates to
Dakar Airport.
c)   Capital investment in Dakar Airport ground facilities
which are carried out by ASECNA for account of the Government,
and for which separate accounts are kept by ASECNA.
5.02      The system is essentially budgetary, and it does not report the
true costs of operation of any particular airport taking into account depre-
ciation. However, ASECNA is able to extract from its accounts all direct
costs concerning Dakar Airport, and is able to calculate the proportion of
indirect costs and depreciation appropriate to the operations of the airport.
ASECNA has therefore agreed during negotiations to produce annually a proforma
profit and loss statement for the airport in a form acceptable to the Bank.
5.03      ASECNA's accounting staff is well qualified and competent.
B.   Audit
5.04      Audit of ASECNA's accounts is carried out by an "Agent Comptable"
appointed by the Government of France. Hie grade promotion and pension are
decided by hie Minister, and he is therefore free from pressure by ASECNA's
management, and is able to exercise independent judgement.
5.05      The "Agent Comptable" has a staff that is well qualified and com-
petent, and he is able and prepared to certify the annual proforma profit and
loss statement mentioned above (para 5.02).



- 14 -
5.06      The Bank is satisfied that under these circumstances there is no need
to insist on further audit of ASECNA's financial statements.
C.   Financial Projections
a.   Profitability
5.07      The proforma profit and loss account projections shown in Table 4
and summarized below demonstrate on a cost accounting basis the viability
of Dakar Airport as a commercial operation:
(In CFAF millions)
1972        1975         1980
Revenues                    565          808        1,055
Operating Expenses          366          431          542
199         377          513
Depreciation                157          232          292
42         145          221
Interest                      5           96          118
Surplus                      37           49          103
The growth of depreciation and interest charges representing the burden of
the investment program, are matched by the growth in income representing the
use of the facilities proposed to be provided.
5.08      Revenue from landing charges has been based on present tariffs and
planned introduction by the airlines of heavier aircraft. Revenue from
passengers is based on projected growth of approximately 8% per annum, which
is much lower than the rate of growth in the past.
5.09      Direct operating expenses which are not particularly sensitive to
the volume of traffic have been estimated to increase by just over 5% per
annum to take into account small increases in staff, and probable increases
in salaries and maintenance. The projection is therefore conservative, but
nevertheless, there is a modest profit on the airport operation in each
year.
5.10      However, should the airlines' plans for introducing heavier air-
craft be delayed, then revenue would be reduced for possibly three years by
approximately CFAF 50 million, and this might endanger profitability.
5.11      A modest increase in tariffs would quickly rectify the position and
is unlikely to result in a reduction of traffic, since the increase would be
very small ln relation to total airline costs. The Government has indicated



- 15 -
that it would be prepared to maintain tariffs at a level to provide revenues
sufficient to do the following concurrently:
(i) cover operating expenses including interest on debt and
an adequate allowance for depreciation;
(ii) enable the amortization of loans and debts out of internally
generated funds; and
(iii)  produce a reasonable surplus which could be used for
expansion of the airport.
5.12      In order to achieve these goals, it has been agreed at negotia-
tions that the rate of return on net fixed assets in use at the airport (ex-
cluding the air navigation center over whose extension the Government has
little control) shall be not less than 7% on completion of the project; and
further, that it shall not fall below 4% during the period of construction
of a proposed industrial zone, provided that it is not less than 8% vithin
three years after completion of this construction. The net operating profit
and the value of the assets are presented in Tables 4 and 5, and a calculatien
of the annual depreciation is at Tabla 6.
b.   Cash Flow
5.13      The proforma cash flow serves to demonstrate that the Dakar Airport
operations would be self-supporting and would not constitute a drain on
Government resources if it were operating as an autonomous entity. The
proforma cash flow is shown in Table 7 for a ten-year period, and is summa-
rized below for the investment period (1972-1977):
(in CFAF millions)
Surplus 1971                                  158
Net Profit from Operations (1972-77)          249
Depreciation                               1,238
1,645
Less Debt Repayment                          419
1,226
Loans - Bank (for present project)            767
- Local banks                          502
- International Institutions
for reinforcement of runway
and industrial zone                  885
3,380
Investment in Bank Project                 1,025
Other Capital Investment                   2,218
3,243
Surplus                                       137



- 16 -
5.14      The actual cash flow is governed by the provisions of the Treaty of
St. Louis (see Annex 1), and will not be the same as that shown above.  How-
ever, the net financial gain of the project as shown in the proforma cash
flow will accrue to the Government of Senegal, and to that full extent will
improve the Government's financial position.
5.15      Since surplus cash on the operations of Dakar Airport is not in fact
accumulated by a Dakar Airport entity, it was agreed during negotiations that:
(a) the Government will make available or cause to be made available the funds
necessary for the completion of the project, and (b) no major investment in
Dakar Airport facilities should be made unless the Bank has agreed both to
the investment itself and to the proposed method of financing. Agreement on
these points was reached during negotiations. Assumptions used in financial
forecasts are shown in Annex 3.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations, the following principal points vere agreed upon:
(i)  The Senegalese law giving a 10% margin of preference to
local contractors would not apply to the project (para. 3.13);
(ii)  ASECNA will produce annually a proforma profit and lo0s
statement for the airport in a form acceptable to the Bank
(para. 5.02), together with financial projections; and
(iii)  No major investment in airport facilities should be made
unless the Bank has agreed both to the investment itaelf and
to the proposed method of financing (paras. 3.02 and 5.15).
6.02      The Bank has agreed that ASECNA should purchase the lighting
equipment for the runway extension from the eame manufacturer who supplied
the equipment for the existing runway (para. 3.12).
6.03      The Bank has agreed to a Project Agreement with ASECNA for the
execution of the project, and for the management and operatioan of the Dakar
Airport (paras. 1.02 and 3.06).
6.04      The project is suitable for a Bank loan to the Government of
Senegal in the amount of US$3.0 million equivalent, with a loan term of 25
years, including a grace period of 5 years. The Government will make the
funds available to ASECNA vithin the framework of the contract between the
Government and ASECNA (para. 2.23). ASECNA will use theoe funds to carry out
the project on behalf of the Government. Out of the revenues derived from
the operations of the Dakar Airport, ASECNA will make payments to the Govern-
ment equivalent to repayments on a loan of 20 years, including a grace period
of 3 years, with interest at 7-1/4Z per annum.

SENEGAL
APPRAISAL OF DAKAR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PROJECT
Agence pour la Securite de la Navigation Aerienne en Afrique et a Madagascar
(ASECNA)
ASECNA was formed by the Treaty of St. Louis between France and
14 African states. The treaty contains 15 principal articles, of which four
have financial implications for Senegal.
Article 2 states: "The Agency shall manage the installations and
services intended to transmit technical and traffic communications, naviga-
tion of aircraft, traffic control, flight information, forecasts and trans-
mission of meteorological information both for enroute traffic as well as
for approach and landing on the airfields listed in the Annex".
Dakar is the only Senegalese airport listed in the Annex.
Article 5 states: "In order to meet its expenses, the Agency will
have resources which may come from:
1.   Tariffs collected from the users;
2.   Contracte mentioned in Articles 10, 11 and 12;
3.   Contributions from member states on the basis of quotas
fixed in the specifications;
4.   Subventions."
Article 10 states: "Apart from the services laid down in this
Treaty, each State may request the Agency to manage or maintain any facility
of aeronautical utility by entering into a contract which financially is in
conformity with the spirit of Article 5."
Article 12 states: "The Agency may enter into contracta with States
which wish to use its services."
Under the above articles, ASECNA controls enroute navigation for
all aircraft in the area (Article 2), provides an approach and landing navi-
gation for the airport of Dakar (Article 2), manages and maintains Dakar Air-
port and some minor airports in the country (Article 10), and periodically
inspects the other minor airports in the country. In addition, ASECNA is res-
ponsible for project construction and supervision at Dakar Airport (Article 12).



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Article 2 expenses are financed by:
a.   a proportion of landing charges;
b.   a contribution from the French Government; and
c.   payments by the member states based on their budgetary
receipts and the volume of local paying air traffic.
ASECNAts total expenses under this article amounted to approxi-
mately CFAF 5,000 million in 1970, of which some CFAF 3,000 million were
accounted for by personnel expenses. Receipts from airlines for enroute
navigation amounted to CFAF 878 million, and from part of landing fees to
CFAF 631 million; most of the remaining CFAF 3,500 million came from con-
tributions by France (CFAF 2,200 million) and the African States (CFAF 1,300
million).
Of the CFAF 5,000 million in expenses, CFAF 618 million were spent
in Senegal. Senegal's contribution to this was CFAF 172 million by way of
payment, and approximately the same sum from part of the landing fees, making
a net inflow to the economy of the country under this Article of approximately
CFAF 270 million.
Article 10 expenses are financed by:
a.   a proportion of landing charges;
b.   a proportion of passenger and commercial charges; and
C.   payments by the Government.
The total expenditure for Article 10 in Senegal in 1970 was CFAF 275
million. This was covered by CFAF 153 million of receipts, and a payment of
CFAF 175 million by the Senegalese Government. The resulting balance of
CFAF 53 million was held by ASECNA for account of the Government of Senegal.
However, of the CFAF 175 million paid by Senegal, at least CFAF 38 million
came from France by way of subsidy.
Article 12 expenses are financed by a proportion of landing fees
and passenger charges, and if necessary, by direct payment by the Government.
The Government of Senegal has not so far made any direct payments
to this account, all monies for recent construction having been borrowed
from local banks and serviced from receipts under this Article.

Thus expenditure of CFAF 909 million in Senegal vas financed to
the extent of CFAF 238 million by the Government, CFAF 357 million by
receipts from airport operations, and the remainder by France and ASECNA's
common budget.
The total expenditure shown above covers three activities -- Dakar
Airport, other airports in the country, and aerial navigation.
The costs of Dakar Airport operations have been obtained by taking
the Article 10 coasts concerned with Dakar Airport, and calculating the propor-
tion of Article 2 costs relative to approach navigation and landing aide.
The aerial navigation center (FIC) which covers several West African
countries is located in Senegal. Aerial navigation world-wide runs at a lous,
and is subsidized; but Senegal is fortunate that the West African center is
located there, and that the inflow into the country's economy far outweighs
its contribution to the subsidy.
Of the total of CFAF 275 million Article 10 coste, approximately
CFAF 150 million concerned Dakar Airport, CFAF 10 million was spent on train-
ing, and the remainder on other airfields.
Of the total of CFAF 618 million of Article 2 coste, only CFAF 200
million concern approach and landing at the airport, with the remainder for
enroute navigation.
Staffing
ASECNA currently employs about 6,000 persons, of whom about 500
are expatriates. Employees in Senegal total about 800, including about
140 expatriates.

APPRAISAL OF DAKAR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
1.        The economic analysis of the project is based upon a comparison
of what is likely to happen if the project is or is not implemented.
2.        In anticipation of the improvements to be made to Dakar Airport
under the project, the international airlines presently using Dakar have
announced a phased introduction of larger aircraft for their Europe/South
America routes and USA/West/East Africa routes. These aircraft would re-
place those presently in use, and such replacement would have three principal
effects for Senegal:
(i)  the income from landing fees would increase with the
use of heavier aircraft;
(ii)  the larger aircraft would take on more fuel; and
(iii) the larger crews would spend more money in Dakar on etopovers.
3.        For the calculation of the economic benefits of the project, it
has been assumed that without the project, the present type and number of
aircraft would continue to be used to serve Dakar. This implies that the
gradual los8 of transit flights would be compensated for by additional ser-
vice between Dakar and Europe. Even with the expected growth of passenger
traffic to and from Dakar, a reduction in flight frequency to Dakar might
well occur, but in order to avoid over-estimating the benefits of the project,
the more favorable hypothesis for the "without project" situation has been
used for the rate of return calculation.
4.        The aircraft estimated to be substituted by 1981 are shown below:
Proposed           Number of
Airline       Present Aircraft         New Aircraft       Landings per week
Air France           B 707                  B 747                   7
Air Afrique          DC 8                   DC 10                   4
Swissair             DC 8                   DC 10                   6
Alitalia             DC 8                   DC 10                   6
Sabena               B 707                  DC 10                   2
Pan Am               B 707                  B 747                  10
Lufthansa            B 707                  DC 10                   6
Thus 25 B707's will be replaced by 17 B747's, and 8 DC10's and 16 DC8's will
be replaced by 16 DC10's.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        The increase in landing fee income arising from the substitution
is approximately US$1.5 million in 1981, from which must be deducted the in-
crease in operating charges of approximately US$780,000, leaving a net benefit
on landing charges for that year of US$720,000.
6.        The present generation of aircraft carries a crew of 10; the B747
and DC10 carry a crew of 18. Thus for each crew stopover, eight extra people
are involved who would spend money on acconmnodation and food in Dakar. The
net benefit to Senegal of these additional expenditures is estimated at
$100,000 a year.
7.        The larger aircraft carry and consume nmre fuel than the B707 or
DC8. The average offtake of fuel at Dakar has been calculated, and the dif-
ference in offtake between the present and the proposed aircraft has been
multiplied by the value added in refining jet fuel in Senegal. Due account
has been taken of the incremental costa in storages and delivery of fuel
to the aircraft.

The economic return for the airport investment over the assumed lifetime of
20 years (1974-1993) is 15%. This includes all investment in the runway,
taxiways and apron (1972/73 and 1976), and one-half of the total investment
in the terminal building (1974), related to transit passengers.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
A 12-year life of the project instead of an assumed 20-year life would reduce
the rate of return to 12%. A 15% increasin the estimated construction cost
of the project and delaying all benefits by one year would reduce the economic
return from 15% to about 12%. If all benefits were decreased by 25%, either
by a 25% lower traffic forecast or by a 25% reduction in the unit benefits, the
economic return vould be over 10%. If the value of benefits vere increased by
25%, the economic return would be 19%.

Assumptions used in Financial Projections
Revenues
Revenues are based on forecast traffic and present tariffa.
Operating Expenses
Direct operating expenses are not particularly sensitive to the
volume of traffic.
Personnel expenses are estimated to increase by 5.5Z per annum.
This takes into account the expected increase in numbers, the expected in-
crease in standard of living, and the reduction in the proportion of ex-
patriate staff.
The cost of spare parts is estimated to increase at 4Z per annum
since electrical and navigational equipment is becoming more sophisticated.
The unit cost of maintenance of infrastructure is not estimated to
increase. Hovever, account has been taken of the larger area to be maintained.
Depreciation is on a straight line basis over the estimated life of
the asset as follows:
Runway and Parking                           25 years
Lighting                                     10 years
