There are three project\n            components. 1) Technology development and adaptation will\n            finance: adaptive research and development activities to\n            address specific production constraints and opportunities;\n            new priorities to respond to serious emerging problems\n            identified in subsequent annual assessment; and\n            establishment of an Agricultural Research and Development\n            Fund to support a competitive research grants scheme. 2)\n            Outreach, extension, and technology dissemination will give\n            priority to the development and transfer of technology that\n            address actual constraints of the dominant production\n            systems of Uganda. It will also support demand-driven,\n            client-oriented research and promote active participation of\n            stakeholders in research planning, implementation, and\n            beneficiary impact assessment. 3) Institutional development\n            will support the transformation of National Agriculture\n            Research Organization into a research and development\n            institution and strengthen its capacity to monitor,\n            evaluate, and determine economic impact of improved technologies."}, "docdt": "1999-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
