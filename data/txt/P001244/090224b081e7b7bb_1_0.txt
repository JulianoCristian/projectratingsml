Procurement
A.   International Competitive Bidding
1.   Except as provided in Part B hereof, goods shall be procured
under contracts to be awarded in accordance with procedures con-
sistent with those set forth in Part A of the "Guidelines for Pro-
curement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits" published by the
Bank in August 1975 (hereinafter called the Guidelines), on the
basis of international competitive bidding.
2.   Furniture and equipment for Project Institutions and Project
administration shall be grouped so as to permit such bulk procure-
ment as shall be consistent with appropriate technical and procure-
ment practices. Whenever possible each bid package for such items
shall be for not less than the equivalent of $15,000.
B.   Other Procurement Procedures
1.   Civil works contracts under the Project shall be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance
with procedures which shall be acceptable to the Bank. Bidders for
such contracts shall be prequalified as described in paragraph 1.3
of Part A of the Guidelines, except that advertisement thereof
shall be restricted to the local press.
2.   Furniture and equipment for Project Institutions and Project
administration which cannot be grouped in bid packages estimated


﻿- 35 -
to cost the equivalent of $15,000 or more may be procured in ac-
cordance with the Borrower's procedures acceptable to the Bank,
provided that the aggregate cost of the furniture and equipment
so procured shall not exceed the equivalent of $300,000.
C.   Evaluation and Comparison of Bids; Preference for
Manufacturers Established in the territories of the
Central American Common Market
1.   For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for the
supply of goods:
i)       bidders shall be required to state in their
bid the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for
imported goods, or the ex-factory price for
domestically-manufactured goods;
(ii)      customs duties and other import taxes on im-
ported goods, and sales and similar taxes on
domestically-supplied goods, shall be exclud-
ed; and
(iii)     the cost to the Borrower of inland freight
and other expenditures incidental to the
delivery of goods to the place of their use
or installation sh.1l be included.
2.   Bids shall be compared in accordance with the following rules:
(a) the term "Central American Bid" means a bid submitted
by a manufacturer established in the territories of the Central


﻿- 36 -
American Common Market for goods manufactured or processed to a
substantial extent (as reasonably determined by the Bank) in such
territories; any other bid will be deemed to be a "Non-Central
American Bid";
(b) the bid price under a Central American Bid will be the
sum of the following amounts:
(i)       the ex-factory price of such goods; and
(ii)      freight, insurance and other costs of de-
livery of such goods to the site designat-
ed in the specifications; and
(c) for the purpose of comparing any Non-Central American
Bid with any Central American Bid, the price under a Non-Central
American Bid will be the sum of the following amounts:
(i)       the c.i.f. (port of entry) price of such
goods;
(ii)      insurance costs to the port of entry;
(iii)     half the amount of any taxes on the importa-
tion of such goods into the territories of
the Borrower which generally apply to non-
exempt importers, or 15% of the amounts spe-
cified in (i) and (ii) above, whichever shall
be the lower; and


﻿- 37 -
(iv) freight insurance and other costs of delivery
of such goods from the port of entry to the
site designated in the specifications.
3.   The bidding documents shall clearly indicate the margin of
preference to be granted.
D.   Review of Procurement Decisions by Bank
1.   Review of prequalification. The Borrower shall, before qual-
ification is invited, inform the Bank in detail of the procedure
to be followed and shall introduce such modifications in said pro-
cedure as the Bank shall reasonably request. The list of prequali-
fied bidders, together with a statement of their qualifications
and of the reasons for the exclusion of any applicant for prequal-
ification shall be furnished by the Borrower to the Bank for its
comments before the applicants are notified, and the Borrower
shall make such additions to, deletions from, or modifications in,
the said list as the Bank shall reasonably request.
2.   Review of invitation to bid and of proposed awards and final
contracts:
With respect to all civil works contracts estimated to cost
the equivalent of $100,000 or more and furniture and equipment con-
tracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $25,000 or more:
(a) Before bids are invited, the Borrower shall furnish to
the Bank, for its comments, the text of the invitations to bid
and the specifications and other bidding documents, together with


﻿- 38 -
a description of the advertising procedures to be followed for
the bidding, and shall make such modifications in the said docu-
ments or procedures as the Bank shall reasonably request. Any fur-
ther modification to the bidding documents shall require the Bank's
concurrence before it is issued to the prospective bidders.
(b) After bids have been received and evaluated, the Borrow-
er shall, before a final decision on the award is made, inform
the Bank of the name of the bidder to which it intends to award
the contract and shall furnish to the Bank, in sufficient time for
its review, a detailed report by the Direcci6n on the evaluation
and comparison of the bids received, together with the recommen-
dations for award of the said Direcci6n and such other information
as the Bank shall reasonably request. The Bank shall, if it deter-
mines that the intended award would be inconsistent with the Guide-
lines or this Schedule, promptly inform the Borrower and state the
reasons for such determination.
(c) The terms and conditions of the contract shall not,
without the Bank's concurrence, materially differ from those on
which bids were asked or prequalification invited.
(d) Two conformed copies of the contract shall be furnished
to the Bank promptly after its execution and prior to the submis-
sion to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of funds
from the Loan Account in respect of such contract.
3.   With respect to each contract to be financed out of the pro-
ceeds of the Loan and not governed by the preceding paragraph,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, promptly after its execu-


﻿- 39 -
tion and prior to the submission to the Bank of the first appli-
cation for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect
