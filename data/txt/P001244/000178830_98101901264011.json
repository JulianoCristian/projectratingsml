plantations on land set aside\n            as government-owned forest reserves. Specifically, the\n            Project will, over six years: (i) establish 38,000 ha sawlog\n            and 8,000 ha for pulpwood plantations; and (ii) assist in\n            further development through weeding, pruning and thinning of\n            120,000 ha of established plantations. Forest roads will be\n            established and upgraded, headquarter facilities built and\n            workers' quarters built or improved. The project will\n            also provide for studies on the social, economic, and\n            environmental implications of the current forest development\n            program. Some nine man-years of technical assistance will\n            also be included."}, "docdt": "1975-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
