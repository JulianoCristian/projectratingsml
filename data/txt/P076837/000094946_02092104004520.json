Country\n            Assistance Strategy (CAS), the National Community\n            Development Project aims at providing basic services, and\n            creating temporary employment opportunities for the poorest\n            groups in Jamaica. To this end, several subprojects have\n            been identified as priority by these communities for funding\n            by the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF). The project\n            components include: 1) financing of demand-driven, and\n            community-implemented socioeconomic infrastructure works,\n            and activities, through subprojects that include\n            construction, and rehabilitation of basic infrastructure,\n            and social super-structure facilities. Community assessments\n            will be implemented, to ensure appropriate skills (or\n            ability to acquire skills), and resources availability to\n            manage the proposed community-contracted works; 2) financing\n            for technical assistance, training, and strengthening\n            programs to JSIF, and the various entities to be involved in\n            the project, particularly to support the Community Based\n            Contracting (CBC) system. Financing will also be provided\n            for additional consultants to support implementation of\n            community contracting; and, 3) funding for goods required to\n            facilitate subproject supervision, monitoring, and community training."}, "docdt": "2002-09-11T00:00:00Z"}
