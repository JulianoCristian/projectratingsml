"Most of the negative environmental\n            impacts associated with sub-projects in the National\n            Community Development Project for Jamaica are likely to\n            occur during construction and rehabilitative works on roads,\n            buildings, drainage, and water and sanitation projects and\n            where designs are inadequate. These tend to be minor and are\n            easily identified and mitigated and determination of the\n            potential impact forms and integral part of the analysis of\n            the technical feasibility of the projects. Dust and noise\n            should be minimized; when sand is used to fill in land or to\n            level a site, it must be capped with clay turf, whenever\n            possible, otherwise, spray the area with water to minimize\n            dust; limit work to daylight hours and warn residents when\n            blasting occurs; use silt screens and straw devices to\n            prevent siltation of watercourses; minimize tree clearing\n            and other vegetation; dispose of waste in approved\n            dumpsites. Negative impacts will also occur during operation\n            particularly regarding disposal of solid and sewage waste,\n            where there are improper operational and maintenance\n            procedures in place."}, "docdt": "2002-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
