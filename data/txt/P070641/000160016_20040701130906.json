{"cdata!": "Project ratings are as follows: Project\n            outcome is satisfactory, sustainability is likely,\n            institutional development impact is substantial, Bank\n            performance is satisfactory, and borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. Among the lessons learned are: 1. Strategic\n            timing and support to government in a critical situation can\n            be at least as important as its specific technical content.\n            2. Complex reforms, such as those supported, are liable to\n            require mid-course adjustments and can thus be best\n            supported with the Bank's programmatic instrument.\n            3.The design of tax reforms in federalist countries requires\n            careful political economy analysis regarding winners and\n            losers and adjustment to design to make reforms politically\n            viable. 4. Economic adjustments in economies with high\n            indexed debt require careful coordination of fiscal,\n            monetary and debt management policies. 5. Other lessons\n            concerned adopting counter-cyclical fiscal policies that\n            take into account the indebtedness level; the need to\n            consider that concentrated market structures and certain\n            shortcomings in the fund industry limit the speed at which\n            risks can be prudently transferred from the government\n            balance; and the need to adopt a more conservative approach\n            to the depth of the proposed changes in the tax system when\n            the government is operating in an environment of tough\n            fiscal effort and economic stagnation."}, "docdt": "2004-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
