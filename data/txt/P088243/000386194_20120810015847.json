Some lessons learned includes: financial\n            sector reforms are relatively easy to design but difficult\n            to implement. Successful implementation depends on two\n            crucial factors: the commitment of the authorities to the\n            reform program; and the effectiveness of project\n            supervision. The Egyptian authorities have shown a strong\n            commitment to the multi-year reform program that was\n            designed by the reformist government that was appointed in\n            2004. The reform program did not include the privatization\n            of the two largest commercial banks nor the large insurance\n            companies. However, many measures were taken to improve the\n            management of these institutions, which one commentator\n            resembled to an effective 'privatization of\n            management' rather than 'privatization of\n            ownership'. A dogmatic approach to the ownership\n            question would not be justified, especially after the public\n            rescue of so many leading private banks and insurance\n            companies in high-income countries during the 2008 global\n            financial crisis. Policy based operations may require strong\n            Bank technical assistance efforts as part of the process,\n            particularly in the financial sector. Multi-trenched\n            financial sector adjustment operations are effective\n            instruments to support major financial sector reforms.\n            Achievements under the operations three policy areas thus\n            contributed substantially to the overall development outcome\n            sought by the operation: strengthen the enabling legal and\n            institutional environment for financial intermediation and\n            risk management and to increase the role and participation\n            of the private sector in the provision of financial\n            services. The most relevant lesson of this project is\n            perhaps the importance of the ownership of the reform\n            program by the authorities and their strong commitment to\n            its success. This is underscored by the second component of\n            the operation concerning the restructuring of the ailing\n            specialized public financial institutions. The key lesson\n            from these two projects was the importance of the commitment\n            of the authorities to the reform program, which was most\n            evident prior to and during the project. Without this strong\n            and effective commitment, such significant results could not\n            have been achieved."}, "docdt": "2012-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
