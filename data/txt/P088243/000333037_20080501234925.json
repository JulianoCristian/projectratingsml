the Financial Sector\n            Development Policy Loan Project for Morocco were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: an efficient\n            cooperation between the project team and the country office\n            team can lower the operational cost of a project. The\n            supervision cost of this operation was reduced thanks to the\n            quality of dialogue between the country office team and the\n            project team but also between the country office team and\n            the borrower. Regular e-mails and phone conversations\n            between the parties were sufficient to monitor the progress\n            in implementation therefore management agreed with the team\n            that a last supervision mission was not needed so long as\n            the team continued in its dialogue to ensure that all steps\n            to the reforms were taken. The success of a reform program\n            is due not only to legal measures taken, but also to the\n            strengthening of the capacity of the institutions involved\n            in the reform. The success of an operation cannot be left to\n            commitment and goodwill alone. In the present operation, it\n            was essential to ensure the institutional capacity of the\n            banking and insurance supervisors to implement their\n            component of the reform. Therefore a detailed action plan\n            was prepared before appraisal and a high level of\n            consultation took place during the drafting of the bulk of\n            the regulations reflected in the policy matrix."}, "docdt": "2008-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
