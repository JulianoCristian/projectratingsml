                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Most activities are now completed. The project has helped finance community-driven infrastructure investments related to roads, drainage, irrigation, water supply, sanitation, waste
                         disposal, power supply, and other services in 95% of the urban wards (kelurahans) in Indonesia. It has also strengthened community participation both directly and indirectly,
                         including by women and the poor, in community groups and through the elected boards responsible for local planning and decision making. However, there are likely to be moderate
                         shortcomings in the achievement of some outcome targets, particularly in terms of levels of local government cost-sharing and the performance of community-managed Revolving
                         Loan Funds (RLFs).
