satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            helped mainstream local government involvement in program\n            nasional pemberdayaan masyarakat (PNPM) in urban areas, and\n            demonstrated that financial incentives, coupled with\n            intensive socialization and training of local government\n            officials and their consultants, are an effective means to\n            create a sustained interest on the part of local governments\n            in planning and co-financing small-scale infrastructure\n            projects for and together with communities. To improve the\n            participation rate of the poor, it is necessary to spend\n            substantial time on socialization and community training. It\n            was found that community participation for neighborhood\n            development (ND) was more limited than in regular program\n            primarily because of the perceived complexity of planning at\n            a higher spatial scale, and therefore requires intensive\n            facilitation. The ND program provided relatively large block\n            grant amounts to slum areas, resulting in a better targeting\n            of the poor. There is no single optimal approach to\n            preventing misuse of funds. Instead, multiple approaches at\n            multiple layers should be promoted. In livelihoods programs,\n            members of a group are required to meet certain conditions,\n            such as a minimum about of regular saving, internal lending\n            and bookkeeping, before they are permitted to borrow."}, "docdt": "2015-06-19T13:30:02Z"}
