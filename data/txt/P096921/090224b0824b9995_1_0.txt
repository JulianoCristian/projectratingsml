                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Most activities have now been completed. The project has helped finance community-driven infrastructure investments related to roads, drainage, irrigation, water supply, sanitation,
                         waste disposal, power supply, and other services in 95% of the urban wards (kelurahans) in Indonesia. It has also strengthened community participation both directly and indirectly,
                         including by women and the poor, in community groups and through the elected boards responsible for local planning and decision making. However, there are likely to be moderate
                         shortcomings in the achievement of some outcome targets, particularly in terms of performance of community-managed Revolving Loan Funds (RLFs). All major activities are
                         expected to be completed by the project's closing date, which has been extended to December 31, 2014.
