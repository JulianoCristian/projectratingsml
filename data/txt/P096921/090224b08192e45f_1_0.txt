                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Most activities are now completed. The project has helped finance community-driven infrastructure investments related to roads, drainage, irrigation, water supply, sanitation, waste
                         disposal, power supply, and other services in 95% of the urban wards (kelurahans) in Indonesia. It also strengthened community participation both directly and indirectly, including by
                         women and the poor, in community groups and through the elected boards responsible for local planning and decision making. However, there are likely to be moderate shortcomings
                         in achievement of some outcome targets, particularly in terms of levels of local government cost-sharing and performance of community-managed revolving loan funds.
