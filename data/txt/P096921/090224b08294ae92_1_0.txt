Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 PNPM Urban and Additional Financing activities in around 8,800 urban wards have now been completed. Most of the Key Performance Indicators have
 been achieved. The Kelurahan Grants had been utilized for Infrastructure (80%), economic RLFs (10%), and social activities (10%). The project has
 helped building the community infrastructure, including 12,865 km of small roads, 3,914 km of drainage and irrigation canals, reconstruction and
 rehabilitation of 57,413 improper houses of the poorest, 62,318 units of solid waste and sanitation facilities, 2,448 units of community and health
 facilities, and 86,100 economic activities through revolving loan funds. Furthermore, the project has also strengthened community participation both
 directly and indirectly, in community groups and the elected board of trustee. However, there are likely to be moderate shortcomings in the achievement
 of some targeted results, particularly in terms of participation rate of the poorest and vulnerable community members in planning and decision making
 meetings, and the performance of community-managed Revolving Loan Funds (RLFs). The government continues following up the shortcomings
 through capacity buildings for the communities supported by the on-going PNPM Urban 2012-2015.
