                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation is on track and the project is making good progress toward the development objectives. The project has helped to improve socio-economic conditions by financing
                         community infrastructure investments related to roads, drainage, water supply, sanitation, and other services in 95% of the urban wards (kelurahans) in Indonesia. However, the
                         project might not fully achieve some goals related to strengthening community participation and local governance, construction quality of some works, levels of community cost
                         sharing, and the performance of community revolving loan funds.
