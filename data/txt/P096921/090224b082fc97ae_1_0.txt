1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
From the late 1960s until the mid-1990s, Indonesia experienced a sustained and uninterrupted
reduction in poverty. The share of the population below the national poverty line dropped from over
40% in 1976 to less than 12% in 1996. However, the East Asian financial crisis, which started in July
1997, wiped out much of these gains. By 1998, the poverty rate had doubled to over 24%, and the
number of Indonesians living below the poverty line increased to almost 50 million. The financial
crisis did not only cause economic hardship but also led to greater demand for public participation in
government affairs, both by individual citizens and by sub-national governments. In 1999, the
National Parliament passed two new decentralization laws, partially in response to the effect of the
crisis on Indonesia's political landscape. These laws shifted many responsibilities for government
affairs from the center to the provincial and district (kota and kabupaten) governments, and also pro-
vided these sub-national governments with the financing needed to implement their newfound
responsibilities.
Against this background, the Government of Indonesia (GoI) created a national development
program (Program Pembangunan Nasional or PROPENAS) for 2000-2004 aimed at increased public
participation, improved governance, and economic recovery. The economic recovery program
prioritized poverty alleviation and the development of a community-based economic system.
PROPENAS 2000-2004 emphasized the need to establish partnerships between government,
communities and the private sector, and to increase efforts to overcome poverty and social
instabilities. To help achieve these objectives, the Bank assisted GoI with the implementation of a
series of poverty reduction projects, initially consisting of the Urban Poverty Project (UPP) series in
urban areas and Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) series in rural areas. Implementation of the
first UPP and KDP was commenced in 1998.
In 2007, GoI launched the National Program for Community Empowerment, which is better known
by its Indonesian acronym PNPM (Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat). PNPM was
established as the operational umbrella for all community-based development (CDD) programs in the
country, including the KDP and UPP series. An inter-ministerial working group (Kelompok Kerja
Pengendali PNPM Mandiri or “Tim Pengendali”) provides oversight of PNPM at the national level.
The group is chaired by the Coordinating Minister for Community Welfare and its members include
representatives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the National Planning Board (BAPPENAS), the
Ministry of Finance, and relevant line ministries.
Rationale for Bank involvement. In 2008, the Bank had financed––or was financing––CDD
programs in urban areas through three projects: UPP1, UPP2, and UPP3 (Table 1). This ICR covers
PNPM Urban (“the project”), which was mainly a continuation of UPP2 and UPP3 to help
consolidate PNPM as a national program. The project would cover 7,800 wards (kelurahans) in all
provinces of Indonesia, about 7,250 of which were already covered by its predecessor projects.
PNPM Urban not only addressed GoI’s development objectives, but was also fully consistent with
the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2004-2007, which aimed at sustaining economic
recovery, promoting broad-based growth, and delivering better public services for the poor.1

    The strategy was in place during most of the project preparation period, and was extended to also cover 2008. The
    CAS was superseded by the Country Partnership Strategy for 2009-2012.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective and Key Performance Indicators
The PAD stated the project development objective (PDO) as “to ensure that the urban poor in PNPM
Urban locations benefit from improved socio-economic and local governance conditions”. The PDO
in the legal agreements was identical.

Key Indicators
1. Improved households expenditure rates or improved access to economic and social services in
   7,800 kelurahans (wards) in 2009,
2. Infrastructure built is 20% less expensive than that built by non-community based approaches in
   80% of participating kelurahans, and
3. 80% satisfaction levels from beneficiaries regarding improved services and local level
   governance (impacts taken from representative sample).
Intermediate results indicators
The PAD identified 14 results indicators, aimed at measuring intermediate results in the three
components described in Section 1.5 (indicators are in brackets):
1. Organized community groups increasingly voice demands and local governments deliver
   improved services to the urban poor (participation rate of the poorest and vulnerable community
   members in planning and decision-making meetings, participation rate of women in planning and
   decision-making meetings, percentages of adult population voting in elections for Community
   Trustee Boards––Badan Keswadayaan Masyarakat or BKM––at the neighborhood level,
   percentage of kelurahans with BKM formation, percentage of kelurahans with Community
   Development Plans completed and ratified, percentage of local governments providing cost-
   sharing of at least 20%).
2. BKMs deliver improved services to the poor (number and type of infrastructure, economic, and
   social activities completed, percentage of infrastructure works evaluated as of good quality,
   percentage of kelurahans with revolving loan funds having a loans at risk ratio ≥ 3 months of less
   than 10%, percentage of kelurahans with revolving loan funds having a cost coverage ratio
   exceeding 125%, percentage of kelurahans with revolving loan funds having an annualized
   return on investment exceeding 10%, participation rate of women as member of community
   groups).


                                                 13
3. Consultants provide technical assistance and implementation support to the project (percentage of
   oversight consultants providing timely and accurate data through the MIS, percentage of BKMs
   with completed annual financial audits).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators
The PDO and the three outcome indicators remained unchanged during project implementation.
However, upon approval of the Additional Financing (see Section 1.7), the target for outcome
indicator #1 “Improved households expenditure rates or improved access to economic and social
services in 7,800 kelurahans (wards) in 2009” was revised in three respects:
1. Change in overall target. The number of kelurahans to be covered by the project was increased
   from 7,800 to 9,457.2
2. Change in calculation of target. The targeted number of kelurahans with improved household
   expenditure rates or improved access to services was no longer set as an absolute number, but as
   a percentage of the total number of participating kelurahans. The target was set at 80%, which
   was deemed more realistic that the 100% used in the PAD. As a result, the original project would
   need to achieve the target in 6,240 kelurahans, and the additional financing would need to
   achieve the target in 4,900 kelurahans.3
3. Change in target year. The year in which the revised target should be achieved was moved from
   2009 to 2011 in line with the shift of the closing date.
The revised outcome indicator #1 was therefore as follows: “Improved households expenditure rates
or improved access to economic and social services in 80% participating kelurahans (wards) in
2011”. Performance against this indicator, as well as against all other outcome and intermediate
results indicators, was monitored separately for kelurahans financed by the original loan and credit
and for kelurahans financed from the proceeds of the AF.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The originally intended primary beneficiaries of the project consisted of some 13.8 million poor
persons living in 7,800 target kelurahans located in 33 provinces. The population of these kelurahans
would benefit both directly and indirectly from improved community infrastructure and services,
grant assistance for poorest and most vulnerable groups (such as scholarships and training courses),
and improved access to microcredit––all planned and implemented through a community-driven
development (CDD) process. Secondary beneficiaries would be: (i) the Directorate General of
Human Settlements in the Ministry of Public Works (MPW, the implementing agency), which would
benefit from increased capacity, (ii) ward-level facilitators and partner agencies providing
implementation support, (iii) the kabupaten and kota governments in which the 7,800 target
kelurahans were located, who would benefit from training, field studies, and institutional
strengthening aimed at improving their planning capabilities, and (iv) Community Trustee Boards,
which would benefit from technical assistance and advisory services in the process of establishing
and strengthening their role in channeling CDD funds to appropriate community activities and
investments.

2
 There were about 4,600 repeated kelurahans. The total number of participating kelurahans was therefore (7869 +
6168 –4,600 =) 9,457.
3
    The figures were calculated as follows: 80% x 7,800 = 6,240, and 80% x 6,168 = 4,934. The latter figure was
    rounded off to 4,900. The total of (7,800+4,900=12,700 is higher than 9,457 because of overlapping kelurahans.


                                                          14
1.5 Original Components
Component 1: Community and Local Government Capacity Building. Project Cost: US$31.62
million (100% Bank financing)
This component would fund the cost of facilitators to carry out social intermediation activities,
training, workshops, press releases/conferences, and other mass communication activities, meetings
and focus group discussions, and production of socialization materials and publications. This
component would also support the training and socialization of local government staff on PNPM and
leverage support from local governments to share costs of subprojects. Taken together, these
activities would help ensure that infrastructure subprojects financed by Component 2 would be less
expensive than those realized by non-community based approaches and that beneficiaries would be
satisfied with improved services and local level governance.

Component 2: Kelurahan Grants and Sub-loans. Project Cost: US$248.92 million (52% Bank
financing)
To improve access to economic and social services, this component would provide block grants to
participating kelurahans to finance activities identified in Community Development Plans (CDPs),
including: (i) specific high-priority infrastructure investments, (ii) microcredit loans channeled
through community-managed revolving loan funds (RLFs), and (iii) direct assistance through social
programs for the benefit of the poorest and most vulnerable groups or individuals to pay for
scholarships, health care, training and similar activities. Kelurahan grants would not finance activities
on the project’s negative list, such as weapons, religious buildings or governm ent offices. Each
participating kelurahan would receive a one-time block grant of IDR 150 million to IDR 350 million
to finance investments in one or more of the above categories, in accordance with their community
development plans (with a maximum allocation of 30% to RLFs for newly participating kelurahans
and 20% to well-performing RLFs in other kelurahans). The block grant amount would depend on
the population of the kelurahan.

Component 3: Implementation and Technical Assistance. Project Cost: US$23.51 million (67%
Bank financing)
The project would be managed by a Project Management Unit (PMU) in MPW. The project would
finance consultants and facilitators to assist in project implementation. Technical assistance (TA)
would be provided through National Management Consultants (NMC) at the central level, and
Oversight Consultant (OC) teams at the province level, with OC offices in the participating district
governments, and facilitators and community cadres at the kelurahan level. In addition, this compo-
nent would finance the project’s monitoring and evaluation program, and a complaints handling
system to help ensure that the local governance aspect of the PDO would be achieved.

1.6 Revised Components
The components remained unchanged during project implementation.


1.7 Other significant changes
Additional financing. On May 1, 2009, the Bank approved an IBRD Loan of US$115 million for
Additional Financing (AF) to scale up the project geographically and enhance its impact. The AF
would be consistent with the PNPM Urban objectives and design. The proceeds of the AF would be
used to provide supplemental block grants to 4,593 kelurahans already supported by UPP2, UPP3 or



                                                   15
PNPM Urban itself, and to 1,575 kelurahans not previously covered by any of these projects. The AF
would also finance community and local government capacity building and implementation and TA
to support investments in the 6,168 additional kelurahans, incorporate awareness of disaster risk
management and emergency preparedness in the community socialization process, and institute
enhancements to the RLF component to make it more sustainable.
The original financing agreements were amended to extend the closing date by nine months to
December 31, 2011 (the same closing date as the AF) and to revise the target of one of the project’s
three outcome indicators (see Section 1.3). Since GoI had decided that PNPM Urban would only
receive block grant funding on an annual basis, it was not possible for it to commit to a longer
closing date, even though it was anticipated that the new closing date would not be sufficient to
complete the additional activities in full. The AF was estimated to reach about 8.5 million primary
beneficiaries, thereby increasing the total number of beneficiaries to 22.3 million. (The number of
kelurahans and beneficiaries mentioned in this paragraph refer to Bank-financed locations only; they
do not include locations co-financed by IDB.)
Other significant changes. Other important changes improvements that during project
implementation were the integration of all NMCs into a single NMC, the decentralization of
operations to 19 provincial working units in charge of overseeing project implementation and
managing the 4,500 kelurahan facilitators, and improved protocols for disbursement of block grants
to the BKM bank accounts.

* Totals may not add up due to rounding off

Parallel financing. In 2009, GoI wished to increase the total financing for the project by about
US$ 269 million (Table 2). GoI would provide additional funds of about US$75 million from its own
resources, and US$115 million in Additional Financing would be provided by the Bank. This left a
financing gap of US$79 million, for which GoI requested financing from the Islamic Development
Bank. GoI decided that IDB would cover the 14 westernmost provinces (consisting of DKI Jakarta,
West Java, Banten, West Kalimantan, Riau Islands, Bangka-Belitung and all eight provinces on the




                                                16
island of Sumatra). The utilization of the IBRD Loans and IDA Credit would be confined to the
remaining 19 provinces, instead of to all 33 provinces in the country (as originally envisaged). 4
Further closing date extensions. The closing date of the financing agreements was revised two
more times, as follows:
 As anticipated, the time was not sufficient to complete the additional activities financed from the
   AF. On December 12, 2011, the Bank extended the closing date of both PNPM Urban and AF by
   18 months, from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013. The Bank also approved a reallocation of
   about US$34 million from kelurahan grants (for which GoI had already secured funding from
   other sources) to goods and consultants’ services in order to finance community facilitators and
   consultant services to support the implementation of CDPs in 2012.
 Shortly before the revised closing date, about US$25 million in AF for kelurahan grants
   remained undisbursed. Since GoI had some funds in their annual budget remaining that had to be
   used by the end of the fiscal year, GoI gave priority to the use of these funds over external funds,
   which necessitated a loan extension. GoI requested to use these funds for the further development
   of the Neighborhood Development (ND) scheme (see Section 2.2 for details). In response to this
   request, on June 28, 2013 the Bank extended the closing date of the AF by an additional 18
   months to December 31, 2014 and reallocated part of the loan funds for kelurahan grants to the
   expenditure category goods and consultants’ services.5
As a result of AF and extensions, the project closed almost four years later than originally planned.

Neighborhood Development (ND) and Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant (PAPG). The
PNPM Urban and Additional Financing supported two advanced programs that were first piloted
under UPP2 and UPP3, and which have since become an integral part of PNPM (see Annex 2 for
details). ND targeted slum areas and involved the development of integrated spatial plans designed
with extensive community participation. It provided larger, more concentrated investments than
regular block grant amounts to improve the impact of infrastructure spending. PAPG provided
matching grants to local governments, which then worked together with BKMs to develop tertiary as
well as connecting infrastructure between kelurahans (refer to Annex 2 for details on NG and PAPG)
It is important to note that both ND and PAPG were based on PNPM’s core components (block
grants for infrastructure, economic and social activities implemented by communities with the help
of facilitators).6

2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
Soundness of background analysis. The design of PNPM Urban was based on UPP2 and UPP3,
which were being successfully implemented at appraisal, but with several modifications to reflect
lessons learned from their implementation. The most important of these lessons were the following:
(i) build institutional sustainability through active involvement of local governments, (ii) make future
kelurahan grant payments contingent upon collection of delinquent RLF loans, (iii) close poorly

4
  In October 2012, the province of North Kalimantan was created. Project activities in this 34th province were co-
  financed by the Bank, not by IDB.
5
  It was not practical to finance ND development from the proceeds of loans for the successor project PNPM Urban
  III because this project used different fund channeling methods.
6
  For more information about these advanced programs, refer to Section 2.2 and Annex 2.


                                                        17
performing RLFs, (iv) improve the role of NMCs in capacity building, and (v) build sustainable
oversight and monitoring functions at community level (see PAD, pp. 8-9).
Assessment of project design. The PDO was relevant and corresponded to GoI’s own plans and
priorities. The components and implementation arrangements were well designed, realistic, and not
overly complex, having been largely adapted from proven approaches developed under the UPP
series. The components were also likely to result in the achievement of the PDO: through the
provision of kelurahan grants and sub-loans, Component 2 would improve access to economic and
social services in project locations. Components 1 and 3 would provide capacity building and
oversight aimed at improving local governance conditions to ensure that the economic and social
services would be provided in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. The results framework is
deemed adequate; it consisted of a relatively small number of well-defined and relevant performance
indicators. However, a weakness of the results framework was the lack of an indicator that measured
increases in access to services or household expenditure rates (the results framework simply
measured the number of kelurahan where an increase was reported). It is worth noting that GoI
wished to develop a uniform monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for both PNPM Urban
and PNPM Rural (although differences continue to persist, the design of the framework was
influenced by this policy objective). The social and environmental safeguards policies applied were
based on policies used for UPPs, and safeguards measures put in place were deemed adequate.
Adequacy of Government commitment, stakeholder involvement, and participatory processes.
GoI’s commitment to the project was strong and involved stakeholders at central as well as local
level. GoI prepared the project in accordance with a roadmap for the development of the nationwide
PNPM until 2015. This roadmap was prepared with the involvement of stakeholders at the central
and local levels, including NGOs and community-based organizations. The former President Soesilo
Bambang Yudhoyono also issued a decree to make all planning, budgeting, implementation, manage-
ment and funding mechanisms for PNPM projects subject to a single set of operational guidelines,
and a single overarching management structure.
Assessment of risks and risk mitigation measures. The overall project risk was rated “moderate” .
The risks assessment and mitigation measures were generally on target, and while some were more
successfully mitigated than others, there were no unanticipated risks or missed opportunities for
mitigation that seriously limited achievement of project outcomes.

2.2 Implementation
Regular program.
The project provided grants for small-scale infrastructure and social programs in just over 9,500
kelurahan in 19 provinces, and financed RLFs in the majority of these. About 78% of all kelurahan
grants were invested in physical infrastructure. The rest of the funds were used for social programs
(12%) and RLFs (10%).
The technical quality of construction was consistently rated as good, while the cost of construction
was at least 20% lower compared to local government contractors in the vast majority of the
participating kelurahans.7 The social programs cover training courses and other social programs
(including aid to the elderly, health care, additional nutrition for children of poor, scholarships
for young and disadvantaged students. The quantitative study shows that about 35% of social

7
    Technical quality was measured annually through spot checks by NMC and OCs, and also covered by surveys
    conducted by PT. Shiddiq Sarana Mulya in 2009, and the RAND Corporation in 2011 (see Annex 9).


                                                       18
program beneficiaries perceived the social program as very useful, and 61% as useful. About
69% BKMs interviewed manage to continue providing social grants. The RLFs were less
successful than anticipated even though a new strategy was adopted to improve the performance of
RLFs.
The project also financed the consultant and facilitators to help communities plan and implement the
infrastructure, social and RLF programs, provided training and capacity building to communities and
local governments. The AF also financed modules on community-based disaster risk management
and mainstreamed tools for reducing vulnerabilities against disaster risk and strengthening the role of
women in decision-making processes. The quality of project facilitation was not always consistent
but certainly sufficient to meet minimum standards. The implementing agency worked diligently to
meet challenging output targets and significant capacity was built at the community and local
government level.
Advanced programs.

   Neighborhood Development (ND). The program provided a bigger grant than regular kelurahan
    grants, for the planning and implementation of larger scale infrastructure. Because of their
    complexity, ND locations required more facilitation and collaboration with local government.
    During project implementation, ND was expanded from 18 to 255 kelurahans.

   Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant (PAPG). This was a matching grant to local governments
    for financing poverty alleviation subprojects that were: (i) too big to be funded by regular
    kelurahan grants or required local government involvement, (ii) located in more than one
    kelurahan, (iii) not on the negative list for kelurahan grants, and (iv) jointly prepared, proposed
    and implemented by BKMs in collaboration with local governments. The project supported
    PAPG especially to enhance its sustainability in PAPG cities, such as facilitating cities that
    replicated PAPG from their own funding.

Factors outside the control of the government or the implementation agency
There were no factors outside the control of the Borrower or implementing agency with a material
impact on the performance of the project.
Factors subject to the control of the government or the implementation agency
Positive factors
   Strong political commitment. The project was able to secure support at the highest levels of
    government. Virtually all participating district governments co-financed part of the project cost
    from their own resources, and a substantial minority provided funds over and above the minimum
    required amount. GOI also leveraged the project to deliver other programs, such as the
    Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector Project funded by the Asian Development Bank
    (ADB), for slum upgrading and post-disaster community-based housing.
   Streamlined management. During implementation, the implementing agency integrated all NMCs
    into a single NMC, reduced the number of OC contracts from 36 to 9, and decentralized
    operations to 19 provincial working units in charge of overseeing project implementation and
    managing kelurahan facilitators. The implementing agency also required all development
    partners (in this case the Bank and IDB) to support PNPM in urban areas through the same
    platform. As mentioned in Section 1.7, IDB financed PNPM in urban areas in 14 provinces not



                                                  19
    covered by the Bank, and therefore operated independently from the Bank, albeit using the same
    standard operating procedures.
   Streamlined eligibility criteria. Starting in 2009, the implementing agency disallowed the use of
    block grants for charity and requested that all block grants be invested in economically
    sustainable activities. The implementing agency also encouraged the use of block grants for
    larger and more focused investment for infrastructure to increase the project’s impact on po verty
    alleviation.
   Flexibility. From the start of implementation, the implementing agency and the Bank were wil-
    ling to modify the design of the project in response to changing circumstances (by, for example,
    providing basic technical assistance to kelurahans covered by earlier UPPs to enhance their
    sustainability after project closure, and mainstreaming tools for reducing vulnerabilities against
    disaster risk). The CDD design of the block grant component and flexibility in its implementation
    also allowed the communities to allocate available funds where it mattered most to them. GoI and
    the Bank also prepared and approved the AF to help scale up the project and modify the design to
    enhance its effectiveness.
   Effective anti-corruption strategy. See Section 2.4 for details.

Negative factors
   Delays in disbursement. At the central level, there were delays in disbursement of funds,
    especially for payment of consultants and facilitators. These delays only occurred in the first
    quarter of each financial year because of late issuance of supporting documents for the annual
    budget document. This problem was beyond the control of the implementing agency and affected
    projects other than PNPM Urban.
   Weaknesses in financial planning. At the beginning of every fiscal year, the Parliament approved
    an annual budget ceiling for PNPM Urban. The budget would be financed from GoI’s own
    resources, supplemented with financing from the Bank (and, in a later stage, IDB). During the
    project implementation period, the budget ceiling was routinely set too low, which necessitated a
    budget revision in the second half of the fiscal year. In some years, the budget revision was
    approved too late to spend the full amount of GoI and Bank funds planned for that year.
   Problems with assessing fiscal capacity. At appraisal, local governments classified by the
    Ministry of Finance (MoF) as having high fiscal capacity were required to provide at least 50%
    cost sharing, while other local governments were required to provide 20%. As a result of
    inaccurate calculations and an initial overestimation of local government’s capacity, some local
    governments were unable to provide the required counterpart funding. In 2012, MoF revised cost
    sharing percentages to 20% and 5% respectively. After the revision, virtually all local
    governments provided the minimum required cost sharing.
   Constraints to improving RLF performance. The RLF strategy did not yield the positive results
    expected, mainly because of limited capacity of communities to manage RLFs (see Annex 2 for
    details). The performance of RLFs continued to deteriorate, in spite of restrictions on eligibility
    for block grants and measures aimed at improving repayment and sustainability.

Mid-term review. In December 2010, the Bank conducted a mid-term review, about one year behind
the original schedule (January 2010). The review resulted in a series of recommendations, the most
important of which can be summarized as follows:


                                                   20
   consistently apply identical policies for the implementation of PNPM Urban in areas covered by
    the Bank and by IDB,
   recruit facilitators using multi-year contracts to improve efficiency and ensure continuity of
    facilitation in the field,
   ensure that local governments fulfill their commitments to provide counterpart funds,
   improve effectiveness of complaints handling mechanism to minimize misuse of funds (see
    Section 2.4 for details),
   increase the involvement of local governments in ND and improve the selection criteria to ensure
    that ND grants benefit kelurahans most in need; the involvement of local governments was
    important to ensure compatibility of ND with the local development plans and also helped secure
    commitment (see Annex 2 for details), and
   modify the strategy to improve RLF performance, especially through more frequent spot checks,
    and improve targeting of the poor.
At the closing date, the implementing agency had implemented most of the above recommendations
except multi-year contracting of facilitators.
Effectiveness of risk mitigation. Risk assessment and mitigation measures were generally well
defined and effective. The key identified risks were: (i) constraints to the management capacity of
MPW for the scaled up program, (ii) delays caused by cost-sharing arrangements with local
governments, and (iii) insufficient budgets approved by parliament to meet full funding for PNPM
Urban were well mitigated during implementation. However, risks related to delays in budget
releases, delays in procurement of consulting services, and poor performance of RLFs were not
mitigated as successfully as expected, though these shortcomings did not fundamentally undermine
achievement of the project outcome.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Rating: Substantial
The project measured progress against key performance indicators (KPIs) using a management
information system (MIS), augmented by a series of qualitative and quantitative surveys and the
results of regular supervision missions.
(a) M&E design. M&E was based on a results framework that consisted of a series of well-
defined and realistic outcome and intermediate results indicators, with plausible time-bound targets
for each indicator. The exception was the PDO level indicator that measured increases in access to
services and household expenditure rates which should have been defined to measure actual increases
towards achieving these objectives instead of merely counting the number of kelurahans where an
increase was observed. At appraisal, a comprehensive management information system was in place
to monitor and evaluate UPPs. The same system would be used to monitor and evaluate the
implementation of PNPM Urban through the measurement of most indicators in the results
framework. In addition, the PAD listed a series of spot checks, surveys and studies that would be
undertaken during project implementation to complement the data to be collected by the MIS, and
evaluate the outcomes of the project. It is worth noting that since 2008, when PNPM Urban became a
national program, it was no longer possible to compare the performance of participating kelurahans
with a control group of non-participating kelurahans.
(b) M&E implementation. In general, the monitoring of the project was well implemented
through the MIS, spot-checking by consultants, and by the complaints handling system (complaints
could be submitted via the project website, by phone, text message or in writing). The MIS and


                                                21
website gradually evolved into an integrated and user-friendly information system (also recording,
inter alia, payment advice from the State Treasury office, detailed RLF performance records, and
audit findings). Data quality improved over time. In addition, the Bank team together with the
Government also established a teleconference supervision system, which significantly expanded
supervision coverage. The project financed several studies and evaluations, including a quantitative
evaluation of PNPM Urban (see Annex 5 for details), a rapid assessment of gender-sensitive CDD
and disaster risk management, and a rapid appraisal of the ND scheme. Unfortunately, several
evaluations were of a qualitative nature or assessed perceptions (as opposed to facts) and were
therefore of limited use in helping to measure progress against key indicators. Also, the preparation
of most studies took longer and started later than envisaged.
(c) M&E utilization. The data collected by the MIS and the monitoring of progress helped the
project stakeholders at central as well as local level to: (i) identify and remedy quality problems and
incorporate better controls as the project progressed, (ii) fine-tune the targeting of resources to the
areas with the greatest needs and to help achieve the greatest impacts, and (iii) ensure transparency
and strengthen public confidence in the openness and fairness of the project. Significantly, the Bank
and implementing agency agreed to consider only data entered into the MIS as relevant for
monitoring and evaluation purposes. The project also shared common data with other CDD projects
through the MIS under the umbrella of PNPM that provides a reference for ministries to identify
active projects and allocate resources. By closing, the project’s website did not only provid e access to
data on PNPM Urban itself, but also on the follow-up projects PNPM Urban III (Ln. 7866) and
PNPM Urban 2012-2015 (Ln. 8213). GoI is now using the MIS to monitor its nationwide CDD
program, which strongly suggests that the system will be sustainable in the long term. In 2009, the
World Bank selected the project website from 42 submissions in the category “most innovative use
of internet and cell phones” during the East Asia Pacific Innovation Days. Since 2011, the website
has also been used to distribute training and socialization materials. The system has since been
adopted for other projects in MPW.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguards. The project was classified as Environmental Category “B”, and overall complied with
the environmental and social safeguards requirements. Although some project activities triggered
safeguards related to environmental assessment (OD/BP 4.01), indigenous peoples (OD/BP 4.10) and
involuntary resettlement (OD/BP 4.12), none of these activities caused significant adverse impacts.
The safeguards frameworks documents were disclosed in Bahasa Indonesia and English. The
Indigenous Peoples Plan of this project was dated March 10, 2008 and disclosed on March 13,
2008. The Resettlement Plan was dated February 25, 2008 and disclosed on February 27, 2008. The
Environmental Assessment was dated December 14, 2007 and disclosed on March 13, 2008. The AF
did not trigger any additional safeguards.8 The project did not finance land acquisition, but did
receive voluntary land donations. Given the small size of the subprojects (the cost of which often did
not exceed US$2,000 equivalent), it was a priori expected that any adverse social and environmental
impacts of such subprojects would be small or negligible. Indeed, the project generated substantial
social and environmental benefits, especially through investments in drainage, water supply and sani-
tation. However, the recording of potential social and environmental impacts was initially poor,
especially with regards to voluntary land donations (VLD). The VLD documentation improved at the

8
    For the original financing agreements, two safeguard documents were disclosed: (i) Safeguards Policy Frame-
    works (Jakarta, 2008), and (ii) Indonesia National Program for Community Empowerment in Urban Areas Project:
    Additional Financing – Integrated Safeguards Data Sheets (Washington DC, 2009). After approval of the AF, a
    third safeguards document was disclosed locally: the Safeguards Frameworks PNPN Urban III (Jakarta, 2010).


                                                       22
final stages of project implementation. By the end of 2014, about 70% of sub-project proposals had
complete information about VLD. There was no independent monitoring of compliance with
safeguards, given the small, scattered nature of the interventions.


Fiduciary Compliance
Financial management. The project’s financial management generally complied with the Bank’s
minimum requirements under OP/BP10.02 and 13.20. Several mechanisms were put in place to
improve the financial management capacity of government, consultants, facilitators, local govern-
ments and communities, including training and coaching. At community level, a community-based
control was applied. This includes the facilitator’s review and certification of community reports,
establishment of oversight consultants, display of financial reports in public areas, and an extensive
complaints-handling system. Furthermore, community group financial statements were audited
annually by independent audit firms. The project received an unqualified opinion from an external
auditor in all years from 2009 to 2013, and the project’s financial management was generally accep-
table at closing. Also, the implementing agency ensured that local government auditors conducted
audits and followed up on their findings (which were recorded in the MIS). The involvement of local
government auditors helped increase the total audit coverage from 16% in 2009 to 34% in 2010 in
the 19 provinces covered by Bank financing, exceeding the target of 20% sample. However, the
project also encountered problems with financial management, primarily on RLF management,
delays in issuance of budget documents, and uneven capacity of the community and facilitators. The
project website has also been extensively used to support financial management.
Procurement. The project has generally complied with the World Bank’s Guidelines.9 Community
contracting worked well. Nonetheless, procurement remained moderately satisfactory throughout
project implementation, mainly because of avoidable delays in the recruitment of consultants. This
affected the quality of project implementation, such as mobilization of consultants and facilitators,
delayed distribution of socialization and training materials, and most importantly resulted in delays in
the training of facilitators and consultants. To overcome this problem, the Bank attempted to simplify
procurement procedures to avoid multiple amendments, and agreed to work with the same NMC and
OCs that have been working in the same areas, subject to performance evaluation. Also, rotation of
facilitators was minimized to allow for a more efficient procurement timeline, and online invoice
monitoring system has been developed and incorporated into the project website along with all
consultants’ contracts, which allow the consultants and government to monitor potential fiduciary
risks and invoice payment.
Compliance with Better Governance Action Plan. The project took steps to improve governance,
enhance transparency, and reduce opportunities for corruption and fraud. More specifically, the Bank
and the implementing agency agreed on a map of corruption risks and measures to mitigate such
risks. The areas of mapping consisted of procurement of consultants, project management, and
project implementation at community level which were regularly monitored and updated. A
comprehensive complaint handling mechanism was used to process inputs, complaints, and feedback
from the public by using project website, text-messaging (SMS), mail, telephone, or consultants
/facilitators. During 2008-2014, the PMU resolved 126,609 of 128,027 (99%) reported complaints10,

including 1,127 corruption complaints, and had recovered about US$1.5 million (67%) of misused
funds totaling an estimated US$2.3 million equivalent. Follow-up actions, including local govern-
ment coordination and withholding of funds distribution, proved effective in combating corruption.
The very low level of misuse of funds was confirmed by external audits of the project. To improve
transparency and reduce corruption, the project website publishes details on consultant contracts,
payment status of the consultants, audit results and follow-up actions, and BKM financial reports.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(a)     Transition arrangements. For infrastructure constructed, the project required the
establishment of an O&M committee at the neighborhood level, and that maintenance costs to be
financed by community contributions. RLFs would continue to be managed by community members,
the administrative cost being financed from a portion of funds under management.
Presidential elections were held in July 2014, shortly before the loan closing date. At the time of
writing, the newly elected President had expressed an interest in continuing PNPM Urban on a
nationwide basis, but with modified implementation arrangements. The implementing agency intends
to use PNPM to help achieve its “100-0-100” objective in urban areas by the end of 2019. (“100-0-
100” means 100% access to safe water, 0% slum areas and 100% access to improved sanitation).
(b)     Follow-up projects. In the second half of 2009, GoI requested the Bank to co-finance the
Third Program for Community Empowerment in Urban Areas.11 An agreement for US$150 million
IBRD loan (Ln. 7866) was signed in May 2010. In November 2012, GoI signed a loan agreement for
an IBRD loan (Ln. 8213) in an amount of US$292 million for the successor project PNPM Urban
2012-2015. The project also influenced the design of the ADB-funded Neighborhood Upgrading and
Shelter Sector Project for slum upgrading and post-disaster community-based housing.
(c)       Future impact evaluation. Not applicable.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objective, Design and Implementation
Relevance of objective
Rating: Substantial

The PDO of improving socio-economic development and local governance conditions remained
relevant throughout implementation. The project complemented the Government’s efforts to improve
socio-economic development and empower local communities. The newly elected President recently
confirmed his commitment to community-driven development projects, and intends to continue the
implementation of PNPM beyond 2014, albeit with modified implementation arrangements. The
CDD approach is also a key component of the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for 2009-2012,
which emphasized engagements with government counterparts and other stakeholders who are
committed to addressing critical governance and institutional challenges. The CPS for 2013-2015
identifies six thematic areas that form the core of the Bank’s engagement in Indonesia, three of which
are directly relevant to PNPM Urban: (i) Promoting Communities, Protecting the Vulnerable and

11
     The original name of the project was “Second National Program for Community Empowerment in Urban Areas”
     (PNPM Urban II). At the request of GoI, the name was changed to “Third National Program for Community
     Empowerment in Urban Areas”, because GoI had already used the term “PNPM Urban II” to refer to the
     Additional Financing to PNPM Urban.

Improving Health Outcomes, (ii) Ensuring Sustainable Development and Improving Disaster
Resilience, and (iii) Gender and Governance. Therefore, at completion the project was still
substantially relevant to the objectives of both the Bank and the Government of Indonesia.
Relevance of design
Rating: Substantial
Over 80% of the project cost consisted of investment in small-scale infrastructure, social services and
RLFs, which directly improved access to economic and social services to the intended beneficiaries,
thereby improving socio-economic conditions in the project area. Most of the remainder of the
project cost was allocated to capacity building and technical assistance aimed improving local
governance conditions, primarily through: (i) social accountability mechanisms, (ii) financial
management, (iii) facilitation, (iv) complaint handling mechanisms, and (v) management information
systems and reporting. The implementation of the Better Governance Action Plan also contributed to
improving local governance by identifying and mitigating corruption risks. The project’s design was
therefore highly relevant to the achievement of the project’s objectives throughout the
implementation period, although it is acknowledged that the PAD could have identified more specific
actions aimed at improving local governance.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective (Efficacy)
Rating: Substantial
Outcome indicators. PNPM Urban was successful in achieving its development objective of
ensuring that the urban poor in project locations were able to benefit from improved socio-economic
and local governance conditions. All three outcome indicators exceeded targets set. Most
intermediate results indicators were achieved, except those relating to the participation of the poorest
of the poor and RLFs. The outputs and outcomes related to the indicators are discussed below.
Outcome indicator #1: Improved household expenditure rates or improved access to economic
and social services in 80% of participating kelurahans (wards). Outputs: through Component 2,
the project financed a large number of infrastructure subprojects, including over 12,280 km of village
roads, 3,400 km of drains, 12,600 water supply facilities and 1,100 educational facilities. It also
financed revolving loan funds and social programs, benefitting approximately 670,000 and 340,000
poor persons, respectively (see Annex 2 for details). Outcome: a study undertaken in 2012 estimated
that 90% of participating kelurahans enjoyed improved access to economic and social services
financed by the project, well above the target of 80%.12 All intermediate results indicators for
Component 2 were achieved, except those related to RLF performance. RLFs had lower returns on
investments and higher loans-at-risk ratios than was envisaged at appraisal, even though about 80%
kelurahans managed to recover their cost (see Annex 2).
Outcome indicator #2: Infrastructure built is 20% less expensive than that built by non -
community based approaches in 80% of participating kelurahans. Output: Component 1
financed facilitators to help communities build infrastructure using community contracting.
Component 3 monitored the quality of the infrastructure. Outcome: Quarterly spot checks found that
infrastructure financed by the project was on average 33% lower than the cost of equivalent works
undertaken by local government contractors in 87% of participating kelurahans. Given that the

project invested over US$300 million in infrastructure, this amounted to a cost saving of about
US$100 million.

Outcome indicator #3: >80% satisfaction levels from beneficiaries regarding improved services
and local level governance. Output: Components 1 and 3 financed means to improve local level
governance, notably facilitation and an advanced MIS (see also Section 3.1). ). For both components,
all targets were achieved, except for the participation of the poorest and most vulnerable groups
(35%), which was slightly below the target (40%), partly due to less effective socialization.13
Although the participation rate of women remained above target, the Bank and the implementing
agency took steps to improve the quality of female participation through targeted facilitation. About
one-third of the adult population voted in BKM elections at the neighborhood level, slightly higher
than the target of 30% (and substantially higher than for elections of community leaders unrelated to
PNPM Urban). In 99% of the project locations, BKMs were established and CDPs completed.
Outcome: the 2012 study estimated that 87% of project beneficiaries were satisfied with improved
services and local governance, significantly above target (there was no baseline for satisfaction levels
in repeater locations as the impact evaluation of UPP2 only measured satisfaction levels related to
RLFs only). The quantitative evaluation also showed that 75% respondents viewed the BKM election
as transparent, participatory and fair. According to a process evaluation, which was conducted in
2011, the vast majority of subprojects financed by PNPM Urban are functional and of good quality. 14
This finding may serve as an explanation for the relatively high satisfaction levels: communities do
not merely state that they are satisfied, but actively use the subprojects for the intended purpose. In
relation to local governance, the survey measure d beneficiaries’ satisfaction about the information
provided in neighborhood meetings and by BKMs, and the performance of BKMs in selecting
subproject proposals and inviting people to annual meetings.

The project had reached about 33.7 million poor beneficiaries, exceeding the revised target of 22.3
million (original loan and credit plus AF) by a substantial margin. The project also made a significant
contribution to the achievement of core sector indicators by providing improved access to clean
water (benefitting about 619,000 households), sanitation (822,000 HHs), electricity (110,000 HHs)
and health clinics (211,000 HHs).

3.3     Efficiency
Rating: Substantial
Efficiency of project management. The implementing agency improved the efficiency of the
project by reducing the number of NMC and OC contracts, decentralizing operations, and
establishing a single platform for Bank and IDB-financed operations (see also Section 2.2). As a
result of this streamlining operation, average personnel costs (per year per kelurahan covered by the
project) dropped by about 25 percent. Although the implementation period was four years longer
than envisaged at appraisal the additional time was used to cover a much larger number of
kelurahans and pioneer the development of advanced programs at a relatively modest increase in the
project management cost.

13
     A substantial number of respondents lived in kelurahans that not received block grants before PNPM Urban
     (reflecting the fact that the majority of kelurahans receiving PNPM Urban had not received any of the UPPs).
     The participation of women and poor people in PNPM Urban community meetings would have been
     significantly higher compared to the participation of these groups in community meetings prior to PNPM Urban.

Efficiency of infrastructure subprojects. Quarterly spot checks undertaken by the NMC confirmed
the cost-effectiveness of community-based infrastructure financed by the project. By the end of 2011,
in 87% of all participating kelurahans, infrastructure built was at least 20% less expensive than infra-
structure that was constructed using non-community based approaches, well above the target of 80%
(see Annex 3 for details). The lower cost did not adversely affect quality, as over 95% of infra-
structure works were rated as being of “good quality”.
Efficiency of social programs and RLFs. The efficiency of investments in social programs was not
measured by the MIS or studies conducted by MPW or the Bank.15 The efficiency of investments in
RLFs was measured by the intermediate results indicators and it did not meet the targets set. The
results for the indicator return on investments (RoI) showed only about 30% of kelurahans managed
to achieve a RoI of more than 10%, out of the 90% targeted kelurahans. The cost coverage ratio
(CCR) showed better results. About 80% of kelurahans achieved a CCR of 125% (meaning that they
managed to recover their costs), out of the 90% targeted kelurahans. The RLFs and social programs
together accounted for less than 10% of the project cost, and so do not impact the overall rating too
much.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The PDOs remained highly relevant throughout the implementation period. The relevance of the
design was rated substantial, especially with regard to improving socio -economic conditions. The
project’s efficacy was substantial as measured by its three outcome indicators and intermediate
results indicators linked to the achievement of the PDOs. The project exceeded most targets set for
the outcome and intermediate results indicators except those related to RLF performance. As for the
project’s efficiency, the cost of CDD infrastructure projects tends to be significantly lower than
similar programs financed by government contractors, although cost savings were to some extent
reduced by limited capabilities for O&M and heavy reliance on facilitators, which resulted in
increased project implementation costs. On the positive side, the implementing agency took steps to
streamline the management of the project, thereby reducing administrative overheads.
Because of the relevance of the project, the efficacy of the outcome and minor shortcomings, to
efficiency, the overall outcome of the project was rated “satisfactory”.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
Gender aspects. To strengthen the role of women in the preparation and execution of CDPs, the
project not only set a target for female participation in decision-making meetings, but also required
that at least 30% of facilitators be women (the actual figure was about 40%), collected MIS data on
gender-disaggregated basis, and increased awareness of gender aspects through the community
socialization process. The AF also financed a gender mainstreaming program, which helped to
overcome the initial underperformance on the project in this area. The implementing agency also
required its contractors to grant paid maternity leave to pregnant facilitators.
Other outcomes and impacts. A positive but unintended outcome of PNPM Urban and its
predecessor projects is an increased interest of the implementing agency in using community-based
approaches to achieve its strategic objectives (MPW is now using community-based systems for

15
     The quantitative evaluation contains a review of the perceptions of the intended beneficiaries of the training
     programs and RLFs, both of which were highly favorable. The evaluation did not attempt to compare costs with
     benefits and recognized norms (as required for an efficiency analysis).


                                                         27
delivery of water supply and sanitation services in addition to local government institutions). The
implementing agency has also adopted PNPM’s management information and financial management
systems in community-based housing (REKOMPAK) and water and sanitation (PAMSIMAS)
projects.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and Stakeholder Workshops
Beneficiary surveys. The implementing agency and Bank undertook evaluations of the project’s
impact, and reviewed the technical and economic performance of the subprojects used by project
beneficiaries. The key findings of these studies are summarized in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 and will not
be repeated here (see Annex 5 for details on the beneficiary survey and process evaluation).
Stakeholder workshops. The implementing agency organized annual meetings with NGOs,
community members and other stakeholders to exchange views about project implementation.

4.   Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The “Risk to Development Outcome” is defined as the risk that the (expected) develop ment outco-
mes of the project—at the time of this assessment—will not be maintained or realized. The most
important constituent risks can be summarized as follows:
    Technical risk. These were rated “low”, because the project’s investments were concentrated in
     physical infrastructure that is relatively inexpensive to maintain and not technically complex.
     To further mitigate the risk of inadequate O&M, the project required the establishment of an
     O&M committee at the kelurahan level.
    Financial risk. The risks associated with financial management and the ability of the
     communities to monitor the use of funds provided in the future was deemed “moderate”.
     Although the management of RLFs was less than satisfactory throughout the project as the
     revolving funds were often unable to comply with the financial management guidelines, grant
     usage for revolving funds were not significant (accounting for about 10% of the total funds for
     block grant).
    Political risk. This risk was also rated “moderate” given the fact that both central and local
     governments showed a strong and long-term commitment to the financing of PNPM (albeit in a
     different format; see Section 2.5). If the central and local governments would withdraw their
     support for community-driven development plans, a major portion of the project’s investment
     will have been wasted, especially investments in facilitation and training for community-driven
     development. Although the impact of such a withdrawal would be significant, the likelihood of
     this happening is in the near future is considered low given GoI’s long-term commitment to
     CDD-type programs.
Based on these considerations, the overall “risk to development outcome” is rated “moderate”.


5.   Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
The strengths of the original project design are:


                                                    28
    Strategic relevance. The project successfully contributed to the further development of PNPM,
     as outlined in the Government’s roadmap for the program, and helped implement the Bank’s
     strategy for engagement with communities (refer to the Bank’s 2009 -2012 CPS for Indonesia).
     It also helped mainstreaming the Neighborhood Development program, a program designed to
     integrate local government and community-based planning (PAPG) and incorporate disaster
     risk management in the community socialization process.
    Robustness. The design of the project was based on the design of UPP2 and UPP3, with minor
     modifications to reflect lessons learned from these projects (notably the need to increase the
     involvement of local government and make the disbursement of block grants to RLFs
     contingent on performance) but otherwise using the same implementation arrangements. The
     Bank deliberately kept design changes to a minimum, in order to consolidate PNPM Urban as a
     full-fledged nationwide program, introducing substantial design changes during this process
     would not have been prudent.
    Strategic use of information and communication technology (ICT). The project design
     promoted the use of ICT for planning, implementation and monitoring evaluation, not only to
     be able to manage investments in a very large number of locations, but also to maintain a high
     level of transparency in all aspects of the project cycle.
    Direct communication with client. The task team leader was field-based, which facilitated
     discussions on project preparation with the Borrower. This also helped keep preparation cost
     low (US$200,000, or about 0.1% of the loan amount at appraisal).
On the other hand, the results framework did not contain indicators to explicitly measure the
outcomes of investments in revolving funds or social programs, and the PAD could have identified
more specific actions aimed at improving local governance. This shortcoming was deemed minor,
however, and the Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry was therefore rated “satisfactory”.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank mobilized a multi-disciplinary supervision team with expertise in project management,
financial management, procurement, monitoring, and safeguards. Intensive supervision enabled the
Bank to identify and proactively address key issues adversely affecting achievement of the PDOs in
an early stage, notably problems with delays in budget execution and revision, consultant
mobilization, compliance with safeguard policies, and the mainstreaming of the ND scheme. Because
of these supervision efforts, performance in these areas improved over time (as described in detail in
the ISRs, which were generally of good quality and candid about problems encountered during
supervision missions). The Bank also flexibly responded to requests for Additional Financing and
project extensions to expand the project geographically and accelerate the development of the ND
and PAPG schemes. The Bank was able to keep supervision costs low, because most missions did
not only cover the project itself, but also other related projects (UPP3, PNPM Urban III and PNPM
Urban 2012-2015). This enabled the Bank to field typically two full supervision missions per year, in
addition to many shorter site visits between such missions (locations to be supervised were selected
using the MIS). Virtually all team members were based in the country office, which allowed for close
and continuous supervision. However, in spite of these efforts, the Bank was unable to halt the
deterioration of RLF performance, and to resolve some shortcomings in financial management.
These shortcomings were, however, deemed moderate, and the quality of Bank’s supervision was
consequently rated “satisfactory”.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
In light of the “satisfactory” ratings for the Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry and the
quality of supervision, the Bank’s overall performance was also rated “satisfactory.”

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Performance of the Government
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Throughout project implementation, the project enjoyed the strong support of the Government, which
together with local governments and communities financed about 30% of the total project cost. GoI
supported the Bank’s efforts for continuous innovation of PNPM to improve the impact of the
program on poor communities throughout Indonesia. It also maintained good relationships with other
development partners involved in PNPM, made a timely request for the AF, and helped increase the
audit coverage from 16% to 34%. At the same time, it is felt that the Government could have been
more pro-active in preventing delays in budget execution, and a better definition of fiscal capacity
could have avoided problems with providing the minimum required amount of local government
counterpart funding. In addition, better financial planning may have avoided the need to repeatedly
extend the project. These shortcomings were deemed moderate, however, and the performance of the
Government was consequently rated “moderately satisfactory”.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Through project implementation, MPW supported a bottom-up, community-driven approach to
poverty alleviation.16 It strongly supported the continuous improvement of a comprehensive M&E
system to maintain a high level of transparency in relation to the outcomes of the project. Following
the agreed Better Governance Action Plan, it also took steps to modify implementation arrangements
where needed and responded to complaints or suspicions about the misuse of funds with great vigor
(as part of these efforts, MPW developed a system for computerized verification of facilitator
payments and requested its contractors to pay all salaries by bank transfer). There were, however,
several challenges that stronger management may have been able to resolve such as delays in
consultant recruitment, incomplete safeguards documentation and delays in submission of interim
financial reports. These shortcomings were deemed minor and did not have a significant adverse
impact on the progress of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
In light of the “moderately satisfactory” rating for the performance of the Government and the
“satisfactory” rating of the implementing agency, the overall performance of the Borrowe r was rated
“moderately satisfactory.”

     The PAD and other Bank documents refer to the Ministry of Public Works as “Executing Agency”. This was
     taken to mean “implementing agency” in the context of this ICR.

6.    Lessons Learned
The implementation of PNPM Urban confirmed the key lessons from the UPP series: CDD programs
can deliver small-scale infrastructure at a lower cost at a comparable quality to equivalent
infrastructure constructed by local government contractors, provided that communities are adequately
facilitated. Including a revolving fund in a large-scale CDD project runs the risk that such funds will
not receive sufficient attention, which may result in poor performance. In addition, several other
lessons were learned, the most important of which can be summarized as follows:
    Active involvement from local governments in CDD programs increases the impact of such
     programs. The project helped mainstream local government involvement in PNPM in urban
     areas, and demonstrated that financial incentives, coupled with intensive socialization and
     training of local government officials and their consultants, are an effective means to create a
     sustained interest on the part of local governments in planning and co-financing small-scale
     infrastructure projects for and together with communities. PAPG was particularly good at
     involving local governments and making them aware of the value of working with communities.
    Intensive socialization is needed to prevent elite capture of knowledge. Poor community
     members have limited understanding of PNPM Urban processes, and community leaders tend to
     present information that they perceive as relevant to be disseminated. To improve the
     participation rate of the poor, it is necessary to spend substantial time on socialization and
     community training.
    The implementation of CDPs at a scale with more complexity is constrained by limited human
     resources. PNPM Urban supported the mainstreaming of Neighborhood Development, a scheme
     aimed at integrated planning for the improvement of slum areas. It was found that community
     participation for ND was more limited than in regular program primarily because of the
     perceived complexity of planning at a higher spatial scale, and therefore requires intensive
     facilitation.
    Larger, more concentrated investments, together with local government involvement, have a
     bigger impact on slum areas than ordinary block grants. The Neighborhood Development
     program provided relatively large block grant amounts to slum areas, resulting in a better
     targeting of the poor. Collaboration between BKMs and local governments during the preparation
     of ND helped with the integration of tertiary infrastructure provided by the project with
     secondary infrastructure provided by local governments.
    The intensive use of ICT helps to maintain a high level of transparency in all aspects of the
     project cycle. The implementing agency instituted the policy to make all information about the
     project available on the project website, including payment advice from the State Treasury office,
     detailed RLF performance records, and audit findings. This policy was effective in strengthening
     public confidence in the project’s openness and fairness. The benefits of the MIS and website can
     be further enhanced by using the system for the prevention of misuse of funds (for example, the
     project website now shows all invoices paid by the project).There is no single optimal approach
     to preventing misuse of funds. Instead, multiple approaches at multiple layers should be
     promoted.
    CDD programs can be effective mechanism for creating awareness of disaster risk management.
     The project adapted the existing community socialization process to increase awareness of
     disaster risks and help develop mitigation measures. This approach worked well and now forms
     part of the PNPM in both urban and rural areas.



                                                  31
     The application of principles of successful livelihoods program may help improve RLF
      performance. In livelihoods programs, members of a group are required to meet certain
      conditions, such as a minimum about of regular saving, internal lending and bookkeeping, before
      they are permitted to borrow. The application of these conditions, coupled with more intensive
      facilitation and capacity buildings of savings group, could help improve RLF performance.
Most of the above lessons have already been incorporated into successor projects, and are applicable
in developing countries with governance systems similar to Indonesia.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Donors
(a)     Borrower/Implementing agencies
The Government rates the process, outcome and implementation of the project “satisfactory”. GoI
considers PNPM Urban and its predecessor projects a model for providing support to the poor on a
nationwide scale, using a demand-driven and community-based planning process. The
implementation of the project was deemed “satisfactory,”, as it delivered mu ch-needed basic
infrastructure and social support to the urban poor. The implementing agency rates its working
relationship with the Bank as satisfactory, and has expressed a keen interest in the further
development of PNPM Urban as a means to help achieve its “100-0-100” target by the end of 2019
(see Section 2.5). At the same time, the Government feels that overly detailed Bank supervision was
sometimes counterproductive to the smooth implementation of the project (see Annex 7 for detailed
comments of GoI on this ICR).
The Bank concedes that supervision was tight and sometimes detailed, but wishes to point out that
intense supervision was deemed necessary to identify and proactively address key issues adversely
affecting achievement of the PDOs in an early stage, and help ensure the timely achievement of
project targets.
(b) Cofinanciers/Development Partners
No issues were raised by the Islamic Development Bank.17

(c)     Other partners and stakeholders
No issues were raised by partners and stakeholders other than representatives of the Borrower and the
implementing agency.

     As mentioned in Chapter 1, IDB provided parallel financing for PNPM in urban areas in 14 provinces not covered
     by the Bank and was therefore technically not a co-financier of Bank-financed activities.

                                 Annex 2. Outputs by Component

This annex summarizes the outputs of the project, and is largely based on a review of the
achievements of the outcome and intermediate results indicators mentioned in the PAD.

Component 1: Community and Local Government Capacity Building (actual cost: US$ 105.26
million)
The project aimed to establish representative and accountable community organizations that would
be able to provide services to the urban poor and increase the voice of the poor in public decision-
making. BKMs were established in virtually all participating kelurahans, and the vast majority of
these were deemed representative, effective and operating in a participatory manner, as measured by
the involvement of women, and poor and vulnerable persons in planning and decision meetings. On
average about 33% of the adult population in kelurahans voted in BKM elections (substantially
higher than the targeted value of 30%). As for local government capacity building, over 90% of local
governments covered by the project co-financed at least 20% of the project cost from their own
resources (higher than the target of 80%).
To build capacity at community and local government level, the project financed two types of
training: (i) basic training and (ii) thematic training. Basic training was compulsory for project
stakeholders at all levels, and aimed to give a comprehensive understanding of the project concept,
participatory planning, community development, budgeting, financial management, accountability
and monitoring systems. Thematic training was given to certain groups of participants working in
particular areas. Local government officials were trained in participatory planning, the project
organization and monitoring system, and audits of CDD-type projects (the latter was of particular
relevance to local inspectorates). BKM, community groups (Kelompok Swadaya Masyarakat or
KSM) and community volunteers were trained prior to the planning and implementation process to
learn how to facilitate community meetings, prepare subproject proposals and budgets, conduct
community procurement, monitor and assess the construction of infrastructure development, and
prepare project and financial reports. Consultants also received a series of thematic trainings in
accordance with their responsibilities, on subjects such as leadership, facilitation skills, socialization,
bookkeeping, financial management, infrastructure assessment, and MIS.
Training was delivered using a “training-of-trainers” model. The project trained about 400 national
trainers, both government officials and consultants. At the community level, the project provided
training to around 100,000 BKM members, 120,000 community volunteers and 70,000 community
groups (KSM) per year. In addition, the project trained about 800 local government officials, mostly
from planning and public works departments, and from local inspectorates.

Component 2: Kelurahan Grants and Sub-loans (actual cost: US$ 346.92 million)
The project was designed to provide grants to communities to finance activities aimed at poverty
alleviation, especially small-scale infrastructure. About 78% of all kelurahan grant funds (totaling
about US$175 million equivalent) were invested in physical infrastructure. The rest of the funds went
to social infrastructure and services (12%) and revolving loan funds (10%). About 87% of
beneficiaries were satisfied with the improved services and local level governance.




                                                    34
REGULAR PROGRAM
Infrastructure. Most of the grants for physical infrastructure were invested in village roads,
drainage and rehabilitation of houses (Table A2.1). Together, investments in these three types of
infrastructure accounted for over 80% of total spending of infrastructure block grants. In 87% of the
participating kelurahans infrastructure subprojects were at least 20% less expensive than that of
similar infrastructure built by non-community based approaches. Spot checks showed that over 97%
of the subprojects were of good quality. As reported in various aides-memoires, the technical quality
of the community infrastructure was generally good. In every sub-neighborhood where project-
financed infrastructure was built, the project required the establishment of an O&M committee, as a
means to instill a sense of ownership for the infrastructure financed by the project. Although this is
considered a useful step towards improved sustainability of community infrastructure, it is uncertain,
and in many cases even unlikely, that formation of these committees will provide the commitment
and resources needed. The Bank recognizes that long-term engagement is needed to resolve this
long-standing problem of inadequate O&M.
Social programs. The project financed about IDR 231 billion (or about US$20 million equivalent) in
training courses and other social programs (including aid to the elderly, health care, additional nutrition
for children of poor, scholarships for young and disadvantaged students), benefitting approximately
830,000 persons, of which over 670,000 were poor. Of total 2,400 HH respondents, about 13% (318 HH)
received social programs.
Revolving loan funds. The project financed about IDR 214 billion (about US$18 million equivalent,
or about 3.6% of the total project cost) of block grant allocations to RLFs. This investment benefitted
over 340,000 poor persons in 65,000 community groups. Of these, about 217,000 (or 63% of the
total) were women. As described in the main text, the performance of RLFs has deteriorated over
time and did not meet the targets set by the results framework. Even though less than 5% of the
project cost was used for RLFs, future projects may benefit from an understanding of the factors that
caused poor performance (see Box 1).

Box 1: REVIEW OF RLF PERFORMANCE

 Background. RLFs were first established under UPP to serve urban poor people that otherwise would not have
 access to credit (other than credit provided by informal lenders at extremely high rates). At present, there are
 over 11,000 RLF management units (Unit Pengelolaan Keuangan or UPKs) that were established with support
 of PNPM Urban or its predecessor projects. UPKs are small by most standards; by the end of 2014, over 90% of
 UPKs had capital of less than IDR 300 million (US$25,000). Loan sizes range from IDR 0.5 million (about
 US$40 equivalent) to IDR 2 million (about US$160), considerably smaller than loans provided by formal
 financial service providers. Interest rates vary from 1.5% to 3% per month, with the upper end of the range
 comparable to rates charged by Bank Indonesia Rakyat, the country’s largest micro -credit provider. Because
 community groups, and not individuals, are responsible for loan repayment, and because borrowers do not need
 (and usually are unable) to provide collateral, lending decisions are largely based on assessments of the character
 of the borrower.

 Performance over time. To measure RLF performance over time, the Bank used three performance indicators in
 the project’s result framework, namely the loans at risk (LAR) ratio, the cost coverage ratio and the annualized
 return on investment. Performance as measured by all three indicators deteriorated over time. Bank supervision
 missions and evaluation studies list a large number of possible explanations, including:
      high turnover of UPK staff (who are unpaid volunteers),
      a small capital base, which makes it difficult to raise additional capital,
      limited financial management capacity of UPK staff (although bookkeeping was generally up to standard),
      limited capacity of facilitators to provide adequate training and oversight,



                                                        35
        limited willingness of borrowers to repay funds (as investments in RLFs are often seen as central
         government grants, not as funds that need to be repaid),
        limited capacity of borrowers to set up and manage a financially viable business,
        utilization of loan funds for non-revenue generating activities (such as consumptive use),
        no requirement for borrowers to save (which is generally an effective tool for instilling financial
         discipline), and

  Implications for project design and implementation. Based on lessons learned during implementation of
  predecessor projects, PNPM Urban generally did not allow kelurahans to allocate more than 20% of block grants
  to RLFs, except in the case when RLF performance was rated “satisfactory” (a threshold of 30% was applied for
  kelurahans that had not previously participated in PNPM). As performance of RLFs declined over time, block
  grant allocations for RLFs also declined, dropping from 15% of total block grant funds in 2007-2009 to 10% in
  2010. The Bank is currently exploring ways to link revolving loan funds directly to livelihood development
  projects. Through the Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan or OJK), the Government is
  planning to rationalize and possibly consolidate RLFs established under PNPM.

ADVANCED PROGRAMS
Neighborhood Development. ND was developed in 2007 during implementation of UPP2 and UPP3
and scaled up with financing from PNPM Urban to 255 kelurahans in 2009. Each participating
kelurahan received a grant of IDR 1 billion (about US$90,000), to be used for infrastructure (85%)
and capacity building for communities (15%). The implementation of ND was supported by an urban
planner and social marketing expert both at local government and community level. Communities
were facilitated to prepare a community settlement plans in consultation with local governments.
Over half of the infrastructure grants were used for roads (37%), drainage (13%) and water supply
and sanitation facilities (8%). At the project closing date, ND covered more than 700 kelurahans.

Since 2012, local governments have led the selection of ND locations and the implementation of the
program. Starting in 2014, ND started to focus on slum improvement in metropolitan areas for bigger
impact, with continuous strengthening provided to local government and increased collaboration
between communities and local government. Following the recently announced government policy to
eliminate slum areas by the end of 2019, the government is preparing a national program for slum
upgrading that will significantly draw on the model developed under the Neighborhood Development
program.

Poverty Alleviation Partnership Grant (PAPG). The project supported the completion of PAPG
subproject activities in about 30 cities. Various initiatives were implemented to institutionalize the
PAPG mechanism into local government planning and budgeting systems, and also to encourage
partnership in ND locations. Despite the limited capacity of PAPG to fund large scale infrastructure,
partnerships between local governments and communities were generally effective. At project
closing, more than 30 local governments chose to replicate PAPG from their own funding.

Component 3: Implementation and Technical Assistance (actual cost: US$ 37.39 million)
The project was managed by a Project Management Unit (PMU) assisted by an administrative unit
(Satuan Kerja or SatKer). The PMU hired consultants and a large number of facilitators to assist with
project implementation. Technical assistance was provided through a National Management
Consultant (NMC) at the central level, and Oversight Consultant (OC) teams at the regional level,
with district offices in the participating kota/kabupaten, and facilitators and community cadres at the
kelurahan level. This component also covered the monitoring and evaluation of the project through
the MIS and a series of evaluation reports (see Annex 9 for details). Implementation support
primarily consisted of the following activities:
     Complaints handling. During 2008-2014, the PMU resolved 126,609 of 128,027 (99%) reported
      complaints18, including 1,127 corruption complaints, and had recovered about US$1.5 million
      (67%) of misused funds totaling an estimated US$2.3 million equivalent. The complaint handling
      system recorded complaints as well as misused of funds related findings as a result of financial
      audit by BPKP, Local Government Inspectorate, as well as independent audit to BKM.
     Monitoring of progress against development targets and performance indicators (supported by
      reports of independent evaluators). About 94% of OCs provided timely and accurate data through
      MIS (91% for kelurahans covered by the AF), which was higher than the target of 90%. The
      NMC and OCs also helped ensure that almost all BKMs had completed financial audits by the
      end of each year, exceeding the target of 70% by a substantial margin. However, due to delays in
      consultant recruitment, evaluation reports were issued later than expected, and there was
      substantial variation in the quality of the reports.
As described in the main text, the implementation of PNPM Urban took significantly longer than
anticipated at the time of appraisal. Refer to Table A2.2 for an overview of the amendments to the
original financing agreements.

                          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Because the project adopted a programmatic approach, the activities financed by the project were not
pre-defined but demand-driven. For this reason, it was not possible to estimate indicators such as the
net present value or the economic internal rate of return (financial rates of return were not applicable,
given that the project exclusively financed non-revenue generating subprojects). Efficiency was
therefore gauged by unit rate norms. These are highly favorable for community-executed
infrastructure projects, as attested by the following studies:
   In 2009, the implementing agency recruited a firm to review community-based infrastructure
    development in PNPM Urban. The review contained an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of
    infrastructure financed by the project. Based on an analysis of the cost of 28 small-scale
    infrastructure projects in 12 kelurahans, it was estimated that the cost of infrastructure built by
    communities was, on average, 23% lower than the cost of equivalent works built by local
    government contractors. The main sources of cost savings were a reduction in the following:
    contractor overheads, double or triple handling of materials, on-site design modifications, and
    construction supervision in remote areas.
   A recent review of PNPM Urban prepared by the RAND Corporation in 2011, called Process
    Evaluation of the Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (PNPM)-Urban, found
    favorable results for the quality of infrastructure projects undertaken and financed by previous
    Bank-financed CDD projects.

   In 2012, the PNPM Support Facility recruited a consultant to analyze the economic benefits of
    small-scale infrastructure (the infrastructure subprojects were financed by PNPM Rural, but are
    comparable to subprojects financed by PNPM Urban). The actual cost of the 48 projects was
    compared to the theoretical cost of the same projects had they been provided by local government
    contractors. The results of the analysis, which are described in Laporan Akhir Studi Skala Kecil
    Analisis Manfaat Ekonomi Proyek Infrastruktur PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan , are comparable to
    the findings of similar studies on cost savings associated with community-driven development
    projects in Indonesia, especially when undertaken by communities themselves instead of using
    community contracting. Cost savings were highest for projects in the roads and bridges sector
    (22%-33%), followed by water supply (19%-28%), and irrigation (20%-25%).
Quarterly spot checks undertaken by the NMC confirmed the cost effectiveness of community-based
infrastructure financed by the project. By the end of 2011, in 87% of all participating kelurahans,
infrastructure built was at least 20% less expensive than infrastructure that was constructed using
non-community based approaches, well above the target of 80%. It is worth noting that the lower
cost did not adversely affect quality, as over 95% of infrastructure works were evaluated as being of
“good quality”.

The implementing agency improved the efficiency of project management by reducing the number of
NMC and OC contracts, decentralizing operations, and establishing a single platform for Bank and
IDB-financed operations It should be noted, however, that the use of single-year contracts for
facilitators made the implementation of the project less efficient that it would have been if multi-year
contracting had been applied (as recommended in the mid-term review).

                             Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Quantitative evaluation. In 2011, the implementing agency commissioned a survey on the impact of
PNPM Urban throughout Indonesia. The results of the survey, which was based on interviews with
2,400 persons in 80 kelurahans were published in October 2012, in a report called “Quant itative
Evaluation the National Community Empowerment Program – Urban (NCEP-Urban) 2011”. The
study covered five island groups (Sumatera, Java, Nusa Tenggara, Kalimantan and Sulawesi), 17
local governments and 80 kelurahans.

The main findings of this report were as follows:

      The vast majority of respondent stated that they received benefits and improved services
       from the PNPM Urban. Improved road access was cited most often as a benefited of PNPM
       Urban.
      The majority of respondents who received microloans from KSMs indicated that the process
       to acquire loans was relatively simple and that these loans improved household income. The
       marginal impact of the PNPM loans on household incomes was perceived to be greater than
       that from other loans.
      Almost half of the respondents stated that gaining access to information about PNPM Urban
       was easy. However, there was room for improvement in this area, as many respondents only
       acquired information through informal channels and many did not know about subjects such
       as poverty mapping and PAPG.
      BKMs were generally perceived to be honest and trustworthy, and BKM elections were
       generally perceived to be transparent, participatory and fair.
      Trainings given to the RLF beneficiaries have increased the probability of improving the
       households’ income by 0.4% (13.4% for RLF beneficiaries without training, to 13.8% for
       RLF beneficiaries complemented by related trainings).
      Of total 2,400 HH respondents, about 13% (318 HH) received social programs. Of the 318
       HH, about 35.5% perceived the social program as very useful, and 61% as useful.
      About 70% BKMs interviewed manage to continue providing social grants. About 24%
       BKMs decided to discontinue social grants, because no budget allocated for social grant by
       BKM (44%), not included in the priority (25%), no proposal received (13%), and other
       reasons such as the long term benefit was somewhat unclear (only to buy sewing machine or
       cake-making tools)
      BKM meeting with social unit (UPS) is less frequent compared to other units (UPK and
       UPL)

Process evaluation. Also in 2011, the Bank appointed the RAND Corporation to conduct a process
evaluation of PNPM Urban. For this evaluation, a sample of 350 beneficiaries in 16 kelurahans was
interviewed, as well as a selection of government officials and facilitators. The main findings of the
RAND process evaluation are summarized below.

Quality of infrastructure subprojects:
 Subjective assessments of PNPM Urban project quality were almost universally favorable.
   Almost all respondents – notably including some government officials – said that PNPM Urban
   projects were of high quality, and often of better quality than similar government-constructed
   projects.



                                                    43
   Objective assessments, including professional engineering assessments, of PNPM Urban project
    quality were also good.
   Generally, respondents attributed the higher quality of PNPM Urban infrastructure to the
    participatory approach and the avoidance of government management.
   With respect to maintenance, some respondents said that the community was more likely to
    maintain PNPM Urban projects than other government infrastructure due to the perception of
    ownership of PNPM Urban projects.

Quality of non-infrastructure
 A significant proportion of respondents mentioned that the poor need more social assistance
   programs, such as access to jobs, loans and capital, training, and access to healthcare and
   education, and affordable food. However, even respondents who expressed a desire for more
   economy and social programs recognize that many of those projects may be difficult to
   implement (than infrastructure project), and may not benefit as many people as in the
   infrastructure projects.
 There is demand for social and economic projects as well as infrastructure projects. Many
   informants agreed that the current mix of infrastructure, economy and social projects was not
   ideal. More emphasis should be placed on economy and social projects, or more balanced funds
   allocated between infrastructure, economy and social programs. Preferences varied across and
   within sites, but many stated the need of greater funds for trainings and loans.
 Many are aware that the non-infrastructure projects have not worked well in the past, but the
   findings raise the general issue that the low-income residents in the state of needing more
   economy and social programs.
 Women tend to be more participative in economy and social programs, and less in infrastructure
   projects (mostly only contributes food and drink for workers).

The CDD approach:
 Volunteer community organizations, including BKMs and KSMs, were generally thought to
   work well, and to function independently of local government.
 Community participation from the grassroots was not at ideal levels, but this must be viewed
   against the scenario prior to PNPM Urban of almost zero participation. Decisions about project
   selection and implementation tended to be made by delegated representatives of the community,
   but respondents generally expressed satisfaction with the choices made about projects to pursue.
 Participation was greater in project implementation. Respondents expressed the view that PNPM
   Urban infrastructure was of good quality and that this was because the community was involved
   in their implementation. In most communities, households reported making in-kind contributions
   (e.g. labor or food/drinks for workers).
 Targeting the poor via infrastructure project was a challenge because the urban poor tend to be
   geographically spread out, even within kelurahans. This was not however a fault of the program.

Local government:
 There was little or no duplication of local government activities i.e. PNPM Urban was providing
   services that were not delivered by government.
 The involvement of local government varied across sites, from little substantive involvement
   (e.g. only signing off on projects) to substantial local government involvement (e.g. participating
   in decision making and oversight). While in some sites, projects might have been aided by
   improved communication between PNPM Urban and government, often both community



                                                 44
   representatives and government officials were in favour of PNPM Urban being kept separate
   from local government.

Capacity building and effectiveness of the facilitators:
 Facilitators were playing a significant role in all of the cycles of PNPM Urban, from the
   socialization phase to helping BKMs and KSMs in the writing of reports and auditing of projects.
 Community members generally perceived that facilitators were significantly contributing to
   project outcomes, often by providing specialized knowledge or identifying problems in the
   implementation of infrastructure projects. However, it was found that facilitators could be doing
   more to encourage community participation in decision-making.
 In some cases, facilitators were a bit overstretched, having to supervise activities in multiple
   kelurahans.

Governance and control mechanisms:
 Monitoring and governance mechanisms were generally working well, despite the logistical
   challenges of collecting information for a national program.
 Auditing was being completed on schedule and that it was perceived to be useful for uncovering
   instances of inadequate project performance, poor implementation, corruption, etc.
 The PNPM Urban MIS had substantial potential, but there was room for improvement in the
   selection of data collected and the validation of this data.

The adequacy of block grants and learning from ND:
 The size of the block grants offered was generally adequate for project needs. However, this may
   have been because project requests were already scaled to expectations about PNPM Urban
   resources.
 Even though it was deemed reasonable that pilot sites were determined on the basis of readiness
   rather than need, the report suggested that ND should consider an alternative selection method for
   future sites to enhance the program’s impact in alleviating poverty.

                  Annex 7. Borrower's ICR and Comments on Draft ICR

(a) Borrower’s Completion Report
In June 2015, the Borrower submitted a 49-page project completion report to the Bank, titled “Project
Completion Report (PCR) PNPM Urban I & Additional Financing (IBRD-75040, IBRD-76640,
IDA-43840)”.The Executive Summary of the report is copied below.

1. In Mid-2007, in Palu at the centre of Sulawesi province, the President of Indonesia
   announced the launch of a national program for poverty reduction. A pillar of this program
   is the National Community Empowerment Program, or Program Nasional Pemberdayaan
   Masyarakat Mandiri (PNPM Mandiri).
2. The PNPM Mandiri, aims to reduce poverty by empowering communities so that they will
   be effective development players and partners through a comprehensive, integrated
   community-based approach. The overall objectives of the project are to (i) improve the
   socio-economic conditions of communities in the targeted areas, especially women and
   the poorest, through (a) improving community infrastructure, both, physical and social;
   (b) social activities aimed at the dependent/ vulnerable segments of the communities; (c)
   facilitating economic growth and livelihood development, and (ii) build capacities & skills
   of communities and their local institutions.
3. PNPM Urban I was carried out in the period of 2008, with the effective date of the project
   is on July 22th, 2008 and the closing date (original) on March 31th 2011, with extent to
   December 31th , 2014 (revised/actual date). The additional financing (AF) was PNPM Urban
   which have been implemented in the period in 2009, with the effective date of the
   project was on May 1st, 2009 and with the same closing dated. Both are financed with
   funds from the World Bank, ie IBRD-75040, IBRD-76640, IDA-43840.
4. The original amount of the PNPM-Urban is US$177.68 million (IBRD loan US$52.68 million,
   IDA credit SDR 78.6million/ US$125 million). With additional financing, provide an
   additional loan in an amount of US$115 million to the PNPM Urban Fy 2009. The original
   project is a Specific Investment Loan with an IDA/IBRD blend.The additional financing is
   100% IBRD and will bring total financing up to US$292.68 million.
5. In order to close these project, the government of Indonesia (GOI) prepare a Project
   Completion Report (PCR) PNPM Urban I and Additional Dinancing. The PCR of PNPM Urban
   I and AF prepared to find out the achievements of the outcome and output results of
   PNPM Urban III which are are identified and defined in Project Appraisal Documents (PAD)
   of PNPM Urban I and AF.
6. According to data presented by the Deputy Secretary Vice President For People's Welfare
   and Poverty Alleviation, as the Executive Secretary of the National Team for Accelerating
   Poverty Reduction (TNP2K), the number of poor people in 2014 was 27,72 million people
   or equivalent with the poverty rate reach 10.96%. For comparison, data on poverty in
   Indonesia at the time of preparation of PNPM Urban I in 2008, the number of poor people
   at that time was 34.96 million people with a poverty rate amounted to 15,42%.


                                                 47
7. Thereby, during the implementation of PNPM Urban I in the period of 2008 to 2014, a
   general overview of the poverty in Indonesia was a reduction in the number of poor about
   7,24 million people, and also decline in the poverty rate of 4,46 %. Specifically in urban
   areas, it was a reduction in the number of poor people at 2,41 million or 3,49% from 2008
   to 2014.

8. PNPM Urban I and Additional Financing have been completed and finished on December
   2014 and in overall, the project is rated satisfactory, with measured by objective and
   outputs indicators results achievement.
9. Related with Achievements of Project Development Objectives (PDOs) of PNPM Urban I
   and Additional Financing, all indicators have been achieved and meet the satisfactory
   rating. In general almost all outputs indicators of PNPM Urban have succeeded to meet
   indicators target results . From all indicators on the component of Community and Local
   Government Capacity Building and Component 3: Technical Assistance are satisfactory,
   while Component 2: Kelurahan Grants’ rating is moderate satisfactory, because t
   indicators related with RLF haven not been achieved. It can be concluded that the
   Kelurahan grant component has successfully disbursed and managed by community with
   appropriately, efficiently and effectively, except for the revolving fund strategies that
   need to be made more precise.
10. The Beneficiaries of PNPM urban 1 and Additional Financing reached 22 million
    Households, including 14 million are poor households.

11. The success of a program, will be able to influence government policy. The Community-
    based development approach in Indonesia, which introduced through PNPM Urban, has
    now become the mainstream of development in Indonesia, with the integration to the
    principles of community development to the Village Law No.6 Year 2014, such as Fund
    Disbursement directly to Community, Community participation, Community Groups
    approach, Community Organizing, Transparancy and Accountability, Gender Perspective,
    and Community Self-Reliance
