                         The project has been implemented in about 8,813 urban districts (kelurahans), or more than 95% of the kelurahans in Indonesia. The project has made good implementation progress
                         and appears likely to achieve its objectives, but with moderate shortcomings in some areas. Investments in community infrastructure to improve roads, drainage, water supply,
