components. First, the EMOS subproject which would benefit\n            about 686,000 people in the Santiago Metropolitan Region\n            through improvement and expansion of water treatment and\n            distribution facilities, construction of new wells and\n            storage tanks, a leak detection program, installation of\n            53,000 new house connections and 120,000 water meters,\n            acquisition of maintenance and operating equipment, and a\n            sewerage master plan to cover Santiago's needs to the\n            year 2000. Second, the nationwide SENDOS subproject, which\n            would benefit some 1.8 million people by providing a\n            chlorination program to improve water quality in 36 cities,\n            a comprehensive metering program throughout the country, a\n            leak detection program in 17 cities and technical assistance\n            for institution building. About 53 percent of the\n            beneficiaries of the EMOS program and 21 percent of the\n            beneficiaries of the SENDOS program would be poor consumers\n            whose incomes are less than one-third the national average."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
