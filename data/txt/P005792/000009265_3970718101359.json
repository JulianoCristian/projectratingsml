   assist the Government in improving communications in rural\n            areas, especially those with dense population, and to\n            strengthen the Highway Authority (HA), particularly in its\n            road maintenance activities.  Towards this objective, the\n            project will assist in the upgrading and partial\n            reconstruction of a priority secondary road, and in the\n            improvement of road maintenance.  It will include:  (a) the\n            realignment and upgrading of a road of approximately 32 km.\n            from Ibb to Al Udayn; (b) construction supervision; (c)\n            technical assistance for improvement of road maintenance and\n            training; and (d) training of over 400 road maintenance\n            personnel.  The project will help to reduce the vehicle\n            operating costs of existing and future traffic and it will\n            improve access to agricultural inputs and extension\n            services, markets for produce, schools, hospitals and other facilities."}, "docdt": "1983-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
