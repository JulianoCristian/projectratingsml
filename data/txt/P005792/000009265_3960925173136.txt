MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on the Republic of Yemen
Fifth Highway Project
(Credit 14 3-Y)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on the Republic of Yemen -
Fifth Highway Project  (Credit  1413-YEN)" prepared by  the Infrastructure
Operations Division, Country Department II, of the Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office, vwth the Borrower providing Part II.
The project was well prepared and well implemented except for some
procurement issues discussed in the PCR.   The economic rate of return is
acceptable.
Overall, the project's outcome is satisfactory. Sustainability is
likely as the quality of the road constructed under the project is good and the
Highway Authority capable of maintaining it. Also, under the follow-on project,
now ongoing, the government's annual road maintenance program is planned in
consultation with IDA. The project's institutional impact is substantial; the
transfer of professional skills significantly surpassed original objectives both
at the Highway Authority and at the local development associations.
The PCR is satisfactory and informative although the documentation
for the economic analysis is missing. No audit is planned.
This doctmuent has a restricted distributfon and may be used by recipients only In the performance of
their official duties. its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Sank authorization.

4.1   Prelma  iddentIcation of the project had been targeted as sarly as June 1981, and formal
eticaton was made In September of the followng year. Irtaly HA was Intrested In a rnuch larger
pr,  etendWgconstutonoftlbb.AIUdaynmroadtoJarahl (1o0mintot. Hower, IDAfound
that the Al Jarahi ption was difficut to justify ecoromicaly, and that because toal costs were estmated
at US$85  in, conandng d the non-IDA potIon (IDA US$ 13 mlDion) woldd be dficul Ultimately, both
pants agred to llnk construction to IbbAI Udayn. As dlssd below, cdolacn for even the rduced
projec vwas unavailable.
4.2    A second dfferene of opinIon bwn ROY and IDA In the Initial prje  design concened the
need for echn   assnce (TA). Not aypiy, the Gowmment fr  prfer  that no now IDA funds be
used for TA, and requested that any prow   TA required be fnded from mons avaable under the
Higw        II credt By apprai  (Janary 1983) It was agred that the project shoud Include a TA
componen wth SDR 2.8 millon of IDA financing. Most of th   hunswere eventualyexpenode; hower,

4.3    A thrd pobnt of discussion In pojct design was the srfae temen to be used fbr Mbb-AI Udayn
The oginal design by consultants  WEOO) caled for an asphaktc double surfoa  weadng course.
Athough IDA agreed with the ontanrs study, HA, becau  of pre v niou     experence wth
double uce requested ntead tht a6 cm asphalt cocre we g sufc be used and beieved dt
tle roughly f  to ten pcnt hihr Ina cost woldd be offet by lower         expense. Durn
IDA agred, and prjct cot wwe  neased accordingly.
4.4   The lbng4tanding and pmduoWe rhiwJomtdp  betwe IDA and HA, not surprfi  In a fifh
apon, ed  MM d_*encn In project concept wmre readly resolved. In general, the role and
responsbilitis of tte borre In th project were clary understood and excutd.
4.6    A more dif fclt problemIn th project's ely days was co bna   Initially  rch 198the 8audi
Fund (SF) had Indiated to ROYand IDA that It was intresed In patiWcpt   but In May 1983 (one wek

During           S, 8F conirmed  a kt woudd not part     In response, the Govermt offered to

4.6   The project did atempt to Intmduce some Innovation In clvii works contractng In ROY. Bldding
documents for lbb-A Udayn construction gave biddes the opton to submit tenders using the target costr
method (in which both owner and contrctor shari In any divergence from target costs). Thes new
contractng procedures we Ilnteded to reduce the high road contucton costs thn prevailing in ROY.
Yet I tuned out that only one bidder Included the target cost option, reportdly becae justIfication of
divergence from taed costs requlre sophisticed accounting and marnagmnt procedures atill diMfult
to apply In ROY - and the ooncept was dicarded. Even under tradkional contracting produr,
costructon costs were far below apprasal estmas (see paes. 5.6 and 6.1). Wih the dedine In
constrcton costs  e    d In this and subsequent projects, target cost contracng no onger factors

this surprising coincidence was premeditated, and no further question was raised as to the Integrity of the
process.
8.5    What did provoke comment by both HA and IDA was that each of the low bids were heavy
conditoned. HA rmpted fte low  stbidder, Indian Road Construcion Company (IRCC), to drop a its
conditions If k wished contact award. The procurement unk d IDAs Project Pollcy Department objected
to this approach, and recommended that all condtomns be quantWfd and the bids re.ewauated, or
aitenatlvey, that both bids be rejected and the third lowest seleced (which was stIl 20 percent under the
engineses estimate). IDAs reglonl management disagreed with procuemets advice to rejec both bids,
viewing the approach as too costly and "not In the Interest of a poor country like Yemenm In May 1984 the
region quand  the low bidders' deviadons. and reported that the ranking of the three lowest bids was
unchanged. IDA subsequently gave itB no objection to award to IRCC.
5.6    The tot project had been appraised at US$35.5 milon, d which cil works we  estimated to cost
US$ 27.8 mlion'. The IRFCC contract represented a savings o US$ 186 mlion and the Governeft
requested that the project be rmduced, with IDA ctrbution remaining comstant Indeed, In Novenber
1984 (over six months afer IDAs 'no objectionr, the Government reue to sign the IRCX contract undess
the IDA share was increase,. In December 1984 IDA agreed to finance 70 percent d constucton
(prevously 30 percent) and revied the credk as showKn In Table 4.C. IDfAs share d the total projet
ncreased from 37 perent to 8 percent The rionale for the aendenta vas 'to alow the Govemrnmet
to benefit to the mxdnium exte  possibe from the foable constuction price it reclved."
5.7    The IRCC contact was sWgned and work std In January 1985, with a argeted compltIon date

tt Owe are very woniecd about the presn poor pefomnce d IRCCO and encouraged HA to exe
more pressure on th contactor and conutant
5.8    One reason for IRCC dffiuts was the losses k was kinuing In the project To some extent
these kse were of the conractoes own makdng, and can be attributed to lRCsseribus udhra

its expsioit approval of the bomwera action was WefensIble. On the other hand, an IDA legol advisor
recommended that the contract should be uphed. At the end of 1985, the locl currncy had deprociated

March 1986 (halfy through the contract period), ordy 8 percent of the work was completed That month
a me_ng was held bewn HA and IRCO's chamen. The contractor agred to all HA conditons, received
a six month contrt extson (untr Judy 1987), and was Informed that HA would wihdraw the work If
