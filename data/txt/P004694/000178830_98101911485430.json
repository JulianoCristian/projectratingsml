"The project includes (a) development of\n            an 85 meter high, multipurpose rockfill dam on the Pattani\n            River in southern Thailand with an installed capacity of 60\n            MW, including related transmission expansion and\n            resettlement of the affected population; (b) expansion of\n            the existing 115 KV transmission system and substations to\n            support the Provincial Electricity Authority's rural\n            electrification program; and (c) study of power to consumers\n            at different voltage levels and as a basis for recommending\n            a tariff schedule for the power sector. EGAT has minimized\n            risk to the extent possible by engaging an International\n            Consulting Board for advice on any unusual technical\n            problems which might arise and by enlisting the support of\n            area residents in developing a mutually satisfactory\n            resettlement scheme."}, "docdt": "1977-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
