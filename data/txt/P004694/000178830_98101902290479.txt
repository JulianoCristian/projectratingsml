PATTANI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)
Guarantor:             Kingdom of Thailand
Amount:                $50.0 million
Terms:                 20 years, including five years of grace, with interest
at 8.0% per annum.
Project Description:   The project will enable EGAT to help meet the growing
demand for power in the Southern Region of the country
and in other selected rural areas. It comprises part
of EGAT's 1977-86 expansion program and includes
(a) development of an 85 meter high, multipurpose
rockfill dam on the Pattani River in southern Thailand
with an installed capacity of 60 MW, including related
transmission expansion and resettlement of the affected
population; (b) expansion of the existing 115 KV trans-
mission system and substations to support the Provincial
Electricity Authority's rural electrification program;
and (c) study of power tariffs to ascertain the marginal
costs of supplying power to consumers at different vol-
tage levels and as a basis for recommending a tariff
schedule for the power sector. EGAT has minimized risk
to the extent possible by engaging an International
Consulting Board for advice on any unusual technical
problems which might arise and by enlisting the support
of area residents in developing a mutually satisfactory
resettlement scheme.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE ELECTRICITY GENERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR THE PATTANI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand with the guarantee
of the Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent of $50.0 million to help
finance the Pattani hydro-electric project. The loan would have standard
terms of 20 years, including five years of grace, with interest at 8.0% per
annum. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development has agreed to lend to
the Borrower $20 million equivalent, on a parallel basis, for a term of 25
years including 5 years of grace, at interest of 3.5% per annum. A consor-
tium of commercial banks under leadership of the Bank of Tokyo will make an
additional loan of $20 million equivalent for a term of 7-1/2 years,
including 4-1/2 years of grace, at interest about 1-1/8% per annum above
LIBOR. To help accommodate the commercial bank financing, the Borrower
would be required to repay only $200,000 annually of the IBRD loan for the
first 2-1/2 years of amortization; i.e., while the commercial bank loan is
being repaid.
PART I - THE ECONOMY /1
2.        A report entitled "Economic Memorandum on the Current Economic
Situation and Prospects of Thailand" (1280a-TH, dated October 29, 1976) was
distributed to the Executive Directors in November 1976 and to members of
the Consultative Group for Thailand in February 1977. A number of missions
are planned in the next few months to study various aspects of the economy,
representing an intensification of Bank economic work, with the intention
of assisting the Government to firm up its plans for implementation of the
Fourth National Economic-and Social Development Plan (1977-1981). Country
data are given in Annex I.
Recent Political Events
3.        Following the April 1976 elections, the coalition Government of
Prime Minister Seni Pramoj succeeded that of Kukrit Pramoj, which had been in
power for just over a year. However, on October 6, following the eruption of
violence at the Thammasat University between left-wing students and right-wing
groups, some 24 high ranking military officers formed the National Administra-
tive Reform Council (NARC), headed by Admiral Sangad Chalawyoo, and seized
power. NARC abrogated the 1974 Constitution, dissolved the National Assembly
and outlawed all political parties.
/1 Parts I and II are essentially the same as presented in President's
Report No. P-2108-TH dated June 15, 1977 for the Second Chao Phya Irriga-
tion Improvement Project in Thailand.



- 2 -
4.        On NARC's recommendation, the King appointed Thanin Kraiwichian, a
Senior Judge of the Supreme Court, as Prime Minister on October 8. The Prime
Minister announced a Cabinet of 17 members drawn from a wide range of back-
grounds on October 22. On the same day, a new Constitution, which provides
for, among other things, the establishment of a National Administrative
Reform Assembly and a phased return to full democracy over 16 years, was
promulgated. The Assembly consisting of 340 appointed members met for the
first time on November 25, 1976, when NARC, which had been acting as an
interim legislature, assumed an advisory role to the Cabinet. The Constitu-
tion bestows wide ranging powers on the Prime Minister on matters relating
to law and order and national security.
Recent Economic Developments
5.        Thailand's growth record over the decade 1965-75 has been good.
Rapid growth of both the agricultural and industrial sectors, which recorded
average annual growth rates in constant prices of 5% and 10% respectively,
enabled real GDP to expand at an average rate of 7.5% annually.     The country
also achieved impressive investment and savings rates throughout this period.
Gross domestic capital formation ranged from 20% to 27% of GDP, with private
fixed investment constituting at least two thirds of total fixed investment
each year. The share of gross domestic savings in GDP ranged from 19% to 22%.
As a result, in no year did the resource gap (import surplus needed to finance
the levels of consumption and investment achieved) exceed 5% of GDP, and was
considerably less in most years.
6.        However, over the Third Plan period 1972-76, the growth rate, esti-
mated at 6.2% p.a., fell short of the 7% target, as a result, inter alia, of:
(a) slower growth in agriculture (4% instead of the targeted 5%), where
progress in intensifying production techniques has been slow; (b) a cautious
fiscal policy that substantially reduced real public investment in 1973/74;
and (c) the international recession of 1974/75, which particularly affected
export industries such as the textile and clothing industry.
7.        The economy has recovered steadily from the deceleration which
began in the second half of 1974. The growth rate of real GDP rose from 4.6%
in 1974 to 5.5% in 1975, and a growth rate of close to 6.5% is estimated for
1976. In sharp contrast to the situation in 1973/74, when the external sector
and private investment provided the main stimuli to growth, the much-needed
stimuli to demand in 1975 and 1976 came from the public sector. With a strong
expansion in export receipts reinforcing the growth of dc    stic c.-nand in the
latter year.  Receipts from merchandise exports rca2 by 31% in 1976, mainly due
to volume gains. Preliminary data suggest that private investment in 1976 fell
somewhat from the peak level of 18% of GDP attained in 1974 and 1975.
8 .       Both in 1975 and 1976 the balance of payments registered much higher
current account deficits than in the previous years ($600 million in 1975 and
$500 million in 1976 compared to $90 million in 1974), The major reason
for the larger current account deficits is 'he deterioration in Thailand's
terms of trade which declined by almost 20% between 1973 and 1975. In 1974,
mainly due to the hike in oil prices, the import price index rose by over 50%;



a substantial improvement in prices of most of the country's major exports,
however, helped to limit the decline in the terms of trade to about 10%. In
1975, on the other hand, although import price increases moderated, export
prices stabilized or fell and there was a further substantial fall in the
terms of trade. For 1976, the decline in the terms of trade is estimated at
under 5%.
9.        In spite of increased foreign borrowing by the public sector in
1975, total net capital inflows were lower than in the previous year because
of a substantial reduction in net private capital inflows. Direct private
foreign investment declined from $137 million in 1974 to $65 million in 1975,
and private loans and credits also fell significantly, while sizeable repay-
ments began on loans contracted in 1974. As a consequence of the higher current
account deficit and lower net capital inflows, reserves, which had increased
in 1974, declined by $195 million to $1,369 million in 1975. Although there
was some improvement in foreign direct investment, total private inflows
declined further in 1976. Public capital inflows, on the other hand, increased
substantially as the country's first Eurodollar loan of $100 million was drawn
down and project loans committed in 1974/75 began to be disbursed. Taking
into account an SDR 67 million loan under the IMF's compensatory financing
scheme, the overall balance of payments in 1976 recorded a small surplus. The
country's reserves equalled about 4-1/2 months imports at the end of 1976.
10.       Thailand enjoyed a large measure of price stability in 1975 and 1976.
Slower demand growth, stable export prices and a moderate increase in import
prices limited the rise in the consumer price index to 5.3% in 1975, a sharp
deceleration from an annual average increase of 20% in 1973 and 1974. The rate
of inflation in 1976 amounted to only 4.2%.
Development Objectives, Constraints and Prospects
11.       Achieving a satisfactory rate of economic and social development
over the next few years will require policy initiatives in a number of areas.
In particular, important objectives in the country's development strategy will
continue to be: (a) substantial improvement in agricultural yields; (b) revital-
ization of the industrial sector with greater emphasis on export-oriented
industries; (c) faster employment growth; and (d) improvement in the distri-
bution of regional and personal incomes. Lack of reliable statistics have
prevented a full understanding of problems of employment and income distribu-
tion in the past. Studies currently underway within the Government and in
the Bank will help to define these problems more clearly.
12.       A further problem that has received increasing attention is the
country's relatively high rate of population growth.     Starting in the late
1960s the Government has given steadily increasing attention to fertility
reduction. Considerable success has been achieved in developing a national
family planning program, and the population growth rate:has been reduced from



-4-
over 3% in the late 1960s to an estimated 2.6% today.   The crude birth rate
is estimated to have fallen from 42 to 34 (per thousand)/1; a further drop
to 29-30 (per thousand) is targeted for 19819 for which a growth rate of
2.1% has been set. Encouraging progress has been made in recruiting
acceptors from the rural areas as well as from cities and towns. Achieving
the 1981 demographic targets will depend on a strengthening and expansion
of rural health and family planning services, including their extension to
the village level, and on continuing the Ministry of Public Health's past
success in upgrading the effectiveness of the contraceptive "mix". A
greater effort to strengthen long-term demand for family planning will be
launched during the Fourth Plan (1977-81), as more acceptors will have to
come from groups whose motivation is now weak.
13.       The implementation of policies needed for a satisfactory rate of
economic and social progress will require a steady increase in public expendi-
tures over the next few years. Public expenditures have increased substanti-
ally in nominal terms since 1974, but these increases have merely restored
the share of the public sector in the country's resources to that prevailing
before 1973/74, when public spending declined in real terms as a result of
an anti-inflationary policy. A reasonably ambitious development program for
the next few years will also require much greater efforts to mobilize both
domestic and external resources than in the Third Plan period. With the
economy's steady recovery, the need for prudent deficit financing has lessened;
consequently, the recent decline in the rate of public savings will need to be
reversed, At the same time, the deterioration in the country's terms of trade
has raised substantially the external capital flows needed for achieving a
satisfactory rate of growth.
14.       The recent evolution of policy concerns and strategies is reflected
in the Fourth Five-Year National Economic and Social Development Plan
(1977-8i) The plan's principal objectives include a growth target of 7%,
a more equitable distribution of income, reduction in the rate of population
growth and faster generation of employment opportunities. The Plan discusses
sectoral issues and strategies only in broad terms and will have limited
operational significance unless it is supplemented by proposals of investment
commi tments for at least the next two to three years. The new Government
has approved the Plan0 The Plan proposes public sector development expendi-
tures of $1/2.5 billion for the Plan period as compared to an estimated
level of $4o6 billion achieved over the Third Plan period (1972-76).
Although this level implies a doubling of development qxpen6i'Cur .  in real
terms, it will raise the share of public investment    n GVŽ from 5% over the
Third Flan to only 6% over the Fourth Plan period. The size of the public
sector development program cannot, therefore, be considered overly ambitious.
15.       The financirng of this program is likely to require commitments of
about $3-3.5 billion in project financing and further public borrowing of
/L The current population growth and birth rates quoted here differ from
the '"most recent estimates" given in Annex I because the latter refer
to average rates for 1970-75 (to achieve comparability among countries).



-5-
$500-700 million through sources such as Eurocurrency loans, suppliers'
credits and industrial countries' export financing facilities. At their
meeting of March 22 and 23, 1977, members of the Consultative Group considered
these amounts reasonable. These external borrowing requirements should not
place a heavy burden on the country's debt servicing capacity. The projected
public sector external borrowing would raise the public debt service ratio
(service payments on public debt as a percentage of exports) from 2.6% in 1975
to 4.7% in 1981. The debt service ratio for total debt, which amounted to
15.4% in 1975, is projected to remain below 17% throughout the Fourth Plan
period.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.       Thailand first borrowed from the Bank in 1950 and has received 37
loans amounting to $865.9 million, net of cancellations. Mlost of these have
been for transportation ($186.1 million), irrigation ($163.8 million) and power
($166 million) with, in addition, one for a dual-purpose power and irrigation
project ($65.8 million). The remaining loans have been for water supply
($55 million), telecommunications ($63 million), education ($52.3 million),
industry ($38 million), rural development ($21 million), livestock ($5 mil-
lion) and rubber replanting ($50 million). A loan for a national agricultural
extension project ($28 million) has been signed, but is not yet effective. In
addition, Thailand has received three IDA credits one, for $19.5 million, for
education and two, for a total of $12.5 million, for irrigation improvement.
In general, Bank-financed projects have been carried out in accordance with
expectations. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments (as of June 30, 1977), as well as notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
17.       The Bank is diversifying its lending program in Thailand.    In the
next few years a smaller proportion of lending is planned for transportation
and power projects, while projects to support a broad range of agricultural
development, rural infrastructure, family planning, education, small- and
medium-scale industries and low-cost housing cum slum improvement would
account for about two thirds of the proposed program. Increasingly, projects
are selected and designed to spread development benefits to the lower
income groups and the most neglected areas; one of the main functions of
the Bank's Regional Mission in Bangkok is to assist the Government in
developing projects aimed at this goal. The Bank's readiness to finance
some local costs in appropriate cases will enable the Bank to participate
more fully in projects in the agricultural and social sectors that have
significant social benefits.
18.       For FY77 and FY78, in addition to the recently approved national
agricultural extension and Chao Phya irrigation loans, the rural population
will be assisted by loans to be proposed for rural electrification, an irriga-
tion project in the northeast and a population project to improve health and



- 6 -
family planning services at the village level. A DFC project, approved last
year, will stimulate uwedium-scale industry development; an industrial estates
project would also help attract anid develop small- and medium-scale industrikes
outside the metropolitan, area.  Othler projects are low-income housing in
Bangkok and provincial highlways.
19.       As of December 31, 1976, Bank loans and IDA credits disbuirsed and
outstanding amounted to $309 million, representing about 38% of public
external debt (disbursed and outstanding). This is not excessive in view of
Thailand's modest overall, pubblic external debt (5.2% of GDP in 1976).  In
addition, although the level. of Bank c.ormnitments is expected to increase over
the next five years, the Bank Group's share is expected to decline rapidly to
about 30% of total public external debt in 1982. The Bank's share in total
debt outstanding would remain at about 20%, and its share of debt service is
not expected to exceed 10%.
20.       IFC has made two equity investrmenLs in the Induiscrial Finance
Corporation of Thailand totaling $380,000, two loaiic to and an investment in
the Siam Cement group totaling $32.08 millior, a loan of $30O,000 to Concrete
Products Ltd., an equity investment of approximately $300,000 in the Mutual
Fund Company Ltd. and, zaore recently, a loan for $2.5 million anid an equity
investment of $200,000 in United Sugar Terminal Co.    Prospects for other IFC
operations are reasonably good; IFC has been asked to arrange .hpe debt financ-
ing of approximately $50 million f"or a  91C million zinc mining and refinery
project.   Prospective projects are the development of privately sponsored
industrial estates and a chermical prcject to produce carbon black for domestic
Lire manufacrurers,  The Capital. Markets Dep.rtment has boon invited to assist
the Govern:nent Housing Bank and is appraising a project to provide loanls
to small business througlh local commercial banks.

whiich is substantial-, but polit.cal and rc.-ettlement problerms make such
development unlikely in Lt>o olear term.



7 _
23.       Coal deposits are estimated at about 150 million tons of which about
75 million tons are commercially exploitable. Proven reserves of petroleum
are negligible, but off-shore drilling in the Gulf of Thailand has indicated
the possibility of a gas deposit which could generate about 1,000 MW over a
30-year period. Oil shale deposits are estimated at about 2,700 million
barrels which, if economically exploitable, could meet Thailand's domestic
requirements at the current rate of consumption for about 50 years.
Power Production and Distribution
24.       Electricity demand and generation grew by about 19% annually over
the past decade, reaching 1,483 MW/i and 8,866 Gwh respectively in 1975.
Electricity demand is expected to continue growing rapidly, largely as the
result of an accelerated program to electrify rural areas, for which the Govern-
ment has requested Bank assistance. By 1986, demand is expected to reach about
4,192 MW and generation, about 24,966 Gwh - a very large increase in both
relative and absolute terms.
25.       At present only 22% of the population has access to electricity;
a large proportion of those served live in Bangkok and its environs, where the
greatest concentration of industry and commerce is located. As the result of
the accelerated rural electrification program, however, some 45% of all house-
holds are expected to be electrified by 1983.
26.       Electricity generation and distribution is the responsibility of
three separate statutory corporations, established by the State but enjoying
considerable operating autonomy. The Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand (EGAT), to which the proposed loan would be made, has major responsi-
bility for generation and transmission; it sells energy in bulk to large
industrial consumers and to the two power distribution authorities. The
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) is responsible for supplying elec-
tricity in the Bangkok metropolitan area, and the Provincial Electricity
Authority (PEA) supplies electricity to the rest of the country. In 1975,
EGAT accounted for 93% of all electricity generated, the balance being gener-
ated by PEA in areas not yet connected to the grid and by several self-
generating industries.
Sector Tariff Policies
27.       The Acts establishing EGAT, MEA and PEA each give their respective
Board of Directors the power to fix rates to their consumers. In practice,
however, all tariff adjustments must first be considered by an inter-agency
tariff committee and are then submitted to the Cabinet for approval. Tariff
policies proved adequate throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the
/1   Excluding self-generating industries wnich in 1975 had a generating capa-
city of 211 MW.



- 8 -
financial position of the sector remained strong; in fact, all three agencies
were able to reduce their tariffs periodically due to conservative financial
management, economies of scale and consequent reduction in unit costs.
28.       The picture altered with the fuel crisis in 1973.    After decades of
stable prices in Thailand, tariffs were increased in 1974 by about 50% to com-
pensate for the increased cost of fuel to EGAT. The Government took steps to
protect consumers from additional price increases: it requested extension of
a mid-1974 deadline for introducing a fuel adjustment clause in EGAT's tariff
schedules as called for under Loan 977-TH and subsequently decided to subsidize
the cosc of fuel to EGAT, thereby lessening the need for such a clause0 To
cushion further the impact of the rising cost of sector operations, the Govern-
ment (a) reduced the tax element on oil fuel supplied to EGAT, (b) exempted
MEA from remitting surplus funds to the Treasury, (c) extended EGAT's tax
holiday from 1976 to 1982, and (d) rescheduled and deferred EGAT's loans and
repayments to the Government. In addition, to encourage the use of electricity
in rural areas, the Government lowered PEA's domestic tariffs in 1975. To
offset PEA's losses, tariffs were raised for EGAT's and MEA's industrial
consumers, and the increased revenues generated were passed to PEA through a
reduction in the cost of bulk power delivered by EGAT to PEA. With sector
tariffs trailing costs, cash generation from the sector became inadequate to
maintain the sector's financial viability.
29.       In 1976 Bank staff visited Thailand at the request of the Government
(a) to review the financial requirements of the power sector, (b) to determine
an economically justifiable time frame for rural electrification, and (c) to
recommend imieasures necessary to maintain the sector's financial viability.
Their review concluded that vwhile EGAT's financial position had been maintained.
l1EA's had deteriorated as PEA's share of the market increased, Also, the
Government had assumed a heavy burden of subsidies while foregoing tax revenues
and remittances.   As an immediate measure to alleviate the situation, the
staff recommended a i15 increase in average tariffs for FY77-79., It also
recommended (a) that the fuel subsidy be discontinued and variations in fuel
costs be automatically passed on to consumers through the introduetion of a
fuel adjustment clause, and (b) that a tariff study be undertaken to establish
a simplified but uniform tariff system which reflects marginal cost structures
as well as tariff levels to ensure the sector"s financial viabiliiy from FY79
and independence from government support.
30.       The Government has acted upon all the above rec3mr1   d:        It
has discontinued subsidizing the cost of fuel to EGAT       1ci .as introduced
a fuel adjustment clause in EGAT's tariff schedule.    The Cabinet has approved
an increase in sector tariffs averaging about 29%, which is sufficient to
cover the removal of the fuel subsidy and also ensure the financial viability
of the sector. The tariff increase became effective on August 1; it is stipu-
lated as a condition for effectiveness of the proposed loan (Section 7.01 of
the draft Loan Agreement). The recommended tariff study will be carried out
under the proposed project (paragraph 38).

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
31.       The feasibility study and preliminary design report for development
of a multi-purpose dam at Pattani were prepared by Sverdrup and Parcel Inter-
national, Inc. (SPI) of San Francisco in 1969 and 1974 respectively. In late
1975, EGAT approached the Bank to help finance the hydro-electric components
of the project; a preappraisal mission in early 1976 recommended further
geological investigations at the site and updating of cost estimates which
were satisfactorily completed by October of that year. The project was
appraised in November/December 1976. Negotiations took place in Washington
from May 10 to 13, 1977. The Thai delegation was led by Dr. Amnuay Viravan,
Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Finance, assisted by Khun Kasame
Chatikavanij, General Manager ,of EGAT.
Project Description
32.       The project is an important part of EGAT's expansion program for
the period 1977-86 and will help meet the country's rapidly growing demand for
electricity; it plays a key role in the development program for the Southern
region, which is not yet integrated with the national grid and where there is
considerable poverty. The project incudes: (a) the development of a multi-
purpose dam on the Pattani River with an annual energy output of 200 Gwh and an
installed capacity of 60 MW; (b) expansion of the existing 115 KV transmission
system and substations to support PEA's rural electrification program in
selected areas throughout the country; and (c) a study of power tariffs.
Details are provided in the report entitled "Thailand - Appraisal of the
Pattani Hydro-electric Project" (No. 1447-TH, dated July 25, 1977), which is
being distributed separately-,to the Executive Directors.
33.       Pattani:  Physical-'Facilities.  The Pattani/hydro-electric develop-
ment, located about 825 km south of Bangkok in the extreme south of Peninsular
Thailand, will consist of an 85 m high and 422 m long rock-filled dam with a
total volume of about 2.9 million cu m.   The reservoir will have an effective
storage capacity of 995 millionicu m, about 70% of average annual inflow.   An
open channel chute-type spillway controlled by tw6o'radial gates will be
located in the right abutment. The intake will be built in a combined structure
with the spillway. It will be provided with a semi-circular trashrack and a
fixed wheel type gate. It will feed into an underground power conduit of
welded steel pipe embedded in concrete. The powerhouse will be a surface type
reinforced concrete structure, located below the dam. It is designed to house
3 units of 20 MW each. The switchyard will be located on the southeast end of
the power house and equipped with switching and protection equipment. A 115 KV
double circuit line will transmit the power to the Yala substation about 40 km
away.
34.       A total of 3,256 people now living in the project area will be
resettled. When EGAT organized a visit for area residents to the successful
resettlement program at Ban Chao Nen, their only additional request was that
their plots (about 3.2 ha per family) be cleared for them; EGAT agreed.



- 10 -
Resettlers will build their homes from the compensation paid by EGAT; EGAT
will provide electricity, water supply, roads and service centers as well as a
subsistence allowance of $50/month per family to those settlers planting
rubber trees until the trees reach maturity in the sixth year. The allocation
for resettlement ($4,500/head) is adequate; it is about six times that provided
under the Ban Chao Nen project because of the relatively high amount required
to compensate the inhabitants for their existing rubber stands. A detailed
resettlement plan will be sent to the Bank for approval by March 31, 1978, and
its implementation will be coordinated by an interagency committee appointed
by the Government (Section 3.02 of draft Guarantee Agreement).
35.       Although not included in the proposed project, irrigation of approxi--
mately 60,000 hectares downstream will be made possible by the proposed dam
construction. The Royal Irrigation Department will construct the necessary
diversion dams and irrigation and drainage systems, flood control dykes,
structures and channel improvements, the design of which is being carried out
by SPIo The Government has given assurances that these complementary irrigation
works will be carried out in a timely manner (Section 3.06 of the draft Guarantee
Agreement), and we understand ADB has been approached to provide some of the
financing.
36.       Engineering Services. EGAT has engaged SPI, the consultants who
carried out the preliminary design work, for the preparation of tender documents
and evaluation of bids for the main civil works and equipment.    EGAT intends to
continue the services of SPI for the detailed design and supervision of contruc-
tion. This is a satisfactory arrangement. In view of the importance of the
work and difficult geology of the site, EGAT has also decided to avail itself
of the services of the International Consulting Board, which it retained for the
Ban Chao Nen project being financed under Loan 977-THo
37.       Transmission SYstem Expansion.   The existing transmission system
and substations of EGAT have to be expanded to meet the increasing load
requirements. Included i.n the proposed project is a part of EGAT's Transmis-
sion System Expansion Project No, 3 (1977-81) specificall,y designed co support
the rural electrification program of PEA in the northern, northleastern and
southern regions.   Altogether, some 427 km of 115 KV transmIssion lines are Lo
be constructed as well as associated substations and facilities.
38.       Tariff StuL.    A tariff study will be carried out by the Governments
Gommittee for Power Policy and Development to ascertain the ma :ina_ costs of
supplying power to consumers at different voltage leve,.c. Consultants would
be employed to assist the Committee if the Bank so recommended (Section 3.02
of the draft Loan Agreement). The study report would be expected to recommend
a single tariff schedule Lo be charged consumers by MEA and PEA with .he
object of eli.minating all capital and operating subsidies from the sector and
assessing the effect cf taxacion on the sector, It would also recommscnd the
manner of transferring cash to PEA (provincial areas) from MEA. (Bangkok area),
possibly by EGAT continuing to charge FLA a loweir price for bulk power than
it charges MEA.  Tariff schedules for EGAT's bulk power would also b.e recommended.
The Government will ensure that all data necessary to carry out the study are



provided by EGAT, MEA and PEA (Section 3.03(a) of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
Recommendations arising from the study and mutually accepted by the Government
and the Bank will be implemented by October 1,,1978 (Section 3.07 of draft
Loan Agreement and Section 3.03(b) of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
The Borrower, EGAT
39.       EGAT was established in 1968 by the merger of three public electri-
city authorities (the Yanhee Electricity Authority, the Northeast Electricity
Authority, and the Lignite Authority) for the purpose of increasing the effi-
ciency of electric supply throughout the country and to coordinate the genera-
tion and transmission systems. It is financially sound, well-organized and
well-operated, functioning as a modern public utility with a considerable
degree of autonomy. The Authority possesses a well-trained and competent
operational staff and an able, well-qualified and energetic General Manager.
40.       The Bank has made seven loans totaling $232 million to EGAT and its
main predecessor, the Yanhee Electricity Authority; the first in 1957 and the
most recent in 1974. The projects financed with the help of these loans have
included dam construction and equipment for hydro and thermal generation,
transmission and substation facilities. Projects financed under the first
six loans have been completed and are all operating satisfactorily. The first
project performance audit was made in April 1976 for Loan 655-TH. It indicated
that the objectives of the project had been met and that EGAT's financial
performance had been satisfactory, all financial covenants having been adhered
to. The most recent loan (977-TH) is helping to finance the Ban Chao Nen
hydro-electric project. Construction is progressing well, slightly ahead of
schedule.
41.       From 1976 to 1986, energy generation by EGAT is forecast to increase
at an average annual rate of 10%, requiring (at current prices) construction
expenditures amounting in the years 1977-83 to $2.2 billion, including interest
during construction. (The proposed project represents about 7% of this program.)
This expenditure compares with fixed assets of about $700 million in 1976.
During this period EGAT will continue to rely mainly on hydro and conventional
thermal power, but a nuclear facility is also being considered. The program
is based on least cost solutions and is judged to meet the country's needs
adequately. To meet this program, EGAT plans to borrow 63% abroad to cover
foreign costs, 20% will be borrowed locally, and 17% will be contributed from
self-generated funds.
42.       Since FY74 when the Bank last lent to EGAT, the Authority's financial
position has remained sound. Rates of return have varied between 7.4% and
-9.;8%; debt service coverage has been better than 1.8; the self financing
requiirement of 30% as defined under Loan 977-TH has been adequately met; the
debt/equity ratio of 58/42 and the current ratio of 1.7 at end FY76 were
satisfactory.'
43.       Underi.reasonabie assumptions, including the necessary recent increase
in tariffs, EGAT's financial position will remain sound. In the years 1978-83,
its contribution from earnings to its investment program would average 17%;



- 12 -
the rate of return on currently valued net fixed assets would be about 6% in
1978, 5% in 1979, and about 10% from 1980 onward; the debt/equity ratio would
not exceed 56/44; the current ratio would not drop below 1.7; and debt service
coverage would range between 1.5 and 2.5 times on an annual basis. Suitable
financial covenants incorporating the major assumptions are included in the
draft Loan Agreement. In particular, the Authority has agreed that in FY78
and FY79, it will contribute at least 15% from self-generated funds toward the
financing of its investment program and from FY80, the contribution to construc-
tion will amount to 20%; that it will maintain a debt/equity ratio of no more
than 60/40; that, except as the Bank might otherwise agree, it will limit its
short and medium term debt to 15% of total debt; and that, for the purpose of
its financial forecasts, it will revalue its assets annually (Sections 5.04,
5.05, 5.06 and 5.07 respectively of the draft Loan Agreement).
Cost Estimates
44.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $144.6 million equiva-
lent, including $3.4 million in taxes and duties but excluding $15.1 million
in interest during construction, and has a foreign exchange component of
$71.1 million. The estimates for the hydro-electric development are based on
the level of bid prices received for the main civil works contract (para. 48)
and take into account design changes recommended by the International Consulting
Board which are now being reviewed by EGAT. Total contingencies amount to
about 26% of base (end-1976) costs.   Costs are summarized in the following table:

Financing
45.       Project costs will be met by the proposed Bank loan of $50 million;
by a loan of $20 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development
(KFAED); by a loan from commercial banks totalling $20 million; by an equity
contribution from the Government of about $29.3 million and by EGAT's self-
generated funds ($40.4 million). The Bank loan would be used to finance (a)
part of the foreign costs of the main civil works, (b) the foreign exchange
costs of equipment for resettlement, (c) the foreign exchange costs of the
transmission system expansion, (d) related engineering services, (e) consulting
services for the tariff study should these be needed, and (f) interest during
construction (IDC) on the proposed loan. The Bank loan (less $9.6 million for
IDC) constitutes about 29% of total project costs excluding taxes and duties.
The inclusion of IDC is justified on the basis of EGAT's cash flow position,
which would be extremely tight unless most major borrowings for its 1977-83
development program include an amount to cover IDC.
46.       The KFAED loan would cover the foreign exchange costs of hydro-
mechanical and electro-mechanical equipment for the Pattani development and
associated transmission works and engineering services. The loan has recently
been negotiated and is expected to be signed in December 1977. The commercial
bank loan would be applied toward part of the costs (both foreign and local)
of the main civil works. That loan has also been negotiated and is expected
to be signed shortly. Effectiveness of the commercial bank loan is a condition
for effectiveness of the proposed IBRD loan. The Government contribution, to
be applied toward local project costs, represents the portion of costs
allocated to irrigation (Section 2.02(b) of draft Guarantee Agreement). In
addition, the Government will finance downstream irrigation works, perhaps
with assistance from the ADB (paragraph 35).
Procurement and Implementation Schedule
47.       All civil works, materials and equipment will be procured under
international competitive bidding procedures, with the exception of civil
works in connection with site preparation and resettlemernt which will be
carried out by EGAT's work force, supplemented by local contractors. Bank-
financed items will be procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines with the
Bank's usual preference of 15% (or customs duties if less) being granted to
local manufacturers. Items financed by the Kuwait Fund will follow KFAED
procurement guidelines.
48.       Because the Pattani project site is situated in a remote and politi-
cally unstable area, the Bank and EGAT agreed that it would be desirable
to obtain bids prior to negotiations for the proposed loan. Specifications
and tender documents for the civil works contract were issued with Bank
approval in December 1976. Bids were received from three qualified firms and
were opened on April 10, 1977, several weeks before loan negotiations. The
results were incorporated in the cost estimates. EGAT proposes to award
the contract in August/September 1977, soon after financing arrangements are
completed.



- 14 -
49.       For equipment contracts, tenders will be issued in mid-1977 and
contracts awarded in early 1978. Civil works construction will be started in
late 1977 and completed by early 1981. Filling of the reservoir would commence
in the wet season of 1980 and all three units are scheduled to be commissioned
before the end of 1981. Total construction time is about 4-1/2 years.
Specification and tender documents for the transmission system expansion will
be issued in early 1978 and awarded before end 1978. All lines and substations
are scheduled for completion before end 1981. The tariff study will begin in
late 1977. The draft report should be finalized before mid-1978 for implemen-
tation by October 1, 1978.
Disbursements
50.       Disbursements from the proposed Bank loan would be made at the rate
of 100% of the foreign exchange cost of directly imported equipment and
materials, 100% of the ex-factory cost of equipment and materials manufactured
locally, and 65% of total expenditures for imported equipment and materials
procured locally. Disbursements for civil works and transmission lines would
be at 42% and 50%, respectively, of total expenditures. For the consulting
and engineering services, disbursements would be at the rate of 100% of the
foreign exchange costs. Disbursements by the Bank would be completed by
December 31, 1982.
Justification
51.       The Pattani hydro-electric development has been evaluated on a
regional basis. From a national perspective, the power output from the project
will satisfy only a small part of the large increase in demand which can reason-
ably be expected over the next decade and which must be met if the economy is
to achieve a satisfactory rate of growth. Regionally, however, the project
represents a key input in EGAT's development program to satisfy demand in the
South, where the power system will remain relatively isolated from the main
system even when a 40 MW capacity tie line is completed in 1979. The Southern
region lags behind much of the rest of the country in its development:    while
per capita income is close to the national average at $342 (1975), power con-
sumption is low, averaging only about 60 Kwh per capita in 1975, as compared
to the national average of 176 Kwh.   The Government is giving emphasis to
development of the region, however, and demand for electricity is growing
rapidly, averaging 17% per annum since 1971.
52.       Generating capacity in the southern region will total 160.6 MW
by 1978 when EGAT will have completed installation of two 15 MW gas turbines at
Hat Yai. Peak demand in 1976 was 90.7 MW, an increase of 29% over the previous
year. Assuming an average annual growth in demand of 13% between 1976 and
1981, this capacity will be surpassed by the latter year. A comparison between
Pattani and the most realistic alternative thermal program confLrmed that
the proposed project constitutes the least cost method for meeting this
additional demand.



-15-
53.       The sum of total investment costs, operating costs and fuel costs
of the two alternatives were compared on a present worth basis. Efficiency
prices were used with foreign exchange costs shadow priced at a ratio of 1.1
and unskilled local labor at a ratio of 0.5. The Pattani project was found
to be the least cost solution for discount rates up to 12%. If the $29.3 mil-
lion of Government equity is considered as the minimum capitalized value of
downstream benefits, the equalizing discount rate would be 20%. The internal
rate of return for the project, or the discount rate at which the present
worth of costs attributed to the project is equal to that of the benefits over
its life, is about 11% in constant prices, with all costs allocated to power.
54.       No rate of return has been calculated for the proposed expansion of
the transmission system to support PEA's rural electrification program, as it
is difficult to identify that portion of system revenues properly attributable
to the expansion involved. However, the total program itself is considered
economically sound and the first five-year slice has been appraised for a
possible Bank loan.
Ecology
55.       In 1975, EGAT engaged the Southeast Asia Technology Co. Ltd., in
association with the National Institute of Devlopment Administration and
Mahidol University, to carry out an environmental and ecological investigation
of the Pattani multipurpose project. The study covers land and water resources,
forestry, fisheries, mining, aquatic plants, wildlife, archaeology, health,
socio-economic aspects, and resettlement. A draft summary report, completed
in 1976, concludes that there is no single ecological consequence or combina-
tion of consequences, which is so significantly important as to preclude
construction of the project. The report also recommended further monitoring
on both a short-term and a long-term basis which EGAT has agreed to do
(see Section 3.06 of draft Loan Agreement).
Risks
56.       EGAT has minimized the risks to the project to the extent possible.
As mentioned above, the Authority has engaged an International Consulting
Board whose advice will be sought if any unusual technical problems arise. To
preclude the possibility of uneconomically high bid prices for the main civil
works due to the political instability of the area, tenders were opened in
April 1977. Bids were satisfactory and the results have been incorporated
into the project cost estimates.   To minimize potential problems during
project execution, EGAT has gathered the support of area residents, developing
a mutually satisfactory resettlement scheme and offering them employment
during the construction period.   The fact that EGAT has been on site since
April 1976 without incident suggests that the project is welcomed as part of
the Government's increased effort to speed development of this relatively
neglected region. Remaining risks are not judged to be great enough to
preclude proceeding with the project.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
(as of June 30, 1977)
Loan Nc. 822 Second Education Project (Kasetsart University); $15.4 Million
Loan of May 24, 1972; Effective Date: August 22, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Due to initial delays, previously reported, the project is
about one year behind schedule. About half of the total civil works
($24.0 million) have been awarded to contractors and construction is
progressing well. Bid packages amounting to $7.5 million are in the process
of being awarded. The specialist services program under the project is
nearly completed. Recommendations of consultants for improvement of teaching,
research and extension activities have been well received and are now being
implemented by the university staff. With help of consultants, major revisions
on the curricula of the different faculties of the University are being
prepared. Total project cost will exceed appraisal estimates by 33%, which
the Government will finance. Disbursements are expected to increase by 75%
by the end of 1977.
Loan No. 864 Telecommunications Project; $37 Million Loan of December 5,
1972; Effective Date: March 1, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The project is about two years behind schedule because of initial
delays in procurement. Procurement action on all Bank-financed items is now
substantially complete and the loan amount has been committed. Over 50% of the
local telephone network expansion under the project is complete and the balance
will be completed by Miarch 1978, 18 months behind schedule. However, because
of delays in procurement of the microwave systems under a bilateral loan, the
long-distance network expansion under the project will be completed only in
December 1978, two years behind schedule. About $35 million is expected to
be disbursed from the loan by the current Closing Date; the Borrower has
requested an extension.
/1   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors re-arding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 870 Fifth Highway Project; $28.6 Million Loan of December 26, 1972;
Effective Date: March 26, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Works under the project have been divided into nine contracts of
which four have now been completed. Work on seven of the contracts was
interrupted in 1974 because rapid increases in costs led to financial prob-
lems for the contractors since, despite the Bank's recommendation, the
contracts provided only for costs escalation on petroleum products while
costs of materials, labor, equipment, and spare parts also escalated rapidly.
Work was resumed on three contracts after renegotiating the contract prices
with the Government. The other four contracts were terminated by agreement
between the Government and the contractors. In one case, a new contract was
awarded to the third lowest of the original bidders, at a price lower than
was acceptable to the second lowest bidder or to the original contractor. On
the riemaining three contracts, new bids were obtained for completing the
works' cobntracts were awarded and work was resumed in early 1976.   Over 75%
of theiwork has been completed.   Because of higher prices in the bids for
completing the unfinished work, total cost of the project is expected to be
around $75 million, or about 28% above the appraisal estimate, with Government
financing the overruns. In spite of these difficulties the project is likely
to be completed no more than one year behind the original schedule. The
highway maintenance study and feasibility studies for future projects have
been completed, and detailed engineering of the roads found to be feasible is
nearly completed.
Credit No. 369 Third Education Project; $19.5 Million Credit of April 11,
1973; Effective Date: August 8, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
Project implementation remains about 12 months behind schedule,
but past problems concerning weak management, overcommitment of the staff,
lengthy and cumbersome approval procedures, lack of funds, and late recruit-
ment of technical assistance have largely been overcome. The project manage-
ment and procurement procedures have been strengthened considerably through
steps initiated as part of the Fourth Education Project (Loan 1271-TH).
Adequate provisions have been made to meet the expected cost overruns and
noticeable progress was achieved in civil works, procurement and technical
assistance. About 90% of the total civil works contracts and 60% of the
total furniture and equipment contracts have been signed. Technical assis-
tance is keeping pace with physical facilities. Project costs are now esti-
mated at $60 million, 50% above the appraisal estimate.
Credit No. 379 Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project; $5.5 Million
Credit of May 9, 1973; Effective Date: August 23, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project is about 90% completed. Until recently, project
construction and disbursements were in line with appraisal estimates.



ANNEX II
Page 6
In 1976, force account construction continued satisfactorily but administra-
tive problems caused a delay in the employment of contractors until the 1977
working season. A project extension service has been set up and is operating
satisfactorily.
Loan No. 898 Fourth Railways Project; $15 Million Loan of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: September 28, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977_
Parts of the project are behind schedule by about 18 months due to
slow procurement. However, apart from rails needed for track renewal (now
being financed by the Government), all material has been received. The
remaining item financed by the loan, technical assistance, should soon com-
mence, under a contract now being negotiated with consultants. The growth
in passenger traffic slowed in 1975/76, due to passenger fares being increased
in November 1975. Freight traffic has commenced to grow again (6% in 1975/76)
and further increases are expected in following years, mainly due to increased
cement production. Despite the tariff increases of late 1975, the SRT failed
to earn any return in 1975/76, (against the prescribed 2% rate of return),
but, with the increased traffic, it expects to earn 0.8% in the current year,
together with a debt service coverage of 1.4 times (against 0.4 times in
1975/76)   At request of Borrower, Closing Date is being extended to
December 31, 1977.
Credit No. 461 Northeast Irrigation Improvement Project; $7 Million Credit
of February 19, 1974; Effective Date: October 7, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project is about one year behind schedule through delays in
appointing consultants and in procuring earthmoving equipment. During the
1976/77 working season there has been a marked improvement in the pace of
construction, especially on the tertiary canals. Progress in rehabilitation of
main canal systems has been satisfactory although somewhat behind schedule.
Encouraging progress is being made in developing agricultural extension services
in the project areas. The estimated project cost is $24.7 million, or about
96% over the appraisal estimate. In part, the increased cost is due to price
inflation being higher than foreseen at appraisal. Also, a large part of the
increase is due to a decision to provide new tertiary canals over the entire
project area and to adopt higher standards for tertiary development than
envisioned at appraisal. The higher costs are compensated for by increases in
projected commodity prices and the economic rate of return is now estimated at
28% compared to 22% at appraisal.. Progress on the rainfed rice component is
satisfactory.

Loan No. 977 Ban Chao Nen Hydroelectric Project; $75 Million Loan of
April 15, 1974; Effective Date:  June 14, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980
Construction of the project is slightly ahead of schedule.
Loan No. 992 Second Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT)
Project; $12.0 Million Loan of June 4, 1974; Effective
Date: September 4, 1974; Closing Date: September 30, 1978
The full amount of the $12 million loan has been committed. The
commitment was more rapid than originally estimated. Disbursements have also
been very satisfactory. Since June 1974 when the loan was made, IFCT's
financial condition has continued to be good.
Loan No. 1021 Bangkok Water Supply Project; $55 Million Loan of June 28,
1974; Effective Date: December 2, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
Owing to considerable delays in contract awards, some of which
have been retendered, the project completion may be delayed by about 12
months beyond the original schedule, i.e. until mid-1979. Consequently,
disbursements are lagging behind the earlier estimates but no change in the
Closing Date seems necessary at this time. Financial performance of MIWWA
continues to be less than satisfactory. The Borrower is taking steps to
improve its billing and collection of revenue and has asked its consultants
to evaluate its leakage control programs to reduce high volume of unaccounted
for water.  Proposals for increase in tariffs are also receiving Government's
consideration.
Loan No. 1149 Phitsanulok Irrigation Project; $95 Mlillion Loan of
July 25, 1975; Effective Date: October 31, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
As a result of delays in hiring consultants, the start of major
construction was delayed by about a year. However, tenders were recently
received on the first major civil works contract; most of the equipment for
the project is now on order and prospects are good that no further serious
delays will occur. The on-farm works are proceeding on schedule, with two
pilot projects in operation and four more nearing completion.   The consulting
services for the project were recently reorganized to provide a nucleus of
resident staff and a greater level of assistance in project management.
Systems for monitoring project benefits and water-associated diseases are

Page 8
being established and the reporting of project progress has improved. The
first phases of the Chao Phya Basin Study and the Pattani Irrigation Feasi-
bility Updating Study, also financed from the loan, have been completed.
Consultants are being selected for the RID Administration and Organization
Study.
Loan No. 1198T  Northeast Thailand Rural Development Project; $21 Million
Loan of February 27, 1976; Effective Date: June 29, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The project has seven components: construction of 1,300 km of
village access roads; strengthening maintenance programs for 2,000 km of
existing rural roads, including provision of equipment; rural electrification;
village water supplies; development of improved techniques for upland crop
cultivation; an agricultural extension program in four provinces; and agricul-
tural development in two existing land settlements. Implementation of the
road components has fallen six months behind schedule due to delay in the award
of a consulting contract, now due to be signed in October. Progress has been
slow in the upland crop component due to problems in management, staffing and
organization. Other components are proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1199T Livestock Development Project; $5.0 Million of February 27,
1976; Effective Date: May 25, 1976; Closing Date: June 30,
1981
Progress is satisfactory. The seed production and pasture develop-
ment program is on schedule; the "Loaned-Bull" Program after a faulty beginning
is now gathering momentum; serious problems with project staffing are near
resolution and the technical assistance component is being ably implemelnted
by the experts financed by the New Zealand Government, Disbursements are
considerably behind schedule, but should pick up within the next few months
onice outstanding requests for disbtursements are received in the Bank,
Loan No. 1243   Rubber Replanting Pro2ect; $50 Million of September 13 176;
Effective Date: January 14, 1977; Closing Date: June 30,
1981
Much useful preparatory work in research, training and expansion of
production capacity for planting material has been done and the project is
off to a good start. First year targets are expected to be reached.
Loan No, 1253   Second Telecommunications Project; $26 M!illion of June 11,
1976; Effective Date:   August 25, 1976; Closing Date-
December 31, 1980
The project is on schedule.   Procurement action has been inf4iated
for all components and civil works has commenced.

Loan No. 1271 Fourth Education Project; $31 Million of September 13, 1976;
Effective Date: February 9, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1327 Third IFCT Project; $25 Million of December 8, 1976;
Effective Date: March 14, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Loan commitment rate has been slower than expected because of sharply
depressed investment climate in 1976. Capital structure and liquidity position
have improved, however, with success of share capital increase. Satisfactory
progress has been made on institution-building aspects of project.
