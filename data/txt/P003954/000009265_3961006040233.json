integrated water resources\n            management; b) it will continue the Bank support started\n            under earlier projects; c) expand the Irrigation Service Fee\n            program for cost recovery; d) privatize small public\n            schemes; e) support the implementation of remedial works;\n            and f) it will complete technically and economically viable\n            rehabilitation of as yet unimproved public irrigation\n            systems. The project components are: 1) support for policy\n            and institutional reform for integrated water resources\n            management; river basin planning in three basins; and\n            improved real-time water management operations in five\n            basins; 2) strengthening hydrological data and information\n            systems; 3) support for special maintenance of small\n            irrigation schemes; 4) irrigation rehabilitation, expansion\n            and upgrading, and remedial works; 5) introduction of\n            sustainable, efficient operation and maintenance to avoid\n            the need for repeat rehabilitation; and 6) the expansion of\n            Irrigation Service Fees to schemes above 500 ha in size in\n            all remaining areas of Java to establish user-pays systems\n            and support operation and maintenance."}, "docdt": "1994-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
