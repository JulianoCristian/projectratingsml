"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the National Rural\n            Infrastructure Project for Guinea was highly satisfactory.\n            The project substantially achieved its objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development was substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of the Bank\n            was highly satisfactory while the Borrower's was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, a broad country-wide approach to improving\n            rural infrastructure has a high impact on the supply\n            response of agriculture production and service delivery.\n            Second, assigning responsibility for project implementation\n            to agencies within the existing institutional framework can\n            work well. Third, labor-based feeder road development is a\n            most suitable entry point for the development of a private\n            construction industry. Fourth, sustainability in privatizing\n            rural works construction and maintenance cannot be assured\n            without a multi-year work program and facilities for renting\n            equipment. Fifth, works carried out by labor-based methods\n            versus conventional equipment-based methods have advantages\n            such as easier maintenance. Finally, in the\n            resource-constrained environment of a country undergoing\n            structural adjustment, establishment of a Road Fund is\n            necessary to ensure the steady and timely availability of\n            resources for maintaining the road infrastructure."}, "docdt": "1997-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
