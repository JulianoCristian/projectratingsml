The\n            additional financing will finance the following activities:\n            1) Rural Road Improvement Program (Estimated cost US$555.89\n            million, with loan financing at US$49.375 million). This\n            will support the construction of rural roads, including\n            provision of technical assistance for their supervision. It\n            will rehabilitate or rebuild at least additional 1,000 km of\n            rural roads in the 61 counties and districts (of which 14\n            counties will be new) of 8 municipalities in Fujian province\n            to a standard of all-weather roads. These roads are existing\n            roads selected from the provincial level rural road\n            databank, identified in the feasibility study report, and\n            will be implemented in compliance with the Rural Roads\n            Implementation Framework (RRIF); and 2) Institutional\n            Strengthening Program (Estimated cost US$0.50 million, to be\n            financed entirely by the loan). This will support training\n            activities and study tours for the benefit of the local\n            government agencies in the issues concerning: (i)\n            environmental design and construction of rural roads; and\n            (ii) rural road maintenance and management."}, "docdt": "2011-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
