                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims to increase the effective use of the road infrastructure in Fujian Province to support its social and economic development. This objective seeks to
                         contribute to: (i) improving living conditions in rural areas-particularly those in the areas of the Province where poverty rates are higher-by enhancing the transport
                         accessibility of the rural communities to economic opportunities and social services; (ii) stimulating higher economic growth in Fujian Province by reducing transport
                         costs; and (iii) facilitating the interconnection across the coastal provinces. In this respect, the project will meet both the provincial government objective to improve the
                         transport network to support the social and economic development of the province (especially in the economically lagging counties), and the central government
                         objective to facilitate transport interconnections across Coastal Provinces.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After five years of implementation, activities under the original project have been successfully completed. The project has improved the transport network in Fujian, increased the
                         interconnections across coastal provinces and had a major impact on improved rural accessibility. The Yongan-Wuping Expressway (195 km) opened for traffic on June 29, 2010,
                         reducing travel time from 5.7 hours to 2 hours between the two cities. About 10,000 km of roads have been upgraded under the provincial Rural Road Infrastructure Program (over

                         4,432 km with the Bank loan) providing all weather access to over 7,500 villages and an estimated 1,040,000 people. An additional loan of US$50 million has been approved by the
                         Bank to scale up the rural roads component in 2011. As of May 2012, 252 rural roads had been upgraded using the additional financing.
