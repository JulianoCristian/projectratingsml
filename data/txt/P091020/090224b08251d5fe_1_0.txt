                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims to increase the effective use of the road infrastructure in Fujian Province to support its social and economic development. This objective seeks to
                         contribute to: (i) improving living conditions in rural areas-particularly those in the areas of the Province where poverty rates are higher-by enhancing the transport
                         accessibility of the rural communities to economic opportunities and social services; (ii) stimulating higher economic growth in Fujian Province by reducing transport
                         costs; and (iii) facilitating the interconnection across the coastal provinces. In this respect, the project will meet both the provincial government objective to improve the
                         transport network to support the social and economic development of the province (especially in the economically lagging counties), and the central government
                         objective to facilitate transport interconnections across Coastal Provinces.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All the activities under the original project have been successfully completed, and the original loan was closed on June 30, 2012. The project has improved the transport network in
                         Fujian, increased the interconnections across coastal provinces and had a major impact on improved rural accessibility. The PDOs of the original loan were achieved except the
                         traffic volume growth on the Expressway remains lower than anticipated due to two main factors: (i) the elimination of toll charge on Class II highways in 2009; and (ii) competition

                         from a parallel expressway in Jiangxi. The Yongan-Wuping Expressway (195 km) opened for traffic on June 29, 2010, reducing travel time from 6 hours to 2 hours between the two
                         cities. Under the provincial Rural Road Infrastructure Program, over 10,000 km of roads have been upgraded (over 5,552 km with the Bank loan) to provide all weather access to
                         about 1,055,000 villagers. The PDOs of the original project have been revised to reflect the impact of the additional financing loan. As of April 30, 2014, 365 rural roads (about 1,447
                         km) under the additional financing had been improved to provide paved and safer roads to villagers. The additional financing project progresses well toward its PDOs.
