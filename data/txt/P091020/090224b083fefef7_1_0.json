Sector\n            Investment Project for China were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the pilot maintenance contracts were carried out\n            with positive results. Experience from developing countries\n            shows that institutionalization and network wide application\n            of maintenance contracting is a complex undertaking and its\n            adoption requires a long time, much longer than a typical\n            loan period. The issues are not only technical, but include\n            institutional reform, labor training and relocation, job\n            security, budget processes, performance indicators for\n            different road classes and their enforcement, supervision of\n            contractors, and payment procedures. The pilot applications\n            in maintenance contracting could be followed up to ascertain\n            if their geographic and possibly technical scope could be\n            expanded, negative technical aspects are corrected, and the\n            labor, procurement, and supervision issues are dealt with.\n            In Fujian advances were made in previous projects in road\n            data collection, road management, traffic safety, and\n            identification of staff training needs. This project\u2019s\n            outcomes are proof of their usefulness. The road data bank\n            was used to select rural roads for rehabilitation; traffic\n            safety has been embedded in the provinces\u2019 own \u2018action\n            program\u2019 in design and safety audits; and training programs,\n            international and domestic, on various aspects of road\n            management (tunneling, tolling, project management,\n            safeguard issues) have been effective to ensure continuity\n            in institutional development."}, "docdt": "2015-12-14T07:54:00Z"}
