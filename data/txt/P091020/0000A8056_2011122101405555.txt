                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims to increase the effective use of the road infrastructure in Fujian Province to support its social and economic development. This objective
                         seeks to contribute to: (i) improving living conditions in rural areas-particularly those in the areas of the Province where poverty rates are higher-by enhancing
                         the transport accessibility of the rural communities to economic opportunities and social services; (ii) stimulating higher economic growth in Fujian Province by
                         reducing transport costs; and (iii) facilitating the interconnection across the coastal provinces. In this respect, the project will meet both the provincial
                         government objective to improve the transport network to support the social and economic development of the province (especially in the economically lagging
                         counties), and the central government objective to facilitate transport interconnections across Coastal Provinces.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After four years of implementation, most activities under the original project have been successfully completed, with the exception of the overseas study/training component. The
                         Yongan-Wuping Expressway (about US$1.3 billion equivalent-195 km) opened for traffic on June 29, 2010, ahead of schedule. About 10,000 km of roads have been upgraded under
                         the provincial Rural Road Infrastructure Program (over 3800 km with the Bank loan) providing all weather access to 7,500 villages and an estimated 950,000 people. An additional

                         loan of US$50 million was approved by the Bank to scale up the rural roads component. The additional loan became effective on August 30, 2011.
