Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The project aims to increase the effective use of the road infrastructure in Fujian Province to support its social and economic development. This
 objective seeks to contribute to: (i) improving living conditions in rural areas-particularly those in the areas of the Province where poverty rates are
 higher-by enhancing the transport accessibility of the rural communities to economic opportunities and social services; (ii) stimulating higher
 economic growth in Fujian Province by reducing transport costs; and (iii) facilitating the interconnection across the coastal provinces. In this
 respect, the project will meet both the provincial government objective to improve the transport network to support the social and economic
 development of the province (especially in the economically lagging counties), and the central government objective to facilitate transport
 interconnections across Coastal Provinces.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 All the activities under the original project have been successfully completed, and the original loan was closed on June 30, 2012. The project has
 improved the transport network in Fujian, increased the interconnections across coastal provinces and had a major impact on improved rural
 accessibility. The PDOs of the original loan were achieved except the traffic volume growth on the Expressway remains lower than anticipated due to
 two main factors: (i) the elimination of toll on Class II highways in 2009 as required by central government impacts traffic diversion from existing roads in
 the corridor to the YWE; and (ii) the completion of a parallel expressway in Jiangxi attracts a part of through-traffic in the corridor. The Yongan-Wuping
 Expressway (195 km) opened to traffic on June 29, 2010, reducing travel time from 6 hours to 2 hours between the two cities. Under the provincial Rural
 Road Infrastructure Program, over 10,000 km of roads have been upgraded (over 5,552 km with the Bank loan) to provide all weather access to about
 1,055,000 villagers. By the end of November 2014, the 365 rural roads projects totaling 1447.03km had been completed under the additional financing,
 among which, 283 projects totaling about 1,058km has been financed by the additional Bank loan. The project progresses toward achieving its
 objectives.
