Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The project aims to increase the effective use of the road infrastructure in Fujian Province to support its social and economic development. This
 objective seeks to contribute to: (i) improving living conditions in rural areas-particularly those in the areas of the Province where poverty rates are
 higher-by enhancing the transport accessibility of the rural communities to economic opportunities and social services; (ii) stimulating higher
 economic growth in Fujian Province by reducing transport costs; and (iii) facilitating the interconnection across the coastal provinces. In this
 respect, the project will meet both the provincial government objective to improve the transport network to support the social and economic
 development of the province (especially in the economically lagging counties), and the central government objective to facilitate transport
 interconnections across Coastal Provinces.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 All the main activities under the Fujian Highway Sector Investment Project and Additional Financing Project have been completed. Supported by the
 Projects, Fujian has constructed the Yongan-Wuping Expressway (195 km), which was opened to traffic on June 29, 2010, reduced travel time from 6
 hours to 2 hours between the Yongan and Wuping, and increased the interconnection across coastal provinces. Supported with the Projects, Fujian has
 implemented its Rural Road Infrastructure Program, upgraded over 10,000 km of rural roads (of which, 5,589 km financed by the Bank loan), and
 provided all weather access to about 1,056,000 villagers. Supported with the Projects, Fujian has improved its capacities of developing and maintaining
 road infrastructures that are critical to its social and economic development in the future. The Projects is expected to achieve its PDOs and will be
 closed on June 30, 2015.
