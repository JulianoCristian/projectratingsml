I. Introduction

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional
loan in an amount of US$50 million for the Fujian Highway Sector Investment Project (FHSIP)
(Project ID P091020, Loan No. 4840-CHN) to the People’s Republic of China. The additional
loan aims to scale up the impact of the Rural Roads Improvement Program (RRIP) component of
the original project and would finance the costs associated with the improvement and
rehabilitation of lower class rural roads as well as additional capacity strengthening activities.

2.    In addition, this paper records the reallocation of US$13.132 million from the Yong’an-
Wuping Expressway (YWE) component of the original project to the Rural Roads Improvement
Program (RRIP) component of the original project.

II. Background and Rationale for Additional Financing

3.     Status of FHSIP. FHSIP was approved by the Bank Board on October 12, 2006 and
supported by a US$320 million loan that became effective on November 27, 2007. The project
development objective is to increase the effective use of the road infrastructure in Fujian Province
to support its social and economic development by: (i) enhancing its rural roads network; (ii)
reducing transport costs; and (iii) facilitating the interconnection across the coastal provinces.

4.       The project is being implemented satisfactorily and the project development objective is
expected to be achieved. Disbursements at the end of December 2010 reached US$303.4 million
or 94.8% of the loan amount of US$320 million. The monitoring results on a sample of 20
rehabilitated rural roads show that travel time decreased by 58%, traffic volumes and passenger
traffic increased by 127% and 225% respectively on the newly improved roads (See Annex 1,
Revised Project Results Framework).

5.       The status of implementation of the four components is summarized below:

        RRIP component. This component has been completed about 32 months ahead of the
         loan closing date, with a total of 10,000 km of rural roads improved, including 3,809 km
         using loan funds.
        YWE component. The Expressway has been completed and opened to traffic on June 28,
         2010.
        HMPP component. A periodic maintenance contract has been completed and a routine
         maintenance contract is under procurement.
        ISP component. Eleven study tours have been completed and four training programs
         offered. The remaining study tours and training activities are planned and under
         preparation.

6.      Rationale for the Additional Financing. The Provincial Government has initiated a new
rural road improvement program for the period of 2010 to 2012 and aims to improve access roads
to villages and connections to higher level roads. The additional financing will contribute to
achieve this objective.



                                                 1
7.     The proposed additional financing is aligned with the Bank’s assistance strategy agreed
with the Government of China and closely follows the specific strategies considered under the
second pillar of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2006-2010: “reduce poverty,
inequality and social exclusion”. This pillar seeks, among other objectives, to promote more
balanced urban-rural development, expand basic social and infrastructure services to
disadvantaged groups and underdeveloped regions, and improve sustainable rural livelihoods. The
Government has requested that the new CPS be co-terminous with, and aligned to, its 12 th Five-
year Plan covering 2011-2015 which will be available in Spring 2011.

8.     The proposed additional financing will be consistent with the original project objective
and the design of the RRIP component. It will scale up the successful implementation of this
component. An additional financing operation will build on the success of the on-going project
and will enable faster and more cost-effective preparation, as well as low-risk implementation
compared to a new project.

III. Proposed Changes

9.    The additional financing will finance the following activities (the costs are shown in the
      table below):

      Component A. Rural Road Improvement Program (Estimated cost US$555.89 million,
      with loan financing at US$49.375 million). This component will support the construction
      of rural roads, including provision of technical assistance for their supervision. It will
      rehabilitate or rebuild at least additional 1,000 km of rural roads in the 61 counties/districts
      (of which 14 counties will be new) of 8 municipalities in Fujian province to a standard of
      Class III/IV all-weather roads. These roads are existing roads selected from the provincial-
      level rural road databank, identified in the feasibility study report, and will be implemented
      in compliance with the RRIF.

      Component D. Institutional Strengthening Program (Estimated cost US$0.50 million,
      to be financed entirely by the loan). This component will support training activities and
      study tours for the benefit of the local government agencies in the issues concerning: (i)
      environmental design and construction of rural roads; and (ii) rural road maintenance and
      management.

      Notes: * The US$13.132 million of loan was reallocated from the Yong’an – Wuping Expressway to the
               Rural Roads Improvement Program under the original RRIP component.




10.    The RRIF of the original project has been updated to reflect current policy requirements,
the implementation experience from the RRIP under the original project and the new scope of
works.

11.    Re-allocation of the proceeds of the original loan. The Borrower implemented one of
the contracts under the YWE component entirely out of counterpart funds and the amount of
US$13.132 million of loan funds allocated for this contract is being re-allocated to the RRIP
component at the request of the Borrower.

12. The closing date for the additional financing will be June 30, 2015. The closing date for the
original loan will remain June 30, 2012.

13. The outcomes and results indicators in the results framework for the original project have
been revised to reflect the expanded scope of works under the additional financing and the
reallocated funds, as well as to comply with current Bank requirements. Key changes in the
expected outcomes are summarized in the table below:

Notes: 1* The actual length of non-Bank-financed rural roads completed with substantial compliance with the RRIF
       under the original project is about 3,744 km; another 500 km of non-Bank-financed roads under AF are
       planned to be implemented in substantial compliance with the RRIF.

       2* Since the actual length of rural roads improved under the original project is about 3,809 km, the revised
       target will be 3,809 km plus 1,200 km, a total of 5,009 km.



  IV. Appraisal Summary

  14. Implementation arrangement. The implementation arrangements for the RRIP
  component under the original project have proven effective and will be maintained for
  additional financing activities.



                                                             4
15. Technical specification. Based on the assessment result and the experience from the
implementation of the original project, the Standard for Rural Roads Engineering and
Construction (DB35/T740-2007), currently guiding the rural roads engineering design in
Fujian province, is generally acceptable for additional financing but an explanatory note to the
Standard was issued by FPCD on March 28, 2011 to strengthen in particular the design of
traffic safety facilities and drainage systems.

16. Financial management. The assessment for the additional financing has concluded
that the project will continue to meet the Bank’s minimum financial management
requirements, as stipulated in BP/OP 10.02. The Bank’s audit and Interim Financial Reports
(IFR) requirements will remain the same and also apply for the additional financing. The
financial management framework of the existing project will still apply to the additional
financing with the new subsidy standards. Retroactive financing, not exceeding 20 percent of
the additional loan amount, will be available for eligible expenditures incurred on or after
September 1, 2010 and before the date of Loan Agreement signing.

17. Procurement. The procurement framework for the original project has allowed for a
successful implementation of the rural roads component and will remain unchanged for the
additional financing activities. However, procurement of contracts to be financed from the
proposed AF will follow the World Bank’s “Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits” dated January 2011 and “Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants
by World Bank Borrowers” dated January 2011.

18.    Economic and financial analysis. The estimated beneficiaries of the additional
financing loan are expected to be over 0.25 million villagers, of which female beneficiaries
and students are about 0.12 and 0.03 million respectively. The Economic Internal Rate of
Return of the roads under the additional financing is expected in the range of 12.2% - 20.7%
for county roads, 13.4% - 15.2% for township roads, and 12.0% - 15.4% for village roads.

19.    The cost of the proposed rural road project will account for 2.9% of the total sector
budget for road development in Fujian in the next 5 years. Loan repayment requirements at
the provincial level and the funding of operations and maintenance costs at the local level are
affordable.

20. Safeguards. FPCD has updated the Environmental Management Framework (EMF),
the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and the Indigenous Peoples Policy Framework
(IPPF), which had been successfully implemented in the ongoing project, by reflecting the
implementation experience of the original project and the other projects financed by the Bank,
as well as the latest policies. The enhanced EMF, RPF and IPPF, to be applied to the
additional financing activities, have been reviewed and approved by the Bank, and have been
disclosed in Fujian Province and in the Bank’s InfoShop.
