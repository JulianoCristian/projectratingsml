the Recipient or the PNGO concerned, as the case may be,
shall furnish to the Administrator a request or requests
for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed the
aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Administrator
shall, on behalf of the Recipient or the PNGO concerned,
as the case may be, withdraw from the Grant Account and
Page  15
deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as
the Recipient or the PNGO concerned, as the case may be,
shall have requested.
      (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account,
                  the Recipient or the PNGO concerned, as
                  the case may be, shall furnish to the
                  Administrator requests for deposits into
                  the Special Account at such intervals as
                  the Administrator shall specify.
            (ii)  Prior to or at the time of each such
                  request, the Recipient or the PNGO con-

                  to the Administrator the documents and
                  other evidence required pursuant to para-
                  graph 4 of this Schedule for the payment
                  or payments in respect of which replen-
                  ishment is requested. On the basis of
                  each such request, the Administrator
                  shall, on behalf of the Recipient or the
                  PNGO concerned, as the case may be, with-
                  draw from the Grant Account and deposit
                  into the Special Account such amount as
                  the Recipient or the PNGO concerned, as
                  the case may be, shall have requested and
                  as shall have been shown by said docu-
                  ments and other evidence to have been
                  paid out of the Special Account for eli-
                  gible expenditures. All such deposits
                  shall be withdrawn by the Administrator
                  from the Grant Account, and in the re-
                  spective equivalent amounts, as shall
                  have been justified by said documents and
                  other evidence.
4.    For each payment made by the Recipient or the PNGO
concerned, as the case may be, out of the Special
Account, the Recipient or the PNGO concerned, as the case
may be, shall, at such time as the Administrator shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Administrator such
documents and other evidence showing that such payment
was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of
this Schedule, the Administrator shall not be required to
make further deposits into a Special Account:
      (a)   if, at any time, the Administrator shall have
determined that all further withdrawals should be made by
the Recipient or the PNGO concerned, as the case may be,
directly from the Grant Account in accordance with the
provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and
paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
      (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Grant
allocated for the activities of the Recipient or the PNGO
concerned, as the case may be, less the amount of any
outstanding special commitment entered into by the
Administrator pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General
Conditions with respect to such activities shall equal
the equivalent of twice the amount of the relevant
Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Grant Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Grant allocated for
such activities shall follow such procedures as the
Administrator shall specify by notice to the Recipient or
the PNGO concerned, as the case may be. Such further
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent
that the Administrator shall have been satisfied that all
such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account
Page  16
as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making
payments for eligible expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Administrator shall have determined at
any time that any payment out of a Special Account: (i)
was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not
justified by the evidence furnished to the Administrator,
the Recipient or the PNGO concerned, as the case may be,
shall, promptly upon notice from the Administrator: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Administrator may
request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if
