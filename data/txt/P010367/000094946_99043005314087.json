Main lessons learned include: 1) The\n            project has demonstrated that financing of microenterprises\n            is sustainable. 2) Micro and small enterprise (MSE) sector\n            can be developed successfully by providing financing at\n            market rates and without subsidies. 3) MSE entrepreneurs\n            performance concerning repayment of loans is satisfactory\n            and better than recoveries from medium-large scale industry.\n            4) Leasing is a viable option for medium-term credit. 5)\n            Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have played an\n            effective role in meeting funding needs of microenterprises.\n            6) Women can play their due role in development of MSEs\n            provided credit is made available. 7) Private sector\n            financial institutions have proved to be effective\n            intermediaries in development of the MSE sector. 8) Prudent\n            selection of financial intermediaries is key to project\n            success. 9) Clear identification of the target sector's\n            characteristics should be part of design of future projects.\n            10) Poverty reduction is vital for eradication of child\n            labor and a practical concerted role can be played by NGOs."}, "docdt": "1999-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
