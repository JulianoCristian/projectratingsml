3.  Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1
Original Objective:
3.1.1
The primary objective of the project was to increase agricultural production and incomes on
 
15,600 sq. kilometers of land in nine tributary watersheds of the Yellow River in the Loess Plateau. A 
secondary objective was to reduce sediment inflows to the Yellow River by locating the project areas in 
parts of the watersheds that had suffered severe soil erosion. The project was designed to: (i) create
 
sustainable crop production on high-yielding level farmland thereby replacing the areas devoted to
 
crops on sloping lands; (ii) plant sloping lands to a range of trees, shrub and grasses for land
 
stabilization and production of fuel-wood, timber for construction and fodder; and (iii) substantially
 
reduce sediment runoff from slope lands and gullies.
3.1.2
The project design attempted to break the cycle of poverty and environmental degradation by
 
supporting sustainable agricultural practices and wealth creation. The objectives were clear, well
 
designed, consistent with the Borrower's and World Bank Group's overall strategies at the time of
 
preparation. The problem of erosion in the Loess Plateau was well recognized and there was a strong
 
consensus among all stakeholders about the project objectives (see Section 3.5).
3.2
Revised Objective:
3.2.1
      The original project objectives remained unchanged.
3.3
Original Components:
3.3.1
     The project has two main components: (1) Land Development and Erosion Control Works; and 
(2) Institutional Development. The first component was further divided into the following
 
sub-components: (a) Terracing, (b) Afforestation, (c) Orchards, (d) Grasslands, (e) Sediment Control
 
Dams, (f) Warping Land, (g) Irrigation; and (h) Gully control; while the second component was divided 
into (a) Training, (b) Research, and (c) Technology Transfer.
3.3.2
   These components were well designed to achieve the project objectives. They took into account 
lessons learned from other related projects, integrated local experience, and were based on extensive
 
trials. A participatory approach combining outside expertise and experiences with local knowledge was 
an integral element in the project design (see Section 3.5). 
3.4
Revised Components:
3.4.1
    The original components remained largely unchanged throughout the implementation period.
 
However, the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) targets of dam construction, shrub plantation and
 
grassland development were adjusted and complementary livestock development activities were added
 
at the mid-term review to reflect evolving priorities and better use of funds (see Section 4.2). 
3.5
Quality at Entry:
3.5.1
    Quality at Entry is rated satisfactory. The project objectives were consistent with the Bank’s 
CAS in China, which calls for sustainable agricultural development in impoverished and
 
environmentally vulnerable areas and for diversified agricultural production; and with the
 
Government's long term policies which focus on increased production, income generation and
 
employment creation in rural areas. Project design incorporated valuable experiences and lessons
 
learned from other Bank-financed watershed development projects and previous experience in the Loess 
Plateau area. The integrated watershed planning approach adopted by the project provided a sound
 
basis for the project design and implementation—it combined a well designed participatory planning
 
and implementation methodology with strong technical support and a sound monitoring and evaluation 
system. It also fully addressed the Bank's safeguard policies in project design.

Page  6
3.5.2
However, the project could have, in hindsight, placed more emphasis on allocating costs to 
households, local governments and the central government for the sediment retention structures. While
 
the SAR clearly stated the significant downstream benefits and benefits for the society as a whole, the
 
Central Government did not agree to bear a greater share of the costs for that sub-component of the
 
Project. 
4.  Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1  
Outcome/achievement of objective:
4.1.1
The outcome of the project is rated highly satisfactory. 
4.1.2
The project was completed slightly ahead of the schedule envisaged in the SAR with all the 
main physical targets having been met. Large-scale investments into terracing and irrigation,
 
afforestation, grasslands, livestock and animal husbandry, and dams and silt retention structure were
 
completed to a high quality. The primary objective of increasing agricultural production and incomes 
through more efficient and sustainable use of the land and water resources exceeded SAR expectations. 
Likewise, the secondary objective of reducing sediment inflows into the Yellow River was substantially 
met (see Annex 1). At completion, the project showed itself to be one of the largest and most successful 
erosion control programs in the world, bringing unprecedented benefits to households in the project
 
area and for those downstream. The project has developed and demonstrated an economically viable
 
and environmentally sustainable integrated watershed management model (see Sections 4.3 and 6.1),
 
which is already being replicated throughout the Loess Plateau. 
4.1.3
Over one million farmers in the project area have directly benefited from the project with
 
raised annual grain output from 427,000 tons to 698,600 tons, and fruit production from 80,000 tons 
to 345,000 tons, and farmers’ incomes per capita increased from
 
Y 
360 to
 
Y 
1,263. The annual
 
sediment inflow to the Yellow River has been reduced by 57 million tons. In addition, production on
 
terraces has significantly reduced labor inputs and together with road access to the terraced fields has 
allowed for mechanization. These labor savings have permitted many farmers to pursue new income
 
earning activities such as off-farm jobs and livestock production. Increased income and the prospect of 
sustainable agriculture have allowed farmers to invest in a wide range of enterprises and social
 
programs, which have benefited the communities as a whole.
4.1.4
The project has benefited from the favorable environment facing agriculture and
 
contributed to the profound changes that have recently taken place in agriculture throughout China. In 
particular, land tenure reforms created strong incentives for investment in land improvement; while
 
improved communications have removed regional marketing constraints and provided farmers with
 
countrywide market channels. The availability of new technology and management practices has
 
further expanded production options and raised yields.
4.2  
Outputs by components:
4.2.1
Land Development Component
 
(
US$212.51 million).
 
The component as a whole is
 
rated highly satisfactory with individual sub-components evaluated below: 
 
Terracing
 (US$96.75 million).
 Terracing was the cornerstone of the project and was a precondition for 
sustainable farming practices. The conversion of slopelands to level fields virtually eliminated erosion 
and helped maintain precious moisture in the soils, allowing higher crop yields and more diversified
 
cropping patterns. Some 90,446 ha of terraces were constructed, realizing 108 percent of the planned
 
- 3 -
Page  7
target. Most of the terraces were constructed by local bulldozer operators, with some manual labour for 
shaping the riser and terrace lips. Roads were built by the bulldozer operators to reach the areas
 
terraced. The standard of terrace construction was very high. The benefits of the terraces were
 
highlighted in a dramatic way during the droughts which affected the area in 1999, 2000 and the first 
half of 2001. On treated slopelands farmers obtained good yields while non-treated lands suffered
 
complete crop failures (See Additional Annex 8 Pictures 5 to 12).
Afforestation and Orchards 
(US$72.21 million)
. This component has established some 290,000 ha of 
arbor, shrub and economic trees. So called ‘arbor trees’, such as black locust, Chinese pine, spruce and 
poplar, have been established on wastelands. Land preparation was usually carried out by farm
 
families employed and supervised by specialized teams, organized at township work stations, and
 
trained by the county forestry specialists. In most areas, specialized teams did the planting. Severe
 
droughts have caused low survival rates requiring replanting, in some cases several times. 
The arrangements for taking up contracts on the arbor tree plantations by households varied from
 
county to county. In some counties the land was contracted before plantation and the farmers were
 
involved in tree establishment. In others the PMOs undertook planting and also kept control for a few
 
years. Households have often been motivated to take up contracts for tree plantations from a sense of 
pride of ownership and participation in what they see as sound environmental practice, even though the 
timber bearing trees will yield no financial return for many years.
At appraisal it was planned that wastelands would be planted with shrubs, mainly for erosion control. 
However, most farmers preferred trees and there was a trend toward planting trees on the steeper
 
slopes, sometimes together with shrubs in alternating rows. Over the project implementation the
 
counties saw less justification to plant shrubs for erosion control (except in desert areas) because of the 
success of grazing bans, which generated in many areas a dense natural vegetation cover at minimal
 
costs (see below).
The planting of desert willow has proved particularly successful in Inner Mongolia for stabilizing sand 
dunes, as well as providing an alternative source of income for farmers, through the sale of the woody 
stems for the production of particle board. In the northern part of Shanxi, and in Inner Mongolia, areas 
of seabuckthorn were dying due to a widespread infection by the seabuckthorn-moth, combined with
 
the severe stress from the prevailing drought. Despite these setbacks, the planting has proved
 
successful with the fruit being sold for the production of juice, providing an additional income source
 
for farmers.
The target in the SAR for Economic Trees and Orchards was 27,000 ha. However, interest in these
 
trees was far higher than anticipated, around 57,000 ha were planted by the completion date of the
 
project. Some 27,000 ha of kernel apricot, chestnuts, walnuts, and Chinese date trees were planted on 
sloping wastelands, and more than 30,000 ha of orchards, mainly apples and some pears, were planted 
on terraces. The land was contracted to farmers, mostly before the trees were planted. The common
 
practice was for farmers to interplant with vegetable crops while the trees were young. Standards of
 
development were high and the farmers have had access to privately produced good quality seedlings. 
Good market prospects exist for high quality fruit.
Grasslands
 (US$16.84 million).
 The project has planned to provide funds for establishment of some
 
155,000 ha of artificial grasses mainly astragalus and alfalfa. The main purpose of this component was 
to produce fodder for pen-fed animals in order to reduce the pressure from unsustainable grazing on
 
slopes. Progress of this component has been mixed.  Before grazing restrictions were widely imposed
 
- 4 -
Page  8
plantation of grasses was only attractive in some areas. After the widespread adoption of grazing bans 
the growing of artificial grasses is successfully practiced on large scale in most project areas. The
 
attractiveness of fodder production is very high and some farmers also use terraces for planting
 
grasses. At the time of the ICR some 100,400 ha, representing 65% of the estimated target, of
 
astragalus and alfalfa have been established mainly on flat or gently sloping wasteland, but much more 
areas are planted by farmers using their own funds. 
During project identification and appraisal, free grazing was found to be a major cause of soil erosion 
in the Loess Plateau. The  Project Management Offices (PMOs) persistently worked towards grazing
 
restrictions in the project and adjoining areas. As a result a number of project counties have now
 
adopted strictly enforced grazing bans and the provincial authorities are confident that all counties will 
soon adopt this practice. An important impetus came through the arbor tree and shrub planting
 
components, where grazing bans were first introduced to protect the plantations. As livestock was
 
banned from the planted areas, natural regeneration occurred, providing a visual demonstration of the
 
dramatic effect that the bans could have. More and more areas, where grazing bans were put in place, 
showed a dramatic increase in vegetative cover even in drought-affected areas.  Despite the droughts, 
natural shrubs, grasses and trees are now well established on steep slopes that had previously been
 
grazed bare. The erosion control benefits from these measures are substantial and unprecedented in this 
area (See Additional Annex 8 Pictures 16 to 18). 
Livestock production did not suffer from the various grazing bans and other conservation measures. On 
the contrary, productivity and incomes rose sharply as farmers moved to more intensive production
 
system. Farmers invested in animal sheds and pen construction, fodder processing equipment, and
 
animals suitable for pen feeding (such as cows and small tail sheep). Informal credit and some project 
loans were the main sources of financing. Under the project, some 116,000 square meters of sheds were 
constructed, 10,800 heads of livestock procured and 125 small feed processing units set up.
 
Significantly, over the course of the project farmers have benefited from higher yields, twining rates
 
and wool quality. Grazing bans imposed by counties and townships have full support from farmers.
Sediment Control Dams, Gully Control and Irrigation 
(US$26.7 million).
 Studies have shown 
that over 50% of the sediment runoff come from the sides of the deeply incised gullies that are typical 
of the Loess Plateau. The aim of sediment control dams is to intercept the sediment at its source. The
 
gullies are uninhabited and provide excellent sites for earth dams. There are three types of sediment
 
control dams. Key Dams are the largest dams and they control catchment areas of 10-15 sq. km. They 
are homogeneous earthfill dams from 15-30 m in height. Warping Dams are about 5 meters high and
 
are built in the lower reaches of a gully.  They intercept sediment and thereby create arable land.  They 
are sited several hundred meters apart in the wider parts of a gully downstream of a key dam. Check
 
Dams are small dams, 1-2 meters high built of rock or brushwood. Their purpose is to slow the flow of 
water in the steep tributary gullies and prevent undercutting of the gully sides. A notable feature of the 
key dams is that they are usually built without spillways; at most sites it is cheaper to size the dam and 
the reservoir to store the entire volume of the design flood than to provide a spillway. The height of the 
dams can also be readily increased in the future to restore any loss in storage capacity due to sediment. 
In the tributaries and the main stream of the Yellow River, sediment inflow causes the riverbeds to rise 
and flood embankments have to be periodically raised. Also, the storage capacities of the reservoirs are 
depleted by sediment. Therefore, sediment control has considerable downstream benefits. Local benefits 
in the case of key dams are water supply for irrigation and villages, and both key dams and warping
 
dams create new arable land on the sediment deposits.
Under the Project, 149 key dams have been built or upgraded, and 1,956 check dams and 1,140
 
- 5 -
Page  9
warping dams have been built, representing 63, 57 and 52 percent of the planned SAR implementation 
targets respectively. Sediment reduction capacity by the various project works is estimated to be about 
57 million tons per year. The number of key dams envisaged in the SAR was reduced at the mid-term
 
review. The village households did not see the local benefits to be commensurate with the construction 
cost and maintained that the Central Government should bear most of the cost of the key dams in view 
of the significant downstream benefits. The cost savings were mainly used for terrace construction,
 
afforestation and livestock development.
Some 7,100 ha of irrigated lands have been developed, equivalent to 111 percent of the planned SAR 
target. The development of irrigation systems has resulted in crop diversification and increased yields. 
Investments in irrigation were mainly in Inner Mongolia where extremely low rainfall means that
 
terracing alone would not sufficiently raise yields to bring about a sustainable agricultural system. Of 
note is an award winning system developed in Inner Mongolia consisting of ‘one dam and one pond’. 
Water is retained behind a dam, from where it drains into the sandy soil and subsequently into a
 
downstream pond. A pipeline system is used to pump the water to nearby terraced fields. Fields
 
irrigated in such a way produce maize yields of some seven to eight tons per ha. The high benefit from 
irrigation was made visually obvious during the drought years, when neighboring non-irrigated fields
 
failed to produce a yielding crop.
4.2.2
Institutional Development Component
 (
US$39.54 million) is rated highly
 
satisfactory.
 
Under this component, the project financed:  (i) the construction and equipping of training 
centres at provincial, prefecture and county levels; (ii) vehicles and equipment for extension services
 
and project management; (iii) hardware, software and related training for GIS and project information 
system management; (iv) local and overseas training and study tours; and research and the services of 
external experts. 
The Bank team helped to introduce and maintain a strict project management system and 
supervision in the field with random spot-checking at all levels. The rules were rigorously enforced at 
the beginning to establish a precedent, and were maintained throughout project implementation.
This component has substantially improved and developed the Research & Development
 
(R&D) capacity of the existing research institutions in the areas of crop protection, balanced
 
fertilisation, orchard and livestock management (detailed research and extension topics are listed in the 
Additional Information).  The component has also achieved far-reaching impacts on institutional
 
development and R&D capacity (see Section 4.5 on Institutional Development Impact). 
4.3  
Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
 
4.3.1
A recalculation of the economic returns of the project investment shows an Economic Rate 
of Return (ERR) of the project as high as 29%, if environmental and downstream benefits are included 
and 19%, if only on-site benefits are considered.  Returns for most components met or exceeded SAR 
estimates, and in particular returns from the livestock and animal husbandry sector have far exceeded 
SAR expectations. Most project investments were largely local labour based and a significant
 
under-employment in the rural project areas suggests that the opportunity cost for this labour was very 
low.  The major differences in the ICR estimation as compared to the SAR estimation include: (i)
 
significant additional benefits of the project from the livestock sector, which turned out to become an
 
important determinant of the project economic success, while the SAR calculated returns from shrub
 
and grass plantation only, (ii) an up-dated value for the sediment reduction benefits from Y1-Y2/ton, 
- 6 -
Page  10
(iii) the inclusion of the carbon sequestration benefits of the project, (iv) lower than expected direct
 
benefits from afforestation due to lower than expected growth and survival rates of arbor trees, and (v) 
lower economic labour costs due to the prevailing underemployment in the project areas.

4.4  
Financial rate of return:
4.4.1
As per the SAR approach, the calculation of a financial rate of return for the project is not 
considered applicable. The financial impact on individual farms and households was directly measured 
in field surveys showing a significant increase in per capita income for one million farmers. (from
 
Y 
360 at baseline to current 
Y 
1,263 against SAR target of 
Y 
900, see Annex 1).
4.5  
Institutional development impact:
4.5.1
The project has taken the approach of working with and developing the existing institutions 
in the Chinese Government and public administration. This not only ensured sustainability, but also
 
created models, which could be spread beyond project areas. The institutional development impact of
 
the project is substantial and far-reaching, as demonstrated in the following: (i) The project
 
management system not only called for an unprecedented level of accountability and discipline in the
 
use of project funds and recording of project activities and achievements, but also allowed evaluation
 
of public sector institutions, PMOs and individuals according to their performance and efficiency. This 
has been practiced widely and has introduced a completely new level of screening and control of
 
government and public administration. Offices or individuals performing well have been awarded or
 
promoted, others have been faced with stricter control or in few cases even been excluded from the
 
project. In most project areas the political leaders at various levels have taken personal responsibility
 
for the project exercising a tight system of self-control and self-evaluation. The fact that a number of
 
project management practices have been widely adopted in other national programs indicates how
 
strongly those methods have been internalized in the Government system already; (ii) the integrated
 
approach for watershed development taken by the project required multi-disciplinary planning and
 
working teams under one PMO. In many cases and often for the first time the different departments and 
- 7 -
Page  11
bureaus such as soil and water conservation, agriculture, livestock and animal husbandry, and forestry 
have made joint efforts in planning and implementing integrated watershed development works; and
 
(iii) the modern project management tools introduced under the project, such as computerized MIS,
 
GIS, and other computer based planning and recording systems have significantly improved human and 
institutional capacity. 
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1
Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
5.1.1
Severe droughts in much of the project implementation period (especially in 2000/2001)
 
made the establishment of trees and shrubs extremely difficult, causing low survival rates which
 
required replanting. The droughts also caused crops failures in some project areas.
5.2
Factors generally subject to government control:
5.2.1
Factors subject to government control have been generally favourable to project
 
implementation. Macro-economic and sector policies have been very supportive of the development of 
integrated watershed development implemented under the project (see Section 3.5). A key policy
 
measure was the government’s policy of providing long-term contracts for land. These tenure
 
agreements, supported at all levels of government and by the Bank, provided strong impetus for
 
implementation of project works. The high level of government commitment throughout implementation 
was also reflected in selection of top quality project staffing, the adoption of transparent project
 
management system, and the rigorous project monitoring and evaluation process. The administrative
 
arrangements made at each level from province to county have been proved efficient and effective. In
 
addition, the government provided sufficient counterpart funds for the project. 
5.3
Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
5.3.1
Project Management
:
 
The project management was highly effective and contributed
 
tremendously to the successful project implementation. The transparency and accountability of project 
management system adopted by the PMOs at different levels instilled and enforced discipline in the use 
of project funds, guaranteed the strict monitoring and evaluation of project activities and achievements, 
and ensured the beneficiary involvement in the project management. The technical assistance was
 
effectively used by PMOs to acquire modern project management tools, such as computerized MIS,
 
GIS, and other computer based planning and recording systems, which have significantly improved
 
project management efficiency.
5.3.2
Procurement and Disbursement
: The construction of over 90,000 ha of terraces
 
involved the excavation and compaction of about 100 million cubic meters of earth.  Private bulldozer 
operators according to designs prepared by the County PMOs carried out the work.  Typical contracts 
were on the order of 20-30 ha. Each county advertised its annual work program for terraces and bids 
were invited for a number of contracts each working season.  As the project progressed, bidders from
 
outside the project area showed interest and this led to more competitive prices. The contractors used
 
the small 90-hp bulldozers manufactured in Luoyang and found throughout China. The villages, on
 
whose land the terraces were built, were responsible for supervision and quality control.
 
The blocks of 
land to be terraced were so widely scattered that it was not feasible to package in them into larger
 
contracts for National Competitive Bidding (NCB). Construction by county governments with
 
equipment procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) was considered but rejected.  The 
adopted approach had the advantages that it exploited local skills and resources, ensured competitive
 
pricing, and placed quality control in the hands of the beneficiaries who would be responsible for loan 
repayment. Vehicles were procured through ICB, and computers and office equipment through Limited 
International Bidding (LIB). The process was slow because of the numerous levels of approval needed 
- 8 -
Page  12
for such procurement. Disbursement was against unit prices per ha for the various components that
 
were agreed with International Development Association (IDA) at appraisal.  Some of the unit prices 
were adjusted during the course of the project.  Before disbursement claims were forwarded to Central 
PMO, a detailed field check of the physical quantities was made by the provincial and prefecture
 
PMOs. IDA missions did spot checks to ensure that the process was being followed.  This procedure
 
worked well and was far superior to a simple record of expenditures since there was a close link
 
between disbursements and verified physical progress.
5.3.3
Quality Control and Physical Checking
:
 
The project introduced a complete system of
 
quality control and checking at every level. Detailed maps, with all project activities clearly located and 
coded, allowed effective random checking of all project components at any time. This system has
 
proven highly effective in supervising a very large and scattered project. Examples of those maps are
 
shown in Additional Annex 9, pictures 23 to 28. Quality was assured by assigning clear responsibilities 
within the PMOs management structure. Standards were set for all works such as plant densities of
 
trees and shrubs, survival rates in relation to planting time, size and depth of water harvesting pits,
 
height and width of terrace lips, maximum slope tolerance. Frequent and well recorded checking
 
system, which also carried the names of the responsible officers, were defined for each management
 
level and each disbursement was subject to following those rules.
5.3.4
Compliance with Credit Agreement
: The Borrower and the Project Executing Agencies 
and Management Offices essentially complied with the credit agreement and recommendations.
5.4
Costs and financing:
5.4.1
In the SAR, total project costs were estimated at US$248.7 million with IDA’s
 
contribution at US$150.0 million.  The actual project costs were US$252.1 million, only 1% over the
 
SAR estimates. Of the total project costs, IDA disbursements amounted to US$148.7 million (99% of 
SAR estimates), while the government counterpart funds including farmers’ contribution totalled
 
US$103.4 million (105% of SAR estimates). Detailed project costs and financing are described in
 
Annex 2.
6.  Sustainability
6.1
Rationale for sustainability rating:
6.1.1
The sustainability of the project is rated highly likely for the reasons below:
(i)
Financial profitability (to farmers) and economic viability (to the society as a whole) of
 
the project have created strong incentives to all the stakeholders involved. For farmers, the project has 
invested in a broad range of diversified income generating opportunities, including the production of a 
range of annual and perennial crops. The livelihood of the farmers, as a result, has been substantially 
improved through the diversified agricultural production and other off farm income sources (see
 
Section 4.1); while at the national level the project has reduced the risks of floods downstream and has 
the potential to significantly reduce dust pollution in north China, including Beijing.
(ii)
The project promoted environmentally friendly production practices and reversed the soil
 
deterioration that was taking place, and thus improved the potential for higher and diversified incomes.  
It has also reduced farmers’ vulnerability to droughts, and it will continue to have a profound effect on 
the sustainability of the farming systems in the future.
(iii)
The new institutional arrangements created by the project as well as the regulatory and
 
- 9 -
Page  13
policy support by government have contributed to the project sustainability, and extended the project
 
impact well beyond project areas. The project activities and interventions are backed by strong policy 
reforms and are well integrated in the social, legal and administrative system of the country. Long-term 
land contracts provide a strong incentive for farmers under the project to adopt sustainable land
 
management practices. The project’s proven concept and methodologies have already been introduced
 
in several similar national projects.  The highly successful grazing ban has also become a corner stone 
in the Chinese strategy to reverse soil degradation in the Loess Plateau areas and to re-establish natural 
vegetation. Furthermore, the accountability of public services and the human capacity built under the
 
project will continue to extend its impact in many development activities in the area, and will be of
 
growing value for the Government’s Western Development Program; and
(iv)
 
The on-going Bank follow-on project, Loess II, based on experiences gained from this
 
project, is expanding the project activities and consolidating the project impacts. 
6.2
Transition arrangement to regular operations:
6.2.1
Most project activities were contracted out and implemented by farmers and therefore do 
not require any specific transitional arrangement. However, for the arbor tree development, county
 
PMOs have employed forestry guards to protect the treated areas. Assurances have been obtained from 
county PMOs that forestlands developed under the project will be well protected until they are
 
eventually auctioned off to farmers.
6.2.2
The key dams are still under the management of the county PMOs although a pilot
 
program has been initiated to test the hand-over to farmers. County PMOs, entrusted by local water
 
conservancy bureaus, are likely to remain in charge of the key dams with financial support from the
 
regular national soil and water conservation budget. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission
 
(YRCC) has raised the point that the Central Government should bear a greater share of the costs for 
the key dams as the national environmental benefits (sediment reduction) outweigh the local benefits.
 
Discussion is being initiated with the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) and the Ministry of Finance 
(MOF). 
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1
Lending:
7.1.1
The Bank’s performance in identification, assistance in preparation, and appraisal is rated 
satisfactory.
7.1.2
The project identified was consistent with the Government's and the Bank's strategies to
 
develop environmentally sustainable agriculture, increase employment and income, and help alleviate
 
poverty (see Section 3.5). The project was very well prepared in terms of technical specifications,
 
particularly for terracing and dam construction components. The project preparation process was
 
highly participatory and the borrower took the lead in the preparation process (Section 7.4). The Bank's 
inputs in terms of staffing and skill-mix were adequate for the preparation. Between identification and 
appraisal, 6 missions were fielded. The multi-disciplinary missions were composed of experts in the
 
following aspects: agriculture, economic analysis, environment, project operations, water resources,
 
and land use planning.
7.1.3
The Bank's performance at appraisal was also satisfactory. The Bank's team was an
 
eight-member mission, which covered the key skills required by the project. The mission appraised,
 
among other aspects of project design, the government commitment (including counterpart funding) and 
- 10 -
Page  14
implementing agencies’ capacity in terms of financial management, project risks and mitigation
 
measures, the incentives for stakeholders to sustain the project, and safeguard issues (environment,
 
resettlement, dam safety).
7.1.4
However, one oversight of the project design was that the Bank should have, together with 
the central and local governments, worked out a more detailed cost sharing and repayment plan for
 
construction costs for the key dams. 
7.2
Supervision:
7.2.1
Bank supervision is rated highly satisfactory. The supervision missions were composed of 
a broad mix of international and local professionals, who were not only technically competent but also 
responsive to the client’s views and needs, and the local experiences and knowledge. The core
 
supervision team was maintained throughout project implementation and an excellent working
 
relationship was kept with their counterparts. Implementation progress was adequately reported and
 
problems were identified early and addressed proactively. Performance ratings were realistic and
 
adequate attention was paid to legal covenants and safeguards (dam safety). The supervision missions 
also helped to build the institutional capacity of PMOs at different levels and establish a transparent
 
monitoring system using Geographical Information System (GIS).  The team provided high quality
 
technical and policy advice (such as initiating the grazing ban), which was highly valued by the PMOs.  
Size and frequency of supervision missions were on the low side given the complexity and the wide
 
geographic coverage of the project--only 8 supervision missions, on average with 6 members, took
 
place over 8 years of project implementation. However, the supervision has been proven efficient and
 
adequate as the PMOs gradually developed their own capacity. The fact that the task manager was
 
placed in the field allowed easy and frequent contact. These aspects of the supervision have had a
 
significantly positive effect on the outcome of the project.
7.3
Overall Bank performance:
7.3.1
The overall Bank performance is rated highly satisfactory given the above-mentioned
 
lending and supervision performance. 
Borrower
7.4
Preparation:
7.4.1
Project preparation by the borrower was rated highly satisfactory. The borrower
 
committed adequate resources to the preparation efforts. A national preparation team, composed of top 
professionals in areas of agriculture, water resources management, forestry and institutional and farm
 
management was assembled by MWR/YRCC. The project experienced two years of participatory
 
project planning, directed by individual watershed communities. Project staff gathered knowledge about 
villagers’ successful experiences with local erosion control measures. Based on these, each county’s
 
project management office prepared a watershed plan with modules of integrated packages. The small 
watershed communities discussed the plans, and decided upon sequencing, payment and
 
implementation procedures. Maps were prepared on a 1:10,000 scale showing existing and planned
 
land use. This occurred with more than 1,000 project management offices for over 2,000 villages,
 
involving hundreds of thousands of people. The project preparation work, adopting a fully
 
participatory approach, covered major technical, institutional, economic and environmental aspects of
 
the project design, and the views of all stakeholders at central, provincial and local level were all
 
reflected in the process.
7.5
Government implementation performance:
- 11 -
Page  15
7.5.1
The Government implementation performance is rated satisfactory. As stated in Sections 
5.2 and 3.5, the government macro-economic and sector policies have been very conducive to the
 
development objectives. The government’s policy of providing long term contracts for land provided
 
strong impetus for implementation of major project activities. The high level of government
 
commitment throughout implementation was also reflected in selection and retention of top quality
 
project staffing, the adoption of transparent project management system at central, provincial and local 
levels. And the government also fulfilled its commitment to providing sufficient counterpart funds for 
the project.
7.6
Implementing Agency:
7.6.1
The performance of the implementing agency is rated highly satisfactory. As discussed in 
Section 5.3, the PMOs at all levels are well staffed and highly effective. The transparency and
 
accountability of project management ensured rigorous monitoring and evaluation, and strict
 
compliance with disbursement and procurement rules and regulations. The management and
 
institutional capacity of PMOs have been progressively strengthened through the technical assistance
 
and interaction with the Bank’s supervision missions. This enabled the implementation of such a
 
technically complex and geographically wide project slightly ahead of SAR projection, and allowed the 
Bank to reduce its inputs for supervision. 
7.7
Overall Borrower performance:
7.7.1
The overall borrower’s performance is rated highly satisfactory, considering the strong
 
government commitment to the project in terms of policy support and counterpart fund provision, and 
the excellent performance of the implementing agencies described in Section 7.6.
8. 
Lessons Learned
8.1.1
  On the basis of the above review and assessments of the project, the following lessons 
can be drawn for similar projects: 
Watershed management project requires well designed technical packages which generate
 
l
incomes for the local communities.
 The comprehensive technical packages supported by the
 
project included afforestation, halting cropping on steep slopes, establishment of large-scale
 
terracing and sediment control structures, and reduction of overgrazing. Those technically sound
 
project interventions combined sustainable soil and water conservation practices with gains in
 
agricultural production and farm incomes and were the foundation and prerequisite for project
 
success. 
Strong ownership at different levels makes a project truly participatory.
  Project interventions 
l
were adapted to the requirements of each watershed. Local communities were in charge of
 
developing their own plans. Equally important was the support from different levels of government 
who saw clear benefits for the down stream flood control, reduced soil and water erosion and
 
sandstorms. As a result, high quality technical and management staff were assigned to the project 
and issues such as counterpart funding were speedily resolved. 
Effective project management with rigorous monitoring and evaluation contributes to the
 
l
successful project implementation.
 
Despite its large scale and scattered nature, this project
 
remained well managed. The key elements for successful project management include: (i) making
 
use and developing local capacity and institutions for implementation, (ii) applying simple but
 
strict and transparent procurement and disbursement mechanisms with a high degree of beneficiary 
control, and (iii) imposing a strong and transparent monitoring system, which allows efficient and 
- 12 -
Page  16
cost-effective internal and external control like the system of ‘maps and tables’ introduced in this 
project. Physical progress was checked against maps for each sub-watershed showing the project 
plan and completed areas, with a table for each map listing all completed areas with their sizes and 
dates of development. For terraces, sketch maps or detailed design drawings show the layout for
 
each plot. 
Successful pilot activities can be scaled up with good project planning and management. 
The 
l
project components were based on activities successfully tested by similar projects funded by other 
donors and government. The major factors underlying their successful up-scaling were attributable 
to adopting integrated watershed based production system and overall strong project management 
at field level, with clear responsibility assigned to county PMOs.
Consistency in the composition of a competent core Task Team greatly enhances Bank-Client 
l
cooperation. 
  The task team, which cohesively worked with the project, was composed of a small 
but highly committed, and productive team. The task team’s working style and commitment have
 
stimulated the same spirit on the Borrower’s side and have resulted in a remarkably open,
 
cooperative and mutually respective working relationship between the Bank and Borrower with a 
high level of mutual trust. Only through such a working relationship a dynamic process of project 
implementation became possible. The grazing ban offers an example for such a dynamic process. 
On this issue the Bank’s team worked with the client over several years towards a policy change
 
and reacted to the emerging success of the grazing restrictions with immediate adjustments in
 
project activities. 
The "public goods" nature of the project should be fully recognized with the financial
 
l
obligations accepted by the different stakeholders.
   As a lot of the environmental impact from
 
increased vegetation cover and reduced sediment and sand storm created benefits outside of the
 
project area. The costs of major project inventions, which generate such benefits, should be jointly 
borne by project farmers, and local and central governments. If this government responsibility had 
have been fully accepted, the project’s achievement in sediment dam construction could have been 
higher.

Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Comments from CPMO
We think the assessment of the project in the ICR generally reflects the actual situation of the project and 
we appreciate very much the efforts made by all of the ICR mission members. We would like to emphasize 
some aspects: 
The project has achieved its targeted objectives with highly satisfactory ecological, economic and social 
1.
benefits at all levels - national, regional and local communities. 
The project design is very focused and practical, which is a major contributor to the great success of
 
2.
the project and has developed an Integrated Watershed Management Model being replicated
 
nationwide. 
The project management throughout the implementation of the Project has been highly satisfactory.
 
3.
The state-of-the-art expertise for project management introduced by the IDA team has been a
 
- 13 -
Page  17
tremendous gain for the PMOs at various levels, which is more important than the funding itself to
 
some extent. 
Many successfully implemented project interventions and policies, like grazing management and
 
4.
enforcement of long-term land contract have strategic impact and hence will make contribution to the
 
sustainability of the Project. 
The excellent cooperation between the World Bank and the Chinese counterparts is an outstanding
 
5.
example for partnership building, which not only has made this particular project a great success, but 
also contributes substantially to the long term collaboration.

Annex 3.  Economic Costs and Benefits
Project Benefits:
The project’s major benefits occurred in form of: (A) substantive raise in farm income and living
 
standard on-site within the project area, (B) improvements in the river regime downstream in the
 
Yellow River, (C) global or regional ecological improvements beyond the project areas and the Yellow 
River Basin, and (D) significant efficiency gains in public administration and public spending under
 
similar national and international investment projects:
A.
On-site Benefits within the project area
The majority of project benefits likely occurred within the project area, where about one million
 
farmers directly benefit from this project. The project areas belong to the poorest in China and the
 
project raised average per capita net-incomes from annually Yuan 306 to Yuan 1,263 with over one
 
million farm households directly benefiting from the project. The various project components
 
contributed to the significant reduction of poverty and tripling of net-incomes from different angles
 
addressing a range of short-, medium-, and long-term income generating and income stabilizing
 
measures:
Direct Income Increase.
 
Terracing of loess soils usually allows to double crop yields with only
 
l
marginal higher input costs, and will therefore lead to an almost immediate raise in incomes. In
 
some of the drier areas and where sufficient surface or groundwater can be secured, terracing will 
be combined with irrigation, which secures optimal yields, since soils, temperature and sunshine
 
hours make the Loess Plateau to one of the most fertile areas in the world. The new terraces, and 
access roads to the terraces, gave farmers the opportunity to grow a wider range of crops with
 
higher yields than is possible on unimproved slopes or old inaccessible terraces. Particularly
 
temperate fruit and nut trees grow very well and have a more medium and longer-term, however, 
very significant impact on agricultural incomes, too. 
Employment and Labor Productivity.
 Labor saving in crop production and the diversification of 
l
agriculture and livestock production allowed engagement in new employment and income
 
opportunities. This includes both on-farm and off-farm employment. While part of the farmers
 
used the opportunity to have more time available for outside employment, others entered into new
 
farming activities particularly in livestock or fruit production; this led to an increase in the labor
 
rate from 70% before to 87% after project and a more balanced use of labor over the year. In the
 
past labor demand was high in the months of crop planting and harvesting with significant
 
underemployment in winter and early spring. Tending of trees, orchards or livestock provides work 
in the off-season.  Employment of women and their labor productivity has particularly benefited
 
from new on-farm employment.
Food Security and Risk Reduction.
 Farmers in the Loess Plateau face the threat of severe
 
l
droughts. In dry years, crops on slopes often failed completely and the Government had to supply 
the farmers with food. Terracing lowered the variability of yields significantly as proven during
 
years of severe drought during project implementation, but in years with average rainfall, grain
 
yields on terraces reached two to three times those on slope-lands. Since farmers typically store
 
grain over years, the high yields in the good years provide insurance for the drought years. The
 
diversification of production as supported by the project reduced the variability of income.
 
Livestock and tree provide a buffer in difficult times. Irrigation, although a small part of the
 
- 20 -
Page  24
project, also provides drought protection.
Natural Resource Protection and Securing of Long-term Income Opportunities.
 Large areas in 
l
the project area were severely degraded and past agricultural practices were clearly unsustainable
 
due to uncontrolled grazing, gathering for fuel, and cropping on slopes that were too steep for
 
sustainable farming. The project succeeded taking a large proportion of these areas entirely out of 
production for natural regeneration and turning unsustainable use of slopes into sustainable use by 
planting trees and shrubs, which protect soils and provide returns. This practice secured long-term 
productivity of those areas and raised incomes for the local people. 
 
B.  Downstream Benefits
In addition to increasing production and income within the project areas, the project provides
 
significant benefits to the downstream areas:
Reduced Sediment Loads in Rivers.
 The project reduced sediment inflow to the Yellow River and 
l
its tributaries with several benefits.  First, irrigation systems suffer less from large inflows of
 
sediment that choke the canals and often make it necessary to stop diversions when sediment loads 
are high. Second, river channels are more stable and maintenance costs for river training works are 
reduced. Third, sediment build up in downstream reservoirs is slowed. Fourth, the rise of the
 
riverbed in the Yellow River will be slowed and cost of raising the flood embankments can be
 
deferred. 
Lower variability in water flows and reduced flood risk.
 Retaining rainfall water on terraces,
 
l
behind key dams and check dams and in millions of small water harvesting pits around each tree
 
planted under this project lower the peak run-off. This reduces severity of down-stream floods,
 
reduces flood damage, and lowers the cost of flood protection works. Due to the difficulty in
 
quantification the effect is not included in the analysis.
C. Regional and Global Benefits
Global and regional environmental benefits of the project are also likely to occur in the long run,
 
although it is difficult to fully specify the magnitude and time-horizon.
Reduction of Greenhouse Gases and Carbon Sequestration.
 Vegetation and soils are widely
 
l
recognized as carbon storage sinks. Sequestration of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems offers a
 
low-cost means of reducing carbon emissions. The ‘Kyoto Protocol’ makes provision for direct
 
human-induced land use change and vegetation recovering activities to be considered in relation to 
each country’s Greenhouse Gases reduction target. The project resulted in a significant incremental 
sequestration of carbon in sub-surface and surface biomass in an estimated range between 20 and 
100 tons per hectare. The analysis has taken an extremely conservative approach in the
 
quantification of these benefits limiting the impact to the project watersheds only and using carbon 
sequestration of 20 tons per ha for regenerated closed areas and 40 tons per ha for afforested land 
valued with Yuan 120 per ton, which represents about the lowest value used in similar
 
calculations. Nevertheless, the economic benefits are substantive and raise the ERR by 7%.  Using 
a more realistic approach the economic benefits from carbon sequestration would outweigh all
 
other project benefits by far.
Biodiversity.
 Almost as a collateral benefit resulting from the re-vegetation of large formerly
 
l
barren areas the project contributed to a restoration of biodiversity, and restored the habitat for
 
plants and wildlife. The impact is already well noticeable, but its full magnitude is yet difficult to 
- 21 -
Page  25
fully assess.  
Long-term Impact on Climate and Rainfall.
 A dense vegetative cover in the Loess Plateau is also 
l
expected to have a positive impact on the climate in the region particularly regarding increased and 
more evenly distributed rainfall and more moderate temperatures. While the trend is very likely to 
be positive, this effect is very difficult to quantify and is not included in the analysis.
D. Efficiency Gains in Public Administration and Public Spending
The project’s impact on institutional development and accountability of public services has significant 
economic benefits. Monitoring and supervision tools developed under the project have been introduced 
in large-scale national programs. Even if the project had resulted in only marginal efficiency gains
 
under these programs the overall benefits would be substantive due to the large-scale national
 
investments. Quantification is, however, difficult and beyond the scope of the ICR work. 
 
Project Costs:
Total project investment costs in financial terms have been RMB 2,092 million. The current stage of
 
trade liberalization in China does not suggest significant price and cost distortion for most traded
 
commodities and services.  However, a significant under-employment in rural areas suggests economic 
labor costs being well below current market wages.  The economic analysis uses economic opportunity 
cost for farm and unskilled labor of Yuan 3 per day for the winter months (November to April, when 
underemployment is particular severe) and Yuan 4.5 per day for the summer months (May to October) 
during the eight years of project implementation. In the future opportunity costs for labor will be higher 
assuming growing overall labor productivity in the country. With these cost adjustments the investment 
cost in economic terms are estimated at RMB 1,785 million.

and a conservative figure of 1 Yuan 
was used in the SAR. The ICR used a 
figure of 2 Yuan per ton brining the 
original 1.5 Yuan up to 2002 prices.
