rated highly\n            satisfactory; and project sustainability is highly likely.\n            World Bank and Borrower performances were both rated highly\n            satisfactory. These are some of the lessons drawn for future\n            projects. 1) Watershed management project requires well\n            designed technical packages which generate incomes for the\n            local communities. The comprehensive technical packages\n            supported by the project included afforestation, halting\n            cropping on steep slopes, establishment of large-scale\n            terracing and sediment control structures, and reduction of\n            overgrazing. Those technically sound project interventions\n            combined sustainable soil and water conservation practices\n            with gains inagricultural production and farm incomes and\n            were the foundation and prerequisite for project success. 2)\n            Strong ownership at different levels makes a project truly\n            participatory.. Local communities were in charge of\n            developing their own plans. Equally important was the\n            support from different levels of government who saw clear\n            benefits for the down stream flood control, reduced soil and\n            water erosion and sandstorms. As a result, high quality\n            technical and management staff were assigned to the project\n            and issues such as counterpart funding were speedily\n            resolved. 3) The key elements for successful project\n            management include: (i) making use and developing local\n            capacity and institutions for implementation, (ii) applying\n            simple but strict and transparent procurement and\n            disbursement mechanisms with a high degree of beneficiary\n            control, and (iii) imposing a strong and transparent\n            monitoring system, which allows efficient and cost-effective\n            internal and external control like the system of 'maps\n            and tables' introduced in this project. 4) Successful\n            pilot activities can be scaled up with good project planning\n            and management. 5) Consistency in the composition of a\n            competent core Task Team greatly enhances Bank-Client\n            cooperation.  6) The \"public goods\" nature of the\n            project should be fully recognized with the financial\n            obligations accepted by the different stakeholders. As a lot\n            of the environmental impact from increased vegetation cover\n            and reduced sediment and sand storm created benefits outside\n            of the project area. The costs of major project inventions,\n            which generate such benefits, should be jointly borne by\n            project farmers, and local and central governments. If this\n            government responsibility had have been fully accepted, the\n            project's achievement in sediment dam construction\n            could have been higher."}, "docdt": "2003-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
