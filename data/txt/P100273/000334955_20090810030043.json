expected to generate significant adverse\n            environmental effects as they are focused largely on public\n            sector capacity building and improved readiness for dealing\n            with outbreaks of avian influenza in domestic poultry and a\n            potential human pandemic.  These prevention-focused\n            activities are expected to have a positive environmental\n            impact as the Project's investments in facilities,\n            equipment, and training for border inspection points and for\n            veterinary and public health services and laboratories will\n            improve the effectiveness and safety over existing avian\n            influenza handling and testing procedures. The main areas of\n            environmental risk from project activities are the\n            inadvertent spread of the AI virus during culling, transport\n            and disposal of carcasses, animal waste, litter, and used\n            protective gear; construction and operation of incinerators\n            for treatment of disposals from labs and hospitals;\n            contamination of surface and groundwater from use of\n            disinfectants; and laboratory bio-safety and waste\n            management. Animal Health Component will support\n            strengthening of disease monitoring and surveillance, border\n            controls and planning for containment measures in event of\n            an outbreak, including preparation of plans for\n            compensation. Mitigation Measures for Animal Health\n            Component: Disposal of infected materials by burial. In\n            Albania, the existing animal carcass disposal method is\n            digging of burial pits and use of quicklime to prevent\n            earthworms bringing contaminated material to the surface\n            after pit closure. The Project aims to address the risks of\n            inadvertent spreading of the virus during disposal of\n            carcasses by burial."}, "docdt": "2009-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
