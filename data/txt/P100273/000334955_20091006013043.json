The changes include: (i) aligning the\n            project's development objective (PDO) to the Global\n            Pandemic Avian Influenza (GPAI) PDO' to expand the\n            scope of planned interventions to include other zoonotic\n            diseases as a new target outcome, and yet preserve the\n            integrity of the original project design related to Avian\n            Influenza (AI); (ii) supporting the development of a\n            National Pandemic Plan for addressing current and future\n            pandemics; (iii) constructing a new animal health laboratory\n            versus the original planned reconstruction; (iv)\n            reallocating unused financing from the compensation fund and\n            eligible emergency imports in light of new Government\n            arrangements for emergency financing, including for\n            pandemics; and (v) strengthening the project results\n            framework to address the above. This restructuring is a\n            timely response to both the recently declared H1N1 pandemic\n            and further extending the project's impact on general\n            preparedness for zoonosis outbreaks given developments in\n            public emergency financing arrangements."}, "docdt": "2009-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
