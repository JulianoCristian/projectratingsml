Executive Summary  
 
This is an Environmental Assessment and Management Plan (EA
MP) of the Albania’s 
Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project, 
prepared in compliance with the World Bank EA requirements on projects proposed for 
Bank financing to help ensure that they are environmentally sound and sustainable, and 
thus improve decision making (OP 4.01, January 1999).  The Bank favors preventive 
measures over mitigatory or compensatory ones, whenever possible and feasible.  
 
The Albania Avian Influenza (AI) Project has been assigned World Bank environmental 
category B, since it involves moderate environmental impacts that can be managed 
during implementation of the project.  Although project activities supporting AI 
prevention, preparedness and planning, and response and containment are not expected to 
generate significant adverse environmental effects, they do present a moderate 
environmental risk from inadvertent spread of the AI virus and waste management.   
 
Overall the AI prevention and response-focused activities are expected to have a positive 
environmental impact, as the investments in facilities, equipment, and training for 
veterinary and public health service staff and laboratories will improve the effectiveness 
and safety over existing avian influenza handling and testing procedures by meeting 
international standards established by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) 
and the World Health Organization (WHO).  This would be reinforced by the 
mainstreaming of environmental safeguards into protocols and procedures for the culling 
and disposal of animals during AI outbreaks. 
 
The environmental assessment and management plan of the Albania AI project is 
organized in two parts: part one provides a project overview and an assessment of 
environmental policy context of the project, while part two, environmental assessment 
and management plan, deals specifically with (i) environmental impact assessment by 
project components, (ii) proposed measures to mitigate those impacts, and (iii) how to 
monitor them. 
 
The first Part of this document briefly describes and assesses the global, regional and 
national dimension of the AI project, socio-economical context and key issues related to 
Avian influenza. It also provides with a short description of the AI project development 
objective and project components, and assesses policy context under which the AI project 
and its Environmental Management Plan are developed.  The policy context includes 
IDA/IBRD Safeguards Policy, Albanian Legislation, International Conventions and 
Agreements and WHO and FAO/OIE Guidelines. In particular it has references to all 
relevant laws and regulations included in the Albanian legislation related to AI 
prevention, control and response activities. According to the national legislation, the 
Albania AI project is classified as Annex 2 project, as the proposed project activities and 
measures are not expected to generate significant adverse environmental effects. Thus, 
this Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is prepared in line with national and 
international laws and regulations and ensures that all environmental requirements and 
Page  5
5
obligations are taken into consideration throughout the project design and 
implementation. 
 
The part two or environmental management plan deals with environmental impacts of the 
proposed project components and activities, with special focus on moderate adverse 
environmental effects of the Animal and Human Health Components, and how to 
minimize or mitigate them.  For the Animal component, the EMP addresses zoonotic 
disease containment and waste management as pertain to disposal of special waste, 
emissions and materials at laboratories, and training for veterinary services workers, to 
include procedures for safe handling of AI materials, safe culling of infected and at-risk 
poultry and disposal of carcasses.  For the Human Health component, the EMP focuses 
on equipment, refurbishing and training for reference and regional diagnostic laboratories 
to include key environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and waste 
management.   
 
The EMP provides mitigation plans and monitoring plans for: (i) Carcass and Waste 
Material Disposal by Burial, (ii) Bird Carcass and Waste Material Disposal by mobile 
Incineration (if this option will be accepted and applied), (iii) Disposal of infected 
materials from labs and hospitals by fixed Incineration, (iv) Laboratory Safety and Waste 
Management, and (v) Reconstruction Work of the reference laboratories and isolation 
rooms at regional hospitals, in order to ensure appropriate attention to environmental 
issues, and tracking progress or problems in their management. Detailed mitigation and 
monitoring plans in matrix-table format are given in the supporting annexes at the end of 
the document. The EMP provides also documentation of meetings and public 
consultations and participation process performed during the preparation of this 
document.

Part One. Project Overview and Environmental Policy Context 
 
I. Global, regional and national sector issues  
 
(a) Introduction 
 
The continuing outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which begun 
in late 2003 in several Southeast Asian countries and have occurred more recently in 
Europe, have been disastrous to the poultry industry in the two regions and have 
raised serious global public health concerns.  As of March 2006, more than 140 
million domestic poultry had either died or been destroyed and over 174 people had 
been infected (of which 94 have died).  Recent increases in the number of known 
cases of avian influenza (AI) transmission have raised concerns over the potential 
emergence of a pandemic, which could have devastating effects on human health and 
livelihoods.  
 
At the same time, it is important to emphasize that there are many uncertainties about 
whether and when a pandemic might occur, as well as about its potential impact.  
Humans are not very susceptible to the disease, but if infected with the Asian H5N1 
strain, they could exhibit a high case fatality rate.  The geographical spread of HPAI, 
the human dimension, and the potential enormous social and economic impact are 
unprecedented.  Economic losses to the Asian poultry sector alone are estimated to 
date at around $10 billion.  Despite control measures the disease continues to spread, 
causing further economic losses and threatening the livelihood of hundreds of millions 
of livestock farmers, jeopardizing smallholder entrepreneurship and commercial 
poultry production, and seriously impeding regional and international trade, and 
market opportunities.  The rural poor, who rely for a larger share of their income on 
poultry, have been particularly hard hit with income losses.  
 
It is impossible to anticipate when the next influenza pandemic may occur or how 
severe its consequences may be.  On average, three pandemics per century have been 
documented since the 16
th
 century, occurring at intervals of 10-50 years.  In the 20
th
 
century, pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968.  If a major pandemic were to 
appear again, similar to the one in 1918, even with modern advances in medicine, an 
unparalleled toll of illness and death could result.  Air travel might hasten the spread 
of a new virus, and decrease the time available for preparing interventions.   
 
Countries’ health care systems could be rapidly overwhelmed, economies strained, 
and social order disrupted.  Through interventions as proposed in this Project, and in 
collaboration with other national and international partners, it should be possible to 
minimize a pandemic’s consequences in Albania through advance preparation to meet 
the challenge 
 
(b) Socioeconomic Context 
 
The recent epidemics or outbreaks of animal origin (e.g. SARS, avian influenza, 
Lassa virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, West Nile virus) have 
demonstrated the potential and real global impact of zoonotic diseases on the health 
and well-being of the public, as well as the enormous humanitarian, socio-economic, 
and trade damage that this group of diseases can cause to both developed and 
developing countries.  They have also underscored the important role of official 
Page  7
7
veterinary and public health services in disease prevention and control, as well as the 
importance of strengthening the capacity of these services in compliance with the 
World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organization for Animal Health 
(OIE) international standards (e.g. the local, regional, and global quarantine powers 
under the International Health Regulations; and the international standards, guidelines 
and recommendations under the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code).  The epidemics 
have also demonstrated that there is an urgent need for a global response to improve 
the local and regional preparedness and rapid response capacity to the threat from 
zoonotic disease.   
 
Influenza is a zoonotic disease (animal to human transmission) of international 
importance because of the ability of the virus that causes the disease to mutate for a 
potential wide-scale human-to-human transmission.  Outbreaks of influenza in 
humans occur annually, as a result of antigenic drift in the Influence 
A
virus with a 
severity which varies from year to year, but is typically moderate to mild.  
Nonetheless, these outbreaks occur in all countries and exert an impact primarily 
through morbidity and reduced economic productivity because of illness.  In contrast, 
severe influenza pandemics occur infrequently, as a result of antigenic shift, but have 
been unprecedented in the number of infections and deaths caused over a short time-
period.  The severity of these influenza pandemics resulted from infection with a sub-
type of influenza virus to which humans had not been previously exposed and so had 
no immunity.  Such a new sub-type of influenza (known as H5N1) is currently 
causing large outbreaks in birds and domestic poultry in East and Central Asia and 
Europe, creating widespread concern that the risk of a new and potentially severe 
human pandemic is high
1
.
Addressing economic and social impacts must be an integral part of a comprehensive 
response. A pandemic would have devastating economic and social consequences, 
including large-scale loss of livelihoods as well as lives.  At least three types of 
economic costs or impacts should be considered under a human pandemic scenario: 
(i) effects of sickness and mortality on potential output; (ii) private preventive 
responses to an epidemic; and (iii) public sector responses.    
 
(c) Key Issues 
 
A
coordinated global response should involve three types of strategic activities: (i) 
preventing the occurrence and spread of the disease in domesticated animals, thus 
lowering the virus load in the environment, (ii) preventing and/or mitigating the 
effects of an outbreak in humans, and (iii) in the event of a pandemic, helping affected 
populations cope with its effects. Key issues that have been identified include:  
 
•
Prevention and control of avian influenza is multi-sectoral in nature
.
It 
involves many players, including those in the areas of health, agriculture, 
environment, economics, finance, and planning among others.  At the country 
level, in particular, an integrated, multi and inter-sectoral response is needed 
1
Antigenic drift refers to a change in surface proteins of a given strain of influence virus in response to 
antibodies in human hosts who have been exposed to it. It occurs continually in both type A and B 
influenza strains, thus the reason to re-engineer the influenza vaccine on a regular basis to prevent seasonal 
outbreaks or epidemics. Antigenic shift refers to the reassortment of the animal influenza strain with the 
circulating human strain in the process of moving from an animal to humans. This antigenic shift is more 
of a concern since when it occurs, it results in pandemics due to generalized susceptibility to infection in 
humans. 
 
Page  8

based on shared objectives.  Responses must address both the animal health and 
human health dimensions and also appropriate social measures (quarantines, 
transport restrictions, mass communication strategies).  
•
The risk of a human pandemic is real.
 
The H5N1 strain currently affecting 
several Asian countries has proven highly fatal to humans.  The risk that a 
pandemic virus will emerge depends on opportunities for human exposure and 
infection, which will persist as long as the H5N1 virus continues to circulate in 
animals.  With the present situation, the potential of the HPAI virus to become 
transmissible among humans needs to be a serious concern.  If the virus adapts 
itself to human-to-human transmission, lives may be threatened on a large scale.  
•
Avian Influenza virus is constantly evolving with unpredictable results
.
The 
HPAI viruses are of particular concern because they undergo constant genetic 
change that can have unpredictable results.  The constant and rapid evolution of 
the virus necessitates a global approach to controlling the disease.  
•
Market conditions have caused HPAI to spread rapidly.
 
The conditions for 
the emergence and local spread of HPAI have been exacerbated by the 
intensification and concentration of livestock production in areas of high-density 
human populations.  The danger of international spread of HPAI has increased by 
the dynamics of regional and international trade and the movement of people.       
•
The geographic coverage of a response should be determined by both 
immediate and anticipated needs.
 
Asia is today the most affected region, but the 
disease is currently spreading to other areas of the world at an alarming rate and 
recent scientific evidence indicates that wild birds play a role in the spread of the 
virus from one country or region to another. A minimum level of preparedness is 
essential in all countries.  
•
An appropriate balance between short and long-term actions needs to be 
taken.  
Immediate action is needed in a number of areas.  The immediate to short-
term objective is to reduce the risk to humans by preventing further spread of 
HPAI in those countries that are currently infected. The long-term vision of the 
strategy is to minimize the global threat and risk of HPAI in domestic poultry and 
humans, through progressive control and eradication of HPAI.     
•
Global and regional aspects of the response need to be addressed and 
coordinated. 
Actions to secure borders and control international trade/travel in 
the event of a pandemic, as well as measures to limit the effects of disease 
transmission by migratory birds, are trans-boundary issues requiring regional 
and/or international coordination. Global and regional efforts should build on 
existing mechanisms such as the joint OIE/World Bank initiative for the 
Prevention and Control of Global Emerging and Re-emerging Diseases of Animal 
Origin, and the joint Global Framework for Progressive Control of 
Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs), a joint FAO/OIE initiative and 
regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and 
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.  
 
The FAO/OIE’s Global Strategy.
 The long-term vision of the strategy prepared by 
FAO and OIE in collaboration with WHO is to minimize the global threat and risk of 
HPAI in humans and domestic poultry, through progressive control and eradication of 
HPAI, particularly that caused by H5N1 virus, from terrestrial domestic poultry.  The 
global strategy will be implemented over three time frames: immediate to short (1-3 
years), short to medium (4-6 years) and medium to long-term (7-10 years).  During 
this period the spread of HPAI, mainly of the H5N1 strain, will have been 
Page  9
9
progressively controlled in domestic poultry of all infected countries, and prevented 
from affecting those countries not currently infected, but at high risk.  The strategy 
originally prepared to control HPAI in Asia is being revised by FAO and OIE to take 
into account the current spread on the disease outside Asia.  The strategy will be 
complemented by more detailed country specific HPAI control plans.  FAO/OIE have 
also issued specific recommendations for avian influenza and OIE has recently issued 
recommendations for each region, in addition to its standards and guidelines provided 
for the prevention and control of HPAI in animals.  
 
The Recommended Strategic Action plan prepared by WHO for Responding to the 
Avian Influenza Pandemic Threat lays out activities for individual countries, the 
international community, and WHO to prepare for a pandemic and mitigate its impact.  
The objectives of the plan correspond to the opportunities and capacities to intervene 
and are structured in three phases:  
(i) pre-pandemic 
–
supporting the FAO/OIE’s control strategy;  increasing 
collaboration between animal and health services; strengthening EWS, 
(ii) 
emergence of a pandemic – containing or delaying spread at the 
source,  and  
(iii) 
pandemic declared and spreading internationally – reducing morbidity, 
mortality and social disruption; conducting research to guide response 
measures.   
 
WHO has also prepared a global plan and guidelines for pandemic preparedness and 
is in the process of developing a model country plan that will allow countries to assess 
their state of preparedness and identify priority needs.  
 
The Bank has developed a global facility through a multi-country adjustable program 
loan (MAP).  In parallel, the Bank is discussing with the EU, WHO and FAO/OIE, 
and bilateral donors the establishment of a multi-donor trust fund (TF) that primarily 
supports country level activities in conjunction with a smaller and complementary role 
at the regional and global level.    
 
(d) The regional dimension 
 
Cases of the H5N1 strain of avian flu have already occurred in more than 30 countries 
in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Africa, including most recently in Albania, 
Azerbaijan, Austria, Croatia, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, 
Russia, and Turkey.  There are also possible cases in Macedonia and Slovenia.  The 
countries in the Balkan peninsula where Albania is a part are at risk, due to their 
proximity to two main flyways the East Africa-West Asia Flyway and the Central 
Asia Flyway.  Both flyways cross areas in North-Eastern Europe, where avian 
influenza in wild and domestic birds has been diagnosed. Besides, the Balkan 
countries, including Albania, are hosting in winter a large number of wintering 
waterbirds coming from the North Europe and Siberia. 
 
(e) The national dimension 
 
Page  10
10
The potential threat posed by HPAI is well documented in the GPAI PAD. Since the 
emergence of the global HPAI threat and its spread to Europe, Albania has been 
considered as a country at strategic risk, due to its position in relation to migratory 
bird routes (more than half of 323 wild bird species recorded in the country are 
considered migratory, frequenting wetlands bordering on farming communities), the 
conditions under which poultry are reared, and increasingly its shared borders with 
other countries that have had cases of HPAI or which are also deemed at strategic 
risk.  In February 2006, the first outbreak of HPAI among domestic poultry occurred 
in the village of Cuka in the South, with the result that several hundred heads of 
poultry had to be culled.  Another outbreak followed in March, in the Village of Peze-
Helmes, just six miles from Tirana. In both cases, the Government moved quickly and 
decisively to contain the outbreak, declaring a state of emergency in the regions where 
the outbreak occurred, restricted movement in and out of a 3 km area around the spot 
where the suspected cases were found, and implemented culling of all domestic 
poultry within the two zones. A quick compensation scheme to farmers for all culled 
domestic poultry  was designed and implemented in a very efficient way to both AI 
outbreak cases. The Government has organized local crisis teams in major regions to 
undertake monitoring and surveillance operations, collect samples from suspicious 
deaths, and prepare for rapid response in the event of an outbreak.   
 
The Government of Albania, with the support of the international donor community in 
Albania, has focused on mounting a rapid response, improving surveillance, detection 
and containment measures. These efforts include adjusting legislation for control and 
prevention of communicable diseases, including influenza pandemics, in line with 
international legislation; establishing a National Influenza Pandemic Committee, or 
“Task Force,” as an inter-ministerial and inter-sectoral decision-making body
2
.
The 
Ministry of Health has prepared and monitors implementation of a national 
contingency plan, and an Influenza Committee at the Ministry of Health is in 
continuous contact with the Civil Emergencies and Crises Committee at the Ministry 
of the Interior. The Institute of Public Health (IPH) is the National Focal Point for 
Influenza Pandemic (human public health). The Institute of Veterinary Research 
(IVR) in MoAFCP is the National Focal Point for Avian Influenza (veterinary public 
health). Establishment of Avian Pandemic Influenza District Committees (sub-
national level) is under progress. Finally, the Government has made considerable 
effort to inform the public about the risks of Avian Flu, and it has established 
functioning hot-lines in both rural and urban areas to take reports of suspicious bird 
deaths. Regular testing of water fowl has been initiated at coastal lagoons and lakes 
along major migratory routes. Nevertheless, the environmental considerations during 
the culling of domestic poultry and disposal of bird carcasses by burial pits are not 
fully and seriously taken into account. Consequently, there is a need to strengthen 
environmental management during the design and implementation of preventive, 
control and containment measures planned under AI project in Albania.  
2
This Task Force was established by order of the Prime Minister on October 28, 2005
.
M
embership of 
the Task Force includes the Ministries of Agriculture (chair), Health, Interior, Education, Environment, 
and Finance. Its main responsibilities include taking decisions at the national level for prevention and 
control of AI; coordination of the national contingency plan; and distribution of tasks to each ministry; 
ensuring implementation at the field level; preparing bulletins; informing the PM’s office; and 
communicating with national and international organizations.  The AI task force meets regularly. 
However, as yet it has no permanent secretariat with full time staff working to coordinate detailed 
planning and crisis management and ensure regular monitoring and supervision of activities.  
Page  11
11
Albania’s poultry population is given as 6.275 million, of which over 85 percent are 
reared in a free-ranging environment on small household farms across the country.
3
Given the conditions of poultry production in Albania, the continued exposure to 
potentially infected wild birds, and the difficulty of enforcing control measures such 
as enclosing poultry and banning hunting and trade and transport of live poultry, there 
is considerable risk of further outbreaks and the spread of outbreaks.  
 
The spread of avian flu among domestic poultry would have a serious effect on 
Albania’s economy, particularly in rural areas, where poverty rates are around 30 
percent.
4
II. Project Development Objective and Project Components  
 
The project development objective is to strengthen the country’s capacity 
to prevent the spread of avian influenza among poultry, to prevent the 
transmission of avian influenza from birds to other animals and humans, 
and to prepare for a potential pandemic of avian influenza transmissible 
between humans.  
 
To achieve this, three areas would be supported by the project: (i) prevention; (ii) 
preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment.  
 
The Project consists of the following four components:  
 
(i) 
Public Awareness and Information
 
(ii) 
Animal Health
 
(iii)  
Human Health
 
(iv)  
Support to Avian Influenza Task Force
 
III. Policy context  
 
(a) IDA/IBRD Safeguards Policy 
 
The World Bank requires environmental assessment (EA) of projects proposed for 
Bank financing to help ensure that they are environmentally sound and sustainable, 
and thus improve decision making (OP 4.01, January 1999).  EA is a process whose 
breadth, depth, and type of analysis depend on the nature, scale, and potential 
environmental impact of the proposed project. EA evaluates a project’s potential 
environmental risks and impacts in its area of influence; examines project alternatives; 
identifies ways of improving project selection, siting, planning, design, and 
implementation by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse 
environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts; and includes the process of 
mitigating and managing adverse environmental impacts throughout project 
3
The remaining 15 percent is reared on 32 commercial farms ranging in size from 500 to 220,000 
heads.

implementation. The Bank favors preventive measures over mitigatory or 
compensatory measures, whenever feasible.  
 
EA takes into account the natural environment (air, water, and land); human health 
and safety; social aspects (involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural 
property); and transboundary and global environmental aspects. It also takes into 
account the variations in project and country conditions; the findings of country 
environmental studies; national environmental action plans; the country’s overall 
policy framework, national legislation, and institutional capabilities related to the 
environment and social aspects; and obligations of the country, pertaining to project 
activities, under relevant international environmental treaties and agreements. The 
Bank does not finance project activities that would contravene such country 
obligations, as identified during the EA.   
 
The Albania Avian Influenza (AI) Project has been assigned World Bank 
environmental category B, since it involves moderate environmental impacts that can 
be managed during implementation of the project.  The EA process for the AI project 
is addressed through this Environmental Assessment and Management Plan (EAMP).  
Key considerations taken into account during the EA process include:  
 
•
Generic initial screening to determine appropriate environmental assessment;  
•
Compliance with existing environmental regulations in Albania;  
•
Linkages with social assessment;  
•
Analysis of alternatives;  
•
Public participation and consultation with affected people and organizations; 
and  
•
Disclosure of information.  
 
(b) Albanian Legislation 
 
Environmental legislation
.
Albania has made good efforts during the last years in 
preparing a quite comprehensive legislative framework. According to the 
Constitution, every citizen in Albania is entitled to “an ecologically healthy 
environment for present and future generations” as well as “access to information on 
the state of the environment”. The laws regarding environmental protection take into 
consideration requirements of international conventions and treaties, and cover the 
whole range of protective measures. However, the challenge is not so much in the 
legislation, which seems to be in place, but in its implementation and enforcement. 
This is due to insufficient work in producing by laws (regulations, decisions and other 
normative acts), inadequate and poorly qualified and equipped local environmental 
structures and inspections (Regional Environmental Agencies), low environmental 
awareness and performance of public administration, general public and decision 
makers. Environment is still not a priority, and environmental principles and concerns 
largely fail to be integrated into other sectoral policies in Albania. 
 
Activities to be carried out under the AI project and the implementation of 
Environmental  Management Plan will conform to current laws in Albania and will be 
in compliance with relevant environmental laws,  including the followings:  
Page  13
13
•
Albanian
 Law on “Environmental Protection” (1993, amended in 1998 and 
2002) 
•
Albanian Law on “Environmental Impact Asessment” (2003)  
•
Albanian Law on “Water Resources” (1996, amended in 1998 and 2000) 
•
Albanian Law on “Protection of Transboundary Lakes” (2003) 
•
Albanian Law on Chemical Substances and Preparations (2003) 
•
Albanian Law on Protection of Air from Pollution (2002) 
•
Albanian Law on “Wildlife Protection and Hunting” (1994)  
 
The Law on Environmental Protection
 (1993, amended in 1998 and 2002) forms the 
basis for environmental management in Albania. The law addresses the prevention 
and reduction of pollution, sustainable management of natural resources, monitoring, 
how to define pollution levels. It provides binding provisions for environmental 
impact assessment and the implementation of the polluter pays principle.  
 
The Law on Environmental Impact Assessment (2003)
.
This law define economic 
activities or projects, which require environmental assessment; procedures for 
obtaining environmental clearance (including assessment of impact on environment) 
and procedures regarding review of permits application. The Environmental 
Permission assesses broad ecological impact of the proposed facility operations, but 
does not define specific ecological impact limits for air and waters. The assessment is 
carried out upon the presentation of the application for receiving the relevant license.   
 
Under Albanian law Environmental Assessments (EAs) are grouped in two 
environmental categories (1 and 2), which are approximately equivalent to Bank 
environmental categories A and B. Albanian Category 1 relates to projects/activities 
that fall under the Appendix 1 of the EIA law, while Category 2 relates to projects/ 
activities included in the Appendix 2. The AI project is considered to correspond to 
Albanian Category 2.  The Albanian Category 2 includes activities the scope, location 
and content of which can have a significant impact on human health and nature of the 
region where the activity will be carried out. According to the EIA law, the AI project 
shall undergo a summary process of Impact Assessment on Environment.  
 
The Environmental Declaration (ED) or Permit shall be issued in the cases when the 
evidential documentation: (i)  is in compliance with the Albanian legislation as well as 
the environmental norms and standards effective on the territory of Albania; (ii) the 
implementation of the activities outlined in it shall not cause irreversible qualitative 
and quantitative changes in the environmental condition and natural resources, and 
(iii) makes provision for measures reducing or evading the impact on the environment 
including the measures for liquidation of possible effects of emergency situations.  
 
Albanian Law on Water Resources (1996). 
This law regulates environmental issues 
related to surface waters, underground waters, current spring waters and territorial 
limits and determines rules necessary for getting licenses/permits regarding water use 
and discharge. The law provides for rules and regulations whose objective is to 
preserve the water resources from pollution and contamination.  
 
Albanian Law on the Protection of Transboundary Lakes (2003)
.
This law regulates 
environmental issues related to protection of transboundary lakes of Shkodra, Ohrid 
Page  14
14
and Prespa. The law provides for rules and regulations which aim at ensuring and 
guaranteeing natural ecological conditions in the transboundary lakes and protection 
of their water resources from pollution. 
 
Albanian Law on Chemical Substances and Preparations (2003).
This law aims at 
regulating the management of chemical substances and preparations for the 
protection of life and health of people and animals as well as for the protection 
of environment from risks that hazardous matters may cause.
 
Albanian Law on Protection of Air from Pollution (2002). 
The purpose of this Law is 
to guarantee the right of citizens to clean air; to protect human health, fauna, flora and 
the natural and cultural values of the Albanian environment from the pollution of the 
air. This Law regulates quality control norms of the living environment air (see 
Decision of the Council of Ministers No. 435 dated 12. 09. 2002 “On approval of the 
norms of discharges in the air in the Republic of Albania”). 
 
Albanian Law on “Wildlife Protection and Hunting” (1994)
.
Article 19 of this law 
says 
“the Government provides budgetary funding for the protection, development 
and reproduction of wild fauna, the natural ecosystems where wild fauna lives and for 
coping with major natural disasters. Article 28 provides with the right of the National 
Authority (today the Minister of Environment, Forest and Water Administration) to 
ban hunting in the entire territory or in particular areas, for reasons related to special 
ecological or weather conditions, even though the hunting seasons may be open.  That 
measure was applied last hunting season as a preventive measure to stop spreading of 
AI to domestic birds, but it largely failed to be implemented due to lack of legal 
enforcement. 
 
Veterinary and emergency regulations
.
The relevant legislative and policy documents 
governing the Veterinary Service provide for response to epizootic diseases.  The 
most recent legislation is the Law of Albania "On Veterinary Service and 
Inspectorate" (2004).  Articles 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 provide for control by the 
Veterinary Service over execution of instructions and resolution adopted in regards 
with prevention and liquidation of hazardous infectious diseases common to animals, 
and for making arrangements for culling and disposal of dead animals by burial holes 
or incineration. Article 26 provides for obligatory preventive veterinary measures to 
protect the public health from zoonotic diseases, and Article 30 provides for 
veterinary (quarantine) measures applied in case of an outbreak of contagious disease. 
Although this is a comprehensive law, there is a need for amendment regarding the 
sharing of competences and responsibilities among authorities to select appropriate 
site for final disposal of animal carcasses infected or suspected with zoonotic diseases 
by burial pits or incineration in the territories of communes and municipalities. As it 
stands today, the environmental authority is not part of this decision making, and 
environmental considerations or requirements regarding site selection for burial pits 
or incineration are not taken into account. 
 
National Committee on Avian Influenza or Task Force (AITF)
.
By order of the Prime 
Minister on October 28, 2005 a National Task Force on Avian Influenza was 
established, under the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister of the MoAFCP and 
consisting of the Minister’s of Finance, Health, Environment, Interior and Local 
Government, and Agriculture, Food and Consumer Protection. Under the coordination 
Page  15
15
of Task Force, the Government has developed National AI Preparedness Plan 
(NAIPP).  This plan provides a good basis for further preparatory work with a 
particular focus on development of contingency plans and conducive legal framework, 
that will enable the government to implement recommended disease detection, 
control, prevention, containment, and eradication measures in a uniform and effective 
way. This NAIPP is disseminated in Regions and Communes all around Albania and 
will help them to better prepare and plan their own activities and undertake measures 
to ensure the implementation of the NAIPP at region and commune level. 
 
(c) International conventions and agreements 
The AI project in Albania and its Environmental Management Plan (EMP) should be 
implemented in compliance with other relevant international legislation such as 
conventions, agreements, protocols and EU Directives. Among them of special 
reference are the following:  
•
Ramsar Convention  “on Wetlands of International Importance especially 
as Waterfowl Habitat.” (Ramsar, 1971).  
•
United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD),  
•
Bern Convention  “For the Protection of Natural Habitats, wild Flora and 
Fauna in Europe” (Bern, September 19, 1979)  
•
Barcelona Convention “For the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea 
against Pollution” (Barcelona, February 16, 1976). 
•
Bonn Convention “on Protection of Migratory Species of Wildlife” (Bonn, 
on June 23, 1979).  
•
Aarhus Convention “on Access to Information, Public Participation in 
Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters  
(Aarhus-Denmark, June 25, 1998)  
•
Helsinki Convention “On the Protection and Use of Transboundary 
Watercourses and International Lakes” (Helsinki March 17, 1992). 
•
EU Habitat Directive, and  
•
EU Birds Directive 
 
(d) WHO and FAO/OIE Guidelines 
 
The strategies for AI containment and response by the FAO/OIE and WHO are 
reviewed briefly in the section on global and sector issues above. More information 
on these guidelines is presented in Annexes 1 and 2 below.    
 
IV. 
 Territorial coverage of the Project 
The project will operate throughout Albania, as it is fully possible that AI will appear 
in wild birds and domestic poultry in all areas of the country.  Priority areas of 
concern are regions of Shkodra, Lezha, Durresi, Tirana, Fieri, Vlora and Korca that 
host large populations of migratory waterfowl, including in their territories major 
water ecosystems of the country, such as coastal lagoons and major inland lakes 
(Shkodra, Ohrid and Prespa lakes). (See map attached as Annex 7 below).

Part Two. Environmental Assessment and Management Plan 
 
V. 
Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures by Component  
Activities under AI projects are not expected to generate significant adverse 
environmental effects as they are focused largely on public sector capacity building 
and improved readiness for dealing with outbreaks of avian influenza in domestic 
poultry and a potential human pandemic.  These prevention-focused activities are 
expected to have a positive environmen
tal impact as the Project’s investments in 
facilities, equipment, and training for border inspection points and for veterinary and 
public health services and laboratories will improve the effectiveness and safety over 
existing avian influenza handling and testing procedures. This would be reinforced by 
the mainstreaming of environmental safeguards into protocols and procedures for the 
culling and disposal of animals during AI outbreaks.  In addition, waste generated in 
upgraded laboratory facilities will be managed using existing national guidelines that 
are consistent with international good practice.  
 
The main areas of environmental risk from project activities are the inadvertent spread 
of the AI virus during culling, transport and disposal of carcasses, animal waste, litter, 
and used protective gear; construction and operation of incinerators for treatment of 
disposals from Labs and Hospitals;  contamination of surface and groundwater from 
use of disinfectants; and laboratory bio-safety and waste management.  In addition, 
minor environmental disturbances may occur during renovation of laboratories and 
construction of inspection facilities at major border crossings.  The project 
environmental mitigation plan is attached as Annexes 5-a, 5-b, 5-c and 5-d.  
 
(i) 
Public Awareness and Information
:
No environmental issues, but an 
important component for design and delivery of communications tools for 
good hygiene, safe culling and disposal of animal carcasses, animal waste 
management. If implemented as designed the activities under this 
component will have positively effects on the preventive, control and 
containment measures proposed under the animal and human health 
components of the project.  
 
(ii) 
Animal Health
:
Equipment, refurbishing and training for regional 
laboratories and border inspection to include key environmental issues in 
zoonotic disease containment  and waste management as pertain to special 
waste, emissions and materials; training for veterinary services and poultry 
sector workers to include procedures for safe handling of AI materials; 
safe culling of infected and at-risk poultry and disposal of carcasses.  
Formal compensation for culled animals should target owners/primary 
beneficiaries (e.g., specifically including women where they are the 
primary backyard producers).   
 
(iii) 
Human Health: 
Equipment, upgrading, refurbishing and training for 
national reference and regional diagnostic laboratories to include key 
environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and waste 
management; guidelines, equipment and supplies for hospital infectious 
waste management.  
 
Page  18
18
(iv) 
Support to Avian Influenza Task Force:
 No environmental issues; 
implementation and evaluation of the EMP will be monitored through this 
component.  
 
Animal Health Component.
 This component will support strengthening of disease 
monitoring and surveillance, border controls and planning for containment measures 
in event of an outbreak, including preparation of plans for compensation.  Immediate 
inputs required include cars, fuel, protective gear, disinfectant material, sprayers, 
rapid testing kits. Training, particularly for regional staff is required, along with 
technical assistance for the development of contingency plans, review of the legal and 
regulatory framework for response to an outbreak, and development of a mechanism 
to compensate poultry owners in the event that culling becomes necessary.  These 
measures will be supported through the following three sub-components:  
 
B-1. 
Strengthening National HPAI prevention and preparedness 
capability
.
It will strengthen the national policy and regulatory 
environment for veterinary service and inspection, and improve HPAI 
prevention and control planning.   
 
B-2
 Strengthening disease control capacities, and improving 
surveillance, diagnostic capacities, and applied research. 
It will strengthen 
veterinary epidemiological surveillance through the creation of a National 
Veterinary Epidemiological Unit (NVEU), operating at the central and 
field level. National diagnostic capacities and bio-safety levels at the 
Institute of Veterinary Research and the Regional Veterinary Laboratories 
will also be strengthened, through equipment and technical assistance. 
Animal disease information systems will also be improved.  
 
B-3 
Strengthening HPAI control programs and outbreak 
containment programs. 
It will target virus eradication at the source 
through culling and disposing of infected and at-risk poultry, and control 
of movement of birds, with the assistance of two mobile sub-units of the 
NVEU. Training and protective equipment will be provided to promote the 
safety of personnel dealing with potentially affected poultry. This 
subcomponent will also include a compensation fund, to improve the 
capacity and the credibility of the government’s commitment to 
compensate farmers for all culled livestock. 
 
These sub-components and measures are all supported through technical assistance, 
training and financing for the Compensation Fund.  While these actions do not raise 
environmental issues, they will enable Albania to meet international standards set by 
the OIE and the recommendations developed by FAO for development of appropriate 
procedures and standards for the implementation and management of animal health 
measures and international veterinary certification activities. This in turn will help to 
provide the capacity for safe and environmentally sound management of culling and 
disposal of AI infected materials.  
 
Page  19
19
In addition to technical assistance and training, these sub-components will provide 
priority infrastructure and equipment (limited works, equipment, materials and 
supplies).  Funding would be provided for essential first response equipment.  This 
would include personal protection equipment, disinfectant equipment, vehicles, and 
materials for sampling and culling.   
 
Albania
’s laboratory capacity has been substantially strengthened over the past years 
and is largely equipped to diagnose all notifiable diseases including HPAI.  Therefore, 
project support would be targeted primarily to strengthening the diagnostic capacity 
that needs to feed into the laboratory system. Essential equipment, consumables and 
reagents, staff training and technical assistance would be provided to complete the 
chain of response for disease surveillance.  
 
Mitigation Measures for Animal Health Component: Disposal of infected 
materials by burial
.
In Albania, the existing animal carcass disposal method is 
digging of burial pits and use of quicklime to prevent earthworms bringing 
contaminated material to the surface after pit closure. This method is accepted in other 
countries (Australia, Canada) with due attention to factors such as the amount of 
material for disposal, location of the burial site, proximity to water catchment areas, 
soil characteristics, etc. Of particular concern however is the risk to groundwater from 
poorly sited pits. The Project aims to address the risks of inadvertent spreading of the 
virus during disposal of carcasses by burial through (i) training of veterinary services 
staff in proper handling of potentially infected materials; (ii) training for farmers and 
commercial poultry workers on proper burial pit construction and operation; (iii) 
provision of quicklime, personal protective equipments (PPEs) and other supplies; (iv) 
ensuring guidance is provided from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Water 
Administration regarding siting of burial pits to avoid groundwater contamination; (v) 
refreshment of knowledge on proper burial practice, adopted to different site 
conditions. 
 
Visiting the first two cases of  AI outbreaks in Albania, the case of Peze-Helmes is an 
example of poorly sited and constructed burial hole, of a high risk to ground and 
surface water contamination and very likely that the virus may spread out. This should 
not be taken as a good practice and safety method that might be applied in such a way 
in other possible AI outbreaks in Albania during the lifespan of this project. Properly 
sited and constructed holes and burial pits are valid disposal options in Albania, but 
this method should carefully take into considerations environmental concerns and 
requirements (see box 1 and table 1).  
 
It is highly recommended that commune/municipality authorities, in cooperation with 
environmental authority and veterinary service, make a list of candidate sites for 
burial pit within their own territory that can fulfill environmental requirements. 
Geology, hydrogeology and soil conditions map produced by relevant Research 
Institutes of Albania should be available and used for such a purpose.  In case these 
candidate sites fall within private lands, provisions for compensation to private owner 
/owners for land acquisition and/or loss of crops and fruit trees should be made 
accordingly and included in the compensation scheme of the AI project.  
 
Apart from disposal of infected material by burial, the project should consider other 
alternative options, especially the use of mobile incineration for coastal regions 
Page  20
20
(Shkodra, Lezha, Durresi, Tirana, Fieri, Vlora) and Korca, where accessibility is not a 
problem. Furthermore, the use of such alternative method takes more advantages if 
consider floods, soil conditions, high risk of contamination of groundwater and 
surface waters, population density and availability of land along the costal regions. 
All these regions fall inside the high risk zones for AI outbreaks (see map in the annex 
7). A comparison of disposal methods for animal wastes generated from Avian 
Influenza outbreaks is presented in the table 1.     
 
Mitigation measures for the disposal of infected materials from AI outbreaks by burial 
and mobile incinerator (if the latter will be accepted and applied as an alternative 
disposal method) are attached as annex 5-A and 5-B-1 below.  
 
Box 1.
Environmental problems during the Peze-Helmes AI outbreak 
 
Major environmental problems encountered during the AI outbreak in Peze-Helmes 
are: 
 
A. Before confirmation of HPAI strain (H5N1)
•
Not safety disposal of dead domestic birds.  Farmers in most of the cases had 
buried their dead poultry in small and not appropriate pits constructed by 
themselves at their gardens, without taking into account any environmental and 
safety requirement, while in some other cases they had just thrown away their 
dead birds either to their neighbors
’
gardens, or next to water drain.  
 
B. 
Confirmation of HPAI and outbreak control  
•
During site selection and construction of burial pit for disposal of bird 
carcasses and other infected material, the following environmental concerns 
and requirements were not fully taken into consideration: 
 
•
appropriate site location (
burial site constructed in the old river bed
);  
•
soil conditions (
poor soil conditions, mostly gravel
); 
•
impermeability (
very high permeability
); 
•
risk of groundwater contamination (
high risk of water contamination
)
•
Mitigation measures were not considered and implemented, such as:  
 
•
marked and fenced dedicated area;  
•
covered heaps;  
•
impermeable surfaces;  
•
hold for sanitary period;  
•
block or intercept the flows in drains to surface or groundwater,  
•
collect and store the diluted disinfectant and organic material for the 
sanitary period of 42 days  
 
Page  21
21
Use of disinfectants
.
Contamination to surface and groundwater from use of 
disinfectants necessary for sanitization of infected premises will be mitigated by (i) 
promoting use of least toxic appropriate disinfectants (soaps and detergents), and (ii) 
providing training to veterinary services personnel and poultry growers on measures 
to limit use of toxic disinfectants and prevent untreated drainage or runoff into surface 
or groundwater systems.  
 
Laboratories and border crossing facilities
.
The Animal Health Component of the 
Project will finance essential equipment, consumables and reagents, staff training and 
technical assistance for regional laboratories and selected major border crossings.  
The project will address laboratory waste management by basing training and 
upgrades to laboratory infrastructure and equipment on guidelines, such as 
“International Best Practice in Safety of Research Laboratories” developed by the US 
National Institutes of Health. The guidelines are attached below as Annex 5-C.  
Design of upgrades for border crossing points will include facilities for safe disposal 
of wastes and contaminated materials, and staff training for border security personnel 
will address safety measures during inspections and appropriate waste disposal.   
Construction and renovation works associated with rehabilitation of the virology 
laboratory in the Institute of Veterinary Research (IVR) will generate low impacts on 
environment coming from minor reconstruction works, such as dust, fumes, and odor 
(internal and/or external, including volatile construction materials), noise during 
reconstruction works and other impacts coming from transportation of construction 
and waste materials.  A mitigation plan of these reconstruction works is provided by 
the annex 5-D.  Construction and renovation works of reference laboratory will be 
carried out in accordance with Albanian regulations and practice regarding 
construction permitting and environmental, health and safety permits.

Human Health Component
.
This component will address short and medium terms 
needs with respect to core public health functions.  The Project will help to 
operationalize some elements that are contemplated as part of the GPAI, expanding 
and intensifying the responses rapidly.  As it is unlikely that the global spread of a 
pandemic influenza virus could be prevented once it emerges, the emphasis is on 
reducing its impact.  Several tools will help achieve this aim:  (i) year-round 
surveillance; (ii) effective and accurate methods of diagnosis; (iii) planning for social 
distancing interventions; (iv) anti-viral drugs; and (v) strengthened medical services. 
The interventions supported under the Project will be based on Albania
’s 
epidemiological and programmatic needs, and well-assessed options for meeting 
them.  The interventions will be grouped in three sub-components:  
 
C-1
 Enhance coordination and program planning, 
by: (i) 
strengthening intra-sectoral command and sector coordination 
mechanisms; (ii) identifying crucial gaps in human health infrastructure, 
equipment, human and other resources; and (iii) preparing a detailed plan 
defining operational priorities and clearly identifying roles and 
responsibilities at each level of the health system. This subcomponent will 
also finance development of a detailed implemen
tation plan for “social 
distancing” measures in the case of an epidemic, and simulation exercises.  
 
C-2 
Strengtheningthe national public surveillance system
 by: (i) 
providing the National Influenza Laboratory (NIL) with training, 
equipment and facilities to contribute to up-grading its bio-safety level; 
and (ii) strengthening the capacity of the IPH and regional epidemiological 
investigation and response teams.  
 
C-3 
Strengthening health care response capacity
,
by expanding 
regular seasonal flu vaccinations, supporting the purchase and 
distribution of anti-viral drugs and developing effective guidelines for 
their use, and strengthening the capacity of medical services to isolate and 
treat patients with severe communicable diseases. 
 
The component will provide equipment upgrades and supplies to the existing national 
public health reference laboratory (NRL) in Tirana other 12 regional public health 
laboratories for rapid diagnosis and cell culture, as well as equipping the NRL with a 
mobile laboratory.  The NRL will be upgraded to BSL-2 while the lab personnel will 
be trained as to work at BSL3, which is suitable for work with infectious agents that 
may cause serious or potentially lethal diseases as a result of exposure by the 
inhalation route. Guidance on specific requirements for BSL-2, -3, and -4 is attached 
at Annex 3.  Other laboratory improvements financed under the project will include 
training on safety and waste management in accordance with the guidelines at Annex 
4.  
 
Construction and renovation works associated with rehabilitation of the Virology 
laboratory in the Institute of Public Health (national reference laboratory 
–NRL- for 
Avian Influenza) will generate low impacts on environment coming from minor 
reconstruction works, such as dust, fumes, and odor (internal and/or external, 
Page  29
29
including volatile construction materials), noise during reconstruction works and other 
impacts coming from transportation of construction and waste materials.  A mitigation 
plan of these reconstruction works is provided by the annex 5-D.  Construction and 
renovation works of the reference laboratory will be carried out in accordance with 
Albanian regulations and practice regarding construction permitting and 
environmental, health and safety permits.  
 
Mitigation Measures for disposal of infected materials using incinerators. 
The project will support the purchase of 9 incinerators, of which 8 will be installed  in 
the major regional hospitals of the country and one in the territory of IVR, serving for 
both IVR and IPH.  Some minor construction work will be required for construction 
or rehabilitation and expansion of impermeable hardstanding and the catchment and 
containment of disinfectants used in the santisation of the equipment.  The scope of 
the potential impact will be modest and will most likely only involve the laying of 
hardstanding and catchment tanks or minor modifications to existing structures.  The 
Government’s standards for these constructions are consistent with the Bank’s 
policies for environmental aspects of minor construction.

The key emissions to the air from operation of the incinerators are odour, particulate 
matter, hydrogen chloride, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, 
volatile organic compounds (from methane to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAH)), and dioxins and furans (PCDD/F).  There will also be noise when the 
incinerator is operating.  In addition there is also risk from airborne release of virus as 
the dead poultry are loaded into the incinerator.  The key actions of mitigation are to 
ensure that the formation of harmful substances is avoided through operation of the 
incinerator at the design temperatures and combustion air supply.  The burning of 
materials e.g. polyvinyl chloride (PVC) that could lead to the formation of harmful 
substances. 
 
The key emissions to water from the incineration processes arise from the water and 
disinfectants that are used in sanitisation of the incinerator and the vehicle used in 
transport of infected materials (bird carcasses and other waste material) from labs and 
hospitals to the incinerator.  There is also a risk from fuel spillage during transport 
and on site commissioning of the facility or overflow of fat from the incinerator.  The 
key actions of mitigation are to provide adequate training and working materials to the 
incinerator operators, and other related personnel, and to ensure that sites are prepared 
in advance with hardstanding and catchment and containment of disinfectants.  
 
Decision capacity for the mitigation measures, operation, maintenance and monitoring 
of the process will be fulfilled through training and capacity building in this area. The 
environmental management plan matrix and mitigation actions are presented at Annex 
5-B.

Hospital waste management
.
The subcomponent C-3 will provide assistance to the 
health care system for preparedness planning and strategy development to provide 
optimal medical care and maintain essential community services.  To this end,  sub-
component will finance: a) technical assistance for the development of plans to 
establish specialized units (isolation rooms) for AI patients in 15 selected hospitals (3 
hospitals in Tirana and 12 regional hospitals) and increase bed availability in case of a 
pandemic, b) development and/or updating of treatment guidelines and hospital 
infection control guidelines and measures, including hospital waste management, 
antibiotic stocks, mobilization of additional health personnel, c) training of health 
personnel,  d) provision of equipment, drugs, vaccines, and other medical inputs, 
diagnostic reagents, including kits, and e) renovation of specialized units (30 isolation 
rooms altogether) in selected hospitals. Renovation of these units will generate low 
impacts on environment coming from minor construction works, such as dust, fumes, 
and odor (internal and/or external, including volatile construction materials), noise 
during reconstruction works and other impacts coming from transportation of 
construction and waste materials.  A mitigation plan of these reconstruction works is 
provided by the annex 5-D.  Construction and renovation works will be carried out in 
accordance with Albanian regulations and practice regarding construction permitting 
and environmental, health and safety permits.  
 
VI. Monitoring  
The environmental monitoring and evaluation guidelines for the project were 
developed to monitor environmental performance and identify any implementation 
problems so that these can be addressed promptly.  These guidelines provide clear and 
functional roles and responsibilities, and provide monitoring indicators in order to 
measure the success of the mitigation measures.  The monitoring plan is attached at 
Annexes 6-A, 6-B, 6-C and 6-D.  
 
An environmental specialist working with the AITF Secretariat at the Ministry of  
Agriculture, Food and Consumer Protection (MoAFCP) will be responsible for 
monitoring of the implementation of mitigation measures for the Animal Health 
Component of the AI project.  The specialist will also handle environmental oversight 
under the Human Health Component and provide periodic monitoring reports to the 
AITF Secretariat and to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Water 
Administration (MoEFWA) during implementation, and will notify the relevant 
authorities in the event of problems or issues connected with the mitigation measures.  
Monitoring of the EMP implementation will form a part of the overall project 
monitoring and evaluation system.  
 
Monitoring for Incineration disposal of bird carcasses, hospital and Labs waste 
material will be conducted under the Animal and Human Health Components. The 
environmental monitoring and operation guidelines for the incineration facilities are 
based upon published guidelines for facilities up to 1 ton per hour capacity.  Extracted 
information relevant to Albania is shown at Annex 6-B.  These were developed to 
monitor performance and emissions from incineration plant designed to destroy 
animals according to the EU Animal by-Products Directive 1774/2005 2003.    
 
Page  32
32
In the Directive 94/2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza 
and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC, Article 48 requires that the cleansing, disinfection 
and treatment of holdings and any materials or substances contaminated or likely to be 
contaminated with avian influenza viruses are carried out under official supervision in 
accordance with:  
a) instructions of the official veterinarian; and  
b) principles and procedures for cleansing, disinfecting and treatment set out 
in Annex VI of the directive.  
 
The Albanian government has adopted the general principles of the Directive and its 
predecessor Directive 92/40/EEC within its strategic response. These guidelines and 
the legal statutes for the Albanian response provide clear and functional 
environmental/social issues monitoring and evaluation roles and responsibilities, and 
provide monitoring indicators in order to measure the success of the mitigation 
measures.  The monitoring indicators include the maintenance of the operating 
temperatures of the incinerator facilities to that will ensure that the destruction of 
harmful products of combustion.  This will demonstrate that the incinerator is 
operated correctly and in a way that minimizes harmful emissions.

Monitoring of the interception of liquid run off from disinfecting and wash down of 
the incineration facilities, containers and transport vehicles is required to demonstrate 
that biocide contaminated water is intercepted and that none is able to enter ground 
water via soak away or surface drainage. The monitoring plan for incineration is 
shown at Annex 6-B-1 and 6-B-2.  
 
VII. Institutional Arrangements and Budget  
 
The AITF and its Secretariat, and PMU of the Water Resource Management Project 
(WRMP) are responsible for ensuring adequate budget and procurement of goods, 
works and services for implementation of the EMP mitigation and monitoring 
measures, and for supervision.  The AITF Secretariat is also responsible for full 
coordination with the Veterinary Service (within the MoAFCP), Public Health Service 
(within the Ministry of Health), Ministry of Environment, Forest and Water 
Administration, Ministry of Interior, and Cabinet of Ministers on matters connected 
with implementation of the EMP.   
 
Budget for implementation and monitoring of the EMP is provided under Component 
4, Implementation Support and Monitoring and Evaluation  
 
VIII. Public Consultation Arrangements  
Page  34
34
The draft EMP will be publicly disseminated in Albanian by the AI Task Force 
Secretariat through the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Consumers Protection 
by posting on the Ministry’s website, announcing availability of the document in local 
press and on the government agency websites, and by making paper copies available 
in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Water Administration Public Information 
Center.    
 
The AI Task Force Secretariat will organize and conduct at least one public briefing 
and consultation on the draft EMP not later than June 15, 2006.  The place, time and 
purpose of the consultation will be announced in the local press at least one week in 
advance of the meeting.  In addition to the public announcement of the meeting, 
invitations will be sent to environmental NGOs, commercial poultry growers, farmers 
associations, local officials from regions prone to AI, Cabinet of Ministers staff, 
Ministries of Environment, Forest and Water Administration, Health, Agriculture, and 
Ministry of Interior, and local representatives of international organizations including 
the World Bank, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP), and USAID.  
 
The draft EMP will be revised after the meeting to take into account inputs from the 
consultation, as appropriate.  The final version of the EMP will be made publicly 
available in Albania, provided to the World Bank, and used by the government 
agencies in the implementation of the project.

Annex 1 
Summary of the FAO and the OIE Global Strategy for the Progressive Control 
of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) 
 
1. Vision and goal.
 The long-term vision of the strategy is to minimize the global 
threat and risk of HPAI in humans and domestic poultry, through progressive control 
and eradication of HPAI, particularly that caused by H5B1 virus, from terrestrial 
domestic poultry in Asia.  Achieving this goal will diminish the global threat of a 
pandemic, stabilize poultry production, enhance a robust regional and international 
trade in poultry and poultry products, increase human and food safety, and improve 
the livelihoods of the rural poor.  
2. A phased approach
.
The global strategy will be implemented over three time 
frames: immediate to short (1-3 years), short to medium (4-6 years) and medium to 
long term (7-10 years).  During this period the spread of HPAI, mainly of the H5N1 
strain, will have been progressively controlled in domestic poultry of all infected 
countries of Asia, and prevented from affecting those Asian countries not currently 
infected, but at high risk.  
3. 
The immediate to short-term objective is to reduce the risk to humans by preventing 
further spread of HPAI in those countries that are currently infected by H5N1.  
4. 
Over the medium to long-term (7-10 years), a more focused approach to HPAI will 
be mounted to progressively eradicate the disease from the remaining compartments 
of infected domestic terrestrial poultry in the region.  The medium-to-long term 
strategy will consider all control measures, including vaccination, zoning and 
compartmentalization as defined in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code.  For the 
long-term success of this strategy, restructuring of the poultry sectors in the region 
will need to be seriously considered.   
5. 
To prevent the threat of HPAI from spreading to avian influenza-free countries, the 
long-term strategy supports the development of active surveillance programs and 
emergency preparedness plans for non-infected, at risk countries.  The application of 
OIE standards relating to the international trade of poultry and poultry products will 
further assist in preventing the spread of HPAI virus across continents.  
6. Capacity building
.
Inadequate capacity in many countries is the principal limiting 
factor for effectively and quickly stamping out and controlling infectious diseases.  
Thus, the strategy suggests building a strong and sustainable human and physical 
resource capacity in the countries, to respond in a more effective and timely manner in 
stamping out not only HPAI outbreaks, but also other newly-emerging infectious 
zoonotic and trans-boundary animal diseases.  Capacity building will be wide ranging 
and include all aspects of disease control as well as policy development and socio-
economic impact analysis.  
7. Strategic research.
 The global strategy recognizes that the dynamics of the current 
rapid spread and persistence of HPAI remain unclear. Therefore, the strategy will 
facilitate strategic research to investigate the epidemiology of avian influenza, 
evaluate the efficacy of vaccines in domestic ducks to reduce the virus shedding in 
domestic duck reservoirs, and work in close collaboration with regional and 
international advanced research institutions to promote the development of improved 
vaccines and rapid diagnostic tests.  Risk analysis of various poultry production 
systems and along marketing chains will be carried out to better target effective 
disease control.  
8. Implementation.
 Implementation will be at the national, regional and international 
levels.  At the national level, well-defined country specific projects will be 
Page  36
36
formulated, which will be underpinned by the formation of sub-regional HPAI 
support units.  Through these units, sub-regional disease diagnosis and surveillance 
and socio-economic and policy analysis networks will be established.  These sub-
regional networks will provide the lead in the development of harmonized technical 
standards and regional policies related to the management of live animal movement, 
compensation plans, capacity building, disease reporting requirements and long term 
planning to restructure poultry sectors.  
9. 
At the international level, coordination of the national programs and sub-regional 
networks will be under the umbrella of GF-TADs (global framework for the control of 
trans-boundary animal diseases), a joint FAO/OIE initiative.  The international 
coordination will provide technical backstopping to the subregional networks and 
national programs, promote international cooperation, and mobilize and coordinate 
resources for HPAI control.  
10. Partners.
 The main partners in implementation of the strategy will be infected 
and non-infected at-risk countries, and regional organizations, all of which are 
committed to controlling trans-boundary animal and zoonotic diseases.  Given the 
zoonotic nature of the HPAI, and the complex interface between farming systems, 
livestock trade, food safety and public health, a strong international partnership 
among FAO, OIE and WHO will be continued.  A number of other partners will be 
involved, important among these would be the private sector, NGOs, and regional 
national agriculture extensions systems (NARES).  
11. Resources
.
The implementation of the strategy will require funding to support the 
national, regional and international HPAI control programs as outlined above.  
 
Framework for Implementation  
12.
 A Framework for Implementation has been developed by FAO/OIE, promoting 
national, regional, and international initiatives.  It includes the following:  
 
National initiatives: 
 
•
Development of a National Strategy for each country specific to its own 
conditions. It would address farming systems, presence/absence of ducks, 
presence of human cases or not, trade orientation, implementation capacity, 
and wildlife migration patterns;  
•
Preparation of contingency and emergency preparedness plans;  
•
Development of economic impact and policy frameworks;  
•
Prevention of avian influenza to non-infected at-risk countries through 
awareness, reporting, and early detection; and   
•
Improvement in epidemiological information on source of infection and 
transmission dynamics in farming system and marketplaces.  
 
Regional initiatives
:
•
Standardization of diagnosis and reporting techniques among countries;  
•
Sharing of disease information between countries;  
•
Development of a regulatory framework for management of animal 
movements; and

Annex 2 
Summary of the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategy 
 
1. The strategic plan
 lays out activities for individual countries, the international 
community and WHO to prepare for a pandemic and mitigate its impact. The 
objectives of the plan correspond to the opportunities to intervene and are structure in 
the following three phases:  
Phase -Pre-Pandemic:  
(i)
 Reduce opportunities for human infection. 
An immediate priority is to halt spread 
in poultry to reduce human exposure to the virus.  More intensive collaboration is 
needed between the animal and health sectors.  Communication activities targeting 
stakeholders, particularly rural poultry holders, should be strengthened.  Workers 
carrying out the culling of poultry must be protected against infection by clothing and 
equipment.   
(ii) 
Strengthen the early warning system. 
To assess risks to public health and guide 
protective measures, information is needed on the extent of influenza infection in 
animals and humans and on circulating viruses.  National surveillance systems must 
be improved urgently in potentially affected countries.  When outbreaks in animals 
occur, active human case detection should be pursued by a coordinated animal-human 
health team.   
 
Phase - Emergence of a Pandemic:  
(iii) 
Contain or delay spread at the source. 
Aggressive containment measures such as 
isolation and prophylactic use of antiviral drugs may slow pandemic spread and allow 
time for response measures.  An international stockpile of antiviral drugs for an 
emergency response should be established, starting with a stockpile for targeted early 
use.  
Phase 
–
Pandemic Declared and Spreading Internationally:  
(iv) 
Reduce morbidity, mortality, and social disruption
.
Although mass vaccination is 
the preferred intervention, serious issues related to the time lag between emergence of 
the virus and vaccine production as well as production capacity constraints must be 
addressed.  Anti-viral supply and production capacity are also limited.  Therefore, the 
main responses in the immediate term should be classic “social distancing measures” 
such as quarantine, bans on mass gatherings, and travel restrictions, backed up by a 
well-designed communication strategy.  For the longer term, options with industry to 
improve antiviral and vaccine capacity need to be explored.    
(v) 
Conduct research during pandemic
.
Research is needed for policy development 
and adjustments for current and future epidemics.  The main elements include: 
assessing the epidemiologic characteristics; monitoring the effectiveness of the 
interventions; and evaluating the medical and economic consequences.    
 
Recommended Strategic Actions 
 
2. In view of the immediacy of the avian influenza threat, WHO recommends that all 
countries undertake urgent action to prepare for a pandemic. Advice on doing so is 
contained in the recently revised 
WHO global influenza preparedness plan 
(2005) and 
a
new 
WHO checklist for influenza pandemic preparedness planning (2005).  
Table 1 
describes the phases of increasing public health risk associated with the emergence of 
a
new influenza virus subtype that may pose a pandemic threat, and the overarching 
public health goals under each phase.  
Page  39
39
Table 1:  Phases of Increasing Public Health Risk Associated with the Emergency 
of a New Influenza Virus Subtype that May Pose a Pandemic Threat  
 
Interpandemic period  
Phase 1.
 No new influenza virus subtypes have 
been detected in humans. An influenza virus 
subtype that has caused human infection may be 
present in animals.  If present in animals, the   
risk of human infection or disease is considered to 
be low.  
•
Strengthen influenza pandemic 
preparedness at the global, 
regional, national and sub-
national levels.  
Phase 2. 
No new influenza virus subtypes have 
been detected in humans.  However, a circulating 
animal influenza virus subtype poses a substantial 
risk of human disease. 
•
Minimize the risk of transmission 
to humans;  
•
detect and report such 
transmission rapidly if it occurs.  
 
Pandemic alert period  
Phase 3.
 Human infection(s) with a new subtype, 
but no human-to-human spread, or at most rare 
instances of spread to a close contact. 
•
Ensure rapid characterization of 
the new virus subtype and early 
detection, notification and 
response to additional cases.  
Phase 4.
 Small cluster(s) with limited human-to-
human transmission but spread is highly 
localized, suggesting that the virus is not well 
adapted to humans.  
•
Contain the new virus within 
limited foci or delay spread to 
gain time to implement 
preparedness measures, including 
vaccine development.  
Phase 5.
 Larger cluster(s) but human-to-human 
spread still localized, suggesting that the virus is 
becoming increasingly better adapted to humans, 
but may not yet be fully transmissible (substantial 
pandemic risk). 
•
Maximize efforts to contain or 
delay spread, to possibly avert a 
pandemic, and to gain time to 
implement pandemic response 
measures.  
 
Pandemic period  
Phase 6.
 Pandemic: increased and sustained 
transmission in general population 
•
Minimize the impact of the 
pandemic 
Note: 
a)  The distinction between phase 1 and phase 2 is based on the risk of human infection 
or disease resulting from circulating strains in animals. The distinction is based on 
various factors and their relative importance according to current scientific 
knowledge. Factors may include pathogenicity in animals and humans, occurrence 
in domesticated animals and livestock or only in wildlife, whether the virus is 
enzootic or epizootic, geographically localized or widespread, and/or other 
scientific parameters.  
b)  The distinction between phase 3, phase 4 and phase 5 is based on an assessment of 
the risk of a pandemic. Various factors and their relative importance according to 
current scientific knowledge may be considered. Factors may include rate of 
Page  40
40
transmission, geo-graphical location and spread, severity of illness, presence of 
genes from human strain (if derived from an animal strain), and/or other scientific 
parameters. 
(Source:
 WHO 2005) 
 
3. In order to accomplish the public health goals described for each phase, WHO 
recommends strategic actions that can be undertaken to capitalize on each opportunity 
to intervene.  Given the many uncertainties about the evolution of the pandemic 
threat, including the amount of time left to prepare, a wise approach involves a mix of 
measures that immediately address critical problems with longer-term measures that 
sustainably improve the world’s capacity to protect itself against the recurring 
pandemic threat.  
 
4. The strategic actions are:  
 
Reduce opportunities for human infection
,
including:  
•
Support to the FAO/OIE control strategy;  
•
Intensify collaboration between the animal and public health sectors;  
•

•
Improve approaches to environmental detection of the virus  
 
Strengthen the early warning systems
,
including:  
•
Improve the detection of human cases;  
•

•
Strengthen risk assessment;  
•
Strengthen existing national influenza centers throughout the risk-prone regions; 
and

,
including:  
•
Establish an international stockpile of anti-viral drugs;  
•
Develop mass delivery mechanisms for anti-viral drugs; and  
•

Conduct research to guide response measures,
 including:  
•
Assess the epidemiological characteristics of an emerging pandemic;  
•
Monitor the effectiveness of human interventions; and  
•
Evaluate the medical and economic consequences.

Segregation / Triage of Waste  
Page  46
46
Multihazardous waste 
–
goal is reduction of waste to a waste that presents a single hazard.  
 
•
Consider frequency and amount of waste generated; assess risk   
•
Identify / characterize waste:  
•
Physical description  
•
Water reactivity  
•
Water solubility  
•
pH and possibly neutralization information  
•
ignitability / flammability  
•
presence of oxidizer  
•
presence of sulfides / cyanides  
•
presence of halogens  
•
presence of radioactive materials  
•
presence of biohazardous materials  
•
presence of toxic constituents  
•
Minimize waste’s hazards  
•
Determine options for management of hazards  
•
If appropriate, take steps to neutralize waste or render it non-hazardous  
•
When possible, select a single management option  
•
Establish procedures for dealing with unstable waste, or waste that requires special storage 
or handling  
•
Store safely:  
•
Designated room or facility modified to contain the waste (with ventilation and 
effluent trapping)  
•
Protect workers  
•
Minimize risk of fire or spill  
•
Minimize radiation levels outside of area  
•
Consider compatibility of materials being accumulated (e.g., aqueous and non-
aqueous waste should be separated)  
•
Give particular attention to the handling or cleaning of radioactive laboratory 
ware, and to the proper disposal of sharps.  
•
Non-contaminated (non-infectious) waste can be reused or recycled or disposed 
of as general waste  
•
Contaminated (infectious) sharps – collect in puncture-proof containers fitted 
with covers and treated as infectious; autoclave if appropriate  
•
Contaminated material for decontamination by autoclaving and thereafter 
washing and reuse or recycling  
•
Contaminated material for direct incineration 
Disposal  
•
No activity should begin unless a plan for the disposal of hazardous waste has been 
formulated  
•
Use appropriate disposal method for each category of waste  
•
Use appropriate containers  
•
Label and securely close waste containers  
•
Separate wastes as appropriate  
Page  47
47
For low level radioactive waste, options include  
•
Storage time for decay and indefinite on site storage,  
•
Burial at a low-level radioactive waste site,  
•
Incineration, or  
•
Sanitary sewer disposal  
 
For biological waste, options include
 
•
Disinfection  
•
Autoclaving  
•
For liquids, disposal in sanitary sewer; putrescible waste disposed of by incineration; 
needles and sharps require destruction, typically by incineration or grinding  
 
Collection and storage of waste
 
•
At satellite area near lab:   
•
should be clearly identified, ventilated if necessary  
•
determine whether to recycle, reuse, or dispose  
•
hold here for less than one year; when containment volume limits reached, move 
to central accumulation area 
–
package appropriately  
•
At central accumulation area:  
•
separate according to compatibility, commingle solvents when appropriate  
•
label clearly, store in appropriate containers  
•
limit storage time to 90 days  
•
ensure that employees are trained to handle waste materials as well as 
contingency planning for emergencies  
•
When transporting, make provisions for spill control in case of accident; have 
internal tracking system to follow movement of waste  
•
Ensure that all necessary records have been generated (Quantities and 
identification of waste generated and shipped; Documentation and analyses of 
unknown materials; Manifests for waste shipping as well as verification of waste 
disposal; Any other information required to ensure compliance and safety from 
long-term liability)  
•
Disposal options:  
•
Incineration – is method of choice for most wastes, but is most expensive  
•
Normal trash – only where appropriate, must be clearly identified and 
appropriately labeled  
•
Sanitary sewer – not commonly used; solutions must be aqueous and 
biodegradable, or low toxicity inorganics – make sure sewer doesn’t drain into 
water supply inappropriate for waste disposal, and make sure waste is highly 
diluted  
•
Release to the atmosphere – not acceptable; fume hoods must have trapping 
devices to prevent discharge to atmosphere  
 
•
If hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are mixed, entire waste volume must be treated as 
hazardous  
•
Preparation for transport to a treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF)  
Page  48
48
•
Waste generator must obtain assurance (in terms of documentation, permits, records) that 
provider is reliable  
 
For infectious material 
 
•
Decontaminate, autoclave, or incinerate in lab  
•
Package appropriately (for incineration or for transfer to another facility for incineration) 
•
Protect against hazards to others to those who might come in contact with discarded items

Minutes of the public briefing of the draft EMP 
 
Tirana, 15 June, 2006 
 
The Public briefing was held at the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Consumer 
Protection. A list of participants is attached below. 
 
The meeting was mediated by AITF secretariat. Ms. Eralda Mariani, coordinator of 
Human Public Health component of the Albania’s AI project opened the meeting and 
introduced meeting agenda to participants. She gave the floor to Mr. Ibrahim Hackaj, 
representative of World Bank ResMission in Tirana and task manager of Albania’s AI 
project. Mr. Hackaj in his speech considered the meeting an important step towards 
finalization of the Environmental Management Plan, preparation of which is based on 
the WB request and safeguard policy. He said that the EMP is aiming and prevention 
and mitigation of environmental impacts of Albania’s Avian Influenza Control and 
Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project. The EMP should be a complete 
and working document to help improve environmental performance of implementing 
agencies of AI project in Albania, based on problems encountered and lessons learned 
from the first two cases of AI outbreaks in Cuka and Peze-Helmes. He invited all 
participants to actively discuss and comment on draft EMP and contribute to its 
completion and finalization.  
 
Mr. Ferdinand Bego, local environmental consultant to prepare the EMP, did make a 
short power point presentation of the draft EMP, being focused in his presentation on 
main environmental issues of AI project to be addressed by the EMP, through 
environmental mitigation and monitoring plans for disposal of bird carcasses, 
laboratory and hospital materials and wastes infected with AI virus as well as through 
increasing biosafety level in labs and hospitals.  
 
Mr. Haki Zoto, head of Session on Flora and Fauna within the Ministry of 
Environment, Forest and Water Administration raised in his speech the issue of 
engaging the forestry personnel at local level, especially those serving along the 
coastal wetland areas, in the survey and reporting of dead wild birds, especially 
migratory waterfowl. He wanted to make clear whether the forestry personnel will be 
engaged in the process of safety collection, package and transportation of the dead 
animals to laboratories for tests and analysis.  
 
Mr. Altin Telo, AITF secretariat, coordinator of Animal Health component of the 
project, informed the audience that the AI project will support MoEFWA and forestry 
personnel with logistics and equipment (binoculars, telescopes, guides) in order to 
increase their capacities to conduct surveys and monitoring of wild birds. He made 
clear that up to know the Task Force decision has been on non-engagement of forestry 
personnel in collecting and sending dead wild birds to labs, but they can report these 
cases to veterinary and public health service at local and regional level.

Mr. Agim Shehi, head of Human Health Department of the Ministry of Health, in his 
speech found the draft EMP as a complete and carefully prepared document, 
addressing all environmental issues and concerns of AI project, especially those 
related to human health, in a proper way.  He made some comments to improve 
document language of the Albanian version of EMP, using some terminology that is 
familiar in health sector.  Further,  Mr. Shehi informed participants with all efforts and 
measures of AITF and MoH, as well as regional and local AI committees or task force 
to prevent and control AI and a possible human pandemic in Albania.  
 
Mr. Lefter Klimi, head of Veterinary Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food 
and Consumer Protection addresses in his speech the need of veterinary service and 
personnel to get experienced in using various methods of disposal of animal carcasses 
and other infected material and wastes, so that they can be adopted to current 
conditions in each specific case of AI outbreak, taking into account environmental 
concerns and requirements, and trying to avoid as much as possible the spread of the 
outbreak and minimizing environmental pollution. Mr. Klimi did emphasize that, 
provided the tradition and existing conditions under which the domestic poultry is 
reared in Albania’s rural areas, it is very difficult to eradicate the infection in the 
ground. Apart from the safety culling and disposal of infected animals, attention 
should also be given to safety disinfection of premises and other backyard facilities 
used by domestic animals and safety composting of animal wastes.   
 
Z. Nevruz Lika, head of veterinary inspectorate at the Regional Directorate of 
Agriculture and Food of Tirana, found the draft EMP a very helpful document for the 
proper implementation of measures planned under AI project, particularly those under 
animal health component. He also found very helpful the meeting and site visit of the 
environmental consultant in Peze-Helmes, comments and views received form the 
consultant related to environmental management of the Peze-Helmes AI outbreak, 
especially those dealing with proper siting and construction of burial pit in Peze-
Helmes. Mr. Lika admitted that in the case Peze-Helmes outbreak, the environmental 
concerns, especially those related to burial siting (on gravel deposits nearby Erzeni 
river), construction and environmental mitigation measures, were not fully taken into 
consideration and implemented, and this should not happen again. He also underlined 
that, provided existing conditions in rural areas, especially those along the coast, and 
the high pathogenity of the strain H5N1, disposal of infected or suspected birds with 
HPAI by burial pit is not the most safety method, and he recommended that the AI 
project should consider the use of mobile incinerator as another and more safety 
alternative of animal carcasses disposal. Provision of use of mobile equipment for 
disinfection for 12 regions of the country was considered a high priority issue under 
animal health component of the project.  
 
Mr. Xhemal Mato, environmental journalist representing a network of Environmental 
NGOs called “EKO-Levizja” (Eco-Movement) did also recognize the work done by 
local environmental consultant for the preparation of the draft EMP. According to 
him, this EMP has identified and addressed in a professional way all environmental 
issues and concerns, making sure that moderate impacts on environment coming from 
implementation of measures and activities of AI project are either avoided or 
mitigated. In his speech Mr. Mato added that environmental NGOs in Albania have 
expressed their concern about the efforts made so far to control and containment 
response of Albania’s Government to HPAI, particularly about the way media has 
Page  81

reacted so far. It is very important that general public and local communities are well 
informed about the potential risk of human pandemia as result of man-to-man 
transmission of the virus. After the first two cases of AI outbreak in Cuka and Peze-
Helmes, there is a full but “fear” silence in the media, both national and local media.   
Mr. Mato added that there is existing a “pollution” in the public information. There is 
a
bad and misleading information of the public by media, coming from either lack of 
professionalism or bad intention of the journalists or editors. Information is “polluted” 
and badly transformed sometimes in the way from the specialists to the journalist, 
media editor until it reaches its final destination, that’s the general public. Aarhus 
Convention on public right of access to environmental information should be used as 
an important instrument during the implementation of the AI project. Environmental 
NGOs of Albania should and may play an important role to inform the general public 
and local communities about the real risks of a human pandemia at global, regional 
and national level and public response to prevent, control and contain it, in case it 
happens. Mr. Mato recommended that a representative of environmental NGOs 
should be a member of AITF .   
 
Mr. Klodian Aliu from the EIA Departament of the MoEFWA in his speech expressed 
the views of its department regarding the EMP document and EMP preparation 
process itself. He underlined strong points of this EMP such as: methodology;  
working out of alternatives and options; detailed mitigation and monitoring plans; 
public consultation meetings and participation of environmental NGOs during 
commenting and discussions on the draft EMP. Mr. Aliu added that MoEFWA and 
REAs should be more actively involved in the process of site selection for burial 
disposal of infected poultry and decision making for the proper method of disposal to 
be used in each particular case of any potential AI outbreak. They should closely 
supervise the construction and operation of burial pits, disinfection (method and 
dosage of disinfectants), in order to make sure that environmental standards and 
norms are fully respected and effects on environment are minimized. Mr. Aliu did 
also recommend as already proposed by the draft EMP itself, that project should 
consider, apart from disposal method of animals by burial pits, other methods, such as 
mobile incineration. He commented that during the first two cases of AI outbreaks in 
Cuka and Peze-Helmes some communication and coordination problems inside AITF 
have been encountered, and in the future we have to make sure that roles and 
responsibilities of various institutions are clearly set up 
Who is doing What?

should be better supported and guided in fulfilling their tasks and functions related to 
implementation of mitigation measures and monitoring plan at regional and local 
level. Representatives from REAs should be members of regional and local AI task 
force.  
 
Mr. Ibrahim Hackaj, (WB representative) in his intervention, bearing in mind the fact 
that Environment authority has not been actively involved during the emergency 
management of the first two cases (Cuke dhe Peze-Helmes), emphasized the need for 
amending the existing Law on Veterinary Service and Inspection, particularly the 
provision on responsibility and competences during the decision making for selection 
of burial and or incineration sites.   Apart from commune head and veterinary 
authority, local/regional environmental authority should be part in such a decision 
making. With regard to public communication and information, Mr. Hackaj proposed 
that a TV spot on HPAI addressed to general public be produced and broadcasted

while the World Football championship takes place, because TV is very massively 
watched by the public at this time.  
Mr. Eduart Kakarriqi, Director of the Institute of Public Health (IPH), during his 
speech was focused on the need to increase Biosafety level in laboratories 
manipulating with infected materials from H5N1, small investment for upgrading and 
renovating IPH labs and professional training of their staff on laboratory biosafety and 
laboratory waste management. In reply to Mr. Kakarriqi question whether during the 
AI project lifespan the IPH will be upgraded from BSL2 to BSL3, Ms. Mariani made 
a
statement by referring to the PAD of the AI project. She said that at the end of 
project implementation, the IPH will have an infrastructure corresponding to BSL2, 
but the labs personnel will be trained to work as BSL3.  
 
At the end of this public meeting, the consultant expressed his gratitude to all 
participants for their comments and exchanging views with regard to AI project and 
its draft EMP. Mr. Bego ensured them that their comments, views and 
recommendations will be incorporated accordingly in the final version of the EMP. 
He also ensured participants that minutes of such public briefing will be prepared and 
disseminated very soon and will be attached in the annex 8 of the final EMP. The final 
version of EMP will be submitted to the World Bank and MoEFWA for approval and 
issuing of Environmental Permit to AI project.
