 Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The project development objective is to strengthen the country's capacity to prevent the
 spread of avian influenza among poultry, to prevent the transmission of avian influenza
 from birds to other animals and humans, and to prepare for a potential pandemic of avian
 influenza transmissible between humans.

 Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
 The revised PD~ was to minimize the threat posed to humans by Highly Pathogenic Avian
 Influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonoses and to prepare for, control, and respond to
 influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Albania was considered to be at "imminent risk" for highly pathogenic avian
influenza (lIPAI) at the time of appraisal, as defined in the Global Program for Avian Influenza
(GPAI) Project Framework Document of December 5, 2005. This risk status followed two
confirmed HPAI outbreaks in March 2006, which occurred in domestic poultry.

2.       Outbreaks of lIPAI had great potential to spread if left unchecked. More than half of
323 wild bird species recorded in the country are migratory, including species that frequent
wetlands adjacent to farming communities. Albania's poultry population was estimated at about
6.3 million birds, of which over 85 percent were reared as free-range poultry on small household
farms across the country. The potential consequences of an undetected or unchecked outbreak,
including transmission of the virus to humans and the possible emergence of a virus transmissible
between humans, were well-documented in the GPAI PAD.

3.       There was an urgent need to improve Albania's capacity to prevent, identify,
contain and eradicate lIPAI outbreaks, and deal with a potential pandemic should· this
contingency develop. The Government of Albania (GoA) had effectively contained the 2006
outbreaks in poultry, with support of the international donor community, focusing on mounting a
rapid response, improving surveillance, detection, and containment measures. Its efforts included:
(i) adjusting legislation in line with international standards for control and prevention of
communicable diseases, including influenza pandemics; (ii) establishing a National Influenza
Pandemic Committee,or ''Task Force," as an inter-ministerial and inter-sectoral decision-making
body; and (iii) establishing a working group between the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Consumer Protection (MAFCP). However, several needs were
identified for further support, including strengthening institutional capacities, increasing public
awareness, and ensuring that potential compensation funds were in place.

4.       The rationale for this project included specific. benefits to the medical and
veterinary services, and building on initiatives of the United Nations (UN) agencies and the
GoA. The project's design focused on strengthening veterinary and public health services and
mitigating the social and economic fallout of ~ potential influenza pandemic. It built on prior
work conducted by the GoA and UN agencies: the World Health Organization (WHO) and other
UN agencies had taken the lead in mounting 'the technical response to Albania's avian influenia,
(AI) crisis. The World Bank anticipated that these UN agencies would continue to take the lead in
providing technical assistance. However, the scale of the response needed to contain and
eradicate potential avian influenza (AI) outbreaks and prevent transmission to humans required
mobilization of financial resources· beyond the mandate and means of these organizations, and
well beyond the government's emergency reserves.

5.      The World Bank was able to bring critical assistance to these efforts in the form of a
financing framework consisting of IDA credits and Japanese PHRD grant money.' In
addition, with the Bank's operational experience in assisting other countries under the GPAI



I Japanese Grant for Co-financing of Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness Project,
Grant Number TF056728, not exceeding U8$800,000.
umbrella, and in mounting emergency response operations,it was able to draw on valuable
lessons learned from other countries facing similar threats and operating in related environments.
The Albania AI project was approved by the Bank's Board on June 27, 2006 and became
effective on October 16, 2006.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.      The PDO was to strengthen the country's capacity to prevent the spread of avian
influenza among poultry, to prevent the transmission of avian influenza from birds to other
animals and humans, and to prepare for a potential pandemic of avian influenza transmissible
between humans.

7.        The Key Indicators were:
With regard to awareriess ofHPAI threat and how to prevent it:
       i.      Behavior changes among key veterinary and public health personnel;
      ii.      Public awareness of how to prevent spread increases and behavior changes.

With regard to HPAI outbreaks among pOUltry:
       i.     Government culls birds at the infection points following international best practice;
      ii.     Government provides timely compensation to farmers for culled birds

With regard to HP AI outbreaks among humans:
       i.     Infection diagnosed and contained;
      ii.     Patients receive appropriate treatment for HPAI infection.

1.3 Revised   PD~   and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

8.      The project was restructured (see Project Paper dated September 17,2009, approved by
the Board on October 15, 2009). The revised PDO was to minimize the threat posed to humans
by HPAI infection and other zoonoses and to prepare for, control, and respond to influenza
pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.

9.        The revised Key Indicators were:
With regard to awareness of the HPAI threat and how to prevent it:
       i.      Behavior changes among key veterinary and public health personnel
      ii.      Public awareness of how to prevent spread increases and behavior changes.

With regard to outbreaks ofHPAI and other zoonoses among animals:
       i.     Enhance laboratory diagnostic capacity of zoonotic diseases,
      11.     Strengthen surveillance of zoonotic diseases on the ground, including modalities
              for reporting, recording and investigating suspect cases.
     iii.     Ensure prompt and efficient prevention/control/eradiation of prevalent zoonoses,
              including resources and procedures for compensation.

With regard to HPAI outbreaks among humans:
       i.     National Influenza Preparedness Plan for control and response to outbreak and
              pandemic prepared in accordance with WHO recommendations.
      ii.     Contained and diminishing pattern of HPAI and other zoonotic viral threats and
              infections in humans.




                                                2
10.      There was no disease outbreak during the project's first two years. At the Mid-Tenn
Review (MTR) in July 2008, GoA suggested re-directing the funds reserved for compensation for
culling birds in the event of an AI epidemic (about US$2 million, which was still intact) to other
eligible activities. A preliminary risk assessment at MTR had shown that the relative risk of
incursion of HPAI had diminished since the project began, due to: (i) favorable containment of
the epidemic in the wider region; and (ii) better preparedness of the Albanian authorities to deal
with an epidemic.2 Other reasons for restructuring were: the declaration of pandemic level 6 by
WHO and the need to respond to mitigate consequences of the pandemic; and the need to adjust
resources for the construction of the Animal Health (AH) laboratory in the Institute of Food
Safety and Veterinary (IFSV). The project's scope broadened from only HPAI to include other
zoonotic diseases of concern such as brucellosis, rabies, tuberculosis. While vigilance for HPAI
remained a priority, the government had been simultaneously combating other prevalent animal
diseases of public health concern, and many of the Project activities intended to control HPAI .
were also considered effective for preventing and controlling other zoonotic diseases. 3

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.      (i) The smallholders keeping poultry in their backyards, through preventing destruction
of their animals due to disease by strengthening veterinary services, and through targeted.
messages particularly to women and children who manage birds; and (ii) the wider community in
Albania and globally who would be affected by potential human pandemic influenza of avian
origin and other zoonoses, through public awareness raising and strengthening health services.

1.5 Original Components -

12.      Component 1: Public Awareness and Information Campaign (US$460,OOO) aimed to
help develop and implement a communications plan to infonn the public, particularly those more
likely to be exposed to HPAI, about the threat ofHPAI and how they could minimize the risk of
transmission and spread of disease. Its two subcomponents were: (i) Risk Communication, and
(ii) Communication for Behavior Change.

13.     Component 2: Animal Health (US$3,698,200) was to support a national program to
develop and implement short- and long-tenn HPAI prevention, containment, and control and
eradication activities in animals. Its three subcomponents were: (i) Enhancing HPAI Prevention
and Preparedness Capacity; (ii) Strengthening Disease Control Capacities, and Improving
Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacities, and Applied Research; and (iii) Strengthening HP AI Control
Programs and Outbreak Containment Programs.

14.    Component 3: Human Health (US$I,600,000) was to support a national program to
develop and implement short- and medium-tenn prevention of an outbreak of HPAI among
humans and reduce the impact of pandemic virus. Its subcomponents were: (i) Enhancing
Coordination and Program Planning; (ii) Strengthening the National Public Health Surveillance
System; and (iii) Strengthening Health Care Response Capacity.




2See Restructuring Project Paper, September 17,2009, and the MTR Aide Memoire, July 3-8,2008.
3The revised PDO was more aligned with the OPAl PD~, "to minimize the global threat posed to humans
by HPAI infection and other zoonoses and to prepare for, control, and respond to an influenza pandemic
and other irifectious disease emergencies in humans" (Report No. 34386, January 12,2006).


                                                 3
 15.     Component 4: Support to AvianInfluenza Task Force (TF)(US$341,200) was to
 support the Avian Influenza TF in implementation of the government's AI response strategy
 (including. components 1 to 3 above), through: (i). strengthening the TF by establishing a
 Permanent Secretariat; and (ii) enhancing Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) capacity.

 1.6 Revised Components (after restructuring)4

 16.     Component 1: Public Awareness and Communication (US$500,600) aimed to.address
 the remaining knowledge gaps within the population concerning influenza-like diseases, zoonoses
 and AlHINI pandemic knowledge within the population. The areas in need of focus were to be
 detailed following the second Knowledge Attitude Practice (KAP) survey.

  17.      Component 2: Animal Health (US$3,238,200) was to finance the construction of a new
. (as opposed toreconstruction ofthe existing) AH laboratory foreseen a Project approval. The new
  laboratory was to provide benefits beyond AI, and was viewed as being consistent with both the
  original PDO and revised PDO, and represented a feasible, proportionate and sustainable solution
  responsive to the original and expected laboratory diagnostic needs of Albania.

 18.      Component 3: Human Health (US$2,660,000) was to: (i) support the revisions of the
 NIPP according to WHO recommendations; (ii) take the needed time to capitalize on completed
 and ongoing activities, and, in particular, to raise preparedness in the regions for diagnosis,
 referrals, and management of outbreaks and pandemic; (iii) improve triage and intra-hospital
 procedures for infection control, specifically for regional hospitals; and (iv) enhance knowledge
 of primary health care workers..                         .

 19.     Component 4: Support to Avian Influenza Task Force (US$38I,200) did not change
 except for expanding M&E to include pandemic preparedness and response.

 1.7 Other significant changes

  20.     Reallocation of funds and Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
  (DCA). The Compensation Fund (US$2,000,000) and the Emergency Eligible Imported Goods
  (EEl) finance (US$300,000) were reallocated especially to the Animal Health and Human Health
  Components' activities due to the absence of disease in the first two years. The estimated cost for
  the new AH lab was about US$I.9 million compared to .about US$0.3 million for the originally
. planned reconStruction. The redirection of the CF and the EEl contributed about US$1 million,
  while GoA contributed additional financing of about US$0.68 million. US$I million was
  earmarked for all additional human health component activities (US$570,000) and for activities
  that went beyond the original cost estimates (US$490,OQO) under this component. Schedules 1
  and 2 of the original DCA, dated July 11,2006 were amended on December 17,2009.

 21.     Revised/enhanced activities. These included: (i) Additional support for disease
 emergency management, which included procuring additional outbreak control and personal
 protective equipment to ensure that adequate stocks were available; and additional measures for
 managing disease emergencies, and especially for the pandemic; (ii) Training and technical
 assistance, where the scope of activities was expanded to include a broader capacity building for

 details on how the new components and indicators relate to the original components and indicators.


                                                   4
animal and human health emergency management, triage, field epidemiology, clinical diagnosis
of a list of several important animal diseases, especially zoonoses; and (iii) Animal disease
surveillance and information system, which was modified to include the needs of AI and other
zoonoses control programs without significant additional financing needs.

22.     Cancellation. of Funds. As the building permit for the AH laboratory was not issued, and
consequently the lab and related furniture were not procured, approximately US$I.3 million was
cancelled. Of the Japanese Grant (ofUS$0.8 million) for co-financing the project, US$198,876
equivalent was cancelled as of April 30, 2011.

23.     Closing Date Extension. In order to complete the revised action plan, the original
closing date was extended by 18 months to December 31, 2010.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

24.     The project was a rational response to Albania's specific needs in the context of
global concern for mitigating a potential influenza pandemic. Project preparation included
analysis in applying the Bank's global experience in good practice in HPAl response and
mitigation to the specific situation (poultry management practices,recent outbreak experience,
projected cost of a large-scale culling program) in Albania. This analysis built on the Bank's
expertise in assisting other countries under the GPAI umbrella consistent with the GPAI PAD.

25.     Overall, the preparation and design stage could be considered a good example of
efficient and effective collaboration among relevant stakeholders in situations of public
health threats such as the AI. The donor community, led by USAID, and the UN Family under
the one-UN Approach lead by UNDP,initially encouraged GoA to organize and plan how to
properly respond to the emergency. USAID provided the initial funding for a rapid planning and
response during the emergency phase, and the Bank team was able to build on the existing
mechanisms and plans to further elaborate a longer-term response without losing much time. All
the activities and planned interventions followed a thorough consultative discussion and
consensus building process during the project design phase, sharing a common strategic approach
among all players. This helped synergize efforts and optimize the available resources.

26.     Project design incorporated lessons from Albania's experiences in 2006 of outbreaks
in domestic birds. These included: (i) paying compensation rapidly to boost public confidence
in government control activities; (ii) gaps in community outreach of the behavioral change
campaign; (iii) the importance of rapid implementation of movement control and biosecurity
measures; and (iv) the need to address bottlenecks in surveillance and diagnostics. Specifically,
the design identified ways to improve capacity to prevent, identify, contain and eradicate HPAI
outbreaks and deal with a potential pandemic should that contingency develop.

27.    The Government actively participated in project design, through consultation with the
Task Force, which included representatives from the Ministries of Agriculture (Chair), Health,
Education, Environment, Interior and Finance.

28.    Gender and social development aspects, that is, the role of women and children in
poultry management, were clearly described. These groups were identified and integrated into




                                               5
the project's design, especially in the Public Awareness component, which specified targeting
farmers and children in wetland areas for behavior change messages.

29.     The project's PD~ and four components corresponded well to the assessed needs at
project formulation. (Subsequently, revision became justified, as anticipated further HPAI
outbreaks did not occur and, therefore, the compensation fund was not drawn upon. In addition,
the risk of an HSNI influenza pandemic was surmounted by the actual HINI pandemic that
occurred during implementation.) The project's organization, with particular Ministries
responsible for specific components, was entirely logical and fitted with the mandates of
respective Ministries. The project had a comprehensive list of 28 key indicators. There might
have been scope to streamline project supervision,· had a more refined list of indicators been
defined during project preparation.

30.     Due to urgency of launching the project, however, fiduciary aspects at entry were
based on utilization of an existing Project Management Unit (PMU), namely the Water
Resource Management Project PMU. Lines of responsibility and reporting were not clearly
defined and became a problem in the first period of project implementation (see Section 2.2).

2.2 Implementation

31.    The Task Force and its Secretariat demonstrated strong commitment to the project,
which helped to overcome the many day-to-day challenges reported in regular Supervision
Mission Aide-Memoires.                                                           .

32.      There were implementation issues in the first years of the project's life, related
mainly to fiduciary aspects and delays in hiring staff. For example, a year into
implementation, the Task Force Secretariat (TFS) was still hiring Financial Management (FM)
staff that should have been in place at the onset. There were also some procurement and
disbursement delays.s The FM review made clear recommendations for the staff, which were
taken on board and resulted in improved project implementation. 6

33.      The lack of involvement and ownership by the Central Veterinary Service as
counterpart contributed to implementation issues in the Animal Health Component in the
early stages of the project. 7 The National Veterinary Epidemiology Unit (NVEU) remained
unutilized at ~he end of December 2007. Poor involvement by the Chief Veterinary Officer was
identified as "a major constrictive/delaying factor". 8 To resolve this, during and between
Supervision Missions, the Bank team gave encouragement to follow the action plan and training
scheme that had been developed by the Veterinary Epidemiology international expert.        .

34.    By mid-2008, these issues had been resolved, and the MTR reported that the project
was on the right path to achieve its objectives. In particular, the MTR noted: (i) that the
appointment of an FM expert had helped to keep FM satisfactory; (ii) significant progress with




7 The procurement function was commonly shared between the procurement expert and the animal health
coordinator, which created overlapping of tasks and delays. See ISR #1-3, which refer to delays in
frocurement and ISR # 1, 2, 3 and 4, which refer to slow disbursement.
  See ISR#9, April 201 1.

implementation including iJiprocurement and disbursement; and (iii) significant progress in the
Animal Health Component.

 ~5.      The restructuring and the redirection of funds to more relevant activities, given that
.there was no lIPAI outbreak, was a timely response. The subcomponents were implemented
 as planned after the restructuring, with the exception of the construction of the veterinary lab
 bUilding. The HINI pandemic in 2009 tested the equipment and procedures thathad been put in
 place by the project, which proved to be fit for the purpose. In particular, the isolation facility at
:central level was very effective.

36.      The failure to obtain a building permit to construct the new veterinary diagnostic
lab facility within the project's life a,nd resources affected implementation of this
component.9 This failure is not attributable to negligence on the part of either the Bank or the
Client. On May 19, 2010, the Client informed the Bank that the civil works had commenced
prior to obtaining a building permit. The Bank, in its response of June 7, 2010, indicated that
construction should cease until such time as the building permit is issued. Otherwise, the
Financing Agreement (FA) would be breached as the Project is to be implemented consistent with
the national laws and regulations of Albania. These factors prevented the timely consideration of
alternative outlets of project resources, and have been used as an excuse to defer upgrading the
laboratory bio-safety level by introducing quality assurance systems and standard operating
procedures. Newly procured laboratory diagnostic equipment was installed in the existing
laboratory, infrastructure and made functional. At the end of the project, the building remained
partially constructed on the selected site and fenced off by the contractor, and funds allocated for
the laboratory building and related equipment were returned to the Bank as discussed above.

37.      Project management deteriorated somewhat towards the end of the project. M&E
deteriorated due to the M&E expert position being unfilled for a period. 1O Since June 2010, the
TFS had focused mainly on obtaining the AH lab building permit, and hence in the six months
that followed, project implementation suffered. The procurement rating was downgraded in June
2010 to MU. However, by the final Supervision Mission, several activities had been launched
(related to post review contracts), and project implementation and procurement were considered
moderately satisfactory and FM was rated satisfactory.11                                      '

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

38.    Design. The M&E system and the list of key indicators (original and revised) covered the
POO adequately both in quantitative and qualitative terms. During restructuring, the indicators
were modified,to also capture the preventative outcomes rather than only the previous readiness
outcomes, and to meet the revised POO.

39.     Project monitoring was complicated by the Results Framework having as many as 28
intermediate outcome indicators, some of which were activity/output indicators. The design



9 Project Supervision Mission, Aide Memoire, December 13-17, 20 I 0, p.1 ~d 6. Although a1\ supporting
documentation required for the building permit had been submitted on time to the Municipality of Tirana,
the Tirana Council of Territory Adjustment did not meet for more than one year. Although GoA amended
the Urban Planning Law (May 2010) to provide an alternative solution, this did not materialize due to the
fact that the approval of the regulatory framework of this law was postponed until January 2011.

could have been simpler with fewer key indicators. As indicators are simply a measurement, they
are compared over time to assess change. However, after restructuring, some indicators that did
not have a baseline were retained." Removing indicators against which outcomes could not be
assessed could have enabled better measu~ment of project achievements.

40.     Implementation and Utilization. Under Component 4, the TFS· undertook project
monitoring and faced some challenges in implementing and utilizing the outcome-based M&E
system. Unfortunately, the change and lack of staffing during the project life undermined the
effective use of the M&E system for proper project management. Project reporting improved
on~e a part-time M&E specialist was hired. 12

41.    There were two KAP surveys, in 2006 and in 2009, carried out by UNICEF and funded
by USAID (see details in paragraph 55). The 2006 survey, which was considered the baseline,
was important for follow-up surveys (2009) for comparison and for addressing unforeseen needs.
One finding of the 2009 KAP survey was the need to increase communication skills and health
promotion activities of teachers. Training was organized for about 216 people (biology and
biochemistry teachers, school directors and deputy directors, and education inspectors) on
AlH5Nl and AlHINI symptoms, prevention and transmission.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

42.      The project was classified as Environmental Category B as it supported investments in
carcass disposal for culled poultry and investments in laboratories, and civil works related to the
rehabilitation of laboratories and hospitals. The planned construction of the AH lab, instead of the
originally foreseen reconstruction, required some additional measures to comply with the Bank's
safeguards policies. It was confirmed that OP 4.12 would not be triggered as the Social
Assessment indicated no social safeguard issues.

43.     The Project carried out a legal review to ensure that the land where the AH Lab was to.be
constructed was owned by MAFCP, registered at the Immovable Property Registration Office,
and that there were no outstanding legal claims. GoA also undertook the necessary
Environmental Assessment (EA) and subsequent update of the existing Environmental
Management Plan (EMP). The EA was disclosed on the website of the MAFCP and in the
Bank's Infoshop on August 6,2009.

44.      Overall Safeguard Compliance is rated as satisfactory. Procurement and FM were found
to be moderately satisfactory and satisfactory by the end of the project. Although there were
issues for about a·one-year period prior to the MTR, these were resolved following the MTR. The
FM expert improved his performance and pro activity not only in doing his tasks but helping the
TF when the Project coordinators were promoted to other ministerial tasks.

45.     There were procurement delays in training activities under Components 1,2, and 3 that
resulted in some activities not being implemented, i.e. the crisis management module. However,
most were accomplished though with severe delays, for example: (i) intra-hospital infection
control and bacterial resistance; (ii) zoonotic diseases management; and (iii) crisis
communication management. The project was regularly supervised by the FM and procurement


12ISR #6 May 2009. M&E was downgraded from HS to MS as the M&E expert left the project and
reporting started to fall behind schedule. Although the mission suggested replacing the expert, the TFS
preferred to use those responsible for each component. See Supervision Report of February 16-21,2009.

specialists at the World Bank country office in Albania: Audit reports were delivered on time and
were not qualified.

2.S Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

46.       GoA ensured that an appropriate state budget allocation for 2011 was in place, so that the
facilities and services upgraded by the project could remain in continuous and efficient use. The
IFSV, -as the unique national reference center for veterinary laboratories in Albania, will be
supported by the veterinary budget in appropriate amounts through different programs. The
budget allocated to the AFSV for the programs of animal health and food safety for 2011 was 35
million ALL. Budget allocations for 2012,2013 and 2014 show a steady increase at 33.5, 38 and
40 million ALL respectively, and point to likely sustainability of the project's achievements after
project closing (ISR 9, 23 April 2011). MoH committed funds for the IPH budget for 2011 (42.25
million ALL) to address the sustainability issue for kits, reagents and basic consumables.·

47.      With respect to future improvements, it would be very useful for the ICU personnel to get
hands-on training on intra-hospital infection control,' use of equipment and safe -medical
interventions, including safe injections. Special focus needs to be paid to the team of nurses and
their capacity building in mentioned areas. To this end, the MoH should consider generating the
req~ests to potential donors, as deemed necessary, to improve capacity of medical personnel with
special focus on nurses. In addition, the relevant authorities should bear in mind that the
consumables purchased by the proje~t will be sufficient only for a 6-month period. Various
donor agencies show interest in further support to build on the momentum of outcomes achieved
in the health sector. Furthermore, the Bank's Health System Modernization Project, approved on
March 14,2006 (and closing on March 31, 2012), is complementary to the Health component of
this project, and has a strong potential to build on the outcomes of this project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

48.      The original PDO reflected proper diagnosis of Albania's priorities. The PDQ was
revised to align it to the GPAI PDO and to the country's needs, as discussed in Section 1.3. The
central element of the revised PDQ, that is, to minimize the threat posed to humans by both avian
and human pandemic disease caused by A/H5Nl and HPAI, remains very valid, as the risk of this
contingency continues up to and beyond project completion. The enhanced project -activities are
also in accordance with the principles of the 'One World, One Health' Strategic Framework for
reducing the risk of emerging infectious diseases' (endorsed by four specialized agencies-that is,
WHO, FAO, UNICEF, and the World Organization for Animal Health). The objectives and
design are consistent with Albania's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, for the period 2011-14),
which emphasizes broadening and sustaining social gains by improving education and health
services and establishing an adequate safety net.

49.      Project implementation was responsive to changing needs. The revised PD~ and
activities enabled project resources to be used more appropriately, given the altered scenario. The
project's overall relevance in terms of both design and· implementation was clearly demonstrated
by the efficient response to the HINI influenza pandemic that occurred during 2009.




                                                9
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

50.      This section discusses the mechanisms through which project interventions helped to
achieve the key outcomes and the PD~. Figures 1 and 2 below illustrate causal linkages from the
project's main outputs to the elements of the PD~ before and after project restructuring. The
three .basic elements of the original PD~ were: (i) to strengthen the country's capacity to prevent
the spread of AI; (ii) to prevent the transmission of AI from birds to other animals and to humans;
and (iii) to prepare for a potential pandemic of AI transmission between humans.

51.      Project activities/outputs emphasized three areas: (i) effective communication; (ii)
support to the veterinary sector; and (iii) support to the human health sector. Together these were
expected to help the beneficiaries (poultry smallholders and the wider public susceptible to
potential pandemic influenza) and the project achieve the intermediate outcomes and the PD~.

52.      After restructuring (Figure 2), the aim was broadened from solely the HPAI threat to
include minimizing the threats of other zoonoses and infectious human diseases. While
interventions under Components I and 4 remained largely unchanged, activities under
Components 2 and 3, related to animal and human health respectively, were modified. Therefore,
this ICR considers the achievement of the PD~ "in two stages: before (Stage I) and after (Stage2)
restructuring. (See Annex 2 Part I for details on activities before and after restructuring and on
outputs by component. See Annex 2 Part 2 for achievement of objectives by component.)

Stage 1 PD~: Strengthen the country's capacity to prevent AI spread among poultry by
creating greater awareness and behavior cbange. (Activities did" not change significantly·
after restructuring.)

53.   The project conducted a wjdespread public awareness and information campaign under
Component 1, focused on Risk Communication and Communication for Behavior Change.

54.     Outputs-- Effective .Communication: Under overall coordination of an inter-sectoral
communication working group, the project cooperated closely with USAID and UNICEF (who
funded the activities) to produce, in the first year, many communication materials, for example,
120,000 printed leaflets, posters, field worker communication guides and television messages.
Communication outputs· after restructuring were tailored more to communication needs of the
influenza AlHINI epidemic.




                                                 10
55.     As detailed in Annex 2, many training sessions were held in Tirana and other cities.
Health-related public awareness and communication activities also targeted school teachers to
maximize effectiveness, not only when children were identified as key beneficiaries, but also
because children can influence their families and others. This was shown to be extremely
successful in raising awareness among the Albanian population. Similarly, training programs for
health care workers and teachers have assisted in reinforcing the preventive work.      .

56.      Outcomes-- Greater awareness and behavior change in the target population; Two
Knowledge, Attitude Practice (KAP) surveys were carried out by UNICEF (and funded by
USAID) in 2006 and in 2009. The intention was to; (i) detect any change due to the project; and
(ii) define needs and thus improve the relevance of communication interventions. Due to ethical
and humanitarian reasons, the urgency of the situation did not allow· waiting for the first KAP
survey to be conducted and then starting the communication activities. Rather, the rapid
communication response for AIIHPAI was built on similar experiences from other countries and
previous communication experience oil other health-related issues in Albania. Therefore,
although the 2006 survey took place after the communication activities had started, this survey
can still be used as the baseline, as the short time period between the first communication
activities and the survey is not considered sufficient to change behavior of the population and
influence the survey results.

57.       Two outcome indicators were specified to measure the achievement of greater awareness
and behavior change, and the PD~ in terms of preventing the spread of AI, and the transmission
of AI from birds to other animals and humans. These were;
       i.      '30 % more of at-risk population practicing safe handling procedures with respect
               to poultry and poultry meat', revised (a/restructuring) due to typographic error to,
               '55 % more of at-risk population practicing safe handling procedures with respect
               to poultry and poultry meat'.                                               "
      ii.      (introduced at restructuring) 'Pandemic communications messages produced and
               delivered to targeted audiences'.

58.     Indicator (i). The survey results show an increase in safe handling practices from 2006 to
2009 as follows: wash hands after touching poultry, or poultry products (16.4 % to 63.8 %);
cooking poultry products well (21.7 % to 59%); (iii) know to avoid contact with dead poultry and
wild birds (13.4 % to 50.2%); and (iv) wear gloves when cooking"poultry (9.4 % to 16.5 %).

59.     Indicator (ii). Survey results show the following in 2009: 55.3% (12.7% in 2006) have
seen and read leaflets and brochures; 67.8 % (28 %, in 2006) responded that the leaflets and the
ideas therein were clearly formulated, easily understandable and expressed in an attractive way;
and 75.9 % (72.1% in 2006) responded that they have seen many TV spots and advertising. The
KAP surveys show that messages have been produced and delivered.

Knowledge and behavioral change have clearly increased .between the two surveys. There was
a reported "noticeable change" in positive answers to awareness of TV messages, and a
"significant increase" in the proportion who knew the signs of AI in poultry. Overall, not only
have these activities helped to strengthen Albania's capacity to prevent AI spread among poultry,
but we could also safely assume that they have contributed to the other two areas of the PD~ (i.e.
prevention and preparation) through greater awareness and behavior change.

Stage IPDO (before restructuring): Prevent the transmission of AI from birds to other
animals and humans through controlling poultry outbreaks by culling and compensation

60.      Activities .in this area focused on: (a) Enhancing HPAI Prevention and Preparedness
Capacity; (b) Strengthening Disease Control Capacities, and Improving Surveillance, Diagnostic
Capacities, and Applied Research; and (c) Strengthening 'HPAI Control Programs and Outbreak
Containment Programs. The extensive list of interventions and achievements of outputs in these
areas is discussed in Annex 2.

61.     The eventuality envisaged' in this intermediate outcome did not occur: there were no
outbreaks. This explains, in part, why the project was restructured.

Stage 2 PD~ (after restructuring): Minimize the threat posed to humans ofHPAI infection
and other zoonoses through enhanced veterinary lab diagnosis, strengthened disease
surveillance; and prevention and control of zoonoses.             .                  .

62.      Disease control capabilities were not tested for HPAI as there was no outbreak during the
project; however, it is reasonable to assume that the interventions in this area have contributed to
achieving the PDO of reducing the probability of both contained and widespread outbreaks. The
main outputs and outcomes are listed below, and described further in Annex 2. These include:
establishment of the NVEU and the strengthened diagnostic capacity and enhanced surveillance;
the upgrading of laboratory diagnostic capacity; the extensive and diversified training of
veterinary staff; the introduction of a new legal and regulatory framework allowing more efficient
disease prevention/control and contingency planning; and the provision, of IT and other
permanent and disposable equipment and materials necessary for field veterinary work (which
has significantly increased MAFCP capacity and expertise to effectively combat animal diseases).
These have all contributed to minimizing the threat of HPAI and other zoonoses, and the
prevention and/or control of zoonoses such as brucellosis and anthrax.

63.     Strengthened laboratory diagnostic capacity of zoonoses diseases, through for example,
the rehabilitation of the virology laboratory at IPH, upgrading with new equipment (RT-PCR
amongst others) and staff capacity. This upgraded lab started its work in November 2009, in the
peak of the HINI pandemic human influenza. According to data collected, more accurate
diagnostic testing was confirmed in 100 percent for all samples that were sent to an international
reference .lab in Cantacuzino (Romania), confirming high standard of laboratory capacities and


                                                       12
laboratory staff capabilities of the IPH. The routine implementation of RT-PCR for HPAI and
other diseases have allowed molecular diagnosis in real time reducing diagnostic time, while the
diversified training of veterinary staff improved the quality and reliabjlity of the testing results.
These activities 'have also contributed to enhanced bio-safety of the lab personnel by reducing
their exposure to risk and creating possibilities for accreditation of other individual laboratories.

64.     Enhanced surveillance of zoonotic diseases on the ground. The National Veterinary
Epidemiological Unit (NVEU) was established. as an integral part of the state veterinary service.
The monitoring and diagnosing of animal disease have improved substantially and been
consistent with OlE standards. An important outcome was the fulfillment of the legal agreement
to have this unit under the regular budget to ensure continuity and sustainability after the project.

65.     The introduction of a new legal and regulatory framework, which has allowed increased
capacity of the veterinary services in controlling and efficiently eradicating zoonoses at the
source of infection before it becomes endemic. This has resulted in costs savings (as discussed in
Annex 3). The culling at infection points now follows international best practice, and national
resources. have been secured for compensation to farmers for culled birds. In case of outbreak,
the compensation mechanism provides an incentive for livestock owners to report sick and dead
animals to veterinarians. The MoF is able to provide timely compensation within 10 days.

66.     It must be noted that the failure to build the new AHlab did not affect the achievement of
the overall POO, as the specific objectives of the AH Component did not refer to; or depend on,
the actual building of the new lab facility. Instead, the PDOs focused on strengthening lab
diagnostic and surveillance capacity.

Stage 2 PDO (after restructuring): Prepare Cor, control, and respond to influenza
epidemics and other inCectious disease emergencies in humans

67.     Activities under the human health component aimed to, "strengthen capacity to isolate
and treat patients with severe communicable diseases".

68.      Outputs and outcome achievements before and after restructuring are listed in Annex 2.
These include preparing a new NIPP that includes Level 6 endorsed by WHO, vaccinating
vulnerable groups as per WHO definition against seasonal influenza-- providing vaccines (14,200
anti-viral drugs procured by 2009)· and staff inoculation (100 percent of the 201 IPH personnel
and all ICU staff); and rapidly procuring stockpiling of antiviral drugs for pandemics.

69.      Surveillance and Detection. As stated above in paragraph 63, the rehabilitated IPH lab
has helped to respond to suspected or actual HPAI in humans as tested during simulations and
real situations. The regions are regularly sending specimens to IPH for testing. The IPH lab has
made excellent progress. More than 3,100 samples have been received by the lab, and about half
of this amount has been tested locally at the IPH lab. The majority of the tests were performed by
using the immunofluorescent technique that has been substituted from last fall by the PCR
method. Since then, the rate of the confirmed cases by the reference lab is 100% (all 5ltests sent
to the reference lab have been confirmed as positives). Lab staff have been trained extensively
with the project funds and by different international agencies, and are capable to perform various
tests (Le. hepatitis, measles, rubella, etc). The virology lab has been certified by the WHO and is
a part of the Global Flu Lab network, while the National Influenza Lab is under the process of
accreditation.




                                                 13
70.     Health System Response. An Intensive Care Unit (lCU) at Tirana Hospital was
constructed. The new ICU was upgraded according to the international standards, and fully
equipped, with negative pressure in 4 isolation rooms. It started work in December 2009, at the
peak of the HI N 1 pandemic human influenza. The ICU is managing a wide range of complicated
cases (i.e. various neuro-infections, tetanus, meningitis, septicemia and hepatitis) as well as
patients with HIV/AIDS that are in need of the intensive care, pulmonary ventilation, etc. All
these cases have been very well documented and experience shared during the trainings organized
by the project for the larger audience, including medical personnel from the regional hospital.
There is recorded enhancement in treatment, management of the patients, and in the bed use rate.

71.     The improvements in the health system and in the health care workers' performance has
generated an additional benefit, which is the percentage reduction of the human population
infected by HPAI, HI A I and other infectious diseases, and consequent reduction of the number
of hospitalizations and the number of deaths attributed to other infectious disease other than
HPAI. Particularly, the establishment of the ICU has contributed in reducing human suffering and
some deaths; out of 400 patients, only 12 deaths have been recorded.

Achievement of final (after restructuring) ~DO

72.     HPAI did not occur in humans, but the threat of this and other diseases has been
diminished by good planning, better and earlier diagnosis capability, and upgraded ICU facilities.
The 2009 influenza AlHINI pandemic experience showed that Albania was better able to
respond to this epidemic, with fewer deaths than expected (as indicated by the General Director
of Health Policies during the ICR mission of February 2011). Overall, the project's interventions
have undoubtedly helped to achieve the key outcomes and the PDO.

3.3 Efficiency

73.     The project cost benefit analysis at the time of appraisal was based on short-term
financial implications of the spread of the virus and the loss of poultry stock during contained
sporadic and/or widespread outbreaks. The analysis appraised an internal rate of return (IRR) of
44 percent. The project investments were justified on the basis of the positive externalities
associated with prevention and containment of a highly infectious disease such as HPAI.

74.     Given that a HPAI outbreak did not occur and that the PDO was revised to encompass
other zoonotic diseases, a re-estimated cost and benefit stream comparison was not deemed
relevant as it is not counterfactual. In addition, the project did not collect comprehensive
quantitative data to enable conventional calculations of economic rates of return and to
reasonably attribute overall changes to the project. Therefore, this ICR carries out a qualitative
analysis of project impacts and benefits (see Annex 3 for details).

75.      The project's major long-term economic benefits stem from strengthened capacity in
early response management for both human health and veterinary systems for epidemic
emergencies. The better preparedness of the Albanian authorities was proven during the last
pandemic influenza that occurred in 2009 when many patients were also treated for other
infectious diseases such as tetanus, septicemia and meningitis. Another major benefit was the
increased intensive care capacity through the establishment of first ICU for infectious diseases




                                               14
and training. Trained key staff have been actively engaged and contributed as trainers tothe other
groups to better manage AI, pandemic influenza and other diseases. 13

76.      The increased capacity of the veterinary service to control and eradicate zoonoses before
they become endemic has resulted in costs savings. Although analysis did not re-calculate the
financial projection of the possible losses due to an AI epidemic, it is reasonable to partly
attribute to the project lower financial losses and lower use of funds for compensation should an
epidemic occur now.

77.      A measure of project efficiency may be the cost effectiveness (only 5 percent of total
costs) of the public awareness component due to the valuable collaboration with USAID and
UNICEF (both in terms of funds and human resources). A final measure of project efficiency
was the proportion of overhead or administrative, of about 10 percent (USD) 0.55 million of total
project costs (USD 4.59 million). (See Annex 3 presents for details.)

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

78.     The project followed a template under GPAI PAD for Bank projects in a number of
countries to address the threat of HPAI. It proved to be relevant for Albania and was aligned
with the CPS. Flexibility was shown in Illstructuring the project when HPAIoutbreaks did not
occur. Thus, objectives and design maintained their relevance throughout the project. As
concluded in Section 3.2, the project successfully achieved its revised PD~.

79.     The project was efficient, although, as described in Section 3.3, counterfactual
comparisons could not be made between the IRR calculated at appraisal and another calculated at
the end. However, consideration of qualitative benefits leads to the conclusion that the project's
investments were justified and that it will have long-term economic benefits. ,

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
80.     Women and children are key actors in backyard poultry sector and, thus, key
beneficiaries of the project. The Public Awareness campaign specifically targeted school
children, amongst others. Backyard poultry are important contributors to rural livelihoods for
poorer people. When sensitizing the public -in awareness campaigns, efforts were taken to ensure
avoidance of panic and market shocks for poultry products, thus safeguarding this important
source of income and nutrition.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

81.      Two European Union-funded projects (Large Ruminants Surveillance and Identification
and Small Ruminants Surveillance and Identification) had established regional epidemiology
units. However, these units operated within the respective project objectives and within Regional
Veterinary Inspectorates. For the first time since Albania's transition to a market economy, this
project created a Veterinary Epidemiology Unit under MAFCP with national coverage.

                                                       IS
82.     . In the human health sectbr, four distance-learning activities were organized by the Bank
and the WHO with world-renowned health experts, linking them to Albanian health specialists:
these technical expertise contacts have potential to be maintained and built upon. Long-term
benefits from the project in terms of knowhow, infrastructure and equipment enhanced capacity
to detect, prevent and control/treat infectious diseases.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

83.       Positive. The strengthened health service and the communication strategies have had a
positive impact on effective management of human AlHINI cases. In addition to preparing
Albania for AlHI Nl, emergency planning has prepared the authorities for other severe
emergencies, including floods. The new ICU and training has helped to create specialist medical
practitioners in the field. The ICU also improved academic curricula for medical students'
training. The supply of influenza vaccines required the authorities to collaborate with
pharmaceutical companies and helped to develop public-private partnerships to bring more
vaccine into the market.

84.      Guidelines for inter-agency communication with cooperation among ministries (MAFCP,
MoH,) helped to build and strengthen the channels of communication, which were crucial for
facing the pandemic. The project also developed close coordination and cost savings, through
good cooperation with other agencies, namely, WHO, UNICEF, FAO and USAID. For example
(i) UNICEF (with USAID support) was closely involved with the Public Awareness and
Information Campaign, (ii) simulation exercises were organized with WHO (with USAID
funding), (iii) guidelines for using the national Public Health Surveillance system were developed
with WHO assistance, (iv) USAID funded PPE, rapid test kits and reagents, (v) FAO regional AI
program coordinated with the Albania project and provided practical assistance, such as rapid test
kits and training. The donor community participated in TF meetings and supervision missions .
                                                           .,
85.     Cooperation developed between this Bank project and a similar Bank project in Kosovo,
which brought cost savings to both projects, strengthened technical cooperation and benefitted
implementation by the Kosovo team, who learned from Albania's example. Specifically, (i)
veterinary epidemiologists from the Albania NVEU and the Kosovo Veterinary Epidemiology
Unit joined together for training held in Albania, (ii) Kosovo staff participated in a simulation
exercise that was held in Albania, (iii) Chief Veterinary Officers of Albania and Kosovo forged
stronger links, (iv) the TFS from Albania shared experiences with the Project Team from Kosovo.
86.     Negative. Cumbersome project procedures for an emergency project increased the
workload of GoA personnel who did not receive additional stipend to carry out the extra tasks,
which some reported to have significantly increased their workload without any remuneration.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(Not Applicable)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

87.    Rating: Moderate. The risk at the time of evaluation that development outcomes will not
be maintained varies across project components. For Component I, Public Awareness and
Information Campaign, the risk is low: the continued functioning of the Communications
Working Group was stated to be "ensured" under the lead of MoH and UNICEF mandates. For
Component 2, Animal Health, the risk is significant as regular Bank Supervision Missions
throughout the project have described management deficiencies, particularly with regard to the


                                               16
NVEU. The sustainability of key project outcomes in this Component is affected by the reported
legaVadministrative vacuums, internal institutional reshuffling and budgetary restrictions. For
Component 3, Human Health, the risk is low: MoH committed funds for the IPH budget for 20 II
to address the sustainability issue for kits, reagents and basic consumables. Furthermore, various
donor agencies show interest in further to support ~roject accomplishments, building on the
momentum of outcomes achieved in the health sector. 4

  88.      Overall and across all components, the institutional risk to development outcome is
 moderaie for reasons highlighted in the preceding paragraph; the economic and financial risk is
 moderate (for governance reasons, it is low in the health sector, but higher in the veterinary
  sector); and the social risk to development outcome is low, as: (i) strong public awareness
  programs have sensitized to key issues and averted the public's potential for panic around
. infectious, zoonotic diseases, particularly influenza; and (ii) reduction of the threat from diseases
  such as HPAI contributes to safeguarding the economic status of poor poultry producers.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

89.      As discussed in Section 2.1, the project was very relevant, and its preparation and design
stages could be considered a good example of efficient and effective collaboration among
relevant stakeholders. The Bank team brought knowledge of global good practice as defined in
the GPAI PAD and applied it according to the specific country scenario, that is, in the context of
recent HPAI outbreaks in a diffuse poultry sector with predominantly smallholder, backyard
management. The project was planned at a time of urgency and uncertainty about HPAI. Despite
this, technical aspects were well planned and appropriate at the time of project formulation.

90.     The role of women and children in poultry management in Albania was clearly identified
at appraisal, and incorporated into the design of behavior change and communication activities.
Environmental aspects were adequately considered at entry, with regard to civil wor~s for
laboratories and hospitals,. handling of hazardous laboratory waste and disposal of culled poultry.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

9i.      Throughout the project, supervision miSSions effectively identified and, with the
exception of the construction of the new veterinary laboratory, resolved any threats to
achievement of the PD~. The Bank fielded six supervision missions between the summer 2007
and winter 2010; they all included health and veterinary specialists, a communication/operations
specialist, and procurement and FM specialists. The same team, except·the health expert, has
been involved in the project supervision and implementation support providing continuity and
guidance throughout the project. Specifically, the Bank: (i) recognized and promptly clarified
early confusion regarding ~ reporting lines in project management and implementation; and (ii)
identified the issue of the planned new veterinary laboratory's requirement for a building permit
at restructuring, and retained the services of a local JegaJ expert to carry out a detailed review, and

generally did all they could to encourage the authorities to resolve the problem. The Bank was
also responsive to the Government's needs and showed flexibility in tenns of restructuring.

 92.      Aide-Memoires were comprehensive and articulated agreed actions for each project
 component. Where implementation issues were identified, ratings were fair and there was
 agreement between Aide Memoires and ISR ratings. One weakness in monitoring, however, was
 that the ISRs following the restructuring do not report on the revised Results Framework listed in
.Annex 1 of the Restructuring Paper. Instead, the ISRs report on the original perfonnance
 indicators and some revised indicators. This inconsistency made it more difficult and time-
 consuming for the ICR team to gather data on a coherent set of perfonnance indicators. IS Bank
 support missions were locally organized, and this 'decentralized task management' brought
 savings. Some mission Aide-Memoires were entered late into the system due mainly to delays of
 the client comments and the long process of clearance from the management. The Bank met all
 safeguard requirements in-a timely and· efficient manner and. provided assistance and training for
 the procurement and financial management throughout the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
93.     The rating reflects'S' rating for Ensuring Quality at Entry and'S' rating for Quality of
Supervision.

S.l Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

94.     The Government was closely engaged in project identification and preparation, and
appointed two fuH-time Component Coordinators responsible for implementation. There was a
sense of urgency at the time of project preparation, in the face of HPAI outbreaks in poultry in the
country, and all parties worked to avoid delays in the process.

95.     A successful feature of GoA's perfonnance was cooperation between Ministries, i.e.
Health and Agriculture: this was a challenge, but was essential for effective public health strategy
through the project's zoonoses control activities. With different Ministries involved as
stakeholders, some friction regarding budget allocation occurred, but these were resolved through
meetings, and project implementation did not suffer. GoA committed to additional funds of
US$0.68 mi])jon (tripling its contribution to the Project) to partiaHy cover the veterinary
laboratory construction, however, it was unable to resolve the impasse over the construction.

96.    Regarding fiduciary perfonnance, GoA carried out FM and several procurement contracts
in compliance with the Bank's guidelines. The Ministry of Finance coordinated the audit of all
Bank-financed projects in Albania, including AI Pr(,>ject. Accurate and timely project records and
accounts and financial statements were prepared and made available for auditing.

'(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

                                                18
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
97.     Overall, the implementing agencies demonstrated strong commitment to achieving the
objectives across all components. Through the KAP surveys, there was adequate beneficiary and
stakeholder involvement in the preparation and delivery of communication messages. The TF
Secretariat played a key role in coordinating stakeholders and project activities across the human
and animal health sectors.

98.     There were delays in the appointment of some key staff, namely, (i) the Procurement
Specialist who was hired only in October 2007 left and needed to be replaced (contributing to a
slow project fund disbursement profile); (ii) an additional staff member was hired to take over the
FM responsibilities of the Water Resource Management Project (WRMP), but was lacking the
required experience or English language skills for this role in a Bank project; and (iii) NVEU
members were hired and salaried, but their employment status and inclusion in the MAFCP
payroll was ambiguous.

99.     There was also poor involvement of and ownership by the Chief Veterinary Officer, and
poor management of the NVEU until late in project implementation. The Animal Health lab
building permit issue remained unresolved, however, construction of the laboratory commenced
in 2010 and had to be suspended, and the building remained partly constructed.

100.    FM arrangements in place at the TFS including staffing, internal controls, project
accounting, financial reporting, flow of funds and auditing arrangements met the Bank
requirements and the recommendations of the Bank missions were fully implemented. Although
M&E functions were performed, reporting was slow and the quality was uneven.

101.    Relationships and coordination with key partners were excellent, including with USAID,
WHO, UN, UNICEF and FAO, all of whom were actively involved with implementation of the
public awareness and communications, and the animal and human health components. The donor
community was part of the TF and participated at the regular and emergency TF meetings. The
TF shared donor reports and the Bank supervision aide memoires, which avoided overlapping,
brought synergy among the donor community, and helped in the best use of resources.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
102.   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The rating reflects'S' rating for Government
Performance and 'MS' rating for Implementing Agencies' Perfor"!ance.

6. Lessons Learned

103.    A global template can enable rapid, good project design. The GPAI PAD was ill
place and was used as the basis for the preparation of this project. The existence of a sound,
global plan ensures that an effective project .can be formulated relatively rapidly at a time of
urgency, due to uncertain circumstances related to an emerging infectious disease.

 104. Projects formulated for a specific disease can prove to have too narrow a PD~ and,
therefore, require restructuring. The project was formulated specifically to address HPAI, but
some of its outputs, such as the enhanced veterinary epidemiology unit and the ICU had from the
outset wider applications to other diseases. In projects primarily concerning a specific disease,
the PDO should be broadened to include other diseases of concem that may emerge or become
problematic during implementation.




                                                19
105.   Close coordination with specialized UN agencies can enhance the quality of
technical assistance. WHO, UNICEF and FAO gave technical assurance for project
implementation by working together with the Bank's implementing partners and agencies. This
is applicable to a wide range of Bank projects, depending on their particular technical areas.

106.    Too many key indicators for an emergency project can make monitoring and
evaluation cumbersome. Data collection and analysis can be a daunting task, particularly when
there are no full-time staff responsible for it. The project's M&E system could have been simpler,

Linking in-country specialists with international experts was successful and should be considered
in other projects.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Part 1. Original Indicators and Indicators after Restructuring and Outputs by
Component
The Restructuring Paper of September 17, 2009 describes changes to the project as follows: (i)
align the PDO to the GPAI PDO, that is, broaden the scope from HPAI to encompass other
zoonoses; (ii) cancel the 'Compensation Fund (CF) and Emergency Eligible Imports (EEl) Fund
and reallocate the funds particularly to Animal and Human Health Component activities; (iii) use
Japan PHRD funds for new activities; (iv) revise project activities. The revised activities were:
      •     Public Awareness and Communication. Address gaps in knowledge in influenza-like
            diseases, zoonoses and influenza AIH IN I ;
      •     Animal Health Component. Finance construction of a new Animal Health (AH)
            Laboratory;                                                                      .
      •     Human Health Component. Revise the NIPP; build on ongoing activities (especially
            raising regional preparedness for diagnosis, referrals and management of
            outbreaks/pandemic);
      • . Disease emergency management. Additional control equipment and PPE.
      •     Training and technical assistance, including
            1. Broader capacity building for animal and human health emergency management,
            2. Triage,
            3. Field epidemiology,
            4. Clinical diagnosis of "several important animal diseases", especially zoonoses,
      •     Animal disease surveillance and information system. Modify to include diseases
            other than AI.

Component I: Public Awareness and Information

Achievements under this component are rated satisfactory.

The indicators specified under this component were:
         i.   '30 % more of at-risk population practicing safe handling procedures with respect
              to poultry and poultry meat', revised (at restructuring) due to typographic error to,
              '55 % more of at-risk population practicing safe handling procedures with respect
              to poultry and poultry meat' .
        ii.   (introduced at restructuring) 'Pandemic communications messages produced and
              delivered to targeted audiences'.

Indicator (i). KAP surveys were carried out (by UNICEF) in 2006 and 2009. They report an
increase in safe handling practices as follows: wash hands after touching poultry, or poultry
products (16.4 %in 2006 increased to 63.8 % in 2009); cooking poultry products well (21.7 % to
59%); (iii) know to avoid contact with dead poultry and wild birds (13.4 % to 50.2%); (iv) wear
gloves when cooking poultry (9.4 % to 16.5 %).

Indicator (ii). The two KAP surveys show the following: 55.3% (12.7% in 2006) have seen and
read leaflets and brochures; 67.8 % (28 %; in 2006) responded that the leaflets and the ideas
therein were clearly formulated, easily understandable and expressed in an attractive way; 75.9 %
(72.1 % in 2006) responded that have seen many TV spots and advertising. The KAP surveys
show that messages have been produced and delivered. Later in the project, uptake of human flu
vaccine increased due to effective awareness-raising.



                                               23
Achievements/Outputs

The Public Awareness and Infonnation Component had two subcomponents, namely Risk
Communication, and Communication for Behavior Change. Under overall coordination of an
inter-sectoral communication working group, the project cooperated closely with USAID and
UNICEF. In project year 1 many communication materials were produced, for example, 120,000
printed leaflets; posters, field worker communication guides and television messages.

The project carried out training for teachers and school directors as planned and this has been
very well received. About 216 people have been trained among biology and biochemistry
teachers, school directors and deputy directors, and education inspectors on AlH5N I and AIH I N I
symptoms, prevention, and transmission. Training sessions were held in Tirana (2 sessions),
Durres, Fier, Vlora, Lezha, and Shkodra (l session in each city), and a joint session for Korca and
Pogradec. The training was conducted by staff of IPH, IFSV and HH component coordinator, in
cooperation with the Ministry of Education and the Institute of Curricula. The implementation of
this training addressed one of the findings of the 2009 Knowledge and Attitude Practices (KAP)
survey, indicating the need to increase communication skills and health promotion activities of
teachers. Further public awareness activities agreed with the MOH, IPH and the CWG regarding
providing information to the population thru TV spots, as assessed by the 2009 KAP survey as
the best mean of communication, are continuing. Broadcasting in 3 national TV stations of 2 TV
spots on personal hygiene and care for persons affected by influenza is currently ongoing. These
spots will also be used as vehicles to publicize the need for vaccination against seasonal flu.

Overall, all the activities planned to be carried out during the life of the project have either been
or are about to be completed, and there has been progress as measured also by the 2009 KAP
survey in improving the population awareness on HPAI, knowledge on safe handling procedures,
and on how to prevent the spread of disease (AlH5N I) as well as influenza pandemics.

Component II: Animal Health

Achievements under this component are rated moderately satisfactory, due to various
shortcomings in management under this component, such as the lack of involvement and
ownership by the Central Veterinary Service, and the poor involvement of the Chief Veterinary
Officer, and the failure to complete the AH lab.

The Animal Health Component's three subcomponents are: (a) Enhancing HPAI Prevention and
Preparedness Capacity; (b) Strengthening Disease Control Capacities, and Improving
Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacities, and Applied Research; and (c) Strengthen HPAI Control
Programs and Outbreak Containment Programs. Indicators specified were:

Subcomponent II (a)
      i. 'Satisfactory sub-laws, regulations, protocols and guidelines developed' revised to
         'New Framework Veterinary Law adopted, in line with EU acquis and practices'.
     ii. 'Annual updating of HPAI influenza and preparedness and response plan' revised to
         'New contingency plan for HPAI adopted, in line with EU acquis and practices'.

Subcomponent II (b)
     i.  'National Veterinary Epidemiological Unit established' revised to 'National
         Veterinary Epidemiological Unit established and achieving an increase in the number


                                                24
            of suspect cases of animal diseases reported and investigated by means of clinical
            examinations and/or epidemiological inquiries'.
      ii.   'Institute of Veterinary Research testing capacity and bio-safeo/ level upgraded'
            revised to 'Animal Health Laboratory testing capacity and bio-safety level upgraded
            and achieving an increase in the number of suspected cases of animal diseases
            investigated by means of laboratory tests and techniques' .

Subcomponent II (c)
      i. 'Two emergency response mobile eradication units established and operating' (not
         r.evised).
     ii. '100% of veterinary and extension field staff trained in safety protocols' revised to
         '100% of veterinary field staff trained in diagnosis, investigation and control methods
         for HPAI and other dise~es' .
    iii. 'Compensation Fund (CF) of US$2,000,000 established' revised to 'Compensation
         secured from national resources'.

Indicator II (a) i. By the end of the project, a new draft Veterinary Law (introducing clearer and
more effective provisions for general disease control), based on advice from the AI project
veterinary legislation expert, had been completed and sent to the Government for consuItations.

Indicator II (a) ii. A new EU-compliant contingency plan for HPAI was prepared, approved and
posted on the MAFCP website.

Indicator II (b) i. The NVEU was established and equipped. Its mandate was expanded from
HPAI to include other zoonoses, for example, brucellosis and tuberculosis.

Indicator II (b) ii. The AH laboratory was equipped with, and capable of routinely carrying out,
RT-PCR for HPAI and other relevant diseases.

Indicator II (c) i. There was no need for the mobile eradications units,since the main disposal
method for infected birds remained burial into a pit and apart from the two HPAI outbreaks in
February and March 2006, no outbreaks were reported in the country: the units were not provided.

Indicator II (c) ii. Seventy resource persons from 12 Districts were trained by a multi-sectoral
team of national trainers in safety protocols by July 2007: by July 2008, this had been extended
to 1,000 frontline workers (85% of State Veterinary Inspectors) from 12 Districts, and by end
March 2009, 100% of State Veterinary Inspectors had been trained. 100 % of all regional field
veterinarians (250 persons) were trained on AI and Newcastle disease. Additional training was
provided to them on various diseases based on request from the regions, such as brucellosis, TB,
classical swine fever, anthrax; rabies, and enterotoxaemia: this training was carried out by
December 2010.

Indicator II (c) iii. By the end of the project, the CF was guaranteed from the budget of the
Ministry of Finance.

Achievements/Outputs

Technical assistance was provided to review existing veterinary legislation and propose revisions.
Contingency plans and AI Regulations were updated by July 2008 and Veterinary Law
amendments proposed to MAFCP.



                                               25
NVEU staff were trained with project support. NVEU activities included compilation of historical
(3-year) data on prevalence and incidence of relevant diseases, i.e. brucellosis and TB, collection
and evaluation of regular epidemiological returns from the field, updating the poultry census, and
monitoring of the occurrence of animal disease. A Simulation Exercise was organized (December
7, 2006) that gave epidemiological and other veterinary personnel hands-on experience and built
capacity and preparedness. The project also supported a livestock census, which provided
numerical data on populations at risk of animal diseases.

AH Laboratory staff were trained in implementation of quality assurance system and SOP, to
enhance stability and improve biosafety. RT-PCR equipment was installed by July 2008 and staff
were trained in its use. The new AH Laboratory planned in the restructured project was not
constructed due to insurmountable problems with securing a building permit.

The project also provided IT and other permanent and disposable equipment and materials
necessary for field veterinary work, which significantly increased the Ministry of Agriculture
Food and Consumers Protection capacity and expertise to effectively combat animal diseases and
fulfill the project's PDOs and intermediate outcome indicators. Operational Manuals outlining
best practice for disease control/culling and procedures for timely compensation were developed
by July 20, 2007.

Component III: Human Health
Achievements under this component are rated highly satisfactory.

The Human Health .Component's three subcomponents are: (a) Enhance Coordination and
Program Planning; (b) Strengthen the National Public Health Surveillance System; and (c)
Strengthen Health Care Response Capacity. Specified indica~ors are:

Subcomponent III (a)
      i.  'New National Pandemic Preparedness Plan developed and endorsed by WHO' [New
         indicator, post-restructuring].
Subcomponent III (b)
      i.  'Number of days between collection of samples and results from the UK reference
         laboratory' revised to 'Samples shipped in conformity to lATA procedures'.
Subcomponent III (c)
      i. ' 100 % of IPH and 30 % of hospital and PHC service personnel vaccinated against
         seasonal influenza' revised to 'Vulnerable groups as per WHO definition vaccinated
         against seasonal influenza'.
     ii. '3,000 units of anti-viral drugs stockpiled' revised to 'Anti-viral drugs stockpiled'.
    iii. 'System to rapidly procure antivirals' revised to 'System to rapidly procure antivirals
         for pandemic'.
    iv.  '15 isolation rooms established' revised to 'Establish an intensive care unit'.
     v.  'Triage procedure established in regional hospitals' [New indicator, post-
         restructuring] .

Indicator III (a) i. Under technical support of WHO, a NIPP was prepared, that includes Level 6,
based on WHO recommendations.

Indicator III (b) i. 505 samples were shipped in accordance with lATA procedures. Laboratory
at IPH: As per last influenza season, in total more than 3,100 samples have been received by the
lab, and about half of this amount has been tested locally at the IPH lab premises. The majority of
the tests were performed by using the immunofluorescent technique that has been substituted


                                               26
from last fall by the PCR method. Since then, the rate of the confirmed cases by the reference lab
is 100% (all 51 tests sent to the reference lab have been confirmed as positives).

Indicator m (c) i. IPH personnel were vaccinated. (see below).

IndicatGr m (c) ii. A stock of antiviral drugs was made (see below).

Indicator m (c) iii. A procurement system for antiviral drugs was established.

Indicator In (c) iv. A very modem ICU was inaugurated and has been fully functional since
December 2009 (see below).

Indicator m (c) v. Triage has been strengthened in regional hospitals (see below).

Achievements/Outputs

  In additional to preparing the NIPP, regional training (supported by WHO) was carried out for
  Hospital Pandemic Preparedness, based on the Preparedness Checklist for pandemic influenza,
  and clinical management of AlHlNl. Four distance learning events concerning pandemic
. preparedness and latest WHO guidelines were organized in autumn 2009 by the project with
  WHO.

From November 15, 2007 lATA procedures (e.g. triple-packaging) were in place for packaging
potentially dangerous specimens. Two human health personnel were trained and lATA-certified.
505 samples were shipped in conformity to lATA procedures and sent to Cantacuzino laboratory,
Romania. Results were turned around within five days (including time for informing the
transport operator, delivery to reference laboratory, sample analysis and informing the test report).

2,000 doses of vaccine were administered to medical personnel by July 2007. There were 3,000
antiviral does procured by the AI project until June 2008 (as it was required to have a stockpile of
3,000 doses). 100 % ofIPH personnel (201 persons) were vaccinated against seasonal influenza.
An additional 11,200 doses were procured in 2009. Therefore, the total number of antiviral drugs
procured by the AI Project was 14,200. Around 7,000 doses ofTa~iflu (expiry date 2017) are
available for the next expected wave of influenza.

The ICU was completed at Tirana University Hospital Center and equipment was procured and
installed. The ICU and the upgraded IPH laboratory were fully functional by 2010. Outputs to
develop triage procedures in regional hospitals includes the local assessment of triage procedures
of regional hospitals was undertaken. Training was also carried out. This covered, first, hospital
procedures for infectious diseases and, second, zoonoses and antibacterial resistance.

Specific training was given to 320 health personnel in 2010 on subjects including hospital
infection control, bacterial resistance and zoonotic disease management.

Component IV: Support to Avian Influenza Task Force for Project Implementation

Achievements under this component are rated moderately satisfactory.

The two subcomponents of this component are: (a) Strengthen the TF by establishing a
Permanent Secretariat and (b) Monitoring and Evaluation.



                                                27
Achievements/outputs
No outcome indicators are specified for this component in the project Technical Annex
(Appendix 2. Results Framework and Monitoring). However. subcomponent (a) concerned
establishing the TF with full-time staff to manage the project.       The government's AI TF
established a permanent Secretariat in MAFCP. led by two Project Coordinators. responsible for
coordinating activities. work plans and project reports. Most of the TFS staff has been
mainstreamed to the ministerial bodies as follows: i) the AH Coordinator. promoted as the Chief
Veterinary .Officer; ii) the HH Coordinator has been promoted to the MoH position of Public
Health Specialist, Sector for HygienelEpidemiology. Directory of Public Health. as of November
1st 2010; iii) the FM expert of the project has been selected as the first candidate and will
continue to work at the new WRIP as FM expert. This is a very good outcome of the project
showing that good cooperation of the TFS with both ministries and the respect of the latter toward
TFS staff. which have been rewarded with their promotions.

 Subcomponent (b). Monitoring and Evaluation, concerned M&E activities at all levels. Overall,
 project reporting improved since a part time M&E specialist has been hired.

Part 2. Tabulated Indicators and Targets/Objectives for Components 1 to 3
Component I: Public Awareness and Communication (US$460,600): to develop and
implement a communications plan to inform the public. particularly those more likely to be
exposed to HPAI, about the threat ofHPAI and how they can minimi~ the risk of transmission
and spread of dise~se. Its two subcomponents are: (i) Risk Communication; and (ii)
Communication fot Behavior Change.

Annex 3. Economic and Fin~ncial Analysis

INTRODUCTION

The Project Development Objective is to mInImIze the threat posed to humans by Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonoses and to prepare for, control, and
respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.

The project focused on communication & awareness programs concerning both human health and
poultry management, on training/capacity building of key staff in the health and veterinary
systems, laboratory renovation and rehabilitation and triage and intra-hospital operational and
safety procedures.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

The project cost benefit analysis at the time of appraisal was based on short-term financial
implications of the spread of the virus and the loss of poultry stock during contained sporadic
and/or widespread outbreaks. The analysis appraised an internal rate of return (IRR) of 44 percent.
The project investments benefits stream was based on the positive externalities associated with
prevention and containment of a highly infectious disease such as HPAI. 16

Given that a HPAI outbreak did not occur during the life of the project and that the development
objective was revised to encompass other zoonotic diseases, a re-estimated project cost and
benefit stream comparison was not deemed relevant as it is not counterfactual 17 • In addition, the
project did not collect comprehensive quantitative data to enable conventional calculations of
economic rates of return and to reasonably attribute overall changes to the project. Still, the
Project's efficiency can be evaluated on the basis of early indications of improved efficiency of
the early response management of health and veterinary systems, efficiency in implementing the
hospital procedures for emergency, and efficiency gains in the stocking and distribution of
vaccines. Therefore, a qualitative analysis of project impacts and benefits has been carried out for
this IeR.

PROJECT BENEFITS

The project's major long-term economic benefits stem from strengthened capacity in early
response management for both human health and veterinary systems for epidemic emergencies.
The better preparedness of the Albanian authorities in detection, prevention and treatment, was
proven during the last pandemic influenza that occurred in 2009 when many patients were treated
also for other infectious diseases such as tetanus, meningitis, septicemia and hepatitis. The
creation of a stockpile of antiviral drugs also served for the treatment of the. patients at the



16 See section D of the PAD, May 2006. The total number of poultry (including turkeys) in Albania is over
6 million, of which approximately 85 percent is owned by small holders. Small poultry farming is scattered
across the country. and the average price of a mature bird (weighing approximately 2.5kg) was US$7 in the
market in early 2006. Prices have been stable in recent years. There were two types of event associated
with the spread of HPAI in the poultry sector: (1) sporadic contained outbreaks (similar to what is already
going on in Albania) where a limited number of birds must be culled; and (2) widespread outbreaks, where
a significant percentage of the poultry stock is decimated at one time.
17 Counterfactual thinking is a conditional (or "if-then") statement indicating what would be the case if its
antecedent were true.


                                                    34
beginning of the pandemic influenza in summer 2009. Another major benefit was the increased
intensive care capacity through the establishment of first leu for infectious diseases and training.
Trained key staff have been actively engaged and contributed as trainers for a better management
of AI, pandemic influenza and other diseases situation 18 •

The increased capacity of the veterinary service in control, end eradicate zoonoses at the source
of infection before it becomes endemic has resulted in enormous costs savings. Although the
analysis did not re-calculate the financial projection of the possible losses due to an AI epidemic,
it is reasonable to partly attribute to the project the lower financial losses and lesser funds for
compensation should an epidemic occur now .

. The project invested heavily in national and regional capacity building. Strengthening local
  planning and emergency response delivery capacities would include developing the synergies
  between different interventions and donors activities.

The Project contributed to good cooperation among relevant stakeholders and to "One Health"
agenda (veterinary public health) in which Government took real ownership of the prevention
campaign. Another major benefit was ensuring sustainability beyond the project lifespan through
the. mainstreaming of project staff to tlte ministerial bodies (MoA and MoH), revealing good
cooperation between the Task Force Secretariat and both ministries. as well as incorporating
maintenance and running costs of laboratories and other infrastructures procured under the project
into the national budget allocation.

Component 1: Public Awareness and Information

This component contributed to raise awareness and improve knowledge in the prevention of the
spread of Avian Influenza and other zoonoses and infectious diseases in animals and humans
among key veterinary and public health personnel. popUlation and commercial farms. The TFS
and the MoH response to pandemic have been well focused and timely.

Health-related public awareness and communication activities in Albania targeted school teachers
to maximize effectiveness, not only when children are identified as key beneficiaries, but also
because children can influence their families and others. This was extremely successful in raising
awareness among the Albanian population. Similarly, training programs to health care workers
and teachers have assisted in reinforcing the preventive work.

During 2006 outbreaks in the region, farmers slaughtered healthy oirds due to panic and
misinformation. An interesting feature of the project campaign, which was instrumental as
economic damage control for both backyard and commercial poultry, was the tailored training for
the media (supported by UNICEF) on how to deliver information on avian influenza, to avoid
unnecessary financial losses in the country economy.

An inter-sectoral communication-working group (CWG) was established and periodically met to
revive the public awareness process. Its sustainabiIity is ensured under the lead of UNICEF, MoH .
mandates and close cooperation with the veterinary service. 19 The better coordination and
complementarity in responding to threats between the various agencies20 (in terms of both funds

and human resources) resulted in cost savings from the project. The cost effectiveness of this
component allowed unspent funding for additional training of key staff, reiteration of the
campaigns and fund the second KAP survey. The actual costs of this component were US$0.25
million, 50 percent of the amount allocated at design.

Component 2: Animal Health

At MTR, the supervision mission conducted a preliminary risk assessment on the relative risk of
incursion of HPAI, which showed that the risk had diminished since the Project started due to: (i)
favorable containment of the epidemic in the wider region, and (ii) better preparedness ·of the
Albanian authorities to deal with an epidemic.21 Then, the project was restructured and the scope
of the project was broadened from only HPAI to include other zoonotic diseases of concern such
as brucellosis, rabies, tuberculosis among others.

Quantification of benefits of the overall project was considered impractical and not
counterfactual; however, simple re-calculation of the appraisal analysis related only to the poultry
sector, has been carried out. The analysis has been updated with actual project costs and market
prices leaving the assumptions of events of incidence and spread of HP AI unchanged. 22 Two
types of outbreaks were assumed: (i) sporadic contained outbreaks -limited number of birds
culled; and (ii) widespread outbreaks, significant percentage of the poultry stock culled. The
analysis yields a NPV ofUS$1,745,671 confirming the investment as financially sound; and also
suggesting that should an outbreak occur would probably cause lower financially losses than it
would have in the without- project situation because of readiness of authorities in the containment
of the epidemic.

 It is reasonable to assume that the project contributed partially to reduce the probability of both
contained and widespread outbreaks by (i) enhancing surveillance of zoonotic diseases on the
ground; (ii) strengthening laboratory diagnostic capacity of zoonoses diseases; and (iii) ensuring
timely and efficient prevention and eradication of prevalent zoonoses before it becomes endemic,
including resources and procedures for compensation.

Strengthening laboratory diagnosti~ ~apa~ity of zoonoses diseases. The virology laboratory at
the Institute of Food Safety and Veterinary was rehabilitated, upgraded with new equipment (RT-
PCR amongst others) and staff capacity. The routine implementation of RT-PCR for HPAI and
other diseases allowed molecular diagnosis in real time reducing diagnostic time while the
diversified training of veterinary staff improved the quality and reliability of the testing results.
According to the data collected, more accurate diagnostic testing was confirmed 100 percent for
all samples sent to an international reference laboratory. This subcomponent has also contributed
to improve the bio-safety of the laboratory personnel reducing their exposure to risk and creating
possibilities for accreditation of other individual laboratories.          .

Enhan~ement of surveillan~e of zoonoti~ diseases on the ground. The National Veterillary
Epidemiological Unit (NVEU) was established as an integral part of the state veterinary service.
The monitoring and diagnosing animal disease have impro.ved substantially and been consistent
with OlE standards. An important outcome was the fulfillment of the legal agreement to have
this unit under the regular budget to ensure continuity and sustainability after the project life.

  Ensuring timely and efficient prevention and eradication of prevalent zoonoses. The
  introduction of a new legal and regulatory framework allowed increased capacity of the
  veterinWy·services .in controlling and efficiently eradicating zoonoses at the source of infection
. before it becomes endemic; which has resulted in enormous costs savings. The culling at .
  infection points now follows international best practice and national resources have been secured
  for compensation to farmers for culled birds. In case of outbreak, the compensation mechanism
  provides an incentive for livestock owners to report sick and dead animals to veterinarians. The
  MoF is able to provide timely compensation within 'I 0 days.

The actual costs of this component were US$I.25 million, 39 percent of the amount allocated at
design. This variance is related to the activity of laboratory construction and related laboratory
furniture, which could not be procured due to lack of the building permit by the authorities.

Component 3: Human health

As there have been many projects on health in the country, authorities, and key health ministerial
staffs have been highly proactive enabling the project achieve all planned outputs. Equally, the
project was very flexible in adapting to changing needs and the holistic approach of provision of
infrastructure, equipment and training proved very successful23 •

The component activities have had a great impact on the improvement of early response to
influenza pandemic through the development of the National Integrated Preparedness Plan for
control and response to outbreak and pandemic. 24 The major benefit of this component is the
enhanced core capabilities and functions of the health system. The project contributed to face the
pandemic in terms of:

         •   Preparation of public health structure procedures and revision of all protocol which
             allowed early diagnosis;
         •   Tamiflu provision;
         •   Provision of new laboratory and new technology as traditional· methodology was
             reliable but not fit for facing emergency;
         •   Supported life-threatening diseases though the provision ofRT-PCR;
         •   Centralization of emergency procurement system for antivirals;
         •   Supported diagnostic and epidemiology unit. The project investment including
             complete restructuring of the facility, intensive training including abroad of medical
             staff25 and upgraded the bio-safety to level 3 contributed to enhanced laboratory
             staff capabilities of the IPH enabling to face efficiently twice the peak of HINt
             pandemic human influenza in 2009. Time savings reduced from 3 weeks to just 2-3
             hours as avoided shipping samples to a reference laboratory (Cantacuzino-Romania);
        •    Provision of vaccines (150 000 sold in 20 II) and staff inoculation (100 percent for
             ICU staff); and
        •    Supported reconstruction of the Intensive Care Unit (lCU) in Infective Hospital at the
             Tirana University Hospital Center. The newly leu was upgraded according to the
             international standards, with negative pressure in 4 isolation rooms, fully equipped.

             Severe cases have been treated in the ICU, also for other infectious diseases such as
             tetanus, meningitis, septicemia, and hepatitis. It was recorded improvement in
             treatment, management of the patients as well of improved bed use rate.

The improvements in the health system and in the health care workers' performance generated
another major benefit which is the percentage reduction of the human population infected by
HPAI, HI Al and other infectious diseases, and consequent reduction of the number of
hospitalizations and the number of deaths attributed to other infectious disease other than HPAI.
Particularly, the establishment of ICU contributed in reducing human suffering and some deaths;
out of 400 patients, only 12 deaths have been recorded?6

Generally, in health projects, the proj~ct benefits stream is calculated in terms of(i) resource cost
savings which is a· reduction in out-of-pocket expenses for health care as a result of reforms in
health financing; and/or (ii) productivity gains are the result of less time lost to illness.
Productivity gains are also realized when less time is spent for the care of sick family members.

 The economic value of averting hospitalization costs, income loss from days lost to illness, and
income loss from fatal cases are the main costs to assess. The assumption for the hospitalization
costs are calculated taking into account daily cost per bed for an average stay, which in case of
influenza is about 7 days while for special cases is longer, for example for tetanus can be some
weeks. For the income loss, it is assumed a number of income days per an average percentage of
population. While, for fatal cases, it is considered average remaining lifetime earning actualized
for a year period and at a discount rate, generally between 10 and 12 percent.

The affected human population (Gross Attack Rate) for an outbreak of HPAI was estimated at 3
percent of the popUlation by the Government while WHO estimated 10 percent, with 10 percent
of the affected popUlation being hospitalized and a 3 percent death rate for those affected. 27

Unfortunately, due to lack of data on dail~ cost per bed and average daily wage (latest statistics is
around 900 Lek per day back to 2007) 8 , the mission could not make guess estimate of the
economic cost savings for the Albanian economy. As health projects are often not revenue-
generating, an analysis of public expenditures becomes critical for determining the sustainability
of the project.

There is an on-going Bank-financed project on modernizing the health system, synergetic to the
Alone that included an expenditure review for the health sector. However, this information was
not analyzed and available at the time of the mission (February 2011). It would be worthwhile for
the Government to pursue a more in-depth expenditure review of the sector,. to ensure that the
right investm'ent decisions are made from an economic point of view.

  NPV @ 10 percent discount rate                                  $1,745,671


 In the original analysis, the market price of birds was US$7 and the project costs were Y 1
 US$I,500,000; Y2 US$I,OOO,OOO; and Y3 US$500,000. Two types of outbreaks were assumed
 and retained in this analysis: (i) sporadic contained outbreaks -limited number of birds culled; and
 (ii) widespread outbreaks, significant percentage of the poultry stock culled. Another important
 assumption was the percentage loss of stock during the two events, which were 5 and 25 percent
 respectively.

  The analysis yields a NPV of US$I,745,671 confirming the investment as financially sound; and
  also suggesting that should an outbreak occur would probably cause lower financially losses than
  it would have in the without- project situation because of readiness of authorities in the
. containment ofthe epidemic for diseases other than AI.

This analysis is only partial and indicative of the overall project benefits. However, economic
damage control of the poultry sector and reducing human exposure to the disease can be said to
justify such project.

Executive Summary

This is the Borrowers Report for the completion of Avian Influenza Control and Human
Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project from October 2006 to December 2010.

Albania has started to implement the Avian Influenza (AI) project. after the confirmation of two
outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (Hi>AI) in March 2006. Government of Albania
with support of the international donor, was focused on mounting a rapid response to improve
surveillance, detection and containment measures.
The Avian Influenza Task Force was established by the Order of Council of Ministers No. 168,
date October 28th, 2005, as an inter-ministerial and inter-sectoral decision-making body.     .

The AI project .has had good progress and significant impact. The project was focused to improve
surveillance, detection and containment measures, in line with international standards.

Positive impacts and outputs were observed in the following areas:

        •   With project support the country has improved the capacities to prevent, identify,
            contain and eradicate HPAI outbreaks. Albania also has proved that it can manage, in
            a pandemic situation, based in its own resources and capacities. This was proved in
            the last pandemic situation occurred in Albania (2009).

       •    The Virology Laboratory at the Institute of Public Health (WH), has undergone
            complete reconstruction to upgrade it at the BSL2 level and one laboratory upgraded
            to BSL3 level. Upgrading of the laboratory facility was accompanied with the supply
            of laboratory equipment and furniture aswell·as training of laboratory personnel to
            comply with the upgraded level of laboratories. The upgraded virology laboratory at
            WH started its work in November 2009, in the peak of the HINI pandemic human
            influenza. All positive samples that were isolated in this laboratory were confirmed
            by the reference laboratory in Cantacuzino (Romania), confirming high standard of
            laboratory capacities and .laboratory staff capabilities of the WHo The total investment
            at the WH virology laboratory from the AI project is approximately 850,000 USD.

       •    The AI project also supported reconstruction of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in
            Infective Hospital at the Tirana University Hospital Center. The newly ICU was.
            upgraded according to the international standards, with negative pressure in 4
            isolation rooms, fully equipped. The· upgraded ICU started its work in December
            2009, in the peak of the HINI panqemic human influenza. Many patients were
            treated on the course of the pandemic influenza, but also from other infectious
            diseases. The total investment at ICU from the AI project is approximately 600,000
            USD.

       •    Antiviral stockpile was created and served for the treatment of the patients at the
            beginning of the pandemic influenza in summer 2009. Following the spread of the

    pandemic and increase in human cases, another stock of antivirals was purchased
    using the AI project funds through direct contract.

•   The National Veterinary Epidemiological Unit was established for the 1st time as an
    integral part of the state veterinary service. NVEU members received basic
    epidemiological trainings, conducted by the international veterinary epidemiological
    consultant. The AH. Project Coordinator, since mid April 2010, was promoted as
    Chief Veterinary Officer, in the MoAFCP. Positive achievements and improvements
    were made in monitoring and diagnosing animal disease consistent with OlE
    standards.

•   Both virology laboratories at the Institute of Public Health and at the Institute of
    Food Safety and Veterinary, received for the 1st time the RT-PCR equipment,
    allowing molecular diagnosis in real time. The RT-PCR technique has 'been
    extensively and successfully used for diagnosis of patients during the pandemic
    influenza in winter of 2009 - 2010 and still being used for diagnosis during the
    season of influenza (winter 2010 - 2011 ).

•   Public awareness campaign covered both Avian influenza and the pandemic human'
    influenza, through TV and radio spots, leaflets, posters, trainings with schools
    teachers and students, aiming to increase information and awareness of public on the
    disease, and how to prevent the spread of the disease.

•   Trainings focused on Avian Influenza and other zoonoses and infectious diseases in
    animals and humans have contributed in keeping the key staff updated on the
    developments and progress in poultry situation in Albania, region and world. The
    trained staff have been actively engaged and has contributed as trainers to the other
    groups to better management AI, pandemic influenza and other diseases situation.

 Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

  (Comments from USAID) -- The AI Response in general in Albania can be considered a good
. example of efficient and effective collaboration among relevant stakeholders in situations of
  Public Health Threats such as the AI. Donor's community, led by USAID, and the UN Family
  under the one-UN Approach lead by UNDP, initially encouraged GoA to get organized and plan
  how to properly respond to the emergency. USAID made possible the initial funding for a rapid
  planning and response, during the emergency phase. The merit of the WB initial assessment team
  was in being able to build upon the existing mechanisms and plans to further elaborate a longer
  term response, without losing too much time.

 All the activities and planned interventions of the WB project, followed a thorough consultative
 discussion and consensus building process during the project design phase, sharing this way a
 common strategic approach among all players, GOA, Donors etc. This helped synergize efforts
 and optimize the available resources.

 WB was an important partner not just as a financing body, but also in its technical assistance
 efforts participating actively in the National Task Force, in inter-sectoral technical
 communication working groups, organized by GOA and lor Donors.

 In general, USAID evaluates high the level of cooperation with the WB during this particular
 phase and considers the WB project very successful, in the most of its components.
