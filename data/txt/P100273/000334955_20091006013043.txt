A.       Introductory Statement

 1.   This Project Paper (PP) seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to introduce
the following changes in the Albania Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic
Preparedness and Response Project, Credit 4206 ALB ("Project"), and any accompanying
amendments to the Project's legal documents. The Japan Policy and Human Resource
Development (PHRD) Co-financing Grant No. TF056728 will also be amended in line
with the changes described herein.

2.    The proposed changes include: (i)     aligning the Project's Development Objective
(PDO) to the Global Pandemic Avian Influenza (GPAI) PDO' to expand the scope o f
planned interventions to include other zoonotic diseases as a new target outcome, and yet
preserve the integrity o f the original Project design related to Avian Influenza (AI); (ii)
supporting the development o f a National Pandemic Plan for addressing current and
future pandemics; (iii) constructing a new Animal Health Laboratory versus the original
planned reconstruction; (iv) reallocating unused financing from the Compensation Fund
and Eligible Emergency Imports in light o f new Government arrangements for
emergency financing, including for pandemics; and (v) strengthening the Project results
framework to address the above. This proposed restructuring i s a timely response to both
the recently declared HlNl pandemic and further extending the Project's impact on
general preparedness for zoonosis outbreaks given developments in public emergency
financing arrangements.

3.    The Project was approved on July 11, 2006. Original financing o f the Project was
US$6.1 million equivalent, comprising US$5 million equivalent (SDR3.5 million) from
IDA, US$0.8 million from the Japan PHRD Grant, and US$0.3 million from Albania.
Currently, the Project i s rated Satisfactory on implementation progress and achievement
o f development objectives. So far, US$2.2 million (41 percent) has been disbursed from
the IDA credit and US$0.37 million (46percent) from the Japanese PHRD Grant. N o
additional Bank financing i s being requested for this restructuring; the Government has
increased i t s contribution to approximately U S $ l million.

4.    This paper i s based on a formal request from the Ministry o f Agriculture Food and
Consumers Protection (MAFCP) and the Ministry o f Finance (MoF), to broaden the
scope o f the Project to cover other animal and public health issues. While vigilance for
A I remains a priority with the country successfully eradicating two A I outbreaks before
Project negotiations and compensating farmers for poultry culling within few days, the
government i s simultaneously combating other prevalent zoonotic diseases as well.
Many o f the Project activities that are intended to control A I are also effective approaches
for the prevention and control o f other animal diseases o f public health concern.

B.      Background and Reasons for Restructuring


' The GPAI PDO, which were endorsed by the Executive Directors on January 12,2006 (Report No.
34386), i s "to minimize the global threat posed to humans by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)
infection and other zoonoses and to prepare for, control, and respond to an influenza pandemics and other
infectious disease emergencies in humans."


                                                    3
5. Background. The Project was approved on July 11, 2006, became effective on
October 16, 2006, and the closing date has been extended once from June 30, 2009 to
December 31, 2010. The original PDO i s to strengthen the country's capacity to prevent
the spread o f AI among poultry, to prevent the transmission o f AI from birds to other
animals and humans, and to prepare for a potential pandemic o f AI transmissible between
humans.

6.   The Project design aimed to support three areas: (i)prevention; (ii) preparedness


     .
and planning; and (iii)
                      response and containment. The Project includes four components:

         Component I Public Awareness and Information (US$ 460,600): to develop and
                           :
         implement a communications plan to inform the public, particularly those more
         likely to be exposed to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), about the
         threat o f H P A I and how they can minimize the risk o f transmission and spread o f
         disease.     I t s two subcomponents are: (i)Risk Communication, and (ii)


     .
         Communication for Behavior Change.

                     1
         Component 1 : Animal Health (US$ 3,698,200): to support a national program to
         develop and implement short and long term H P A I prevention, containment, and
         control and eradication activities in animals, I t s three subcomponents are: (i)
         Enhancing H P A I Prevention and Preparedness Capacity; (ii)       Strengthening
         Disease Control Capacities, and Improving Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacities,
         and Applied Research; and (iii) Strengthen H P A I Control Programs and Outbreak


     .
         Containment Programs.

         Component 111: Human Health (US$ 1,600,000): to support a national program to
         develop and implement short- and medium-term prevention o f an outbreak o f
         H P A I among humans and reduce the impact o f pandemic virus. Its
         subcomponents are: (i) Enhance Coordination and Program Planning; (ii)
         Strengthen the National Public Health Surveillance System; and (iii)
                                                                            Strengthen


     .
         Health Care Response Capacity.

         Component IV: Support to Avian Influenza Task Force (US$341,200): to support
         the A I Task Force in implementation o f the Government's AI response strategy.
         I t s two subcomponents are: (i)
                                        Strengthening the TF by Establishing a Permanent
         Secretariat; and (ii)
                             Monitoring and Evaluation.

7.    Currently, the Project i s rated Satisfactory on implementation progress and
achievement o f development objectives. As a result, it has been recently acknowledged
by key stakeholders and partners that Albania i s n o w better prepared for an outbreak o f
A I and other diseases than it had been prior to the Project. The following achievements
are notable:

                       : development o f a communication strategy; (ii)
         Component I (i)                                                    public awareness
         activities such as printing and distribution o f posters and brochures, airing o f A I
         documentary, TV spots, and radio message on AI, personal hygiene and seasonal
         flu prevention; (iii) on farm training including commercial poultry; (iv)


                                               4
        preparation o f training materials for schools and for media; and (v) regular
        preparation and distribution o f the AI Newsletter and update o f the MAFCP web
        page.

       Component 1 : (i)recruitment o f staff and establishment o f a National
                       1
       Epidemiological Unit for the first time in the country's history o f the veterinary
       service; (ii) comprehensive, diversified and multi-purpose training o f field and
       laboratory staff; (iii)  supply o f permanent equipment and various consumable
       materials for the field services and the Institute o f Food Safety and Veterinary
       (IFSV) laboratory for the purpose o f effectively combating or diagnosing diseases
       respectively; (iv) review, update and consolidation o f the legal framework
       governing disease control in general, and contingency planning in particular; and
       (v) completion o f all preliminary steps for the construction o f the new Animal
       Health Laboratory (AH Lab), including inter alia a strategy and business plan,
       preliminary and final designs, update EA and EMP, Social Assessment and
       clarification o f the ownership status o f the proposed building site.

       Component 111: (i) appropriate stock o f antiviral and protective equipments in the
       center and the regions, and yearly vaccination o f vulnerable and at risk groups
       against seasonal influenza; (ii) reconstruction and equipping o f the Institute o f
       Public Health (IPH) laboratory; (iii) hospital centers are better equipped, their
                                            the
       staff trained against influenza and influenza-like diseases; (iv) the cooperation
       between animal and human health service increased steadily; (v) establishment o f
       a modern, and well equipped Intensive Care Unit for contagious patients in Tirana
       University and Hospital; and (vi) preparation o f training material for standard
       operating procedures.

8.    Reasons for Restructuring. The Project i s being restructured to (i)    address the new
threat associated with the A/HlNl pandemic; (ii)       expand the scope o f the Project's
impact on general preparedness to include other zoonoses; (iii)             reallocate unused
financing in light o f new Government financing arrangements for public emergency
response; and (iv) adjust intended outcomes o f the Project in light o f the revised PDO.

9.     The Government continues to recognize the importance o f addressing AI and other
zoonoses. However, the recent new threat, with W H O declaring a level 6 pandemic for
A/H 1 N1, reinforces the importance o f preparedness and strengthening government
capacity to deal with a broader ranges o f zoonoses as well as pandemics. In addition,
H P A I has diminished in prevalence over the last three years, while other zoonotic
diseases, notably brucellosis and to a lesser extent tuberculosis, are threatening to become
endemic in Albania, thus posing a risk to animal and human health alike. In view o f this,
the Government saw the need to expand the PDO to deal with these other zoonoses and
restructure the Project to meet these new threats and to add a few new additional
activities to certain project components. I t was acknowledged that the revised Project's
benefits would be larger since it was going to provide a general level o f capacity building
for the veterinary and human health services which i s now coming to fruition. The
proposed restructuring will further contribute to capacity building and improve the
overall impact o f the Project.


                                             5
 10. The proposed alignment o f the PDO with the G P A I DO will allow the Project to
better address prevailing needs to respond to the pandemic situation, while maintaining
the original focus on Avian Influenza preparedness.

 11. At the same time, Albania continues to experience significant levels o f zoonotic
diseases such as brucellosis in livestock and people, which are comparable to other
countries in the region. Minor adjustments in the capacity building interventions under
the Project including technical assistance related to epidemiology, support for the
national animal disease surveillance system and public awareness would similarly
address this serious problem while continuing to develop capacity to prevent AI.
Expanding o f the scope o f the Project by adding an additional target outcome responds to
the country's need to control and address other zoonotic disease priorities such as
brucellosis, and reflects the suitability o f the Project design to support interventions in
this regard.

 12. One important area that emerged during Project implementation was the need to
construct a new, rather than reconstruct the existing, Animal Health laboratory to ensure
that the capacity to handle adequately activities related to both A I and other zoonotic
disease. As such, in August 2008, the Government requested the reallocation o f the
Project's Compensation Fund (US$2 million) and the EEI (US$0.3 million)2 to finance
the construction o f this new laboratory as well as a few new activities. At that time, the
Government also confirmed the additional contribution o f US$0.68 million (tripling i t s
contribution to the Project) to partially cover the estimated cost o f the AH Lab
construction. It should be noted, that in early 2006, before approval o f this Project, the
Government successfully eradicated the A I twice and paid farmers for the culled chickens
within one week from i t s own budget funds. Since then there has been no outbreak o f the
AI during the Project l i f e and consequently no use o f the Project CF. In addition, the
Government has confirmed that i t s annual budget allocation o f around US$22 million for
emergencies includes response to AI outbreaks, and that the Public Procurement Law has
a specific clause for emergencies that allows the direct purchase o f medications in case o f
emergency. Standing arrangements are in place to effect prompt compensation to
farmers for the culling o f birds in the event o f an H P A I epidemic.

13. There i s also an urgent need to establish a mechanism for management o f a
pandemic situation, and to scale up hospital preparedness and health sector response
capacity, while continuing with priority activities under the communication and animal
health component.     As such, other new activities proposed under this restructuring
include the preparation o f a National Pandemic Plan in accordance with W H O
recommendation and revisions in support for public awareness and communication for
and strengthening hospital procedures to deal with A/H 1N1.


* At the negotiations the Government of Albania requested to have a separated Project category for quick-
disbursement of critical imports in the event of an emergency situation in the amount of SDR 0.2 million
(US$0.3 million, equivalent). This category was added to the Financing Agreement for the following
goods: List of Eligible Imported Goods to be Financed in National Emergencies under the Credit: (1)
Pharmaceuticals and vaccines, (2) Medical and veterinary supplies and equipment, (3) Protective clothing
and gear.


                                                    6
 14. In summary, the reasons for project restructuring include: (i)Declaration o f
pandemic level 6 by W H O and the need to respond to mitigate consequences o f the
pandemic, (ii) need to adjust resources for the construction o f the Animal Health Lab
              the
at the IFSV; (iii)  absence o f H P A I in Albania and improved preparedness o f the
veterinary services leading to a reduced risk assessment for the disease; and (iv) the
Government's increased interest in improving the animal health situation in the country
especially for zoonotic diseases. The restructuring and adjusting o f the Project as
proposed would result in a more sustainable impact while retaining the objectives related
to AI. These reasons for restructuring were analyzed and agreed with key stakeholders at
the Project Mid-Term Review as well as during the February 2009 supervision o f the
Project.

C.       Proposed Changes

15.    Alignment o f the PDO to the GPAI PDO: I t has been agreed with the
Government that the PDO should be revised to more accurately reflect the Project
outcomes and to bring it into alignment with the G P A I PDO. The revised PDO i s as
follows:

      "to minimize the threat posed to humans by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza
     (HPAI) infection and other zoonoses and to prepare for, control, and respond to
     influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans."

16.      Cancellation o f Compensation Fund and Emergency Eligible Imports Financing
and RedirectiodReallocation o f Proceeds. I t was agreed to redirect the Compensation
Fund (US$2 million) and to reallocate the EEI Fund (US$0.3 Million) to finance other
activities under an adjusted scope o f the Project, especially the Animal and Human
Health components activities.

17.     Revised Proiect Activities: In July 2009, the Government's Avian Influenza Task
Force, in agreement with the Bank, took the final decision on the priority activities to be
funded under the reallocated funds to support the revised PDO, as follows:

     a) Public Awareness and Communication: The restructured Project will aim to
        address remaining gaps in influenza-like diseases, zoonoses and A/H 1N1
        pandemic knowledge within the population. The areas in need o f focus will be
        detailed following the second Knowledge Attitude Practice ( U P ) survey,
        currently underway.

     b) Animal Health component; The restructured Project will finance the construction
        o f a new, as opposed to reconstruction o f the existing, AH Laboratory foreseen at
        Project approval. The construction o f the AH Lab provides benefits beyond AI.
        The envisaged new facility o f the Institute o f Food Safety and Veterinary (IFSV)
        i s consistent with both the current PDO and revised PDO, and represents a
        feasible, proportionate and sustainable solution responsive to current and
        forecasted laboratory diagnostic needs o f Albania. The estimated cost for the new
        AH Lab i s about US$1.9 million versus approximately US$300,000 for the


                                             7
      originally planned reconstruction. The Project through the redirection o f the CF
      and the reallocation o f the EEI, will contribute about US$1 million, while the
      Government will contribute an additional financing o f approximately US$0.68
      million.

      Human Health component. The restructured Project will support the revisions o f
      the National Pandemic Preparedness Plan according to WHO recommendations.
      More time i s needed to capitalize on completed and ongoing activities, and in
      particular to raise preparedness in the regions for diagnosis, referrals, and
      management o f outbreaks and pandemic. The restructured Project will improve
      triage and intra-hospital procedures for infection control, specifically for regional
      hospitals, and enhance knowledge o f primary health care workers. About US$
       1.O million has been earmarked for all additional activities (US$570,000) and for
      activities that go beyond the original cost estimates (US$490,000).

      Additional support -for disease emergency management. The restructured Project
      will finance procurement o f additional outbreak control and personal protective
      equipment to make sure that the adequate stocks are available, as well as
      additional measures for the management o f disease emergencies, and especially
      for the pandemic.

      Training and technical assistance. The restructured Project will expand the scope
      o f training and technical assistance activities to include a broader capacity
      building for animal and human health emergency management, triage, field
      epidemiology, clinical diagnosis o f a l i s t o f several important animal diseases,
      especially zoonoses.

       Animal disease surveillance and information system. The animal disease
      surveillance and information system will be modified to encompass the needs o f
      the A I and other zoonoses control programs but without significant additional
      financing needs.

       The changes in indicators and targets are summarized in Annex 1: Proposed
Changes in the Results Framework. The revised outcomes are summarized in Annex 2:
Revised Results Framework and Monitoring.

20.    Japan PHRD Co-financing Grant. The Japan PHRD Co-financing Grant (US$0.8
million) has been financing the majority o f the technical assistance. So far about 46
percent o f the grant proceeds have been disbursed and other TA activities financed b y the
Grant are in process. The Grant implementation progress i s satisfactory contributing to
the achievement o f the Project development objectives. The development objective o f
the Japan PHRD Grant have been amended to be mirror the G P A I DO. The Grant
closing date will be extended to April 30, 2011 to accommodate the revised Project
closing date3. In addition, the Grant disbursement schedule will be reallocated among
categories to accommodate expanded training needs to address the new N H l N 1 threat.
The share o f these Grant-eligible expenditures financed by the Grant will remain at 100
percent. N o new activities are expected to be added to the Grant, while the scope o f
some activities will be extended to cover other zoonoses and as well N H l N 1 .

2 1.     Project implementation arrangements. The Project management, implementation
arrangements, financial and economic analysis remain unchanged from the existing
Project .



 The Japan PHRD Grant closing date was originally approved for 4 months beyond the closing date of the
IDA Credit to allow for the A I Task Force Secretariat to finalize project expenditures during the usual
project grace period.

D.       Analysis

25.     The original analysis at Project appraisal focused on the benefits derived from
preparedness and control o f the AI. However, it was acknowledged that the Project's
benefits would be larger since it was going to provide a general level o f capacity building
for the veterinary and human health services which i s now coming to fruition. The
proposed restructuring will further contribute to this capacity building and improve the
overall impact o f the Project.

26.     The proposed alignment o f the PDO with the G P A I PDO allows the Project to
address prevailing pandemic and veterinary needs, while maintaining the original focus
on avian influenza preparedness. The broadened objectives expand Project impacts and
outcomes. The original outcome targets continue to remain relevant and can also serve to
track the expanded scope o f the Project. Expanding o f the scope o f the Project i s an
acknowledgement o f the need to respond to the country's efforts to control and address
other disease priorities such as NHlNl and brucellosis, and reflects the suitability o f the
Project design to support interventions in this regard.




                                            11
27.     A literature review and preliminary risk assessment suggest that the relative risk
o f incursion o f H P A I has diminished over the last three years since the Project
commenced due to: (i)    favorable evolution o f the epidemic in the wider region, and (ii)
better preparedness o f the Albanian authorities to deal with an epidemic. A full risk
assessment i s planned under the Project for later this year. Similarly, an updated financial
projection o f the possible losses due to an A I epidemic suggests that the very advanced
stage o f the Project not only reduces the probability o f such an epidemic in the limited
remaining period but, should an epidemic occur, it would probably cause lower losses
and necessitate less funds for compensation than was originally forecast and allocated.

28.     Several cases of N H l N 1 have been detected in Albania recently. The
Government has already taken several measures to address the threat. The M o H has
mobilized US$2.0 million from the M o F emergency reserve fund to procure Tamiflu,
seasonal vaccines and other medication. In addition, the Government i s finalizing the
National Pandemic Plan for N H l N 1 and other pandemics, building on the plans prepared
under the H P A I Project. The Plan envisages that, in case o f pandemic, the M o H would
be the lead agency with support o f other agencies as i s the current situation for
preparation for the NHlNl pandemic in the context o f the WHO notification. It i s
expected that funds could be reallocated from other Bank-financed projects if significant
additional resources are needed from the Bank for the N H l N 1 effort. The potential for
reallacation within the A I Project for N H l N 1 i s limited at this stage in i t s
implementation unless additional financing were to be considered. At present, the AI
Project Task Force Secretariat has approved the use o f $90,000 from Project savings for
the purchase o f Tamiflu available on the Albanian market.

29.     Rehabilitation o f an existing lab o f the Institute o f Veterinary Research (IVR) was
foreseen already during the Project design. However it was also agreed at Project
negotiations that the scope o f Laboratory activities and i t s costs would be subject to
change o f institutional framework. At the end o f 2006, the MAFCP merged IVR with the
Institute o f Food Research (IFR) and created new IFSV on the premises o f the earlier
IVR. I t was decided to keep the food control and the administration o f the IFSV in the
existing building and completely separate the animal diseases control in a new building to
be constructed with the Project proceeds within the IFSV territory. Based on the above,
the GOA in August 2008 submitted a request to the Bank to use the CF to construct the
Animal Health Lab (AH Lab).

30.     Safeguards policies. The construction o f the AH Lab instead o f the originally
foreseen reconstruction required some additional measures to comply with the Bank
safeguards policies. A Social Assessment was carried out that showed that there i s no
social safeguard issue and it was confirmed that OP 4.12 will not be triggered. The
Project has carried out a legal review to ensure that the land where the AH Lab will be
constructed i s owned by MAFCP, i s registered at the Immovable Property Registration
Office and that there are no outstanding legal claims. The Government also undertook
the necessary Environmental Assessment and subsequent update o f the existing
Environmental Management Plan. The EA has been cleared by the Bank and was
disclosed on the website o f the MAFCP and in the Bank's Infoshop on August 6,2009.



                                             12
31.     Financial management. There would be no changes in the existing financial
management and auditing arrangements for project implementation. As i s the case under
the original project, the financial management functions o f the restructured project will
be managed b y Project Task Force Secretariat within MAFCP. The Secretariat will
continue to be responsible for flow o f funds, accounting, financial reporting and auditing
arrangements. The financial management arrangements have been reviewed periodically
as part o f project supervision. According to the latest financial management supervision,
the financial management arrangements o f the project continue to be satisfactory and the
control procedures are in place. However, the completion o f all Albania Bank-financed
projects audit o f year 2008 Project Financial Statements has been delayed by two months.
Reminders have been issued to the M o F to urge the auditors to complete the audit for the
Project and submit the audit report to the Bank by November 30, 2009, to be in full
compliance with audit covenant. The auditors had issued unqualified opinion on prior
years' audit reports and there were no internal control issues in the management letters.
The client i s in compliance with financial reporting requirements. Project management
oriented Interim Un-audited Financial Reports (IFRs) will be used for financial reporting.
The existing format o f the IFRs will be used and the Secretariat will produce a full set o f
IFRs every quarter throughout the l i f e o f the project and submit them to the Bank no later
than one month after end o f each quarter.

32.    Compliance with Bank policies. The proposed restructuring does not involve any
exception to Bank policies.

E.      Expected Outcomes

33.    The main expected outcome indicators o f the restructured project are the
following: (i)National Integrated Preparedness Plan for control and response to outbreak
and pandemic prepared in accordance with W H O recommendations; and (ii)      Contained
and diminishing pattern o f H P A I and other zoonotic viral threats and infections in
humans. The proposed changes in the Project are reflected in Annex 1 and 2. The
revised Results Framework has been discussed and agreed upon with all relevant
stakeholders.


F.     Benefits and Risks

34.     The added benefits include (a) support for response to pandemic needs to increase
capacity to diagnose, isolate and treat patients with novel N H l N 1 influenza; (b) support
for construction o f the new AH Lab consistent with existing and future country needs for
such a diagnostic laboratory, in compliance with the EU standards; and (c) enhanced
laboratory diagnostic capacity for brucellosis and other zoonotic diseases, improving the
capacity o f the veterinary services to control and eventually eradicate zoonotic diseases,
and the overall readiness o f the country to respond to disease emergencies.

35.   The Government had been able to pay farmers satisfactorily and in a timely
manner to compensate for culled poultry before Project effectiveness. The farmers
compensation mechanism exists for poultry and other animals that need to be culled, thus


                                             13
    providing an incentive for livestock owners to report very quickly any sick and dead
    animals to their veterinarians. The risks associated with eliminating the CF are addressed
    through the current Government provisions for compensation.

    36.     The risks remain the same as described in the Technical Annex o f the original
,   Project. Evaluations during the mid-term review and the recent supervision o f February
    2009, however, suggest that the risks associated with declining political and financial
    commitments may be moderately reduced by: (i)      the continuous efforts to keep the
    Project satisfactory, (ii) additional financial commitment o f the Governments to the
                             the
    construction o f the IFSV AH Lab, and (iii) willingness to complete the National
                                                  the
    Pandemic Preparedness Plan with Government budgetary resources.
