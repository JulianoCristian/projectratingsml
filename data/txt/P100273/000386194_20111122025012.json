(APL) Project\n            for Albania were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory;\n            risk to development outcome was: moderate; Bank performance\n            was satisfactory; borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned include: a global\n            template can enable rapid, good project design. The Global\n            Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI) PAD was ill place and was\n            used as the basis for the preparation of this project. The\n            existence of a sound, global plan ensures that an effective\n            project can be formulated relatively rapidly at a time of\n            urgency, due to uncertain circumstances related to an\n            emerging infectious disease. Projects formulated for a\n            specific disease can prove to have too narrow and,\n            therefore, require restructuring. Close coordination with\n            specialized United Nations (UN) agencies can enhance the\n            quality of technical assistance. Too many key indicators for\n            an emergency project can make monitoring and evaluation\n            cumbersome. Data collection and analysis can be a daunting\n            task, particularly when there is no full-time staff\n            responsible for it. School teachers can play an important\n            role in behavior change and health promotion. Health-related\n            public awareness and communication activities in Albania\n            should target school teachers to maximize effectiveness, not\n            only when children are identified as key beneficiaries, but\n            also because children can influence their families and\n            others. Video conference and training with a health expert\n            can be very cost effective. Linking in-country specialists\n            with international experts was successful and should be\n            considered in other projects."}, "docdt": "2011-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
