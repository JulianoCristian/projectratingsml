and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (APL) Project\n            for Albania were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in\n            designing an emergency intervention, it is important to\n            distinguish between immediate response and longer-term\n            capacity building activities. The latter are often included\n            to build capacity to deal with future emergencies. However,\n            such activities usually benefit from longer preparation and\n            coordination with other sector interventions. Stronger\n            Management oversight is needed to ensure that project\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is actually utilized as\n            a management tool for effective project implementation.\n            Persistent occurrence of H5N1 infections in poultry around\n            the world means that conditions for the mutation of the\n            virus continue to prevail, including in Albania, where\n            biosecurity levels remain weak on poultry farms. Greater\n            effort is needed, both globally and in Albania, to improve\n            surveillance in backyard poultry systems and wild-life to\n            reduce risks. Early cooperation with UN agencies and\n            international technical organizations can offer synergy and\n            provide a basis for sustaining at least some programs on\n            project closure. More effective ways of working with the\n            media to communicate disease risks are needed to avoid panic\n            and build public confidence."}, "docdt": "2012-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
