alleviation and compensation for vulnerable groups presently\n            unreached by traditional mechanisms. The project will\n            support the government in: (a) establishing an efficient,\n            complementary and demand-driven mechanism for delivering\n            basic services and infrastructure to the poor utilizing\n            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), community\n            organizations and local decentralized agencies; (b)\n            channeling additional resources to social assistance, basic\n            infrastructure and small-scale productive activities; (c)\n            demonstrating transparent and efficient approaches to\n            project selection, management and administration; (d)\n            strengthening the institutional capacity of NGOs and\n            grassroots organizations; and (e) increasing beneficiary\n            participation in poverty alleviation efforts. The project\n            consists of: (a) support for sub-projects approved by FISE\n            in the areas of social infrastructure, socio-economic\n            infrastructure, social services, institutional development,\n            and productive community investments; and (b) institutional\n            support for FISE, including personnel and other operating\n            expenses, vehicles and equipment, and technical assistance\n            and training."}, "docdt": "1994-01-26T00:00:00Z"}
