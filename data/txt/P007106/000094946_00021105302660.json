Third Social Development Project are rated\n            partially satisfactory. Key lessons drawn from the project\n            include: 1) To avoid costly and protracted preparation\n            before starting a social fund, it would be advisable to\n            decide on the institutional framework, establish and staff\n            the implementing agency prior to detailed technical\n            preparation. 2) The use of a poverty-targeting strategy\n            should be strongly encouraged in all programs targeted to\n            benefit poor social groups. 3) Preparation of private\n            contractors can help accelerate subproject preparation as\n            well as implementation. On the other hand, the benefits of\n            rapid implementation must be weighed against the risk of\n            conflict of interest that could compromise subproject\n            selection. 4) Strengthening and improving grassroots\n            organizational capacity to develop subprojects contributes\n            to improve all stages of the subprojects cycle. 5) Training\n            nongovernmental organizations in subproject promotion and\n            development is essential for their full participation in\n            social fund projects. 6) Sustainability will be uncertain if\n            the beneficiaries are not directly involved in monitoring\n            and maintaining their completed subprojects. 7) Continuity\n            of technical staff as well as of external technical\n            assistance contributed to the establishment and maintenance\n            of consistent operating procedures in FISE (Emergency Social\n            Investment Fund), despite turnover of managers caused by\n            political changes."}, "docdt": "2000-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
