  Project covers three sectoral, regional, and indirect\n            issues: reforming agricultural technology generation;\n            institutional strengthening, and reform of the Ministry of\n            Food and Agriculture; and, development of farmer-based\n            organizations, which includes agricultural training. The\n            project, mainly service, and research oriented, could\n            generate adverse agricultural interventions on the\n            environment, such as bio-diversity loss, and land, and water\n            resources degradation, resulting in soil fertility loss, and\n            erosion. Mitigating measures specify that: 1) degradation of\n            productive systems affecting crops, would be compensated\n            through a built-in natural resource management program, to\n            match crop species with site suitability criteria.\n            Fertilizer trials will recommend appropriate dosage, and\n            application for specific types of soil; 2) agricultural\n            technology diffusion, will refocus on the management of\n            natural resources in the provision of environmental\n            extension services, through improved soil, and water\n            conservation methods, and include community participation;\n            3) improvement of communal grazing areas, monitoring of\n            improved breeds, and, application of non-polluting methods\n            for tsetse control, will curtail endangered livestock; and,\n            4) aquatic fauna will be monitored, and culture effluents\n            will be bio-restored."}, "docdt": "2000-03-31T10:03:03Z"}
