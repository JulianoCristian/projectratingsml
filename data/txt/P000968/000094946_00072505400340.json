the regions and districts; c) promoting cost-effective\n            demand-driven agricultural and extension systems to generate\n            and disseminate technologies on a contracting and/or cost\n            sharing basis; and d) strengthening the capacity of\n            farmers-based organizations. The project consists of four\n            components. 1) Reforming and strengthening agricultural\n            technology generation and diffusion as the main thrust of\n            the program will accelerate agricultural growth that results\n            in increased food security, reduced poverty, and\n            conservation of the natural resource base. 2) Institutional\n            reform and strengthening of Ministry of Food and Agriculture\n            (MOFA) will integrate resources for implementation of plans\n            and provision of decentralized services under the\n            administration of district assemblies, thus placing the\n            responsibility for planning and implementation of\n            agricultural services and development activities at the\n            grassroots level. 3) Development of farmer-based\n            organizations (FBOs) will develop a grassroots independent\n            movement of FBOs. 4) Strengthening agricultural education\n            and training will strengthen the capacity of agricultural\n            training institutions to produce the middle level human\n            resources/skills critically needed in the sector."}, "docdt": "2000-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
