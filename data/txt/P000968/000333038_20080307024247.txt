1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Since 1983, following a period of successive macroeconomic reforms, Ghanaian agriculture
has recovered from almost total collapse to a position of contributing significantly to the
country's economic growth. The Government of Ghana (GoG) initiated a number of
investment programs from the mid-1980s onward to rehabilitate basic agricultural services,
culminating in the formulation of a medium-term agricultural development strategy in 1990,
which aimed at achieving sectoral growth of 4 percent per annum. The agricultural sector
responded well, reversing the negative and sluggish growth rates of the late 1980s and early
1990s into a credible 3-4 percent annual growth rates of the late 1990s.

Despite this success, GoG at the same time was of the opinion that this growth path was well
below the country's potential for expanding production of agricultural commodities, both
tradable and non-tradable. Climatic conditions, fast growing domestic and regional markets
and proximity to the European market were considered to offer good opportunities for
sustained growth. Although agriculture was supporting economic growth ­ with the
employment of 60 percent of the active population and contributing 39 percent of total GDP
and 46 percent of export earnings in 1997- the GoG had identified a number of constraints that
needed to be addressed to sustain momentum and possibly accelerate growth of the sector.
These constraints included: (i) low factor productivity; (ii) a weak technology and transfer
system; (iii) weak Farmer-Based Organizations; (iv) a land tenure system that hampered
sustainable agricultural development; and (v) overexploitation of natural resources.         The
Agricultural Services Sub-sector Investment Project was conceptualized and designed to
support GoG in addressing these issues.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The project development objective (PDO) of the Agricultural Services Sub-Sector Investment
Project (AgSSIP) was to increase agricultural productivity and diversification at a rapid pace so
that rural incomes will be raised, rural poverty reduced, food security improved and the basis
for accelerated overall growth in the economy established on an environmentally sustainable
basis.

The project was designed as an Adaptable Program Lending (APL) to be implemented in three
3-year phases coinciding with GoG's three year rolling Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF). The project was to support all public agricultural services programs managed by the
Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) and the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research (CSIR). The first three-year phase ((2001-2003) was to focus on: (i) the introduction,
on a pilot basis before its full-scale implementation, of a demand-driven, and open agricultural
service delivery system; and (ii) the implementation of policy and institutional reforms to re-
focus government services on their core functions and strengthen the technical, financial and
managerial capacities of the sector ministries and district governments for executing these core
functions effectively. The two subsequent phases of the AgSSIP were to expand these reforms
and programs to a national level and support their consolidation.

The key indicators initially identified in the PAD for measuring progress toward the program's
and the project's development objective included the following: (i) sector impact indicators ­


                                                14

improved agricultural growth, increased rural household incomes, increased value of
agricultural production and marketing, reduction in unit cost of production, reduced rate of
land degradation, reduced over-exploitation of fisheries resources, and increased number of
beneficiaries; (ii) institutional development indicators ­ decentralization of services, capacity
building at all levels, cost-effectiveness of service provision, service cost recovery level,
capacity building at all levels, empowerment of FBOs and satisfaction of clientele of
agricultural services; (iii) a set of 33 project-specific input/output indicators clustered as
follows ­ satisfactory operation of the competitive agricultural research grant scheme, and the
agricultural extension and the farmer-based organizations (FBO) development funds; adoption
rates and impact of research and extension recommendations; private sector participation in
financing research and extension activities; productivity increases of selected commodities;
increased planting material and improved breeding livestock produced; increase in female
intake into agricultural colleges and extension personnel; reduction of post harvest losses;
privatization of animal health services; dissemination of accurate agricultural statistics and
market information; and (iv) 16 specific triggers to move from one phase to another.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The original PDO was not revised.          However, as part of the mid-term review, the key
performance indicators were revised. For this purpose, Schedule 6 in the DCA was amended
accordingly. Outcome indicators were reformulated into three and substantial modification
were introduced concerning the Component or output Indicators , which were simplified and
reduced in number - from 29 to 14- to make them more realistic and measurable. This was
done in light of unsatisfactory project execution prior to the MTR and to reflect Bank and GoG
agreement on priority actions to undertake and key policy and institutional reforms to retain.
Revised project key performance indicators and measurements are detailed in Annex 2 (Table
6).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The ultimate beneficiaries of the project were agricultural producers who are expected to adopt
better production technologies: farmers, livestock producers and fishermen. At the same time,
AgSSIP provided support for the development of farmer-based organizations (FBOs) to allow
them to play a major role in shaping agricultural policy, providing services to farmers and in
engaging in export activities. In addition, the project sought to strengthen the Ministry of Food
and Agriculture in general and it's Directorates both at the national and local level. Finally, the
project provided institutional strengthening to Ghana's agricultural research system (Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research) and its agricultural education and training institutions
(agricultural faculties of four universities).

1.5 Original Components

Component I. Reforming and Strengthening Agricultural Technology Generation and
Diffusion (US$68.35 million; IDA $39.50 million).

The objective of this component was to strengthen the national agricultural research and
extension system, primarily by increasing the participation of users in priority setting, funding
and delivery of these services. Specific activities of the agricultural research component



                                                15

included: (i) improving research governance and management and financial accountability; (ii)
introducing sustainable and competitive research funding, including Competitive Research
Grant Scheme (CARGS) 1 and voluntary contributions from research users; (iii) funding
priority research programs, and (iv) strengthening/rationalizing the scientific information
systems, human resources and research infrastructure. Specific activities of the agricultural
extension component included: (i) supporting the decentralization of front-line extension
activities to District Assemblies; (ii) empowering beneficiaries to participate in priority setting
and decision making of extension and adaptive research programs; (iii) strengthening linkages
with research; (iv) establishing and operating an Extension Services Development Fund2 to
promote pluralism in the delivery of agricultural extension services; (v) mainstreaming gender,
equity and environmental conservation issues in extension services; and (vi) supporting the
national initiative on prevention and control of HIV/AIDS.

The agricultural research activities were to be implemented by The Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research (CSIR), under the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology
(MEST), while MOFA had the primary responsibility in implementing extension services in
collaboration with FBOs, NGOs and the private sector.

Component II. Institutional Reform and Strengthening of MOFA (US$24.90 million; IDA
$17.65 million)

The objective of this component was to assist Government to complete its decentralization
program in the agricultural sector by supporting MOFA restructuring and providing the
necessary support at the regional and district levels. Specific actions were to assess and realign
MOFA's structure, staff skill mix and internal processes with its new mandate. The central
directorates of MOFA were to be strengthened and their staffing/skills developed to enable
them to perform their core functions and to provide backstopping services and training to the
regional development officers and subject matter specialists and to front-line extension agents
at district level.

MOFA reform was to be led by its Policy Planning Monitoring and Evaluation Department in
collaboration with the technical directorates of the ministries concerned, under the coordination
and supervision of the Office of MOFA's Chief Director. Implementation of the
decentralization of agricultural services at the District level was to be done in collaboration
with the Ministry of Local Government.

Component III. Development of Farmer-Based Organizations (US$ 9.03 million; IDA
6.35 million)

The objective of the component was to provide support for the development of Farmer-based
Organizations (FBOs) to allow them to play a major role in shaping agricultural policy and in
providing services to farmers. Specific activities were: (i) development of policies and legal



1 As described in the project document, the CARGS aimed to support demand-driven research which is
complementary to the priority research programs, and covers two type of research activity : (i) strategic research
targeted at problem of national importance and (ii) downstream research and development, e.g. pilot project
demonstrating potential for improved technologies or for development into commercial products

2The establishment of an Extension Service development Fund aimed at contracting gradually extension services
to private sector, and preparing District Assemblies to assume responsibility for the supervision and funding of
extension services. It would also allow farmer to have a greater voice in determining extension programs.



                                                        16

framework conducive for the development of FBOs and the operation of NGO; (ii) promotion
and development of grass-root level FBOs; (iii) strengthening the capacity of agencies and
entities responsible for assisting the promotion and development of FBOs; (iv) upgrading the
Cooperative College and transforming it into a College of FBOs; and (v) establishment of an
FBO Development Fund. The FBODF aimed to address constraints -such as inadequate access
to inputs, extension services, credit, marketing, and lack of management capacity- that small
and medium-scale farmers were facing in their daily operations.

The Department of Cooperatives, the Ghana Cooperative Council (GCC) and the Board of
Trustees for the FBO Development Fund were in charge of the implementation of the
component in collaboration with NGOs. These arrangements were defined in a tripartite
memorandum of understanding between the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Employment
and Social Welfare and GCC.

Component IV. Strengthening Agricultural Education and Training (US$4.67 million;
IDA $ 2.80)

The objective of the component was to strengthen the capacity of agricultural training colleges
and farm institutes to produce the middle level human resources/skills critically needed for the
sustained development of the agricultural sector. This objective was to be achieved through an
in-depth review of Ghana's agricultural education strategy and the revision of the curricula of
the colleges and the institutes to cater to the skill needs of the private sector. As part of the
program, the Human Resource Development Directorate was also to be strengthened.

MOFA's Human Resources Development Department was responsible for implementing the
agricultural education and training component, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education
and the agricultural faculties of the four universities in Ghana.

There was no separate component for project's coordination and monitoring and evaluation,
which were mainstreamed into the government structure with MOFA as the lead government
agency in implementing AgSSIP. A Program Coordination Unit was created within MOFA's
Policy Planning Monitoring and Evaluation Department (PPMED) to ensure technical and
fiduciary coordination of all non-research components, while CSIR coordinated agricultural
research activities.

1.6 Revised Components

There was no change in the number and headings of project components. However, activities
under Component III Development of Farmers Based Organizations, and Component IV
Agricultural Education and Training, were significantly enlarged after the mid-term review
to include new activities clustered under the heading "New Initiatives". As a result, credit
proceeds were reallocated to increase expenditure categories for MOFA Grants to strengthen
the Extension Development Fund and the FBO Development Fund, which were the main
channels for supporting some of the new initiatives, in addition to the construction of the Shed
9 Fruit Terminal in Tema harbor (Civil Works and Goods, see Table 1 below and details in
Annex1 (a) Table 2 and (b) Table 3).

These activities were carefully prepared and documented, and feasibility studies, including
cost-benefit analyses, were carried out. At the same time, some of the originally stipulated
actions under Component II Institutional Reform and Strengthening of MOFA were
revised and simplified altogether subsequent to the agreement reached during the mid-term



                                                17

review. The institutional reform agenda was thus reduced from twelve measures as indicated in
the original DCA, to three key actions: (i) the production and implementation of 10 district
annual agricultural services and development plans; (ii) a functional review of MOFA and
decentralization of its activities; and (iii) the enactment of a revised Fisheries Bill.

1.7 Other significant changes

As a consequence of the mid-term review carried out in June 2004, a New Initiatives
subcomponent was introduced as part of Components I, III and IV. These initiatives were fully
consistent with the overall project development objective and responded to GoG's wish to
expand the role of farmer-based organizations, and supporting private sector participation in
agricultural and rural development. They reflected Ghana's Poverty Reduction Strategy
(GPRS) which was approved by Parliament in February 2003; it also targeted the sources of
potential growth identified in the Bank/s 2004-7 CAS ­ namely, the development of non-
traditional export crops, improved farmer access to infrastructure, technology, international
markets and improved quality control.

These changes in emphasis led to the amendment of the Schedule 1 (Withdrawal of the
Proceeds of the Credit) of the DCA, and as mentioned in paragraph #1.3, and to the revision of
the project key performance indicators (Schedule 6 of the DCA), especially regarding
Component Indicators. At the time of project restructuring3 carried out as part of the MTR,
only of 37 percent of the credit proceeds had been disbursed.

To fully implement these changes, the project closing date was extended from 10/31/2003 to
10/31/2004, and thereafter two more times, to October 31, 2006 and again to April 30, 2007.
Since the new initiatives were fully consistent with the overall project development objective
and were part of existing components, there was no need for Board approval to the project
restructuring that was agreed with GoG during MTR.

Activities introduced under the New Initiatives (USS12.35 million) were the following:




3The project underwent a "minor" restructuring based on OPCS guidelines in effect at the time which note
examples of minor project changes as "renaming of implementing entities, agreed revision of reporting schedules
or formats, or changes in the specification of project outputs that do not have significant impact on the project
objectives or scope". In this case project outputs were changed but the PDO remained the same. The Key
Performance Indicators were amended based on changes in project outputs and VPU clearance was received since
the request included a 3 year extension from the original closing date, and because the reallocation was more than
5% from the original allocations.

Horticulture Export Industry Initiative (HEII): The HEII was designed to address the
challenges faced by the horticulture industry. The main objective of this component was to
increase the income of the farmers, workers and small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
involved in the horticulture export industry. This was to be done by supporting actions that
would enable Ghanaian exporters and farmer-owned organizations to reposition themselves
quickly to higher value growth segments of the market (logistics and post-harvest
infrastructure, improved planting material, applied research and development programs,
smallholders mango out grower development, quality management and food safety systems,
support to industry and farmer owned organizations, program management and strategic
support systems.

Development of Oil Palm Industry: The objective of this component was to support the Oil
Palm Research Institute's (OPRI) capacity for production of improved planting materials. This
was part of the President's Special Initiative (PSI) to develop the palm oil industry. To that aim,
new seed store was to be constructed, some OPRI premises rehabilitated, and seedlings were to
be produced and distributed to FBOs.

Community Fisheries Infrastructure Development: The objective of this component was to
develop and promote small holder aquaculture as a source of fish protein, and to ensure safe
landing of fish from capture fishers. This was to be achieved through the completion of two
fish hatcheries, and the preparation of a feasibility study for improvement of six selected fish
landing sites.

Rehabilitation of Irrigation Schemes: The objective of this component was to increase
irrigated agricultural production. This was to be achieved through the rehabilitation of 9
irrigation schemes, covering 1,864 hectares of rice (70 percent) and vegetables (30 percent). In
all 2,326 small holder families (18,600 persons) were expected to benefit from the project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The intended policy and institutional reforms to re-focus government services on their core
functions and to strengthen the technical, financial and management capacities of the sector
ministries and district governments for executing these core functions effectively were not
defined in sufficient detail. Little formal sector work was available to support the necessary
comprehensive policy dialogue. While there was probably general agreement between GoG
and the Bank on the desirability and sense of direction for the envisaged policy and
institutional reforms, no clear roadmap was drawn up, which led to misunderstanding and
disagreements during project implementation. Also, beneficiaries were not sufficiently
involved in project design.

No implementation manuals were available at the beginning of the project. This led to
misunderstanding between GOG and the Bank on the eligibility of certain expenditures, and
resulted in procurement and disbursement delays.

It is worth noting that donor collaboration during project preparation and appraisal was good,
and several donors participated in mission work. The original USD 123.73 million financing
plan ((c) Table 4 in Annex1) was sought as an attempt to initiate a program-based approach for
the agricultural sector, in particular for the implementation of the AAGDS and subsequently
the FASDEP. Even though some donors did not follow through on commitments at approval



                                                19

stage, significant support through parallel financing has come during project implementation
and GoG provided substantial counterpart funding as committed during project preparation.

The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) contributed to the Program through
the Food and Agriculture Budget Support (FABS, CAD 49.25 million disbursed as of
December 31, 2006). CIDA also supported the FBO component and contributed to the
rehabilitation of some irrigation schemes, but reporting of CIDA funds were separated from
reporting on AgSSIP funds. EU technical assistance came in 2005, for the elaboration and the
implementation of a Sector Monitoring and Evaluation System. Over time, donor cooperation
improved even further, notably under the mechanism of systematic joint Implementation
Support Missions (ISM), which empowered the government in organizing, leading, and
coordinating supervision missions with major donor partners taking part in it.

2.2 Implementation

After appraisal and presentation of AgSSIP to the Board on August 1st, 2000, the country
entered into an intense phase of parliamentary and presidential election campaigns. During this
time, there was considerable political uncertainty and government's activities slowed down.
The party which had been in power for a long time, lost and was replaced by the opposition
party. The new government, once in office, reviewed all existing projects to make sure they
fitted their own strategies and priorities. The new government was not committed to the
original AgSSIP as designed and, as a consequence, the signing of the loan was delayed by
about one year. The new government signed the DCA on the understanding that once signed, it
would be easier to make modifications rather than to insist on an immediate redesign of
AgSSIP. Also, the expected close donor coordination and financial support for the wider
AgSSIP program, was slow in materializing. Nevertheless the practice of inviting other donors
to participate in joint implementation support missions in the end paid off, and subsequently
led to close collaboration in the revision of the Food and Agricultural Sector Development
Policy, and likely the financing of the underlying sector wide program.

Government's level of commitment improved after the project was finally modified to include
activities it had called for from the start. This redesign of the components to include the new
initiatives took over one year, as a consulting firm had to be selected to carry out feasibility
studies and to undertake environmental assessments for these new activities.

In many ways, project design was oriented towards using country systems and responding to
the possibility of channeling funds eventually (in phase II and III) through the budget. Project
implementation, unlike many other projects of this vintage, was designed to be part of the
government structure and the Director of the Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation
Department (PPMED) of MoFA was at the same time project coordinator and that there was no
separate project management unit. This was meant to reflect the fact that the project supported
the implementation of the sector policy and indeed, the Ministry saw it as the main vehicle to
implement the policy. Unfortunately, GoG's initial capacity to manage the project as a
mainstreamed program was over-estimated during project preparation causing delays during
implementation.. Furthermore the decentralization policy was slow in being implemented and
therefore MOFA as such had little incentive and was constrained in its ability to decentralize
functions or budget beyond gradually increasing the level of budget to district directorates.
Over time, and with specific training of key personnel, overall management of the AgSSIP
improved and became satisfactory towards the end of the project period, suggesting that the



                                                20

approach of mainstreaming was in fact correct but should have been accompanied with more
technical assistance

The project was considered as a problem project for nearly two years starting in October 2003,
which coincides with the original closing date. The Bank and GoG teams identified and
recognized major issues that hindered project implementation during the mid-term review, and
addressed them through restructuring. This review was jointly prepared and considerable
specialized human and substantial financial resources were mobilized both by Government and
the Bank. This allowed the Bank and GoG to successfully identify implementation issues, and
to agree on necessary adjustments to some of the initial policy and institutional reforms, and to
the inclusion of the New Initiatives. The mid-term review was the turning point in the project
life, as project implementation accelerated and became satisfactory. The Government also
responded by focusing attention on implementation delays, careful monitoring of procurement
processes, including demanding a faster turn around time within the Ministry and by the Bank
on no objection requests.

Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

Until mid-term review, project implementation and disbursement delays were very significant.
While the project at appraisal was supposed to be a three-year time slice of a 9 year APL and to
be closed by October 31, 2003, it has been extended 3 times and the final closing date was
April 30, 2007. Disbursements were very slow initially and way behind the original
disbursement schedule. As of September 2004 (shortly after the mid-term review and after the
initial closing date), only 37 per cent of the Credit had been disbursed. The reasons for these
implementation and disbursement delays were a combination of factors: changes in
government and review of the original project, unrealistic implementation schedule, weak
financial management system and inefficient procurement and disbursement. The fact that
many of the expenditures were spread over a great number of cost centers all over the country
was an additional complicating factor, initially. However this is part of the GoG
decentralization policy and as such, AgSSIP should be commended for using and enhancing
the implementation of the government decentralization framework.           Hence, although the
project might have been able to avoid some of the initial delays by adopting a ring-fenced
implementation structure, the use and subsequent enhancement of government systems by the
project is felt to have off-set some of the initial implementation delays.

Project costs for the overall AgSSIP program and the Bank financed AgSSIP project varied
considerably between appraisal estimates and actual expenditures. Concerning the Bank
financed AgSSIP, at the time of the mid-term review, the mission found that MOFA had
committed most of the funds for civil works and goods already and that CSIR had
overcommitted funds for civil works by US$4 million and goods by US$1.6 million, and
under-committed funds for consultancy/training and operating costs.

After the mid-term review and the inclusion of new initiatives, project costs per component
changed significantly and a major reallocation of Credit funds was carried out. The two main
changes were: a) the allocation of SDR 10.3 million for training and consultants' services was
reduced to SDR 4.8 million, and b) the allocation of grants for MOFA was increased from
SDR 3.9 million to SDR 11.1 million). The new initiatives were funded to the tune of US$ 12.3
million. These were mostly charged against the Component III on Development of Farmer-
based Organizations, following project restructuring at the time of the medium term review.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

At the sector level, MOFA received towards the end of the project, technical assistance from
the European Union to establish a monitoring and evaluation framework. Reporting guidelines
for quarterly and annual reports were established and discussed with national and selected
district and regional staff. A significant effort during 2006 has been made to implement this
M&E framework. This resulted in obtaining more information from the field and allowed
better documenting of sector performance. As a consequence, MOFA's M&E system today is
much better than in the past and provides a basis for the follow on operation to be sector
budget support. The EU Technical Assistance found that field level monitoring and evaluation
training carried out under AgSSIP was beneficial in that extension officers in charge of data
collection were competent even if they were not fully conversant with or aware of national
policies.

At the end of the project, and in line with earlier agreements, PPMED also carried out a general
beneficiary assessment as well as an evaluation and impact study of the farmer- based
organizations development. Key findings from these studies (see summary in Annex 5)
revealed significant impact on livelihood of the FBOs and their members, and identified factors
that militated against optimization of the project outcomes, particularly of subprojects funded
under the FBODF. Beneficiaries also welcomed institutional innovations introduced for
agricultural services that ensured increasing stakeholders' participation in research and
extension priority settings. In addition, although most of the new initiatives related investments
were completed only towards the end of the project, thereby making it difficult to fully assess
their overall profitability, initial results are very encouraging as demonstrated by the evaluation
of irrigation investments. A full economic analysis of these activities and an evaluation of the
extension development fund are underway as part of the preparation of the agricultural sector
Development Policy Lending (DPL), meant as a follow up operation for AGSSIP I. It is also
clear that a number of supporting interventions by other donors, such as in irrigation and
horticulture, will rely on the completion of these investment activities for the implementation
of their programs.

The project monitoring and evaluation system as designed in the appraisal document was very
ambitious and all encompassing. Around fifty performance indicators and triggers for AgSSIP
II were established. At appraisal, it was foreseen that in addition to the information collected
for performance monitoring at the local, regional and national level, beneficiary assessments
and impact evaluations would be carried out from time to time. These latter two activities were
supposed to be done through twinning arrangements with local Universities and other partner
institutions, since MOFA did not have adequate capacity in terms of staffing and analytical
skills.

As it turned out, the original project's M&E system was too complex and demanding to be
implemented successfully. Baseline surveys were not carried out and many of the key
performance indicators were not sufficiently specified, and no methodology was agreed upon
on how to measure some of the variables. Taking the opportunity of the mid-term review,
project performance indicators (sector indicators, end-of program indicators, outcome/impact
indicators and component indicators) were reduced in number and revised to make them more
easily measurable. Moreover baseline data have been collected and targets have been agreed
upon. At that time it was also agreed to conduct a beneficiary assessment prior to project
closing with the aim to obtain additional data to judge project performance. The Project


                                                   22

Coordination Unit was then able to document appropriately progress towards achievement of
project outcomes, and results have been documented in implementation support missions' aide
memoirs and Project Status Reports.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Two safeguard policies were triggered for the project: environmental assessment (OP 4.01) and
pest management (OP 4.09). Overall the project has complied with these policies. To facilitate
the development, implementation and adoption of IPM packages for sustainable crop
production, and as part of AgSSIP support to the Directorate of Plant Protection under
Component 2,       the following guides were developed, printed and disseminated: Crop
Protection Policy Guidelines, Handbook of Crop Protection recommendations in Ghana -
Volume 4 - selected fruits;             Good Agricultural Practices and Crop Protection
Recommendations Volume 5 - selected vegetables; IPM Extension Guide 1-4 (650 copies
distributed); Pesticides Dealers Handbook ; Pesticides Applicators Handbook; Post-registration
field surveillance and monitoring manual for pesticides inspectors (400 copies available). The
guides are in use by extension staff, RELC's researchers and other stakeholders.

In 2006, the MOFA work plan was subjected to environmental screening where a number of
activities were identified for further environmental assessments. Criteria to guide the screening
process have been developed and staff has been trained. Pest management is controlled by the
National Pesticide Control and Management Act. To further improve an otherwise satisfactory
application of policies in these areas, a number of opportunities were identified including: (i) a
closer collaboration between MOFA and the Environmental Protection Agency; and (ii)
updating the manual of procedures of the CARGs and FBODF to also apply environmental
screening to individual research and FBOs subprojects.

Concerning fiduciary compliance, audit reports were delivered on time and were not qualified.
Financial management reports were also submitted on a regular basis and generally on time.

Procurement initially faced a number of constraints notably that are typically associated with
the use of country systems, including: inadequate capacity at the MOFA's directorates and
CSIR to prepare detailed technical specifications for goods and works, and/or sound terms of
reference for consultants.

Under the CSIR managed research activities, during the first three years of the project, costs
were grossly underestimated leading to category overruns. The Bank's request during the mid-
term review to reduce the scope of contracts under execution (instead of effecting reallocation
from the unallocated category) and later restoring these same contracts to their original scope
created problems for the civil works component for the research institutes and led to serious
cost overruns and delayed contract execution.

However, these constraints were satisfactorily addressed by training and assigning two
procurement specialists to the coordination unit, and towards the end of the project,
procurement was handled satisfactorily, evidencing the project contribution to capacity
building in this area.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Based on achievements in policy and institutional objectives, including the successful
completion of a revised Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP II), a
revised monitoring and evaluation framework, and improved financial management capacity


                                               23

within the Ministry, the next phase is expected to continue to support the implementation of the
sector policy. This support is expected to help sustain investments made to date and support
public agricultural investments where needed; stimulate private agricultural sector performance
across the board and continue to increase donor coordination and collaboration in the
agricultural sector.

Experience under AgSSIP I has shown that the follow-up operation should continue to support
FASDEP II, which is the Government's platform for sector development. Lessons from
AgSSIP first phase, the CIDA/DFID-supported Food and Agriculture Budgetary Support
(FABS) assessment, and the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) of MOFA
have fed into the revision of FASDEP and broad based consultations have been held. The
policy supports continuing focus on FBOs and private sector development and on productivity
increases, particularly for staple crops.

Such an approach is necessary to develop the country's potential in commercial agriculture and
to address continuing concerns of food security and rural poverty. In agreement with the
Government of Ghana, the current Country Assistance Strategy anticipated continued Bank's
support to Ghana's agricultural sector through a Development Policy Lending instrument
(DPL). The use of such instrument would require (i) a strategic sector policy framework, (ii)
sound institutional and financial management arrangements, and (iii) a sector-wide M&E
framework with specific indicators and targets. During the course of AgSSIP I implementation,
these elements have indeed been strengthened and donor coordination has improved
considerably. The time seems ripe therefore for a sector-wide budget support, . This would
help fostering unfinished reform agenda and developing coordinated donor support to
agricultural sector development.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The development objective was highly appropriate in the context of Ghana. Recent analytical
works have demonstrated how powerful engine of growth the agricultural sector may be ­ both
in sustaining the overall economy as well as in reducing vulnerability and poverty in general.
The recent Country Economic Memorandum (CEM, 2007) notes that national rural poverty has
decreased from 50 percent in 1998/99 to 39 percent in 2004/06, and the depth of poverty
among rural households (84 percent of total poverty at the beginning of AgSSIP) has also
fallen over the same period from 0.24 to 0.18 to 0.14. The performance of the agricultural
sector has been an important determinant of aggregate macroeconomic performance with the
growth in the agricultural sector mirroring aggregate trends in most years. Macro-economic
simulations recently undertaken by the West and Central Africa Council for Agricultural
Research and Development (CORAF/WECARD), jointly with the International Food Policy
Research Institute (IFPRI, 2006) highlight the potential of stronger agricultural growth based
on improved yields and improvements in marketing.

The agricultural sector posed significant constraints and opportunities at the time AgSSIP was
being prepared. Agriculture was dominated by resource-poor smallholders who employ low
levels of technology. Farmer-based organizations (FBOs) were weak and existing land tenure
arrangements hamper sustainable agricultural development, and natural resources are being
over-exploited. Yet, with the institutional and policy reforms and stepped up investments by
the public, and especially the private sector, as supported under AgSSIP, the rural economy


                                              24

had the potential to becoming the engine of growth for the whole economy. The CEM also
notes that (i) over 2001 - 2005 agriculture contributed 38 percent to Ghana's aggregate growth
and that 55 percent of this agricultural GDP growth was from crops (i.e. not from cocoa or
livestock or forestry or fishing). The sub-sectors supported by AgSSIP have therefore
contributed significantly to growth over this period. The CEM analysis further suggests that 60
percent of this agriculture sector growth is from increase in total factor productivity.

Because of strong linkages between small-scale agricultural and non-agricultural sectors of the
rural economy, it is agricultural growth, based on technologically-driven factor productivity
increases that can be expected to provide the effective engine for employment creation in the
farm and non-farm sector. Also, non-traditional agricultural exports are in its infancy and given
Ghana's natural endowments, fast growing domestic and regional markets and proximity to the
European market offer good opportunities for sustained growth. Horticulture, oil seeds, and
tree crops are some areas where the approaches to improve technologies, policies and
institutional arrangements are starting to pay off. GOG shared this assessment and considered
AgSSIP as one of the major instruments for implementing its Accelerated Agricultural Growth
and Development Strategy (AAGDS), which supports Ghana's Vision 2020. The World Bank
Group in its CAS equally considered the AgSSIP as the main instrument of Bank support to the
agricultural sector.

The choice of an adaptable program lending (APL) was justified. However, the first-phase
implementation period of three years was too short to allow full implementation of all the
envisioned changes. The operation was very complex and combined too many investment
activities, institutional objectives and policy changes. More sector work to provide the
analytical underpinning would have been useful. Also, clear implementation procedures and
milestone should have been spelled out in a comprehensive implementation manual before
project effectiveness.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Out of a total of 19 performance indicators (including two end of program first phase indicators
or triggers, three outcomes indicators to measure project development objectives, and 14
output indicators to measure component performance), 12 were fully achieved, 6 were partially
achieved and only 1 were not met (see Table 6 in Annex 2 for more details).

The following outcome indicators were agreed upon to measure project development objectives:
(a) Overall farm productivity increase by 10 percent for all crops compared to 2000 levels; (b)
Increased value of agriculture production, particularly in horticulture by 40 percent; and (c)
Improved capacity of farmer based organizations in production and marketing.

The indicator on farm productivity is partially met. Over the period 2001 ­ 2006 sector
production (including crops, livestock, forestry and fishing) increased in real terms by 30
percent. The cocoa sector led the trend, with growth over the period of 69 percent. The crops
and livestock sub-sector growth increased by 5.5 percent per annum on average real terms.
Compared to the demographic growth (2.7 percent per year), production per capita
(agricultural labour productivity) increased by 8 percent. Increase in production resulted from
5.3 percent improvement in average yield (land productivity), and 26.3 percent expansion and
diversification of cropped areas, particularly for groundnut, cowpea, plantain, yam, and maize.
At the same time, performance in production output contributed to food security improvement
and additional income to the farmers. While Ghana has recorded good performance both in



                                                25

labour and land productivity, achievements are below the initial target of 10 percent, which
was overly optimistic compared to the NEPAD/CAADP target of 6 percent.

The second indicator regarding the increase in value of agriculture production is fully
achieved. Value of horticultural exports at current prices recorded a 171 percent increase at
USD 76 million in 2006, compared to the baseline established in 2000. Agricultural exports
(including timber) are the primary source of foreign exchange accounting for over half of
export receipts in 2006, and value of cereals production increased by 147 percent from
US$210 million in 2000 to US$520 million in 2006 (see annex 2 for details).

The third outcome indicator (Improved capacity of farmer based organizations in
production and marketing) is fully achieved. Results achieved under the FBO component
included setting up of the FBO Development Fund (FBODF), training of about 1,300 FBO
executives in group development and business management at the Cooperative College,
strengthening of the Ghana Cooperative Council, building capacity for agencies in charge of
promoting FBO, and creating a web-based directory of FBOs and NGOs.. The FBODF
assessment study report concluded that the Fund has been satisfactorily established in 2002 and
has become operational progressively in 20 pilot districts (two districts per region), with
governance structure composed of Regional Steering Committees whose mandate has been
expanded to other non-pilot districts, a Board of Trustees assisted by the FBO Secretariat. 326
FBOs benefited from the FBODF,

Figure 1: FBO's projects per activities
                                                beyond the initial target of 300 FBOs. As many as
                                 Processing     100 of the FBOs supported were made of women
                                 equipement     only, while the rest were a mix of women and men.
                                 Crop & animal  An independent evaluation conducted by CIDA and
                                 production     the FBO Secretariat in 2006 indicated an 85 percent

                                 Storage and    satisfactory rating for FBO projects funded under the
                                 Workshop       FBODF. Results of the FBODF `s support included
                                 Facility       the following : over 70 percent of FBO assessed in
                                 Rehabilitation
                                 of office      the sample indicated improved access to services
                                                such as credit; about 70 percent of FBOs were
                                 Training       utilizing their equipment effectively, and recorded a
                                                50 to 100 percent       increase in their processing
activities.

Furthermore, the agricultural sector experienced sustained growth rate over the project's life,
averaging 5 percent between 2001 and 2006 (compared to 2.1 percent in 2000), and well in
excess of the population growth rate estimated at 2.7 percent per year. The agricultural sector
contributes more than 35 percent to the country's GDP.

While these performance cannot be all attributed to the Project's intervention (for example the
crisis in Cote d'Ivoire, other development projects supporting sector objectives also
contributed to these developments), it is clear that the capacity of farmer based organizations
in production and marketing is increasing steadily, although from a very low base. Priority
Research Programs and subprojects funded under CARGS have generated 67 new technologies,
including crops varieties tailored to users needs thanks to the farmers' participation in selecting
research priorities. In addition AgSSIP contributed to revamping the Horticulture Exports

Industry. In particular, the Horticultural Export Industry Initiative (HEII) took the approach of
developing public private partnerships and enabling small holders to access improved planting
materials and respond to market needs (see Box 1below on pineapple industry and Annex 2 for
details, including the public-private partnership for mango export from Tamale).

Box 1: The Pineapple Story: Conversion to MD2
Pineapple exports from Ghana are an interesting success story in horticultural exports. Market volumes exploded from
practically zero in the late 1980s to about 70,000 tons (fresh cut and juices combined) in 2004, capturing a 10 percent market
share of the European fresh produce import market. Sea freight has been a major factor, increasing from 15,000 tons in 1997
to 70,000 tons in 2004 (even though only one shipping company is available to transport freight from Ghana). The pineapple
export industry has a large base of small farmers contributing up to 50 percent of the total export volume. However, Ghana
experienced a dramatic reduction in market share and export earnings from horticulture with the introduction of the MD2
pineapple cultivar by Del Monte. In 2005 horticultural exports declined by 27 percent primarily due to a decline in pineapple
exports by 35 percent. The industry is now switching to the MD2 and trying to meet standards for food safety. HEII is in the
process of converting 1,150 acres of small scale Smooth Cayenne farms to MD2 by August 2008 to benefit 1,560 small scale
farmers. Forty groups of farmers (400 farmers) have been supplied with 1.76 million plantlets from two tissue laboratories to
establish forty nurseries. The farmers have received training on how to multiply the plantlets, which, when harvested, will be
used partly by the farmers and partly for further distribution to other farmer groups. In this manner, once the conversion is
complete, smallholders who contribute over 40 percent of exported pineapple should be able to export 23,000Mt of MD2 by
November 2009.

Likewise, steps have been taken to mainstream gender into agricultural policy making and in
the delivery of extension services. Specific project's contribution in mainstreaming women in
agricultural development included increase of women enrollment in agricultural education and
training, and support to women-led activities through the FBO Development Fund as indicated
earlier. Support to the extension services through AgSSIP have also contributed to raising
HIV/AIDS awareness in rural areas.

Most importantly, AgSSIP has laid the institutional ground for demand-driven agricultural
services by initiating participatory priority settings and funding mechanisms such as CARGS,
RELCs, FBO and Extension Services development funds. These mechanisms will need further
strengthening under the agricultural sector DPL under preparation, as already foreseen in
FASDEP II.

3.3 Efficiency

The actual sector average growth rate is much higher than the very modest minimum
incremental growth rates (from 0.14 percent to 0.15 percent p.a.) calculated in the break-even
analysis in the project appraisal document required to justify the cost stream of AgSSIP.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Achievement of the overall project objective is rated as moderately satisfactory.

The approach for rating project's overall outcome follows OPCS ICR guidelines (August,
                                                                              2006, Appendix B), which indicate

 Outcome Rating                          Unsatisfactory      Satisfactory     for    period       before       and      after
 Weight (Share in disbursement)                   37%               63%       restructuring in a rating scale ranging
from 6 as Highly Satisfactory to 1 as Highly Unsatisfactory, in proportion to the share of
actual credit disbursements. The Project is rated unsatisfactory against the original outcome
indicators (2), and satisfactory against the revised outcome indicators (5). This results in a
weighted average value of 3.89 or 4 when rounded off, or moderately satisfactory.

The project has fully or partially met all outcome indicators as stated in the revised DCA
(amendment of the project key performance indicators), contributing to Ghana's agricultural


                                                               27

sector performance and rural poverty reduction, as described in the economic analysis in
Annex 3.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Data from the 2006 Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS V), suggest that the share of the
population in poverty decreased from 39.5 percent to 28.5 percent between 1999 and 2005.
Disaggregated data show that poverty among food crop farmers has fallen from 59 percent to
45 percent in the same period, and from 39 percent and 24 percent for export crop farmers,
putting Ghana on the right path to achieving MDG1...

Furthermore, agricultural research and extension programs have been widened in scope and
concerns to mainstream gender dimension and to deal with HIV/AIDS related issues. The
majority of beneficiaries under the farmer-based organizations component were women.
Finally, it is worth noting that AgSSIP has steadily increased women enrollment in agricultural
education and training programs. According to the FBODF assessment report (April 2007), of
the 1,266 FBO executives trained at the Cooperative College, 48 percent were women and the
youth (age range 18 to 39) constituted 42 percent. Out of the 326 FBO projects supported, 100
were solely for women with the remaining consisting of mixed groups. Also, it is worth noting
that over 70 percent of FBO projects are into processing, which tended to be women-led
activity.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Both for the national research system and the agricultural extension system, AgSSIP has had a
significant impact. The competitive research grant scheme and the subcontracting of extension
delivery to private service providers, although very limited in scope and funding, are starting to
influence the way managers of researcher and public extension think about their work. Most
importantly, researchers as well as public field extension agents start to feel competitive
pressure and realize that they have to deliver if they do not want to become irrelevant and even
lose their jobs in the longer term. The decentralization of MOFA ­ even in its present limited
form - has already significantly impacted the workings of district directorates, as field staff in
the Districts are starting to realize that they now have to work with District Assemblies. MOFA
is the most deconcentrated Ministry of the Government, with most staff located in districts.
Also, the financial management restructuring at MOFA is progressing steadily, and planning
and budgeting processes have become embedded in the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
and now concentrates on defining and achieving clear objectives rather than describing
activities.

AgSSIP has also promoted farmer-based organizations, by being a catalyst for business
development by groups of farmers that want to succeed in the market place. With continued
technical and financial support to primary FBOs, it can be expected that they will associate and
create larger organizations that will enable them to take on larger challenges and provide them
with greater bargaining power in the economic and political arena. Finally, through the "New
Initiatives", especially the Horticultural Export Industry Initiative, AgSSIP has proven that
Ghana can become a major exporter of agricultural produce and that it can successfully and
quickly step up production of competitive agricultural commodities if it so chooses by linking
small holder farmers to agro-industries and the world market.




                                                  28

Ghana is also spearheading the NEPAD/CAADP's agenda for agricultural technology
generation and dissemination, alongside Senegal and Mali to host the first phase of the West
Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP) which will be grounded on institutional
developments under AgSSIP, including building on the achievements of the IFAD supported
Roots and Tuber project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Donors active in the agricultural sector participated in all phases of the AgSSIP (preparation,
pre-appraisal, appraisal and during project implementation, including MTR). Joint field
implementation support missions were the norm. As a result, CIDA and EU contributed to the
program through parallel mechanisms ­ budget support and technical assistance on M&E
respectively- and the horticultural sector has become more attractive to invest in (USAID-
supported TIPCEE and the Millennium Challenge Account as well as private investors). In
addition, institutional settings for more demand-driven agricultural services created under
AGSSIP, are being used for implementing other programs. As an example, GTZ-supported
FARMER Project is expanding the RELC experience in other regions which have not benefited
initially from the project.

Furthermore, AgSSIP has provided the base for Ghana's participation in the regional
agricultural research agenda under the NEPAD's Comprehensive Africa Agricultural
Development Program (CAADP), which is supported by the Bank through the Regional West
Africa Agricultural Productivity Project (WAAPP) approved by the Board in March 2007.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Both the general beneficiary assessment and the evaluation and impact assessment of the
Farmer-Based Organizations Development Fund (FBODF) were positive, as indicated in
section#3.2. They allowed an independent assessment of the response of various stakeholders,
to identify strength and weaknesses of the different components, and to formulate
recommendations for improvements (see summary of the reports in Annex 5).

The beneficiary assessment outlined for consideration in designing the second phase of
AgSSIP the following: adoption of alternative approaches to reforms in MOFA; strengthening
program management structures and systems; strengthening extension and research linkages;
inclusion of Agro-processing in project activities; enhanced support to FBOs and strengthening
of the FBO Development Fund; improving infrastructure and equipment base for agricultural
development.

Key recommendations from the FBODF evaluation study include the need for continuous
capacity building to address operational challenges, enhancing leadership and members'
commitment and encouraging the FBOs and District Unions to develop business plans to guide
their operations. Others are the need to ensure that only FBOs that are solidly on the ground are
supported, the provision of integrated support to the FBOs, blacklisting non-performing service
providers and revisiting the unfavorable government trade policy on agricultural development

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate.

Risks to development outcome and sustainability of project achievements are evaluated against
the following criteria: institutional, economic and financial, environmental and social:


                                                29

    · Institutional risk to development outcome is low: Given the support provided in
       FASDEP II, it is likely that the institutional framework that has been established under
       AgSSIP for developing the agricultural research and extension services system will
       prevail within the next years. CARGS, the Extension Services and the FBO
       development funds are now internalized as the right approach to enhance stakeholders'
       participation in defining priorities. In addition, the current decentralization policy will
       further strengthen empowerment of local actors, notably at district levels, in scaling up
       the agricultural services delivery system.

    · Economic and Financial risk to development outcome is moderate: the current
       annual agricultural growth is well above the incremental agricultural GDP growth rate
       of 0.14 percent to 0.15 percent per annum that has been determined as minimal to
       justify undertaking the program. Current level of Government contribution to the
       AgSSIP I, combined with a move towards more budgetary support ­including the
       proposed agricultural sector DPL- in addition to resources from the WAAPP for
       supporting the agricultural research system over the next five years, would normally
       ensure a financial sustainability of the funding. However, cost for effective stakeholder
       involvement in setting priority research through RELCs, as well as for expanding the
       outsourcing of extension services to NGOs and private operators should be worked out.

    · Environmental risk to development outcome is substantial: Ghana agricultural
       growth is first and foremost natural resources based. Expansion of cropped areas may
       threaten the sustainability of the agricultural and ecological systems. Agricultural sector
       performance should be sustained through increased agricultural productivity. The
       revised sector policy places an emphasis on the improvement of agricultural
       productivity and the development of a sustainable land management strategy for
       agricultural lands.

    · Social risk to development outcome is low: AgSSIP has contributed to revamping the
       dynamics of farmer groups at the local level, and has played an instrumental role in
       mainstreaming gender in agricultural development, particularly with regards to
       extension services and agricultural education and training. In addition, under the WIAD
       leadership, HIV/IADS has been brought forward in the extension services agenda. It is
       likely that these achievements, built under clear governance and rules ad procedure to
       ensure equity, transparency and participatory control of public funds, would likely be
       sustained over the next coming years, following the country general trends towards
       more decentralization.

On the basis of these assessments, the overall risk to development outcome is rated as
moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Quality at entry is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

The AgSSIP featured prominently in the government's development strategy and the Bank's
CAS. Government of Ghana prepared a Vision 2020 document which called for alleviating



                                                30

poverty through strong and broad-based economic growth, especially of the agricultural sector.
Accordingly, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) prepared an accelerated
agricultural growth and development strategy (AAGDS). The AgSSIP was one of the major
instruments for implementing this strategy.

In preparing this operation, the Bank mobilized considerable financial and human resources. A
PPF was put in place and the Bank fielded a large 5 week pre-appraisal mission of thirteen
Bank and FAO staff and consultants that covered a wide area of technical expertise. However,
the AgSSIP had too many components and sub-components to be prepared in sufficient detail
(e.g. a project implementation manual was only prepared during implementation) and the
policy dialogue did not focus on a limited number of critical issues that needed to be addressed
realistically within the first phase of the project.

At appraisal, the capacity of MOFA and CSIR to manage such a complex project, especially
concerning financial management and procurement was overestimated. Only four years after
appraisal did an implementation support mission point out that the project lacked an
appropriate computerized administrative, accounting and financial management system.
Following the MTR recommendations, MOFA and CSIR appointed two financial controllers
and two procurement specialists, one of each focusing on the project financial management and
procurement related issues respectively. This helped improve MOFA and CSIR performance
on project fiduciary aspects, but it showed clearly that using country systems requires some
prerequisites in terms of capacity building. Also, use of computerized systems for accounting
and financial management has been hampered overall because the roll out of the Ministry of
Finance supported financial management software (BPEMS) has been so slow.

The moderately unsatisfactory rating reflects significant shortcomings in project preparation,
notably regarding the policy and institutional aspects and a lack of adequate assessment of the
implementing agencies' capacity to carry out properly project activities.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: moderately satisfactory

The Bank's initial reaction to project start-up delays was slow and inadequate. There was
insufficient recognition and admission that the new Government was not committed to the
original design of AgSSIP and that this would not change without reformulating the project so
as to incorporate the Government's concerns and priorities. The first several Project status
reports (PSRs) painted a picture as if the project startup was simply delayed. During this period,
dated legal covenants were not systematically addressed and enforced. Only the Project Status
Report of July 2003 gave for the first time an unsatisfactory project performance rating for
implementation progress. This was close to the original closing date of October 2003. By that
time, consideration should have been given to partial cancellation or profoundly restructuring
of the project.

While the supervision missions listed several critical risks, such as: inadequacy of counterpart
funds; government not committed to private sector participation; and political will lacking to
pass certain pieces of legislation, these risks were not closely followed and some were very
little commented upon in successive Project Status Reports.

However, project supervision improved considerably over time and the Bank's mid-term
review mission in June/July 2004 did an in-depth work in resuscitating the project through: (i)
simplifying and clarifying actions under the various original project components, and (ii)


                                                 31

incorporating the new initiatives that client was calling for. Furthermore, to reinforce the
Bank's support to accelerate project implementation, Bank enhanced staffing in the field with
two decentralized staff members, in addition to the team already in place, to work with the
Government's project team. Finally, the posting of the third and last TTL to the field in 2005
allowed for closer and swifter follow-up on project implementation issues and a better dialogue
on policy and institutional issues with GOG and donor partners. The strengthening of the task
team through the appointment of a new TTL, the transfer of task-management to the field and
considerably stepped-up utilization of supervision funds ((b) Table 13 in Annex 4) resulted in
better supervision of recommendations and close monitoring of action plans that came up out
of the MTR

The rating of Quality of Supervision derives from the assessment of Bank performance before
and after the medium term review (MTR) against the following criteria in table below, and
reflects an unsatisfactory rating before mid-term review, and a satisfactory rating thereafter.

Criteria                                            Before MTR           After MTR

Role in Ensuring Adequate Transition Arrangements   N.A                  S

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

The rating reflects an moderately unsatisfactory performance of the Bank in ensuring quality at
entry, a moderately satisfactory performance in supervision particularly around and after the
mid-term review, and a moderately satisfactory rating of the overall project outcome rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: moderately unsatisfactory.

The Government at the time of project preparation did everything necessary to prepare the
various components of AgSSIP. However, it underestimated the difficulties to undertake such a
complex program within the time frame agreed upon.

Significant shortcomings in Government's performance include no enactment or approval of a
number of laws and policies/strategies that have been prepared during project implementation,
such as the revised Cooperative Bill, the Quarantine and Seeds Bills, the Agricultural and
Education Policy, and the Irrigation Policy and Strategy. While most of these delays have been
attributed to excessive time taken at political executive levels, the revision of FASDEP
provides a new collaborative environment with a renewed Government's commitment to
accelerate the reform agenda. As a follow up operation to the AgSSIP I, the DPL would a
suitable instrument to implement the reforms in collaboration with other donors.


                                                 32

The new Government should have been more assertive vis-à-vis the Bank and insisted on an
immediate redesign of the project, including a formal review of the institutional and policy
reforms agreed to by the previous administration. In the absence of this initial redesign, until
the time of the mid-term review, the Government did not demonstrate strong commitment in
taking action towards implementing the initially agreed upon institutional reform measures.

However, it is noted that important changes took place once the New Initiatives were included,
including Government's effort in budgeting and releasing appropriate counterpart funding up
to the initial amount agreed on during preparation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

The Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Department (PPMED) of MOFA was
initially ill prepared and not equipped to handle the administrative management of AgSSIP,
especially the financial management and procurement aspects. Its management structure also
faced difficulties in coordinating several technical implementing agencies and in ensuring
coherence of the overall program. Project management was supposed to be mainstreamed but
turned out as an unclear hybrid between discrete project type Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
and mainstream management. PPMED did not ensure consistency between budget allocations
to technical Departments and their work programs under AgSSIP. The role of director PPMED
and the AgSSIP coordinator was further separated, but no clear responsibility has been defined
for the two positions in the management of AgSSIP.

The AgSSIP Coordination Office was initially cautious in releasing funds. The directorates had
also not been responsive in submitting timely returns of accounts for the funds advanced to
them. The AgSSIP advisory and technical steering committees did not meet regularly and
could not provide guidance to program implementation as designed.

Until the mid-term review, (i) the project was plagued by a lack of communication both
internal and external, and was poorly understood even by the main stakeholders like MOFA's
Directorates; and (ii) program implementation suffered from a lack of leadership, as the
AgSSIP Coordinator had other duties that prevented him from working full time on the
program. Also, certain Departments of MOFA were less than enthusiastic about devolving
functions to the private sector (case of private sector participation in clinical veterinary services,
which was later dropped).

However, after the mid-term review and with renewed government commitment and measures
to strengthen PPMEDs management capacity, performance improved considerably. Financial
management and procurement capacity building was provided, monitoring and evaluation was
emphasized and PPMED's role as coordinator and facilitator of project activities was
emphasized. As a result, key directorates of the Ministry ­ such as the crops division ­
developed clearly defined roles in project implementation with clear reporting mechanisms to
allow PPMED to monitor progress under the project. The statistics directorate also improved
coordination with PPMED so that data collection and analysis started to become more
complementary.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

On the basis of the assessment of government and the implementing agencies performances,
which basically was unsatisfactory prior to the MTR, and then improved tremendously towards



                                                 33

the project closure, and given the overall outcome rating, the overall Borrower performance is
rated as moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Among the major lessons to be drawn from the implementation and outcome of this operation
are the following:

Combining in one operation: (i) investment lending for a very large number of activities; (ii)
a broad institutional reform agenda concerning several centralized and decentralized
organizations; and (iii) policy reforms require thorough preparation and borrower's ownership.
Institutional and policy reforms should not be folded into investment operations, unless
strongly called for by the client. In such case, project preparation and reforms to be undertaken
should be backed with strong economic and sector works, and timing both for preparation and
implementation of agreed reforms measures should be worked out before project approval..

Project management Unit vs mainstreamed project management: The initial decision that
project implementation should the mainstreamed within MOFA, under the responsibility of
PPMED, although appropriate, was problematic. It overestimated the capacity of PPMED to
deal with the fiduciary standards associated with Bank operations. Mainstreaming requires
explicit attention to capacity issues and organizational aspects within the ministries, in order to
ensure a successful shift-over from project mode to program mode. Therefore, capacity
building for and technical assistance to implementing agencies should be conceived as a
process that needs to be adequately supported through the project rather than as a one time
decision.

Project timeframe: For complex APLs with heavy emphasis on institutional reforms, a
multitude of executing agencies and where expenditures are spread geographically all over the
country, the first phase should not be less than 5 years. Basic project management issues such
as accounting, financial management, procurement and interagency coordination and flow of
funds between the national level and the field need to be addressed especially carefully as they
are likely to dictate the pace of project execution.

Accelerating mid-term reviews when governments have changed: For a major sub-sector
loan with several distinct policy orientations and institutional reform objectives, the election
cycle must be taken into account in establishing the time line for the different steps in loan
processing (Board presentation and effectiveness) and the expected time for implementation.
Also, once a newly elected Government asks for important changes in a recently approved
project, an advanced mid-term review should be considered.

Clearly separate sector performances from project M&E system: In a major sub-sector
agricultural loan, more attention from the beginning needs to be given to the state of
agricultural statistics and the state of sector-wide monitoring and evaluation systems. There is a
need to clearly distinguish between broad sectoral performances indicators, and to focus on
more limited indicators that allow tracking of effectiveness of project interventions. The
tendency to ask for ever more elaborate monitoring and evaluation systems should be resisted,
as they risk becoming too expensive to be sustainable.

Donor coordination and parallel financing: Although ultimately donor coordination is the
borrowers responsibility, in this kind of operation where success is to a certain extent
predicated on better donor coordination, specific mechanisms for collaboration, including


                                                 34

process mechanisms, procedures, and leadership arrangements should be explicitly and
formally discussed and agreed upon by donor representatives in the field as well as their
headquarters at the outset of the project. In addition, securing availability of other sources of
funds during project preparation is critical for ensuring the coherence and integrity of the
overall financing plan. Otherwise the program cost and design should be adjusted accordingly
before IDA approval.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1: Technology Generation and Diffusion.

Achievements under this component are rated moderately satisfactory.

For the subcomponent Agricultural Research Development, key performance indicators were
as follows: (a) The competitive agricultural research grant scheme (CARGS) is initiated and
operating effectively, and 75% of ongoing projects have satisfactory rating, (b) Participation
of farmer representatives in priority setting of adaptive research through Research-Extension
Linkages Committees (RELCs) in 10 regions, and (c) At least 15 priority research projects
completed with 75% satisfactory rating from a clientele point of view.

All three performance indicators have been met. The CSIR agricultural research system
generated 67 technologies out of a total of 193 research project during the period 2001-20064.
Under the CARGS initiated with AgSSIP, CSIR has developed an agreed upon manual of
procedures. Out of the 28 CARGS projects contracted out to scientists since 2003 fifteen were
completed and scored satisfactory rating during project review meetings by research clientele.
Three have generated technologies suitable for dissemination to farmers while the results of the
rest are yet to be validated. 2nd round of CARGS employed RELCs to identify research
priorities.

Research Extension Linkages Committees (RELCS) have been established early 2003 in all
regions. The CARGS second round of call for proposals used RELCs for identification of
farmers' problem, which led to the approval of 13 research projects from 7 regions
implemented with CARGS funds. The remaining regions are being catered for by GTZ-
supported FARMER Project.

Concerning the third performance indicator, 15 research projects (11 from the 1rst round and 5
from the 2nd round) were completed. More than 75% are rated satisfactory. Also, the
management information system (MIS) is producing timely information for research program
management and evaluation. A database has been created using INFORM software to capture
and provide easy access to information on all on-going research projects and technologies
generated. Finally, participation of research clientele on the boards has been increased.

The subcomponent is rated moderately satisfactory, because of some remaining longer-term
sustainability and effectiveness issues.     So far, the project has had limited success in
mobilizing co-financing from the private sector and other stakeholders. Most adaptive research
programs do not enjoy 15 percent support from other stakeholders. Only 4 projects are being
co­funded directly by non-research organizations. Also, as presently conducted, the RELC
process is costly. It has had limited influence on the research agenda, due to limited
participation of end users, and inadequate allocation of operating budgets for meeting RELCs
expenditures and the perception in the research system that demand-driven research is to be
limited only to funding made available under CARGS. Also, rehabilitations of labs under CSIR
suffered from weaknesses in procurement that further delayed achievement of the project
outcomes.

The subcomponent Agricultural Extension and Technology Diffusion is rated as
moderately satisfactory. It has largely fulfilled the two performance indicators that were
established, namely: (a) setting up of an extension development fund in each of the 15 pilot
districts and 75% of on-going contracts having satisfactory ratings, and (b) production of
improved planting material increased on average by 40% in horticultural crops and oil palm. In
addition, significant activities have been undertaken to mainstream gender in extension
services programs, and capacity has been built within the Ministry of Agricultural to that aim,
under the leadership of the newly created Directorate for Women in Agricultural Development
(WIAD).

Concerning the first indicator, the extension development fund is established and operating
effectively and 75% of ongoing contracts have satisfactory rating in their operations in 8 pilot
districts covering 272 farm communities and 8,130 farmers. Concerning the second indicator,
3,300,000 plantlets of MD2 (new pineapple variety) sourced from 2 local tissue culture labs
and distributed to 75 small holder farmer groups (900 farmers) which have established
nurseries. It is expected at the end of the multiplication process in December 2009, a
production of 23,000 Mt of fruits. Oil Palm Research Institute (OPRI) seedlings production
capacity has been increased fivefold from 1 million to 5 million units. OPRI has supplied
870,000 seedlings to the nurseries, as AgSSIP contribution to the Presidential Special Initiative
(PSI).

Moreover, Agricultural services have been decentralized to the districts and district assembly
(DA) members and farmers have been participating in extension program planning and
implementation supervision through DA committees. For monitoring of extension activities, a
new structure has been put in place at the district level. In addition, a national policy on


                                                38

extension was formulated, published and distributed to all stakeholders. Furthermore, the
Women in Agricultural Development Directorate (WIAD) of MOFA took a leading role in
mainstreaming gender in extension activities. Extension agents were trained in incorporating
HIV/AIDS prevention in extension messages, and workplace HIV/AIDS committees were
established in all districts and regions. Also, the extension services collaborated closely with
the research system in carrying out RELC activities.

However, the movement towards a more pluralistic extension delivery system needs to be
accelerated and developed at affordable costs. To that end, public sector extension needs to be
resuscitated and made more professional as the great majority of farming communities,
especially smallholders, will continue to depend on it for advisory services in the foreseeable
future. Also, the ongoing decentralization process will affect agricultural extension delivery in
a major way. Once completed, agricultural extension at the local level will have become the
full responsibility of District Assemblies, including the management of extension personnel.
This will need a careful redefinition of the roles and responsibilities for planning, funding,
training and certification of extension agents of extension between the national, regional and
district level. Appropriate adjustments to this new situation still need to be made and will be
crucial for the future functioning of Ghana's agricultural knowledge and information system
(AKIS).

On the basis of the above assessment, the overall achievement under the agricultural extension
subcomponent is rated as moderately satisfactory.

Component 2: Institutional Reform and Strengthening of MOFA

Achievements under this component are rated as unsatisfactory.

The three performance indicators for this component agreed upon during the mid-term review
were as follows: (a) 10 district annual agricultural services and development plans produced
and implemented, (b) functional review of MOFA and decentralization of activities
implemented by December 31, 2005, and (c) Revised Fisheries Bill enacted by Parliament by
October 31, 2002.

Ten district specific agricultural development plans along with M&E plans were developed on
a pilot basis. Although all district level agricultural directorates prepare plans to feed into the
expenditure framework for the Ministry, MOFA was not able to implement them beyond the
10 selected districts in part due to the slow decentralization process. Government, together with
EU, GTZ and CIDA, is reviewing how to go about developing these district specific
agricultural development plans so that the costs are sustainable and fully compliant with
district level planning. Therefore this indicator is considered partially achieved.

Concerning the second indicators, a comprehensive organizational and structural management
review of MOFA has not been undertaken. Nevertheless, following the GOG decentralization
policy, there have been substantial changes at the district level with regards to ways under
which activities are planned, budgeted and implemented with increased stakeholder
participation. The institutional review is being carried out as part of the preparation of the
follow up operation. Also, most of the activities for institutional capacity building for MOFA's
directorates have been executed as planned. Especially the training of staff to perform their
core functions (policy formulation, planning and coordination, monitoring and evaluation) has
been undertaken. Decentralization has already significantly impacted the workings of district
directorates and MOFA is the most deconcentrated Ministry of the Government. The GOG has



                                                39

only just initiated a composite budget at the district level and this will allow MOFA to devolve
functions and budgets further than it has already done. This indicator is also assessed as
partially achieved.

The third indicator was met, as the Government has enacted the Fishery Bill. In addition the
Government has drafted and/or enacted a number of other Bills and initiated some policy
reforms. These include the enactment of the revised fisheries bill, the preparation of the
Cooperative and NGO bills, the preparation of quarantine and seed bills, and the development
of a sector M&E framework. The irrigation draft policy is under consideration at the Cabinet,
and the Fisheries Act has been operationalized through the creation of a new Ministry of
Fisheries and the formation of a Fisheries Commission. However, little progress has been made
in the Livestock sub-sector reforms and for the co-financing by stakeholders of adaptive
research for commercial crops and livestock. More importantly, a number of laws and
policies/strategies that have been prepared a long time ago, such as the revised Cooperative
Bill, the Quarantine and Seeds Bills, Agricultural and Education Policy have not been adopted.
Most of these delays can be attributed to excessive time taken at the political executive level in
presenting legislative measures to the Cabinet and Parliament.

In spite of important achievements reached at project closing with regards to the revised
performance indicators, the component is rated unsatisfactory because of the delays and
change in Government commitment in implementing some important policy reforms that were
part of the original project design.

Component 3: Development of Farmer-Based Organizations

Achievements under this component are rated satisfactory.

The three performance indicators for this component were as follows: (a) establishment of
Board of Trustees (BOT) for managing the FBO Development Fund with MOFA to serve as
secretariat of the Board; (b) auditing services of cooperatives undertaken by Ghana
Cooperative Council (GCC) in two pilot regions and plan to expand into the remaining 8
regions prepared by December 30, 2005; and (c) establishment of 3 viable and operating
industry/farmer owned companies to operate export infrastructure. The component also hosted
new activities at the mid-term review and clustered under the New Initiatives, and benefited
consequently from a substantial reallocation of the credit proceeds.

Concerning the first indicator, the BOT was established with a FBO secretariat embedded in
MOFA's Directorate of Extension. The Board is fully operational and has held on an average
four meetings annually. The FBO component is working well. About 1,300 FBO executives
have received training in Group Dynamics and Development, Business Management, Financial
Management and Savings and Credit Management.

In addition all activities under the establishment of an FBO Development Fund (FBODF)
subcomponent have been satisfactorily completed, and targets met or exceeded as documented
in the FBODF Evaluation and Impact Assessment Study report (see summary in Annex 8).
FBODF governance structure is appropriately established across the 10 regions. 326 FBOs
were supported for several training and economic activities -mostly for value addition- and
these enterprises have helped farmers to raise their incomes.

As for education and training of FBO leaders, most planned activities have been accomplished,
though expectation in respect of the Cooperative College is only partially fulfilled. About 1,300
FBO executives have received training in Group Dynamics and Development, Business


                                               40

Management, Financial Management and Savings and Credit Management. In addition all
activities under the establishment of an FBO Development Fund (FBODF) subcomponent have
been satisfactorily completed, and targets met or exceeded. FBODF governance structure is
appropriately established across the 10 regions. 326 FBOs were supported for several training
and economic activities (mostly for value addition) and these enterprises have helped farmers
to raise their incomes. A survey carried out by CIDA and the FBO Secretariat, found that, of
the enterprises established under FBODF grant            85% are operating satisfactorily. A
comprehensive evaluation and beneficiary assessment has been carried out and key findings
are summarized in Annex 5.

Other activities related to building capacity for agencies promoting FBOs, have been fully
implemented. This sub component provided for the strengthening of the NGO unit in the
Ministry of Youth and Employment, strengthening the department of cooperatives, and
establishment of NGO database and publishing a directory. The NGO directory is also
available on the FBO website. Two thirds of the district cooperative officers and some staff of
NGO unit were provided training using 5 training manuals prepared by the Department of
Cooperatives with AgSSIP support.

Concerning the Ghana Cooperative Council, it has taken over audit in 10 pilot districts, and has
prepared a plan for extending its audit function to the remaining districts of the country. This
plan has been submitted to the MOFA.

Finally, the third indicator was not fully met. Agreement was reached between the Bank and
GOG during the ISM of October 2005 to concentrate available resources of this component on
the construction of 1 facility (the Shed 9) instead of three as initially planned (including
Kotoka Airport Perishable Freight Handling and Field Packing houses). A study for the
management of the facility was carried out which provided recommendations regarding options
for O&M of the Shed 9.

FBOs were supported under the original project, and the MTR also put greater emphasis on
getting results. Furthermore many activities FBOs are engaged in are profit making (according
to the assessment) so they may well continue to flourish. The follow up operation might also
pay attention to the continuation FBODF as called for in the FASDEP II, which recognizes it
as a good instrument to provide organizational and business skills to the farmers.

New Initiatives
As agreed at the project mid-term review in 2004, a new cluster of activities titled `New
Initiatives' was included. These initiatives were related to: (i) Horticultural Export Industry
Initiative (HEII); (ii) Development of Palm Oil Industry; (iii) Rehabilitation of Irrigation
Schemes; and (iv) Community Fisheries Infrastructure Development. Implementation under
this new component is uneven with almost all activities planned for HEII completed, or near to
be so, while for fisheries, even the design studies have not been completed.

Ghana's horticulture industry is private sector driven. More than 80 percent of the sector's
entrepreneurs own small to medium sized businesses. While horticulture growth has been
driven by pineapples, it includes: pawpaw, soybeans, eggplants, banana, mangoes, capsicum,
dried apricots, oranges, spinach, beans, tomatoes, berries, avocadoes and sweet potatoes. Sales
to Europe of Asian vegetables have also increased the unit value of air freighted exports while
fresh produce processing (fresh-cut fruits and juices) and fresh produce sales in local and
regional markets have also picked up. Under the Agricultural Services Sub-sector

Investment Program (AgSSIP), the Horticulture Exports Industry Initiative (HEII)
supports the development of Ghana's Horticulture Export Industry. The initiative took the
approach of developing public private partnerships and enabling small holders to access
improved technologies in order to facilitate market integration and develop Ghana's
competitive edge in export markets.

Box 2: Developing other markets: Mango on the rise
A certification scheme for accessing high quality planting Satisfactory progress has also been made
materials of mango, citrus and pineapple coupled with      under horticulture expansion activities :

been created.
                                                           Other activities performed under HEII
included rehabilitation of a cold store in Team, diversification and pesticide residue trials,
knowledge sharing and dissemination, setting up a web-based out growers mapping, and
developing successful market linkages between small out-growers and an agribusiness
company for the collection and marketing of mango fruits in Tamale (see Box 2). The project
also supported Ghana Standards Board to procure and install equipment for a pesticide residue
analysis laboratory

Upgrading the Cold chain: The project supported the rehabilitation of a cold storage facility at
Tema Port (Shed 9). The facility is to support improvements in fruit quality and an increased
market share, with the potential for the industry to reach a capacity of 300,000 tons by 2010.
Upgraded Shed 9 into a modern Fruit Terminal fitted with cold storage installation and a
double stacking system is expected to increase the holding capacity of the facility from about
1200mt to about 2200mt..The Shed is the exit point of the cold chain for fruits. Support for
improved agricultural technology, access to rural finance and improved tenure security;
development of public-private partnerships to build trust, improve food safety/quality, promote
investments and coordinated support for addressing transport/infrastructure constraints are
elements of a focused strategy to regain market share in horticulture.

Addressing Food Safety standards: A harmonized pesticide list, to guide pesticide usage in
line with international standards, has been published by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Ghana Standards Board laboratory has been upgraded for ISO 17025 certification. Farmers
are being trained in Good Agricultural Practices and, in collaboration with GTZ and TIPCEE,
being trained to meet EurepGap (Euro-retailer Produce Working Group for Good Agricultural
Practice) certification requirements which are expected to offer smallholders better access to
the European market.

Public/private collaborative research has been facilitated by the Public/Private Research
Committee and a Geographic Information System (GIS) Database Management System has
been established to provide reliable and accessible data for production planning.



                                                      42

Implementation of the HEII has also promoted collaboration between development partners,
public sector and the industry, and has served as a model for other programmes. The AfDB's
Export Marketing and Quality Awareness Programme (EMQAP); Millennium Challenge
Account (MCA) Programme and USAID's Trade and Investment Programme for Competitive
Export Economy (TIPCEE) have drawn lessons from the HEII and the public-private
partnership approach.

Under the New Initiatives, AgSSIP also supported the Oil Palm Research Institute (OPRI)
as part of the Presidential Special Initiative (PSI) to develop the palm oil industry. To that end,
a new seed store facility has been constructed and some OPRI premises have been rehabilitated.
However, rehabilitation of labs delayed and was only completed towards the project closure,
due to procurement shortcomings under CSIR. Under the project, the OPRI distributed 828,800
seedlings to 152 FBOs developed around 12 "PSI-Oil palm nurseries" in 8 districts, which
resulted in an area of 5,180 ha being planted with improved materials. Overall, about 300
FBOs are currently operating in 56 districts that have planted 13,771 ha under the PSI.

Rehabilitation of 9 irrigation schemes was initially estimated to cost Cedis55 billion for 9
schemes selected in September 2005. The funding provided under AgSSIP could cover only
43% (4 schemes), while 57% of the cost were covered by CIDA (5 schemes). Works for 9
irrigation schemes were completed, and three schemes -namely Bontanga in the Northern
Region, and Afife and Kpando in the Volta Region- have started cropping activities.

A Cost benefit analysis conducted in August 2007 for these three schemes revealed positive net
returns for all production systems (rice, vegetables or combined) even though average yield is
below initial targets. On average, recovery of irrigation service charges is low at 60% and may
pose concerns regarding the sustainability of the rehabilitation. The new irrigation policy
however emphasizes increased management of the sites by water user associations.

Progress under the Community Fisheries Infrastructure Development is insignificant. The
proposed cost for the feasibility studies for six fish landing sites and the rehabilitation of two
hatcheries exceeded by far the budget allocated for it, and therefore the studies could not be
undertaken.

A number of interesting developments have taken place as a result of the lead taken by the
Ministry in supporting non-traditional export commodities. The Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC) has made agricultural development, and especially horticulture, a key
element of its program. It has based its analysis of the potential of this industry in large part on
the HEII experience, the fact that a key cold chain infrastructure has been completed (Shed 9)
and private sector participation has improved. HEII has had a strong impact on the horticulture
industry and has served as a model for other programmes. Plans developed for additional
infrastructure such as the Kotoka Airport Perishable Freight Handling and Field Packing
houses) have been made available to the Millennium Development Authory (MiDA) which
plans to construct these structures. The AfDB's Export Marketing and Quality Awareness
Programme (EMQAP); Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) programme and USAID's
Trade and Investment Programme for Competitive Export Economy (TIPCEE) have drawn
lessons from the HEII and the public-private partnership approach.

The oil palm industry has also taken off with IFC providing a US$12.5 million loan to Ghana
Oil Palm Development Corporation to support (i) its planting of oil palm trees on its existing
plantation in Kwae and new plantation at Okumaning, (ii) increasing oil store capacity and
improving infrastructure, (iii) refinancing of a loan used to fund new plant (refinery, boilers,


                                                 43

turbines) and (iv) working capital. This will be IFC's first major investment in Ghana's
agribusiness sector.

Component 4: Strengthening Agricultural Education and Training

Achievements under this component are rated satisfactory.

The performance indicators for this component were as follows: (a) agricultural education
policy reviewed by December 31, 2003; (b) curricula of agricultural colleges and farm
institutes revised and improved to cater to needs of private sector; and (c) infrastructure of
agricultural colleges and farm institutes rehabilitated.

The education policy review was completed and the policy was finalized before the deadline.
Indicator two was also achieved. Curricula of agricultural colleges and farm institutes have
been reviewed and MOFA was planning to make it operational with the commencement of the
Diploma program in the Agricultural Colleges in year 2007. Concerning the third indicator,
achievement is partial. Rehabilitation works were at various stages of completion at the time of
the ICR mission.

Most noticeable under this component is the increase in female enrollment from 10% in 2004
to 27% in 2006. AgSSIP also provided resources for training and upgrading of the skills of
2,496 instructors, from which 1,815 were enrolled in short courses, 306 received diplomas, 241
graduated as BSc. and 134 with Masters Degrees. Also, the Cooperative College has also
trained FBO executives. As mentioned earlier, about 1,300 farmers (male and female) were
trained. Both the training content and teaching methods are appropriate for these adults who
often are in a classroom situation for the first time in their lives. The setting allows these
farmer leaders to network and to learn technical skills in addition to group dynamics and
lobbying.

Project Coordination, Management and M&E

There was no separate component for these activities which were folded into Component I for
CSIR and component II for MOFA.

Project Coordination and M&E

Following the evaluation of M&E activities of MOFA carried out in 2002, the Ministry has
established a monitoring framework for the sector and MOFA's programs with the technical
assistance of the EU. The draft framework has been discussed with selected district and
regional staff. The draft performance matrix has been circulated to development partners for
comment. Reporting guidelines for quarterly and annual reports have been established and the
2006 annual report will be compiled using the new template. A significant effort through 2006
has been made to implement the M&E framework and PPMED got technical assistance from
EU starting June 2006 to that aim. This resulted in obtaining more information from the field
and allowed better documenting of sector performance. However the tendency of using staff
exclusively for M&E activities in the field could lead to high costs and disinterest of other
technical staff in participating in the M&E system.

Financial Management

Disbursement Status and Project Financing: The total amount of the credit no. IDA 34050-GH
(SDR 50.9 million, equivalent to USD 78.8 million) was disbursed at project closing date. The




                                                44

government released an amount equivalent to $10.11 million as counterpart funds, fulfilling
72% of its initial commitment of $14 Million at project preparation.

Audit: audits of the project were carried out on a regular basis and audit reports submitted on
or before the deadline of June 30 of each year. The MOFA also submitted on a regular basis
the project Financial and Management Reports (FMRs), which are usually consistent with
Bank disbursement data.

Procurement

The procurement function was managed at the central and directorate levels. Procurement
during the life of the project faced a number of constraints notably: inadequate capacity at the
directorates to prepare detailed technical specifications of their needs; submitted technical
specifications sometimes turn out to be for obsolete items - this sometimes becomes known
during the bidding process leading to extended bidding processes; difficulty in drafting of
terms of reference for technical assistance and other consultancy assignments; inadequate
capacity at the Procurement Section of the coordination unit at the beginning of the project -
though this was later addressed by assigning two officers to the unit; weak capacity at the
decentralized levels to manage procurement.

Under the CSIR component, costs were grossly underestimated leading to category overruns.
The Bank's directive to reduce the scope of contracts under execution (possibly instead of
effecting reallocation) and later restoring these same contracts to their original scope further
compounded the contract management crisis and led to serious cost overruns and delayed
contract execution.

Overall, project management and coordination within MOFA, including for procurement, had
improved considerably by project closure. This can be considered as an important achievement
of AgSSIP in term of capacity for mainstreaming the project's activities within the
PPMD/MOFA, as it moves toward a SWAP. Effort should be pursued at the decentralized
levels however, so as to carry out the procurement and financial management functions
irrespective of the funding source.

In spite of these achievements mostly reached during the last two years of the project life, the
overall achievement under the Project Management, Coordination and Monitoring is rated as
moderately satisfactory, as initial arrangements for project coordination and limited capacity
for handling procurement procedures negatively impacted project implementation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Sector Performance

The economic justification for AgSSIP at appraisal was based on break-even analysis on
the basis that the sector-wide nature of the project made it impossible to quantify rates of
return. On this basis, AgSSIP was expected to break-even if incremental growth rates in
agricultural GDP (AgGDP) were 0.14 ­ 0.15 percentage points higher than the without-
project scenario (see table in Appendix). Assuming the pre-project growth rates of 3.9%
per annum (p.a.) as the counterfactual, observed growth rates of 5.5% p.a. over 2001 ­
2006 demonstrate that the break-even incremental growth rate has been exceeded (Table 8).

There is no analytical evidence as to what extent can this be attributable to project
interventions, particularly given the re-focusing at mid-term review. However, a
breakdown of the sector performance shows that those areas of Ghana's agricultural
economy supported by AgSSIP ­ primarily crops, which accounting for 68% of the
agricultural value-added and excluding cocoa and fishing ­ also expanded at a significantly
higher rate during project period and was a major driver of total agricultural growth.
Agriculture remains a key driver of overall economic performance, and performance in the
crops sector is a key factor (although the cocoa sector has become a major driver in recent
years because of high global prices and Cote d'Ivoire Crisis).

According to analysis reported in the recent CEM (2007), improvements in total factor
productivity (TFP) accounts for 60% of agricultural growth in the project period.5 The
contribution of labor participation and fixed capital accumulation has reduced compared to
the pre-project period. Although high commodity prices for cocoa have played a part. TFP
growth is attributed primarily to endogenous factors of increasing agricultural production
(Table 9).

Aggregate production of key crops has been impressive, with the main cash crops (maize,
rice, millet, sorghum, cassava, cocoyam, plantain, groundnut, cowpea and soybean and
yam) increasing by 21.6% during the 2001 ­ 2006 period as compared to the year 2000, in
excess of the target 10% increase. With demographic growth of 2.7% p.a., per capita

production has increased by 5.4% during the period (equivalent to a per capita increase of
0.9% p.a.) thereby contributing to improved food security and increased incomes to
farmers.

Land and Labor Productivity

As reported elsewhere, area expansion was the primary driver of increased production,
with yield improvement playing a smaller role. Over the period 2000 ­ 2006, the area
planted to cassava increased by 20%, with growth also in yam (25%) plantain (23%) maize
(14% and sorghum (11%). In aggregate, increase in agricultural production resulted from a
5.3% yield improvement and a 26.3% increase in cropped areas.. Comparing annual yields
in 2000 and 2006 suggests some increases in land productivity, in particular for millet
(23%), plantain (22%), soybean (20%), groundnut (12%) and maize (9%). Aggregate data
that account for annual seasonal variations suggest more modest changes and have not met
AgSSIP targets (Table 10).

Increased output albeit driven by expansion rather than yield growth, has fed through to
increases in labor productivity. According to aggregate FAO data, the average value added
per agricultural worker has increased from 229,000 Cedis in 2000 to 248,000 Cedis in
2003 (constant 1993 prices) ­ equivalent to a real increase of 8% over 4 years.

Non-Traditional Agricultural Exports

After restructuring, a greater emphasis was placed on non-traditional agricultural exports
under the HEII initiative. At appraisal, economic rates of return were estimated (see Table
11). Data is not available to update this assessment. However, there is ample evidence that
the economic impact of the HEII under the restructured AgSSIP is substantial.

According to Government statistics, the total number of non-traditional agricultural
products being exports has increased from 77 in 2000 to 209 in 2004.6 Diversification
appears to have contributed to increase exports overall with the aggregate value of (non-
traditional) agro-exports having increased from an average of $81.2 million in the three
years period ending 2000 to $159.8 million in 2004. Horticultural exports have increased
from $28million in 2000 to $76million in 20067. Small-holders and medium-sized farmers
make-up over 80% of Ghana's horticultural industry. By assisting in the transition to MD2
varieties, AgSSIP has helped small-holders in particular to maintain market share and has
reversed the price discounts suffered by exports of the less popular variety (Figure 2).

Economic Versus Financial Impacts

An important consideration in the economic (rather than a financial) assessment of AgSSIP
is the true resource cost of economic performance. Cropland accounts for 64% of Ghana's
natural capital (even though only 18% of agricultural land is under cultivation) and
expansive agriculture is associated with land degradation (from soil erosion and nutrient
depletion). Previous estimates cost these effects at between 2.9% ­ 6.3% of agGDP8 and to
the extent that AgSSIP activities have reduced the negative environmental impacts of farm
practices (for instance, through improved agricultural technology generation and diffusion)
the (improved) macroeconomic indicators will under-report the true economic impact of
project interventions.




6This substantial increase appears to be very recent: the number remained between 68 and 82 from 1997 ­
2003 with the big increase only in 2004.

Poverty Impacts

Drawing on data from two living standards surveys conducted in 1998/99 and 2004/05
shows the rapid poverty reduction commensurate with impressive growth figures reported
above. The national poverty headcount has fallen from 39.5% to 28.5% over the period.
Disaggregate poverty rates across economic activity shows that while agricultural
households continue to lag behind (it has the highest rates of all occupations and poverty is
increasingly a food-crop farmer phenomenon) poverty among (current) food crop farmers
has fallen from 59% to 45% with respective figures for export crop farmers of 39% and
24%. Poverty reduction in the agricultural sector is helping ensure Ghana is on-track in
achieving the MDG target of reducing poverty by half by 2015.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(Prepared by Bank staff based on Borrowers" Implementation Completion Report of January 2007).

AgSSIP commissioned two studies: 1) a general beneficiary assessment and 2) a specific
evaluation of the Farmer-Based Organizations Development Fund (FBODF), i.e.
component III of the project.

1) Beneficiary Assessment

The beneficiary assessment consisted of interviewing representatives of the different
agencies involved in carrying out the project. It was designed as a qualitative survey and
no statistical analysis was carried out. Overall, the assessment was positive.

Emerging Issues and Recommendations

The critical issues that emerged from the assessment from beneficiaries' point of view as
well as consultants' analysis were as follows:

     · The critical role of extension support in agricultural development cannot be
          underestimated and thus require maximum assistance for enhancing service
          delivery.

     · Linkages among research, extension and farmers need to be made effective with
          financial support and effective co-ordination mechanisms at all levels of the
          system that is from district to national level.

     · With yield and productivity of the farmer increasing, there is the urgent need to
          address the issue of low prices and poor marketing of farm produce.

     · The role of FBOs in value addition to farm produce is having some multiplier
          effect on the local economies and thus requires to be adequately supported by
          liaising with other national programmes and agencies including NGOs and private
          sector operators.

     · Programme management has not been satisfactory from beneficiaries' point of
          view and thus needs to be a priority issue to be addressed. Critical areas to be
          addressed are co-ordination of activities and feedback, systems for M&E and
          procurement of goods and services.

Considerations for the follow up operation

In view of the above the following are outlined for consideration in designing the second
phase of AgSSIP:

     · Adoption of alternative approaches to reforms in MOFA;
     · Strengthening program management structures and systems;
     · Strengthening extension and research linkages;

     · Inclusion of Agro-processing;
     · Enhanced support to FBOs and strengthening of the FBO Development Fund;

     · Improving infrastructure and equipment base for agricultural development.




                                                 58

2) Evaluation and impact study of the farmer-based organisations development fund.

The evaluation reviewed the extent of achievement of objectives, outcomes and triggers as
defined under the project framework, while the impact assessment reviewed impacts of the
fund's interventions on agricultural production and livelihoods of the beneficiary FBOs,
the individual members and their communities.

Key Findings

The findings revealed that significant progress had been made in the establishment and
functioning of the fund as well as the operational performance of the projects of the
beneficiary FBOs. The support to FBO projects had yielded significant impact on the
livelihoods of the FBOs, their members and the communities in which they operated.

Challenges

The key challenges identified include poor performance of some service providers,
ineffective leadership, inadequate understanding and appreciation of the dynamics of
FBOs' functioning by some FBOs, inadequate working capital, as well as unfavorable
trade policies of the government.

Recommendations

Key recommendations from this study include the need for continuous capacity building to
address operational challenges, enhancing leadership and members' commitment and
encouraging the FBOs and District Unions to develop business plans to guide their
operations. Others are the need to ensure that only FBOs that are solidly on the ground are
supported, the provision of integrated support to the FBOs, blacklisting non-performing
service providers and revisiting the unfavorable government trade policy on agricultural
development.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
A stakeholder workshop has not been organized. However, a joint final implementation
support and completion    mission which involved World Bank Team, implementing
agencies and, CIDA, EU and participating NGOs was carried out in February 2007. Joint
working groups have been formed whose technical reports served to prepare a join mission
aide memoir. The document and its annexes was use as the basis for elaborating the ICR.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

(Prepared by Bank staff based on Borrowers" Implementation Completion Report of January 2007).

1. Summary of Borrower's project completion report

Project context, development objectives and design

Context at appraisal

The Agricultural Sub-Sector Investment Program (AgSSIP) was the major instrument for
implementing the strategy of the Government of Ghana (GOG) for accelerated agricultural
growth and rural development (AAGDS) at the end of the 1990s. GOG intended to
increase the pace of the sector's growth from the annual average rate of 3-4% (1995-1999)
to 5-6% in support of attaining the goals set in the Vision 2020 program of social and
economic development.

AgSSIP was an attempt to move away from stand-alone project type to an integrated
system that encompasses all public and private investments in the agricultural sector. Until
now, GOG had been undertaking reform and investment programs in the agricultural sector
on the basis of individual projects, many of which were spatially, temporally and/or donor
restricted. This was rejected in favor of a program sector wide approach. Under the
AgSSIP, Project Management has been mainstreamed within the Ministry of Food and
Agriculture (MOFA) to eliminate the wastage, duplication and fragmentation of
Government's development efforts.

Benefits and target population

The AgSSIP was expected to benefit the general rural population, particularly women
farmers, traders and food processors through:

    · Supporting technological change and innovation in crop, livestock. fishery, forestry
        production and in agro-processing thereby improving returns to all production
        factors, including land and labor; and

    · Strengthening producer organization such as cooperatives and farmer groups. Such
        strengthening will lead to provision of better services to members of such groups
        and will lead to facilitating technology adoption, by improving access to inputs and
        facilitating marketing. This approach would also benefit rural women who make
        up over 60% of the farming population. Increased incomes accruing to such
        women will improve household food security and well being.

Project Description

Project components were as follows:
    (a) Reforming and strengthening the agricultural technology generation and diffusion
         systems
    (b) Institutional reform ­ Restructuring and strengthening of Ministry of Food and
         Agriculture


                                                 61

    (c) Development of Farmer-Based Organizations
    (d) Strengthening Agricultural Education and Training

After a joint GOG/IDA mid term review of the program in June 2004 with the participation
of the development partners active in the agricultural sector, funds were reallocated for the
funding of new initiatives. The new activities of the restructured AgSSIP were:
    · Development of Horticulture Export Industry;
    · Rehabilitation of Irrigation Schemes;
    · Development of Oil Palm Industry;
    · Community Fisheries Infrastructure Development; and
    · Agricultural Mechanization Services Centers.

Implementing Agencies were: Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA), Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Department of Cooperatives.

Implementation and Outcomes

While overall progress has been made towards achieving the project development
objectives, implementation results have been mixed.
Outcomes by component have been as follows:
    (a) Technology Generation and Diffusion. 67 technologies have been created from
        the implementation of 193 projects and a booklet titled: `Agricultural
        Technologies: 2001-2006 has been published. A competitive agricultural research
        grant scheme (CARGS) was established and it was made more demand driven
        through research-extension liaison committees (RELCS). The Directorate of
        Agricultural Extension Services (DAES) performed as expected. An extension
        policy document was published, and private extension providers delivered services
        in selected pilot areas. Gender issues were mainstreamed in extension work.
    (b) Institutional Reforms. The various technical Departments of MOFA improved
        their planning procedures and implemented their programs more effectively. Also,
        MOFA's capacity for decentralized planning and budgeting has been greatly
        enhanced.
    (c) Development of Farmer-Based Organizations. Although financial and economic
        analysis was not carried out on this component, there was substantial evidence to
        show that benefits of this component outweighed the cost. Subprojects supported
        with matching grants exceeded the target by 7%.           FBO benefited from value
        addition to their produce and that increased their incomes. To make the component
        sustainable, closer links with rural finance institutions will have to be developed.
    (d) Strengthening Agricultural Education and Training. The objectives of this
       component were largely achieved. The agricultural education policy has been
       reviewed and is ready for implementation. Curricula of agricultural colleges and
       farm institutes have been reviewed and will become operational with the
       commencement of the Diploma program in the Agricultural Colleges in 2007.
    (e) New Initiatives ­ Horticulture Export Industry Initiative (HEII). Despite
        remaining challenges, the major achievement of this component was to help the
        country in resuming pineapple exports which had been stalled by the need to
        complete the switch to the new MD2 pineapple variety and to adapt export

       practices to higher quality expectations for both cold chain management and food
       safety/quality.

Bank and Borrower Performance.

Bank. During implementation, the Bank fielded Joint Implementation Support Missions
with other sector Development Partners and monitored progress. Recommendations and
actions for redress were communicated through mission aide-memoirs and follow-up
discussions. Government of Ghana was alerted on problems with project execution and
remedies were facilitated in a timely manner in conformity with Bank's procedures. The
aide-memoirs were realistic in the assessment of the performance of the project in terms of
achievement of development objectives and project implementation.

The shortcomings of the Bank were mainly delays in the granting of no objection to
disbursement requests for funds to implement various activities.

Borrower. The Government facilitated implementation by making available counterpart
funding. Government also prepared for, convened and took part in the implementation
support missions. Also, the Government asked for and gave its concurrence to donors in
November 2004 to restructure the AgSSIP when it was found that expected development
outcomes would not be realized within the original time frame.

Implementation of some key policy and institutional issues were however slow.

Implementing Agencies. Management structures such as the AgSSIP Coordination Unit at
MOFA faced difficulties. This Project Unit was designed to be mainstreamed but turned
out as an unclear hybrid between discrete project type PCU and mainstream management.
This arrangement needs to be resolved for smooth implementation of future support. GOG
needs to take a decision on the management and application of projects within the context
of overriding national policies of decentralization and privatization and also the current
orientation towards the sector wide approach and the MDBS.
Due to improved capacity in Monitoring and Evaluation through the appointment of
Technical Specialists and the establishment of a computerized management information
system (MIS) the AFFS of the CSIR was able to monitor and evaluate the performance of
research projects which were being implemented.

At the CSIR there were initially some problems with the submission of Financial
Management Reports (FMRs) on time due to difficulties in the use of the SCALA
Accounting Software. The situation improved over time. Also, the situation of non-timely
submission of financial returns by some spending institutions was corrected as time went
on.

In MOFA a plan to restructure financial management is progressing steadily. This is to
improve oversight over the use of public resources. However some change of mandates in
financial management in relation to the budgeting process has posed difficulties in some
instances in information gap to adequately advice disbursements.




                                            63

Procurement of all works, goods, consultancies and training all followed the procurement
guidelines of the Bank. There were however initial delays in procurement due to the slow
build-up of capacity in the implementing agencies.

Concerning monitoring and evaluation, the project design assumed incorrectly that a sector
M&E system was in place to support implementation of activities. The development of
this system is ongoing as Phase I is coming to a close. It is hoped that the completed
system will serve the needs of the envisaged future support to the sector in the form of an
agricultural sector-wide approach.

The report concludes with a detailed list of recommendations for future operations,
covering all the different technical Departments of MOFA and agricultural research.
