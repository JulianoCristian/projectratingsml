SUMARY
i,        This report brings up-to-date the situation and prospects of BNDE
described in Report DB-57(a) which was presented to the Executive Directors
(R69-244) on December 30, 1969.
ii.       BNDE's direct lending operations continued to increase in the past
year and the Bank's fourth loan to BNDE, approved by the Executive Directors
on January 13, 1970, is now fully committed. As in the past, BNDE has served
as Morocco's main long-term lending institution for industry, with  most loans
financing imports of capital goods.  BNDE has made few equity investments in
the past three years. BNDE's role in mobilizing savings is still small. It
has depended for over 90% of its resources on the Bank Group and on the
Moroccan Government.
iii.      BNDE's financial position is satisfactory and its profitability -
a subject of considerable concern a few years ago- has improved markedly.
BNDE's long-term portfolio is diversified and of good quality; reserves cover
amply the few hard-core risks. BNDE's exposure in textiles is still substantial
but that sector's significance in BNDE's portfolio is likely to diminish sub-
stantially before the Government, as it plans, adds new textile capacity in
Morocco.
iv.       BNDE's project appraisals are of good quality in respect of techni-
cal and financial aspects. Project selection has been helped by criteria for
a satisfactory return on project investment which BNDE has required since
last year.  However, much has still to be done by BNDE to measure better the
inpact of its operations on the Moroccan economy, particularly the extent to
which the competitiveness of projects it finances depends on protection from
e           imports.  BNDE's project supervision is good in discovering problens; but it
has not yet fed systematically the practical knowledge BNDE has gleaned into
project appraisals and providing insights into Moroccan industry.
v.        Uhile BNDE's shareholders and Board remained about the same in the
past two years, important changes took place recently in BNfDE's management;
there is a new Chairman, who also functions as Director General,
and, a Deputy Director General. BNDE's staff has grown in experience and
maturity. The problems encountered two years ago due to lack of internal
A           coordination are now less acute.



- iv -
vi.       ENDEfs operations have grown sharply in 1970; it has a sub-
stantial pipeline of projects alreadg at an advanced stage of considera-
tion, and general conditions in Morocco favor private industrial invest-
ment. It is therefore reasotiable for BNDE to forecast a higher business
volume than in the past, through the mid-seventies. With direct loans for
imports likely to remain BNDEts major activity, BNDE looks forward to commit
$61 million untfL the end of 1972, including $h9 million to finance importe.
BNDE forecasts only a limited activity in equity investments in the next few
years.  BNDE should engage more actively in this field.  It should also do
more to attract financing partners into large projects.
vii.      BNDE looks again to the Bank to replenish its resources.  If the
Bank were to meet all of  NfEtDs requiremeuts, it would by 1975 be the source
of nearly 8G% of BNDE's lcng-term resources. It is therefore encouraging
that ENDE ls now making efforts to seek capital from other than its tradi-
tional sources. The fact that BNDE can now go to the domestic market should
facilitate ENDE's efforts to mobilize resources.  The Oovernment has agreed
to remove restrictions on BNDE that hindered it in this respect. Another
important decision taken by the Government recently is to permit BNDE to
increase its lending rate from the present 7% to 8% immediately and to 9%
by end 1971. This action should enable BNDE to achieve appropriate levels
of operational income without subsity.
vii.      BNDE îs a suitable and creditworthy borrower for another Bank
loan.  An appropriate amount would be $35 mlllion which is less than BNDE's
estimated two-year needs and wlll stimulate BNDE's efforts to develop other
sources of funds. The terms of the proposed loan should be those normally
applied to Bank loans to development finance companies, including the stan-
dard comritment fee. As in the past t½o loans, financing of public sector
proJeets should be permitted under the limitations set by BNDE%s policy
statement, but this time up to a limit of $6 million.  In consequence of
recent improvements in BNDE, its free limit should be raised from $300.0Co
to $500e,OG, with an aggregate free liziit of $7 million.  BNDE's debt limit
should be raised from h.5 to 5.5 times equity as defined in Loan Agreements
with the Bank.



APPRAISAL OF
BANQUE NATIONALE POUR LE DEVELOPPEIENT ECONOIYEQUE
I. INTRODUCTION
1.      The Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique, established
in 1959, has received four loans from the Bank totalling $62.5 million.
The most recent Loan, signed on iarch 6, 1970, and amounting to $15 mil-
lion, is now fully ccnmitted.  In view of a substantial pipeline of
project applications, BNDE needs fresh capital. This report appraises
BNDE and recommends a fifth Bank loan.
.
II. BNDE'S ROLE II3 THE ECONO'iY
Private Industrial Investment
2.      An analysis of l'Ioroccots economy appeared in "Economic Develop-
ments and Prospects in Horocco" distributed to the Ezecutive Directors
on October 16, 1970, ?70-195.  in the period 1965-69, private
industrial investmeht, judging from the only systematic indicators avail-
able J/oscillated between DH 134 million and DH 130 million per year,
without any real sign of growth. In 1970, however, there was a significant
increase in investors' interest. The Investment Commission, which
approves the eligibility of investment proposals for various Government
incentives and to which most investors apply, reported that its approvals
of private industrial projects durin- 1970 were 2.5 times higher than
for 1969    (see Annex 1).  This evidence of increased interest is
confirmed by other indicators such as higher output of construction
materials, but the most notable evidence is the rapid commitment of the
fourth Bank loan to BNDE and the continued spurt of project approvals
by BNDE .
1/ Approvals by the Investment Commission . This is the only record of
the course of private industrial investment in Nlorocco.  There are no
data on actual investments.



BNDE as a Source of Financing
3.      BNDE has been active in the financing of two sectors, manufactur-
ing and tourism. It is the main source of long-term finance for
industry in MYlorocco and has played a major role in the development of the
manufacturing sector. Annex 2 and Graph I show the evolution of BNDE's
project approvals compared with totatl approvals by the Investment
Commission. Leaving aside several large public sector projects for which
suppliers' credits have been arranged directly between the Iloroccan
Government and equipment suppliers, BNDE has contributed to the financing
of the bulk of kIoroccan industrial projects undertaken in the past few
years, and appears to have supported more than three quarters of the
projects approved by the Commission.
4.      Loans.  DNDE's financial assistance has been mainly in the form
of direct loans with terms between 3 and 15 years 1/.  A leading
characteristic is that about 80% of these loans have financed imports;
where the source of financing is foreign, the exchange risk is with the
Government. BNDE's direct loan approvals have increzwsed from an average
of DH 25 million per year before 1965 to more than double that level in
1966-1969 and to a record of DH  165 million in 1970.  1,Jhile the most
recent approvals are still being processed, commitments have followed
suit, except in 1968 when two hotel loans did not go fonrard.
5.      The alternatives to BNDE's long-term loans, suppliers' credits
and medium-term loans from coimmercial banlcs, have not had the steady
importance as a financing source for private industry which BNDE has
had; and they have, apparently, declined markedly since 1968. This
development is of particular interest as suppliers' credits have been
easier to obtain than BNDE's loans, which require a comparatively
lengthy appraisal process; but they have the disadvantage that borrowers
have to carry the exchange risk and that they are of generally shorter
terms. M4edium-term loans from commercial banks have been limited by
the banks' resources and were granted mainly for small projects.
6.      Two particular channels of BNDE's industrial financing call
for special note:
a. Medium-term loans extended by commercial banks at their own
risk may be rediscounted at the Central Bank if appraised
and approved by BNDE. Annual rediscounting commitments by
EINDE have shoin great fluctuations, mainly influenced by
the incidence of large public sector projects for which
conmercial banks could not provide enough financing of their
own. BNDE's participation is limited to financing fixed
assets only, as BNDE does not lend for working capital
requirements.
1/ For industrial projects, only up to 12 years.

b.  Maroc Leasing, established in 1965 under the sponsorship of
BNDE and the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, leases equip-
ment to small and medium-sized firms with purchase options
at the end of the lease period. Its business has grown very
rapidly, from contracts of DH 6.2 million in 1966 to DH 20
million in 1969 and somewhat more in 1970. Maroc Leasing has
become by far the largest client of BNDE, on which it depends
for over 60% of its financial resources. Ieareç Leasing's
financial services complement and do not compete with those
offered by BNDE because of the nature of the equipment financed
(i.e. individual pieces of machinery rather than whole projects)
and the small size of individual contracts. Individual leases
are for less than DH 700,000, and 80% of them are lower than
DH 250,000, while over 85% of BNDE's loans are for more than
DH 750,000. Maroc Leasing performs the very useful function
of making credit available to firms for small extensions, which
do not warrant detailed investigation by either ENDE or the
Investment Commission.
7.      Equity Investnents.  In the past three years BNDE has provided
little equity capital. In its earlier years BNDE was an important source
of equity investments, and at the end of 1966 its equity portfolio con-
sisted of 24 investments with a book value of over DH 15 million. The
recent drop in equity financing is partly due to BNDEts reluctance to ex-
pand its equity portfolio because of difficulties experienced in some of
its early investments. A more important reason was that the creation in
1966 of the Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI), a public sector
institution for equity financing, referred to in paragraph 10 below. This
institution and the GQoernnent itself have been active in buying equities.
They have taken advantage of opportunities which they found attractive and
which, reflecting the Governmentîs desire to have a share in certain invest-
ments, had in practice become reserved for the Governmnent and SNI. The Bank
expressed in negotiations its concern about the lagging role of BNDE in
equity investments and stressed the need to expand that role.  The Govern-
ment has agreed that BNDE will not face any obstac7es in this regard and
that, within the limit of financial prudence, it will have freedom in seek-
ing out share investment opportunities.
BNDE as a Mobilizer of Resources
8.      BNDE's aggregate financing of about DH 525 million since 1962,
about 65% of which with Bank funds, involves total investments of over
DH 2 billion (»L0O million equivalent).   BNDE has had some success in at-
tracting foreign investors into its projects; cases of this kind were
financing of hotels through SOMADET, BNDE's financing subsidiary, and
SOTHERMA, a mineral water producer.
9.      BNDE's own long-term resources as of December 31, 1970 are sunmarized
in Annex 3. The Bankis loam accounted for 70%. On the basis of outstanding
amounts alone, the Bank's contribution on December 31, 1970, was 641. Long-
term subordinated Governnent loans, carrying an interest rate of 2%, account
for 12% of total resources: bond held by local institutions since BNDE's



- 4 -
creation in 1959 account for 4%; and a loan from AID, signed in July 1970, for
4%. BNDEIs equity constitutes 10% of total resources. Reserves have increased
rapidly and represent over 40% of net worth. BNDE needs more resources; but
in seeking capital from sources other than its main providers heretofore,
important constraints had to be dealt with:
(a) First, private capital in Morocco is mobilized by the Government
and the banking system; term borrowings within Morocco are regulated by
the Government. Although several institutions have been able to enter
the money market, BNDE has until recently been precluded from tapping
private or corporate savings except for an issue in 1961 and three- and
six-month "bons de caisse" for DH 10 million at 3 3/h%, subscribed by
insurance companies and automatically renewed at maturity if authorized
by the Finance Ministry. This annual authorization has so far been
regularly obtained. In negotiations the Government has affirmed that it
would treat BNDE on an equal footing with other Moroccan institutions
seeking capital from the domestic market; in fact BNDE is about to float
bond issues totaling DH 20 million in 1971.
(b)  Seccnd, the Government controls interest rates in Morocco, and BNI<E
has been required to maintain its lending rate at 7% as the Government
has in the past felt that an increase would discourage industrial
investment and have inflationary effects. In exchange for keeping the
interest rate at 7V0, the Government has been subsidizing BNDE for bor-
rowing costs exceeding 5% and up to 7%. BNDE had an offer of term
financing from a foreign financing institution at interest rates exceed-
ing 7%, but could not take it up because of arrangements with the Govern-
ment. The consequence has so far been that BNDE was pushed to loans on
concessional terms. To mitigate its heavy reliance on only two sources
of capital, ENDE is now seeking additional funds from elseditere, in-
cluding several banks in Europe. Enabling BNDE to succeed in this pro-
cess was one of the reasons for which the Government recently decided to
let BNDE increase its interest rate, starting July 1, 1971. Details of
this decision are discussed further in paragraph 51.
10.       The stock exchange in Morocco, the Bourse of Casablanca, has not
been significant as a source of funds for BNDE. This is also true for other
enterprises. Though increasing its activities over the past two years, the
Exchange is in an early stage of development. The market is thin, with the
volume of transactions increasing only from DH 23 million in 1967 to DH 5h
million in 1969 and decreasing to DE 50 million in 1970, although as many as
85 stocks are quoted on the Exchange. There is little involvement of insti-
tutional investors who, on the average, have only DH 1 in shares for every
DH 25 in Government bonds.  Reluctance of family entrepreneurs to have outside
participations is also an important obstacle to the development of the stock
market. To stimulate equity investment and to help broaden ownership of
securities, the Government sponsored the creation in 1966 of the Societé
Nationale d'Investissement (SNI). SNI has a share capital of DH 30 milion
owned 51% by the Government, 29% by a public sector institution, 5% by BNDE
and 15% by private investors. SNI is also responsible for administering all
Government equity participations.



- 5 -
11.       Except for the investment in SNI (DH 1.5 million), BNDE#s present
equity investments with a total book value of DH 22 million are not quoted on
the Bourse. There is little that BNDE can do to increase transactions in the
stock market, and privately arranged share sales have been non-existent.
12.       ENDEfs financing activities have involved the participation of other
institutions, mainly Moroccan banks. However, it is not clear in many in-
stances whether BNDE or the banks wanted such participation. BNDE has done
little financing with financial institutions outside Morocco; principal excep-
tions are the Lukus project involving IFO, export financing deals insured by
COFACEF/in France and more recently aircraft financing together with American
banks.
13.       Altogether BNDE has played a small role in mobilizing resources from
sources other than the Bank and the Governnent.  BNDE has indicated that it
intends to make greater efforts to raise funds from new sources and to draw
both local and foreign institutions into financing arrangements. The arrange-
ments referred to in paragraphs 7 and 9 are designed to facilitate BNDE1s
efforts in that direction.
Project Promotion
14.       BNDE has not restricted itself to lending for projects brought to it.
Through the mid-sixties it actively promoted new ventures in the industrial
field (pastics, cement, fishmeal, bitumen, electric motors, feed, olive oil,
bottling) and in tourism. Except for recent months BNDEfs promotional acti-
vity has not been significant in the past three years, the period in which
it has made few equity investments.  Sector studies are going on which mnay
help new promotions.
Project Appraisal
15.       The quality of ENDEss appraisals is naw considerably better than two
years ago and has reached a good standard. From the 19 projects, presented to
the Bank in the past 18 months for the Bank's approval, none was rejected and
only three drew questions. BNDE has a good engineering section, called the
Development Department, whose engineers have now considerable experience in
judging textile and food processing projects. The engineers work closely with
clients in the preparation of projects and frequently modify or ultimately
reject project applicav-ions presented in an unviable form.  The work of BNDE's
engineers has led to the point where few technical problems are experienced by
BNDE projects. BNDE has a good record of projects having proceeded on schedule;
few of BNDEIs clients have had high cost overruns.
16.       Financial analysis is also competently handled.  Marketing and
organizational aspects are less well analyzed. BNDE staff is now working more
closely than before with the managements of its borrowers in attempting to
establish realistic projections. To it has often fallen the task of projecting
I/ Compagnie Francaise d'Assurance du Commerce Extérieur.



- 6 -
its clients# business, and its forecasts have so far turned out well; by and
large financial results have come close to forecasts. For more than a year,
BNDE has been requiring that projects achieve a minimum internal rate of
return of lC%, and has undertaken to continue to do so.
17.       Most of BNDE's clients have made profits in recent years, but no
systematic study has been made to determine whether, and to what degree, the
satisfactory financial performance of BNDE's clients is due to import pro-
tection, to subsidies from the Government, or to the enterprisest own effi-
ciency.  The economic aspect of BNDE's appraisals is developing, as is the
evaluation of BNDE's overall impact on the Moroccan economy. There has been
a continuing discussion between the Bank and BNDE to improve BNDE's economic
work, and as a result considerable progress has been noticeable in recent
months.
Investment Supervision
18.       BNDE#s project supervision has been increasingly useful in providing
its management with notice on problem cases and in recommending steps to pro-
tect ENDEts portfolio. Frequent visits are made during construction and at
least once a year, for two or three years, after the project is operating.
BNDE's supervision reports present an adequate picture of the progress of the
projects and of the borrowerst performance, and try to determine the causes
for discrepancies between projections and actual results.
19.       However, the feedback from supervision reports is not being put to
full use in making new appraisals, for supervision reports are not being dis-
tributed to staff in the departments responsible for appraising new applica-
tions. Moreovere the systematic study of BNDE's end-use results could lead to
valuable conclusions concerning the economic impact of BNDEts projects. HNDE
now has a substantial volume of material on the performance of Moroccan indus-
try which, if subjected to analysis and evaluation, would be of great value
not only to BNDE but also to the Government and others concerned with
Moroccots industrial policy. BNDE agreed in negotiations to undertake the
needed evaluation.
Characteristics of BNDEIs Investments
20.       The fact that BNDE shares in financing the bulk of Moroccots private
industrial projects suggests that conclusions about the development of
Moroccan industry generally can be drawn from BNDEts experience. Annex 4
gives some salient features of projects financed by BNDE from the proceeds of
the two latest Bank loans, and Annex 5 shows the principal characteristics of
BNDE's operations since they first started.
a. The size of individual projects financed by BNDE has increased.
(This trend has been particularly apparent in recent months).
Excluding the large Doukkala Sugar Mill, 30 manufacturing pro-
jects financed under Loan 571-MOR received loans averaging
US$173,000 equivalent; their total investment cost averaged
US$350,C00. Under Loan 660-MOR, BNDE has financed 22 manu-
facturing projects with an average loan of $436,000 and an
average total cost of us$953,000.



- 7 -
b.  BNDE's industrial projects are increasingly oriented towards
exports despite insufficient encouragement of exports by the
Government. Of the 31 manufacturing projects financed under
Loan 571-MOR, two were expected to export over 50% of pro-
duction and three, cver 10%. Under Loan 660-MO0R, out of 22
projectse five projects (all in food processing) will produce
primarily for exports and five more are expected to export at
at least 10o of their total production. of the remaining 12
projects, six will manufacture products on a fairly competi-
tive basis, with projected prices only slightly above c.i.f.
prices. The remaining six projects will enjoy higher levels
of protection. No data could be obtained on actual protec-
tion of BNDE projects already operating, but projects for
which commitments vere made recently indicate a trend to-
wards greater competitiveness.
c.  Systematic data on the geographical distribution of industry
in Morocco are not available.  However, BNDEts projects are
probably representative of the general geographical pattern.
40% of BNDE's projects were concentrated in the Casablanca
region in the period 1959-1966, against 25% in the period
from 1967 till 1970. The Government granted fiscal incen-
tives to projects in the Tangier region but the proportion
of projects financed by BNDE in that area has not increased
in recent Years. There is no indication that BNDEfs invest-
ments helped the dispersal of industry to new areas.
d.  The sectoral pattern of BNDEfs industrial projects has not
changed in the past two years. Textile and food processing
still account for roughly 40% of BNDE's commitments with
Bank funds, and Maroc Leasing about 15%. However, hotel
financing is rapidly disappearing, due to the expansion of
CIH.
21.     To sum up, the economic impact of BNDE's financing is considerable.
BNDE's effort to make a more precise assessment of the nature and extent
of that impact is particularly important so that ENDE can learn through its
own experience, and on the basis of that experience, evaluate its policies
and procedures for the future.

III. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Shareholders and Board
22.       There have been no significant changes among BNDE's shareholders
(see Arnex 6), nor in the composition of BNLDE's Board (see Annex 7), since
the report (R69-244) recommending the fourth Bank Loan to BNDE was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on December 30, 1969.
Management and Staff
23.       Management.  After virtually no change since 1966, three impor-
tant changes in the top management of BNDE took place in the last 18 months.
On December 22, 1969, Mr. Mohamed Bargach replaced Prince Moulay Hassan Ben
Mehdi as President (Chairman) of the Board of Directors of BNDE. On March
25, 1970, Mr. Azzedine Sefrioui, until then Director of BNDE's Legal and
Follow-up Department, was appointed Deputy Director General.  Finally, Mr.
Mohamed Benkirane, BNDE's Director General for about five years, resigned
on May 30, 1970, to become General Manager of the Banque Marocaine pour le
Commerce et ltIndustrie.  His responsibilities were assumed by 1Mr. Bargach
on July 2.
24.       Mr. Bargach, formerly Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of
Morocco and former Minister of Agriculture, has considerable stature in the
country. He has immersed hinself in the responsibilities of running BNDE.
Mr. Bargach has good relations with the business community, and has contri-
buted considerably to BNDE's increasing pace of business in recent months.
Mr. Sefrioui, BNDE's Deputy Director General, has been with BNDE since
1959.
25.       Decision-making rests mainly with Mr. Bargach, who delegates some
responsibilities to the Deputy Director General, who has primary charge
of project control, accounting and administration, and to the Director of
the Credit Department, who is responsible for project appraisals.  Mr.
Marcel Alacchi, an econcmist with wide experience in Governnent, was recently
appointed to lead BNDEts economic work.
26.       Staff and Organization.   Annex 8 is BNDE's Organization Chart.
As of December 31, 197-0, BNDE's professional staff totaled 43, two of whom
were foreign. BNDE's professional staff as a whole has grown in experience
and maturity.  Several members at the middle level are of high caliber.



- 9 -
27.       Appraisals are the product of three departments:  Development
(technical aspects), Economic Studies (market surveys, especiaLly at the
macro-economic level), and Credit (ehich synthesizes the job and makes
financial projections).  Coordination among these departments has improved
during the past year. Although ombodyis specifically designated to coordi-
nate appraisal work, the Director of the Credit Department has helped to
bring about a measure of coordination.  BNDE staff communicate more with
one another on their work than two years ago, and organized meetings of
working teams on specific projects including members of the three depart-
ments concerned with appraisals have become a regular practice.  Mhe
President is involved only at a late stage of the appraisal, concerning
himself with essentiaiL issues. Though coordination is much better than
two years ago, this matter requires continued attention by the President,
Relations with Government and Business Community
28.       The situation is about the same as in 1969.  BNDE's dependence on
the Government for financial resources, the   interest        aubsidy and other
fiscal advantages, and the fact that the Government possesses the largest
block of shares and representation on its Board have been important reasons
for BNDE to maintain good relations with the authorities. While BNDE main-
tains freedom of maneuver on details of projects and in regard to much of
its internal organization, BNDE pays close attention to official develop-
ment policies. Within this framework, BNDE has tried to let business con-
siderations prevail and to improve its performance.
29.       BNDEls relations with the business community have been correct
and somewhat formal, though they seem to have become warmer in the past
year. Some clients object to the amount of detail they have to supply.
There is no evidence of BNDE supporting any particular group in the com-
munity. BNDE is keen on keeping good relations with the commercial banks
in Morocco, and appears to have done so successfully.
Operational Policies
30.       With one exception, BNDEts Policy Statement (Annex 9) has remained
unchanged in the past two years.   BNDEts Board approved, on December 22,
1969, an increase in the normal limit of its conmitments to a single enter-
prise from 10% to 15% of BNDE's equity and subordinated loans . This chtnge has
beanagreed by the Bank. BNDE can finance Government enterprises, but only
in special circumstances in which private capital to carry out the project



- 10 -
cannot be found on reasonable terms. BNDE has approved direct loans to rela-
tively few public sector projects since its Policy Statement was adopted
in 1963,  including only four in the past three years.
Evaluation of Loan and Equity Portfolio
31.       Loan Portfolio.  On December 31, 1970, BNDE had loans outstanding
to 138 companies for a total amount of DH 219 million, of which four for
DH 50 million were guaranteed by the Government and two for DH 22 million
were covered by commercial b&nk guarantees. BNDEfs arrears performance has
continued to be good. The level of delinquency is very low. In September
1970 only eight loans with an amount outstanding of DH 5.1 million, which
represents less than 2.5% of the total loan portfolio, were in arrears of
principal. The actual amount of principal in arrears was DH 1.1 million
(or 0.5  of total loan portfolio).  Arrears on interest are also low.  The
e             number of projects in serious difficulties has been reduced over the past
three ye-rs with only three remaining and accounting for 80% of arrears
in principal and interest. They are a glass producer (Manuver), a leather
tannery (Nouvelle Somatam) and a fish protein factory (Sonafap). The loan
to Sonafap is guaranteed by the Government; the loans to Manuver and Nouvelle
Somatam are covered by good guarantees. BNDE expects no losses in these
loans. Despite some concentration in textiles and food processing, the
sectoral composition of BNDEfs loan portfolio is reasonably well diversi-
fied. At this time there appears to be no recession-prone sector represented
in BNDEls investraents.
32.       Exposure in Textiles.  BNDE's exposure in the textile sector and
the situation of overcapacity and inventory accumulation were a serious
source of concern two years ago. Since then the share of textile projects
in BNDE's loan portfolio has decreased from 35% to 241o, and is decreasing
further as earlier loans are being repaid. Furthermore, the textile sector
ppears to have weathered its crisis of 1967/6<, the improvement
being due in part to  h  he      consumer income resulting from the excellent
1968 harvest and to the  aect that a number of Moroccan textile enterprises
have acquired more experience and improved their productivity. On December 31,
1970, BNDE had loans outstanding to1*  textile companies, 19 of Vihich were
for mxore than DH 1 million each. Only two of the operating companies were
unprofitable in 1969; ten companies nad net profits of over 10% of equity.
Production capacity and internal consumption are now in approximate balance,
but this will probably change in two years when the large Government-spon-
sored COTEF mill in Fès (50,000 spindles and 1,000 looms) starts operating
and adds some 25% to capacity now available. By the time COTEF starts
operations, a large proportion of the textile loans made by ENDE in 1965/66
will be completely repaid. Nevertheless, BNDE's textile portfolio must
continue to be watched closely.
33.       Equity Portfolio.  Details of BNDE's equity portfolio as of
December 31, 1970, are given in Annex 10. BNDE has subscribed to the shares
of 25 conpanies for DH 24.9 million, of which DH 22.6 million has been paid
in. BNDE has made specific provisions of DH 2.7 million for the deprecia-
tion of six unprofitable investments, four of which have been written off.



- 11 -
Thus, net investment is DH Z2.: million, of which 19.9 million has been paid
in.
3h.       Dividend income has doubled in two years, increasing from
DH 397.000 in 1968 to over DH 800,000 in 1970, representing a yield of 4.2%
of BNDE1s equity portfolio at cost, up from 2% in 1968.  The improvement
has been considerable but BNDE's equit portfolio continues to be
weighed down by a few large unprofitable investments.
35.       BNDEts equity portfolio  ,y be broken down as follows:
(DH million)
Number      Amount
le                       1.  Profitable companies distributing
dividends                              13         14.31
2.  Companies under construction or
about to start operations               3          3.03
3.  Unprofitable companies                  5           4.93
21         22.27
Most companies in the first category, accounting for 63% of the equity port-
folio, have excellent prospects. Of the five presently unprofitable com-
panies, four are expected to to be profitable in lS71.
36.       Summing up, BNDE's serious risks of loss on its loan and equity
portfolio are only about DH 3.8 million; but given the Goverument guarantee
on one project and very good security for the other two, no losses are
likely.
Profitability and Financial Position
37.       Annex 11 shows BNDEls income statements from 1966 to 1970, the
last not yet audited. BNDE's profitability has been a continuing matter
of concern. The concern is less now, for BNEEts net profits are growing,
from DH 2.65 million in 1967 (7% of average equity and 8.8% of share capital)
to DH 3.80 million in -970 (Il.Ô% of equity and 19.0% of share capital)
Increased profitability is partly due to the reduction in BNDE's share capi-
tal, from DH 30 to DH 20 million in 1968 but also to an increase in lever-
age without rising administrative expenses.  The various forms of Governnent
subsidies to BNDE also have had an important effect on BNDE's increasing
profitability. Without them, ne-t profit.z in 1970 --ou1d hctva beein only
DH 1.8 million, a return oI 5.5> on average equity.



12 -
38.       ENDE has been paying dividends since 196h.  For the years 1968
and 1969, it paid a 6% dividend annually. A dividend of 7% is planned
for 1970. The payout ratio has been quite low (37% in 1969) and BNDE
has been building up reserves, as discussed in paragraph h0 below.
39.       Annex 12 presents ENDE's balance sheets from 1966 to 1970.  BNDEts
financial position is sound. Total assets increased at an annual rate of
10% in 1967 and 1968, 6% in 1969 and 15% in 1970. The current ratio on
December 31, 1970, was 0.98:1. Nearly half of BNDE's current liabilities
are the three-month "bons de caisse" described in paragraph 9, which have
been automatically renewed at maturity.  In the unlikely event that these
bonds were not renewed, BNDE's cash surplus from operations and collections
would be almost sufficient to cover the excess short-term liabilities, and
BNDE would have ample time to obtain short-term loans for the balance.
Thus, BNDE's liquidity position is stronger than it appears at first glance.
ENDE's long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 1970, totaled DH 205
million, of which DH 40 million was in the form of subordinated Governnient
loans. The ratio of total debt to equity was 5.6:1 as of the same date.
The Bank loan agreements limit ENDE's borrowings to a maximun of four and
a half times its equity. "Equity" for that purpose includes the amount of
Government-subordinated loans falling due after the last maturity of loans
made by BNDE with Bank funds. On that basis, the ratio was only 2.8:1 as
of December 31, 1970.
40.       ENDE is allowed to set aside tax-free reserves against its current
income at an annual rate of one-seventh of direct financial costs and 0.15%
of new rediscountable credits granted each year.  BNDE has taken full
advantage of this agreement with the Goverrment in constituting general
reserves against possible losses. As a result reserves and retained earnings
increased from 5h% of share capital in 1968 to 83% as of December 31, 1970,
and amounted on that date to 7% of BNDE's long-term portfolio, as against
loans in arrears of 2.3% and no likely losses.

IV. BNDE'S OUTLOOK
Prospects for Industrial Investment in Morocco
41.       As indicated before, there has been in 1970 a sharp increase in
interest in industrial investment among private investors in Morocco. In
the next two years, capacity limitations will be reached in some sectors
(cement, mining and petroleum refining).  On the other hand, foreign in-
vestor interest has been expressed concretely in several manuiacturing
sectors (tires, nylon, can-making)and some  such   proposals are already
considerably advanced and likely to result in large projects. The next
two years should thus show a substantial growth,over the recent past, in
private industrial investment.
42.       After 1972, prospects for industrial growth remnain
e             favorable. tTncertainties remain because Morocco has
yet to make imiportant policy ciecisioris which could influence the future
course, such as appropriate treatment of foreign investors and sound incen-
tives for exports of industrial goods. Nevertheless there are factors
worling in favor of Moroccan industry. Among them is t1e growth in demand
for construction materials because of the increase in hotel construction,
and further growth of food processing because oa the rapid development of
tourism. Also significant is Morocco's recent association with the European
Economic Community under which Moroccan manufacturers enjoy favorable treat-
ment in the EEC area. Morocco is well placed to take advantage of this
opportunity because of its armle and capable labor force; at present about
200,000 Moroccans, nearly the same number as employed in industry at home,
work in Europe and many of them are likely to bring home their skills. As
labor shortages are likely to continue in Europe there is an attraction for
European enterprises, given Morocco's geographical proximity, to invest in
the country and to make use of its experienced labor pool. In doing so,
they could take advantage of the doors opened by the EEC Association
Agreement to Moroccan industrial exporta.
BNDE's Forecast of Operations and Finance Requirements
43.       Direct Loans. BNDE's operational forecasts for the period 1971-
1975 are shown in Annex 13. They reflect the recent upswing in BNDEts
operations and the large stock of project applications now under study.
Against DH 165 million in 1970, ENDE forecasts loan approvals of DH 170
million in 1971 and DH 150 million in 1972. BNDE projects an annual level
of DH 150 million from 1972 until 1975. The forecast of commitments takes
into account recent experience in project casualties. BNDE expects com-
mitments to follow approvals with a six-month lag.



- 14 -
44.       BNDE's project pipeline no longer contains hotel projects which
in recent years have accounted for a significant portion of BNDE's loans.
But, as there are many and large industrial projects in the pipeline already
at an advanced stage of preparation, the high forecast of approvals for 1971
appears justified.  It is  &19o    reasonable for ENDE to predict, as it
does, a stabilization of its loan approvals for the period 1972-1975 at a
level of DH 150 million per year.  Futhermore ENDE needs to involve more
partners in finanoing projects of large size.  In fact, some of the projects
already approved by BNDE's Board (two refineries and a sugar project) call
for individually very large BNDE commitment9, ranging between DH 25 and
40 million. Even with available first-class guarantees,projects of this
type 1/ would warrant more financing from other sources. As in the past,
about-80% of BNDE's prospective loans are expected to finance imports.
45.       Equity Investments. After three years of very little equity
financing ENDE projects a level of DH 8.5 million in 1971, DH 3 million in
1972 and fH 2 million annually thereafter.  Three large equity investments
are responsible for the unusually high figure projected for 1971. The
levels proj ected thereafter, although higher than in recent years, are still
quite low. The Bank has encouraged ENDE to make more equity investments
46.       Medium-term Rediscountable Credits. Rediscountable credits are
difficult to forecast, for they depend largely on the position of the com-
mercial banks. Because of the number of large projects in 1971, BNDE
expects medium-term rediscountable commitments to be high. An annual level
of DH 60 million is estimated for 1972-1975.  These loans do not affect
ENDE's balance sheet; they are only contingent liabilities. However, they
help BNDE's earnings. Their impact on BNDE's income is expected to decrease
gradually, from 7% of gross income in 1969 to 3% in 1975.
47.       Resource Requirements.  To meet the forecast commitments through
1975 shown in Annex 13 ENDE will need to borrow fresh resources of nearly
DH 600 million o. t os ! which will be needed to finance imports.  The out-
look through the end of 1972 is discussed in more detail below.
1/ BNDE advised the Bank in negotiations that, except for exceptional
cases, it would not submit projects to the Bank which would call
individually for more than $3.5 miUlion of Bank financing.



^ 15 -
48.    ILoan 660-MOR is fully conmitted. To meet conmmitments for 1971 and
1972, BNDE will need about DH 305 million, of which about DH 61 million for
local currency financing and DH 214 million (nearly US$ 49 million) to
finance imports. This is shown below (in DE million):

- for imnport financing (80%)       67.2  61.6      60.8    55.4      2h4
Three major assumptions, based on the past two years' experience, underlie
these calculations, and the remainder of the projections until 1975: a l0%
casualty rate on gross approvals, an average 6-month lag between approvals
and commitments, and an 80% import component of ENDE1s direct loans.  Com-
mitments have accelerated in recent months and the lag has been reduced to
three months. However, as some large projects could experience delays
especially if they involve desirable efforts to secure co-financing by
partners, it appears more prudent to rely on the observed two-year pattern.
49.     The DH 61 million needed by BNDE over the period 1971-1972 for
local currency financing will be covered by internally generated funds,
BNDE#s share capital increase of DH 10 million planned for 1972 (para. 56),
and borrowing next year about DH 10 million in the market.  Of the DH 244
million ($48.8 million) needed to finance imports, BNDE has already resources
of DH 34 million, namely DH 19 million from Bank Loan 660-MOR, and DH 15
million from AID's loan to BNDE. Therefore BNDE has to raise DH 210 million
(US$ h2 million) to meet forecast commitments for import needs until the end
of 1972.
Interest Rate and Government Subsidy
50.     The convention signed vith the Government on January 22, 1960
precluded BNDE from _ncreasing its lending rate over 7T and stipulated that
BNDE wouldreceive from the Government a subsidy equivalent to its borrowing
costs exceeding 5% (and up to 7%) so long as it does not charge more than
7%. It is obvious that BNDE's interest rate of 7% per annum on its loans is
low.



- 16 -
51.    $¶M Governnent has nov decided that a change in BNDE's interest
rate is timely.  Starting July 1, 1971, BNDE's lending rate will go up
to 8% and the subsidy of the cost of BNDE's borrowings obtained after
that date will be reduced to the equivalent of BNDE's borrowing costs
exceeding 6% and up to 7%.  Starting January 1, 1972  BNDE's lending
rate will be 9% and the Governnent subsidy will cease to exist altogether
in respect of any new borrowings BNDE obtains after that date.  In turn,
the Government will subsidize BNDEts borrowers directly in order to com-
pensate for the increase in ENDE's interest rate; ENDE will have nothing
to do with the administration of that subsidy. The Government is cur-
rently undertaking studies on the interest rate structure in Morocco and
its policies on industrial investment, especially the provision of
financial incentives. These studies aim at improving the industrial
incentives system with a view to ensuring a more economic use of resources
and to encouraging industrial sectors favorably placed for exporta of the
European Economic Community. In light of these studies, the Government
proposes to examine in what way its interest rate subsidy could be granted
more selectively to BNDE borrowers, taking account of the priority of these
projects and the nature of activities the Government proposes to encourage.
52.     The Government's decision on BNDE's lending rate is a move in the
right direction.  The Bank will nmaintain close contact with the Moroccan
authorities in their efforts to streamline and improve the incentive sys-
tem for industrial investments in the country.
Projected Profitability and Financial Position
53.     ENDEIs financial forecasts rest on the expected business referred
to in paragraph 43 - 46 above. They also take account of the forthcoming
change in BNDE's interest rate and, as mentioned in paragraph 56, a 50%
share capital increase proposed for late in 1972.
54.     Projected income statements from 1971 to 1975 appear in Annex 14.
BNDEIs net profits are expected to grow from DR 3.8 million  -C%on equity)
in 1970 to 10.8 million (15% on equity) in 1975. Yields on investments
in shares increase gradually from 4% to 5% durîng the five-year period.
Administrative costs are expected to rise at a rate of about 8%



- 17 -
per annum and represent 0.8% of average total assets at the end of 1975
against 1.1% in 1969.  The dividend rate on BNDE's shares is projected
to increase to 8% to be paid first on 1972 results, and to be maintained
at that level even after the proposed share capital increase. Since BNDE
would take full advantage of the maximum allowable reserve build-up favored
by the tax legislation, the payout ratio would decrease from 37% in 1970 to
22% in 1975. On the basis of the projected dividend payments, the book
value of BNDE's shares will increase from 175% of par value at the end of
1970 to 252% at the end of 1975.
55.       Projected statements of sources and uses of funds are given in
Annex 15. These and the projected income statements show that debt/service
coverage will be ample during the forecast period. Annual interest payments
range from 63% to 65% of BNDE's annual profits before financial expenses.
Principal repayments by BNDE are in every year 20% lower than loans collec-
tions.  The overall debt/service coverage will not be below 1.3 through 1975.
If BNDE continues keeping in balance the maturities on its debt and the re-
payments on its lendings, and if it can maintain its present borrowing and
lending terms for the bulk of its operations, RNDE's debt service coverage
will not drop below 1.2 through the life of another Bank loan.
56.       Projected balance sheets through 1975 appear in Annex 16.  Total
assets are expected to expand faster than in the past and to more than double
in the five-year period from DH 261 million in 1970 to DH 652 million at the
end of 1975. The long-term portfolio is estimated to increase from DH 233
million in 1970 to DH 610 million in 1975. The ratio  of total long-term
debt to equity will increase from 5.7 to 7.4 and the debt/equity ratio as
defined in the Bank's Loan Agreements will rise from 2.8 in 1970 to 5.3 in
1975, compared to a contractual limit of 4.5:1. On its projections, BNDE
would exceed the present contractual debt limit some time in 1972. The
quality of ENDE's portfolio is good and a substantial portion is covered
by good guarantees; BNDE has pursued a satisfactory policy of building up
reserves which, over the next five years, are expected to cover about 7%
of BNDE's long-term portfolio; and there is the likelihood that BNDE would
be able to maintain a reasonable debt service coverage. Therefore some
relaxation in the present debt limit would be justified. A prudent new
limit would be 5.5. Even with that limit, BNDE will have to strengthen
its net worth in order to carry out its forecast operations. In loan
negotiations, BIDE has proposed to arrange for a capital increase by one-
half to DH 30 million which it proposes ta complete by late 1972.

V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECONIENDATIONS
Conclusions
57.       Since the Executive Directors approved the last Bank loan to BNDE
on January 13, 1970, BNDE's role in Morocco has grown in importance, es-
pecially in recent months when business expanded rapidly. BNDE remains the
paramount institution for financing private industrial investment. It now
is less active in the financing of tourism projects.  BNDE's impact is far-
reaching.  Despite relatively stagnant private industrial investment for
some years, BNDE has increased the volune of its lending and provided the
majority of term loans to industry, most notably for imports.  The level of
BNDE's equity investments has been low in the past three years. BNDE's role
in mobilizing savings is still small;  BNDE depends for over 90% of its re-
sources on the Bank and the Government.
58.       BNDE recognizes the Governnent's important role in the economy and
in its own affairs, through controlling ownership and as a source of funds.
But BNDE has been able to act professionally, and to inprove its procedures
and standards. It has a good standing in the business community in Morocco
but so far has few active connections with foreign financing institutions.
Its relations with the Bank Group are good.
59.       BNDE's project appraisals are generally good in respect of tech-
nical and financial aspects, but economic analysis needs more emphasis, so
as to avoid investments that are financially profitable but not economically
sound. Project supervision is performing the function of guarding against
potential difficulties; but its findings have not yet been fed into BNDE's
appraisals and the wealth of information it is producing is not being used
to develop insights into Moroccan industry and BNDE's contribution to it.
ENDE is now arranging to improve these aspects.
60.       Important changes in BNDE's management tock place in the past
eighteen months.  BNDE's staff has grown in experience arid maturity, and
is generally cornpetent.  There is now better coordination within BNDE than
there was a year ago, thcugh this matter needs continued attention.
61.       BNDE's financial position is satisfactory.  Its portfolio appears
sound and the level of delinquencies has been remarkably low. Profitability
has improved, but Governnent subsidies have been a substantial factor.
Indeed the Governnent s control over BNDE's financial regime has hitherto kept
BNDE from having significant recourse to sources of funds other than the
World Bank and the Governnment.



- 19 -
62.       BNDE has a substantial project pipeline and general conditions
appear favorable to further industrial investments. BNDE is considering
several large projects in which it should involve more financing partners.
Even so, BNDE can look towards a substantial level of business over the
next five years.  The projections emphasize lending, but not equity invest-
ments.  As in the past, BNDE should play a major role in providing capital
to finance imported equipment required principally by private enterprises
for industrial investment. To this end, BNDE needs fresh capital, about
$42 million, to finance the import component of investment commitments
until the end of 1972.
63.       BNDE looks again to the Bank to replenish its resources.  If the
Bank were to meet all of BNDE's requirements, it would by 1975 be the source
of nearly 80% of BNDE's long-term resources -- an excessive proportion. It
is therefore encouraging that BNDE is now making efforts to seek capital
from other than its traditional sources. The fact that BNDE can now go to
the domestic market should facilitate BNDE's efforts to mobilize resources.
The same purpose will be served by the Government's decision to let BNDE
increase its interest rate which should enable BNDE to achieve appropriate
levels of operational income to pay market terms abroad.
Recommendations
64.       BINDE is a suitable and creditworthy borrower for another Bank loan.
An appropriate amorunt would be $35 million 21 which is less than BNDE's
forecast two-year requirements and should therefore stimulate BKDE's efforts
to seek other sources of capital.  As in the previous loan, the proposed loan
would be disbursed to finance the cif cost of imported goods and 65; of the
cost of goods previously imported into Morocco or of gooda produced in
Morocco which are made to a substantial extent with imported materials.
65.       The terms of the proposed loan should be those normally applied to
Bank loans to development finance companies, including the standard commitment
fee. As in the past two loans, financing of public sector projects should be
permitted under the limitations set by BNDE's policy statement, but not more
than $6 million from the proposed loan should so be used. In consequence of
improvements in BNDE's appraisal capability, its free limit should be raised
from $300,0C0 to $5co,coo, with an aggregate free limit of $7 million. BNDE's
debt limit, as now defined in Loan Agreements with the Bank, should be raised
to 5.5.
2/ Such a loan would be disbursed as estimated in Annex 17.

ANNEX Q

BANQUE NATIONALE POUR LE DEVELOPPENENT ECONOMIQUE
Statement of Policy
(Approved by the Board of Directors on Mlarch 29, 1963 and amended
on March 7, 1966, September 24, 1968 and Deceiber 22, 1969)
1.        BI'DE's genera' investment policy should be stated along the
following lines:
(a)  BNDE's objective will be the encouragement of productive
lnvestment in Morocco, chiefly in the industrial field.
To that end it will assist particularly in the financing
of private industrial enterprises to which the major
portion of its resources will be devoted.
*b                 (b) BNDE will assist a non-private enterprise only in special
circumstances, and when private capital cannot be found on
reasonable terms to carry out the project;
(c)  BNDE will assist a non-industrial enterprise only when
capital cannot be found elsewhere on reasonable terms.
An enterprise will not be considered "private" if the Government or any
of its agencies directly or indirectly hold 50% or more of its outstanding
voting stock.
2.        BNDE xf 1 consider enterprises only on the basis of their
economic and financial merits. To this end, projects will be analyzed
as to their ece omic desirability, technical feasibility, financial sound-
ness, managemert competence, etc., to insure that only sound productive
ventures are financed. BNDE will finance only projects which:
(a) have a high economic priority, and
(b) promise to provide a satisfactory rate of return on the
investment.
BNDE will perform adequate supervision of the operations it finances.
3.        BNDE should, as appropriate, make use of a variety of forms of
investment, including, w ithin the limits of sound financial practice,
equity participations, and the underwriting or participation in the under-
writing of securities sold by investment enterprises.
4.        In order to assist the development of the Moroccan capital
market, BNDE should stand ready to sell portions of its investments to
other private investors, with due respect to its own interests and to
those of the other participants in the investments sold.



ANNEX g
Page 2
5.        When one or more conmerciaI bank participates with BNDE in
lending to an enterprise, BNDE should exert every effort to ensure
that the terms of all the loans, taken together, are well suited to the
needs of the enterprise.
6.        BNDE should, whenever appropriate, extend technical assistance
to its clients in respect of the formulation, execution and operation of
projects.
7.        BNDE should not normally make direct loans or other investments
in favor of one single enterprise aggregating more than 15% of BNDEts
paid-up capital, reserves and outstanding long-term Government loans, with
the exception of such loans and investments which are covered by a
Government guarantee or guarantee from the Caisse Centrale de Garanties
or by a bank guarantee after examination of the financial position of
the bank concerned. In entering into discounting arrangements with a
commercial bank, involving contingent liabilities, BNDE will limit the
amount of its individual commitments on the basis of its assessment of
the financial position of the bank concerned and in the light of BNDE's
share capital and reserves.
8.        In general, BNDE should not take any single equity participation
larger than the smaller of (a) 15% of B1)E's paid-up capital and reserves
and (b) 25% of the share capital of the investment enterprise concerned.
In the case of underwritings, BNDE might take a large commitment in the
faith that it will not in fact have to take up more than the proportion
of shares here indicated.
9.        BNDE will build reserves consistent with sound financial
practice. It will annually appropriate a portion of its income to reserves.
Appropriations will be made so as to build up total reserr-es to a level
that is appropriate to the size and quality of BIDE's portfolio of loans
and equity investments, while permitting the distribution of an adequate
dividend to BNDE's shareholders.  The Board of BNDE will review every
year the situation in this respect.
