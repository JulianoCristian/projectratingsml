'REPORT AND RECOFBENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE BMAOUE NATIONALE POUR
LE DEVELOPPENPTh ECONOMIMUE TO BE
GUARANTEED BY THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan in an amount of various currencies equivalent to
$35 million to the Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique
(BNDE) in Morocco.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank has been associated with BNDE since 1962, and
has so far provided it with four loans totalling $62.5 million.
In addition, IFC holds about $1 million or 25 percent of BNDE's
share capital. In recent years BNDE's general performance has
consistently improved, and it has continued to expand its business
activities, especially in 1970. The fourth Bank Loan to ENDE,
made in an amount of $15 million in March 1970, is now fully com-
mitted. An appraisal mission visited BNDE in September 1970.
Negotiations for a fifth loan took place in Washington from
February 17 to February 22 with Mr. Mohamed Bargach, President
of BNDE, and Mr. Mohamed Lahlou, Director of the Treasury in the
Ministry of Finance, who represented the Guarantor. Subsequent
discussions took place with Bank missions in Morocco and agreement
on the legal documents was reached on April 22.
3.        The proposed loan would be the eleventh operation in
Morocco by the Bank and IDA. The following is a summary statement
of Bank loans and IDA credits in Morocco as of March 31, 1971.

4.        Several of the projects under execution present currently
some problems. Execution of Eoan 389-MOR, an agricultural develop-
ment project in the Sidi Slimane area, was delayed and even after
extending the closing date one year to October 31, 1970, the loan was
not completely disbursed. The work is now complete, however, and the
unutilized balance of about $2.4 million will be cancelled. The main
reasons for this excess of funds are the Governments's use of other



- 3 -
resources to finance some parts of the project and a reduction in the
program of farm improvement. Disbursement on the $11 million IDA
credit (79-IMDR) made in 1965 for an education project amounted to only
$4.5 million as of March 31, 1971. The Bank has asked the Government
to take several specific steps to remedy administrative difficulties
hampering impIementation of the project.  The action now taken by the
Government is being reviewed before deciding on the Government's request,
for postponing the closing date which at present is June 30, 1971.
After a slow start in the execution of the Roads Project (167-NIOR and
642-YiOR) most contracts have now or will soon be let and the initial
delay should be progressively overcome. Construction of the dam
included in the Rharb-Sebou Irrigation Project (643-NOR) is progres-
sing satisfactorily, but delays are occurring in the implementation of
some other parts of the project, particularly in the land consolidation,
reorganization and redistribution throughout the project area, the
Government being slow in putting into effect the Agricultural Investment
Code. The Bank is urging prompt action and is awaiting a government
report on the situation.
5.     As mentioned above, IFC holds 25 percent of the share capital
of B1DE. The Corporation made in 1966 an investment and a loan totaling
about $1.4 million in Compagnie Industrielle del Lukus (CIL), a company
mainly concerned with processing and canning vegetables. EYDE made a
similar investment in CIL, and IFC and INDE each hold 23 percent of
CIL's share capital.
6.     Projects under preparation for consideration by the Bank Group
include a second education project, a second agricultural credit project.
a second loan to the Credit Immobilier et H8telier (CIH) - the develop-
ment finance company specializing in tourism projects - a first project
for water supply and a first project for power development.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
7.     Borrower:            Banque Nationale pour le D6veloppement
Economique (BMDE)
Guarantor:           Kingdom of IViorocco
Amount:              The equivalent of $35 million in various
currencies
Purpose:             To provide ENDE with funds to finance
projects carried out by industrial or
other productive enterprises.



- 4 -
Amortization:       The initial amortization schedule provides
for repayment over 14 years including a two
year period of grace through semi-annual
installments beginning July 1, 1973 and
ending January 1, 1985; it is subject to
change to conform substantially with the
aggregate of the amortization schedules for
the sub-projects for which loan funds are
disbursed.
Interest Rate:      7 and 1/4 percent per annum
Commitment charge:  3/4 of 1 percent per annum on the unwithdrawn
amount of the loan.
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.      A report entitled "Appraisal of Banque WJationale pour le
Developpenient Economique" (Mo. DB-74) is attached.
9.      Industrial production in 1Idorocco grew slowzly but steadily
during the 1960's until 1969, when growth increased sharply to 9 percent
as compared to 5 percent per year in the preceding years. In 1970
private investument in industry appears to have increased significantly
as evidenced in the sharply increased volume of approvals of private
industrial projects by the IMioroccan Investment Cormission. Although
the recent spurt in investors' interest is encouraging, the low growth
in industrial output over the past decade has been a matter of concern
to the Government. At the Government's request, a Bank mission has
reviewed the industrial sector and submitted a draft report. Subsequently,
a 1iinisterial Commission, appointed by the Prime KIinister, has been
studying this draft and other documents prepared by the Nhoroccan admin-
istration to prepare policy recommendations for industrial development
and related incentives.  These recommendations will be submitted to the
Government and reviewed with the Bank.
10.     HIDE plays an important role in the industrial development of
Morocco. Its major activity is to provide long term finance for privat^-
industrial projects, mostly for imported equipment. EN\DE's lending
during 1970 accounted for over 30 percent of total private investment
in industry, and 25 percent of aggregate investment approved by the
Investment Commission for the same year. UNDE expects its annual
volume of loan operations to continue approximately at the 1970
level, wihich was more than double the level attained in previous
years. Although the sectoral pattern of ENDE's industrial invest-
ments has been stable in the past twro years, with about 40 percent
in textiles and food processing, its investments are now rapidly
becoming more diversified. Projects under 1IDE's consideration cur-
rently include, for example, the expansion of two oil refineries and an



- 5 -
automobile assembly plant. ERJDE's projects are becoming larger, thus
accentuating the importance for BlDE of finding financing partners.
An increasing share of ENDE's industrial projects is oriented toward
exports, which should be developed as fast as possible to enlarge
the base of hi'oroccan development as well as to provide the countrr Twith
additional foreign exchange earnings.
11.     BliDE's net profit for 1970 was almost 20 percent higher
than 1969 profits, which were in turn higher than in preceding years.
The rate of return on share capital in 1970 was 20 percent. ELTDE's
loan portfolio is adequately protected and it has no serious risk or
exposure problems. ENDE has also made further progress in improving
the quality of project preparation and its appraisals have reached
a good standard, thus increasing R.TDE's ability to cope with the
recent rise in loan applications. This ability will be further
enhanced by the measures agreed upon between the Bank, ENDE and the
Government during negotiations for the present loan, particularly
the increasing emphasis 31DE is to give to better assessment of the
economic aspects of its operations.
12.     The Bank has been concerned for several years about BIDEfs
low lending rate of 7 percent. This was made possible by a government
subsidy eqaivalent to HNDE's borrowing costs above 5 percent up to
7 percent. This arrangement was part of the long standing government
policy to maintain a low interest rate structure.   However, over time,
this policy enhanced the risk of misallocation of capital resources
and inhibited BJNDE from mobilizing resources on the capital markets.
As a result, BIDE's dependence on the Bank was becoming excessive.
13.     The Government has now decided to let SIDE raise its lending
rate from 7 to 9 percent and to abolish government subsidies to RIDE
after it has raised its rate. The increase will be made in twio steps:
to 8 percent on July 1, 1971, with an interim subsidy of H\JDE borrowing
costs between 6 and 7 percent, and to 9 percent on January 1, 1972,
with a complete abandonment of the subsidy of B!VDEPs borrowings obtained
after that date.
14.     This 2 percent increase in its interest rate is not expected
to turn business away from MNDE. To soften the impact, the Treasury
will, for the time being, subsidize BNDE's borrowers directly, thus
maintaining their net borrowing costs at their present level of 7 per-
cent. Later, in the course of the review of industrial development
and related incentives mentioned above, the Government will consider
how the subsidy could be made available selectively.



- 6 -
15.    The increase in its rate of interest should enable ENDE to seek
new capital on market terms, and BNDE has recently succeeded in
obtaining a FF 50 million loan from a French bank. iMoreover, govern-
ment policies that have limited ENDE's activities in the past will
be revised. The Government has agreed that BNDE will have access
to the domestic capital and money market, and enjoy freedom, within
the limits of financial prudence, to make share capital investments
in enterprises eligible for BNDE financing.
16.    In recognition of the improved quality of ENDE's operation, the
"free limit" for use of the proceeds of the loan without prior Bank
approval would be raised to $500,000 not to exceed an aggregate of
$7 million. While amounts in excess of $500,000 could be financed under
the loan after they had been approved by the Bank, SIDE indicated
during negotiations that, save in exceptional cases, it would not submit
projects to the Bank which would call individually for more than
$3.5 million of Bank financing.
17.    In view of BIDE's good portfolio and prospects that BNDE will
maintain an ample debt service coverage, BNDE's debt equity limit would
be raised from 4.5 to 5.5. To strengthen its equity base, BNDE in-
tends to increase its share capital from $4 to $6 million by the end
of 1972. Finally, as in the past two loans, financing of public sector
projects would be permitted under the limitations set by ENDE's policy
statement, but not more than t6 million from the proposed loan would
be so used.
PART IV - LEGAL DJSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.    The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Banque
Nationale pour le D6veloppement Economique, the draft Guarantee
Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Bank, the report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed Loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors sepa-
rately. The provision of the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements
conform; generally to the pattern of Agreements utilized for loans to
development finance companies.
PART V - THE ECONONCY
19.    An economic Report entitled "Economic Development and Prospects
in liorocco" (aiA 27a) dated September 30, 1970 was distributed to the
Executive Directors on October 16, 1970. An economic mission is
presently in the field and its report should be available by the end
of the summer. A basic data sheet is attached.



20.    Morocco's annual rate of growth of output during the period
1967-1969 averaged 6.5 percent. This was partly due to above-average
harvests, but it reflected also substantially increased public invest-
ment.  Domestic savings have remained at only about P1-12 percent
of GDP in recent years, but fixed investment rose from 11 percent in
1965 to about 14 percent of GDP in 1969. The rise in investment
occurred mainly in the public sector, and the public investment targets
of the 1968-1972 Five-Year Plan -were largely attained. As a consequence,
the targets for the years 1970-1972 were raised by about 25 percent,
with most of the increases allocated to irrigation, other agricultural
projects and transportation. Public savings have also risen steadily
in recent years, helped by higher tax rates and by collection of arrears.
Prices have been stable.
21.    A fundarental problem in Knorocco is the worsening unerployment
situation, with its serious social and economic implicat-ions being
felt most severely in the cities, to which migration from the country-
side is continued at a rapid pace. The net additions to the labor
force are partly being reduced by emigration, but the current pace
of new investment is failing to absorb the excess labor. Agrarian
reform should also help in absorbing excess labor, but implementation
of the Agrarian Reform Law passed in 1969 has been slow. In the long
term, a family planning program. much more vigorous than tihe present
one will be necessary.
22.    Tourism has continued to expand rapidly in recent years
and receipts from tourism and from emigrant workers remittances
have become important sources of foreign exchange. The improvement
in the balance of payments in 1969 was due mainly to increases in
these receipts together ;4th reduced wheat imports and a high olive
oil export.   Howsever, comnodity exports in general have risen slowly
and although net foreign exchange reserves rose in 1969, they remained
at the equivalent of only one and one-half month's imports.
23.    Noroccots publicly guaranteed external debt increased at an
average rate of 15 percent between 1964-1969 to reach a value of
$570 million in January 1970. The ratio of public debt service
payments rose from about 3 percent in 1964 to about 8 percent in
1969, and may reach 12 percent by 1976, and close to 20 percent in
the early 1980's. The continuation of concessionary aid in the
next few years is needed to prevent the debt burden from rising
to an excessively high level. Neverthelessn, Morocco remains able
to undertake substantial additional borrowing on conventional terms.
24.    A Consultative Group for IKorocco met in October 1969 and
i1ovember 2270. The next meeting is planned for October 1971.

PART VI - M14PLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGRERENT
25.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - REODI2ENDATION
26.    I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
