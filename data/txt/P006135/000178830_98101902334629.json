(a) help\n            carry out a gas appraisal program, including seismic data\n            collection and drilling of wells, which would enable Bolivia\n            to prove sufficient reserves of natural gas to satisfy the\n            domestic market and undertake further gas exports; (b)\n            assist YPFB to initiate secondary recovery in the Monteagudo\n            oil field. The project consists of: (a) a 14-well appraisal\n            drilling program; (b) an initial phase oil secondary\n            recovery project plant in Monteagudo; (c) a 1,600 line-km\n            seismic survey, with data processing and interpretation of\n            such 1,600 line-km and of additional 700 line-km of previous\n            seismic surveys, reprocessing and reinterpretation of an\n            additional 250 line-km seismic survey, all for certification\n            of gas reserves; and (d) a study of Bolivia's domestic\n            gas market and a pre-feasibility study of a gas export\n            project. The project would be a necessary and important step\n            for Bolivia to increase significantly its gas exports and\n            hence its foreign exchange earnings."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
