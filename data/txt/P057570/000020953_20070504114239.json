Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) There is a trade-off between the number\n            of project towns and the level of effective engagement with\n            local governments, especially in Bhutan; 2) Clear\n            implementation arrangements and identification of capacity\n            constraints are paramount in a project, especially with\n            decentralized implementation responsibilities; 3) Monitoring\n            capacities need to be strengthened in central government\n            institutions; 4) Land development components require careful\n            preparation and cannot be simply subsumed as an offshoot of\n            civil works; 5) Township planning workshops should be part\n            of preparation not implementation; and 6) More attention\n            should be paid to ensure cultural coherence in urban\n            planning. Historically, Bhutan has been almost entirely\n            rural in terms of its patterns of human settlement.\n            Therefore, urban planning efforts need to be carefully\n            considered in terms of their coherence and congruence with\n            local norms, such as the layout of villages and esthetic\n            features of settlement areas."}, "docdt": "2007-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
