The\n            following measures are recommended for mitigation: Water\n            resources will be monitored and water treated to maintain\n            water quality, particularly during monsoon periods. The\n            district network system will be improved by replacing\n            defective pipes and connections, and improving skills in\n            pipelaying, as well as providing better materials, more\n            quality control during construction, more regular\n            maintenance, and civic education. More properly ventilated\n            pit latrines will be built and households with septic tanks\n            provided de-sludging and disposal facilities. Play-and-use\n            toilets will be built in the town centers. A public\n            awareness campaign will be aimed at making households\n            responsible for keeping local drains clean. Staff will be\n            trained to identify, prepare, and maintain solid waste\n            disposal sites. Garbage separation and recycling will be\n            activated through a public education campaign. Conservation\n            of significant heritage sites will require increased\n            attention to proper land use and zoning regulations and\n            their enforcement. Where rivers are eroding their banks in\n            some of the project towns, erosion control and protection\n            measures will be taken."}, "docdt": "1999-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
