Some lessons learned included:\n            to provide assistance effectively to ten towns (or more), an\n            operation requires a wholesale project design that provides\n            Bank support through a country intermediary. The Bank cannot\n            provide hands-on retail assistance to so many\n            municipalities, especially with Bhutan's challenging\n            logistics for access. With no strong country-level\n            intermediary, the scope of a retail project should be\n            limited to fewer towns. The project experience clearly\n            demonstrates the need for building greater capacity for\n            local authorities to assess the efficiency of their\n            investments, especially to help them avoid losses from\n            sub-projects that, having incurred considerable costs, are\n            left idle and thereby generating few or no benefits.\n            Baselines must be clearly drawn and identified at appraisal\n            not only to make final evaluation more robust, but also to\n            be sure that a project is focused clearly at the outset upon\n            priority areas of need highlighted by the baseline data. As\n            urbanization takes root and accelerates, as it is in Bhutan,\n            it is important for each city and town to prepare and\n            implement its own urban plan. The plan should assess its\n            potential for developing efficiently within any physical\n            constraints it might face, while respecting prevailing\n            cultural values in land use planning and layouts."}, "docdt": "2011-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
