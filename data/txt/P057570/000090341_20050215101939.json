Therefore, this plan is concerned with\n            only adverse impacts associated with the project and\n            mitigation measures to be considered. Out of the ten towns\n            funded under the project, eight towns involved private land\n            acquisition owned by 77 households. In order to ensure that\n            resettlement is completed prior to commencement of civil\n            works; the civil work is proposed to be taken up in those\n            stretches where land is free of settlement. A detailed\n            resettlement implementation plan (RIP) has been prepared\n            mainly based on the policy framework for land acquisition\n            and resettlement. The project will ensure that the\n            rehabilitation package will be implemented before civil\n            works are started."}, "docdt": "2005-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
