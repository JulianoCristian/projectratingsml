The project has two major components: 1) the\n            institutional development component will strengthen the\n            capacity of the Urban Development and Housing Division\n            (UDHD) and the project towns in urban planning development,\n            land use management and mapping, and planning/implementation\n            of urban development investments, focusing on adequate\n            operation and maintenance, in addition to appropriate\n            project management and monitoring of the UDHD, and the\n            project towns. This component will further support the\n            National Environmental Commission (NEC), in the development\n            of environmental guidelines for the urban sector, and, the\n            UDHD, for environmental codes of practice regarding solid\n            waste management; and, 2) the urban development component\n            will consist of water supply investments and chlorination\n            equipment, confined to the rehabilitation, and increased\n            capabilities of existing systems, as well as the\n            construction of some new schemes. The solid waste management\n            program will include a public information campaign, and,\n            comprehensive programs of training for waste management\n            personnel will be provided. In addition, sanitation of\n            septic tanks, and urban infrastructure, such as drains,\n            urban roads, and civic facilities will be provided."}, "docdt": "1999-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
