                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank Group for two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is
producing the expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through
the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
World Bank’s lending operations through fieldwork. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to
those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those
for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to
generate important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to
development policy operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of the Bhutan Urban
Development Project (Cr 3310) for which the World Bank approved a Credit of US$10.8
million equivalent on December 21, 1999 to finance the $12.2 million project. The Credit
closed on June 30, 2006, six months later than planned, with $10.6 million equivalent of
the credit disbursed and $0.68 million equivalent cancelled.

The report is based on a review of project documents, including the Implementation
Completion and Results Report, the Project Appraisal Document, legal documents and
project files, and on discussions held with Bank staff involved in the project in
Washington DC. An IEG mission visited Bhutan in December 2010 to review project
results and met with more than 15 key interlocutors including Royal Government of
Bhutan officials, representatives of nine of the ten project towns, as well as many local
beneficiaries. The mission conducted field visits to four project towns, namely Trongsa,
Jakar, Wangdue and Paro, where it carried out site inspections and discussed project
results with the users of the project infrastructure and services and the project staff.
Within the timeframe available to the mission, the IEG mission could not make the
protracted overland journeys required to visit all six remaining project towns. Prior to its
visit to Bhutan, therefore, IEG had invited municipal engineers of each of these six towns
to meet with the PPAR mission at the most convenient location for them in the country.
The response was excellent. The mission was able to hold discussions with
representatives of five of these remaining six towns. IEG gratefully acknowledges the
courtesies and attention of all these participants, and particularly the diligent responses of
the towns in providing the data requested by IEG, and their willingness to send
representatives to meet with the IEG Mission at central locations of the country.

IEG selected this operation for a PPAR field assessment to verify its results and their
sustainability four years after completion. This project evaluation will also serve as an
input into IEG’s ongoing review of infrastructure sustainability worldwide.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to government
officials and agencies for their review and comments. No comments were received.

Summary
During the implementation of the Bhutan Urban Development Project ($US 12.2 million,
1999-2006), Bhutan began a momentous and rapid shift from rural to urban living that is
projected to continue at a pace unmatched worldwide. Annual urban population growth
had been just 2.2 percent prior to the project. Now it is projected to continue at its current
7.2 percent rate. The stress of such growth upon urban infrastructure and services
challenges the government’s flagship pursuit of Gross National Happiness, a policy that
adds good governance, environmental protection and cultural preservation to boosting
economic growth. Indeed, Bhutan’s economy grew rapidly during project implementation
between 1999 and 2006. But rapid urbanization has seen urban infrastructure and service
deficits, persistent urban poverty, and high youth unemployment in towns where a
buoyant demand for labor is met by migrant workers. The ten towns assisted by the
project were small, between 1,500 and 7,500 inhabitants each. To address the towns’
development the government had no national urban policy during the project, but did
adopt a National Urbanization Strategy shortly thereafter, in 2008.

The project objective was to improve the quality-of-life in Bhutan’s secondary towns
through enhancing basic service coverage, while strengthening local financial and
institutional capacity to deliver urban services. It was substantially relevant to Bank
country strategies’ focus upon basic service provision, and the government’s latest Five-
Year Plan that seeks to make the secondary towns into more viable economic and social
centers. The project design, too, was substantially relevant for incorporating instruments
likely to help achieve this objective, notably providing the basic infrastructure that was
lacking in the towns, and a twin-track approach to strengthening urban service provision
capabilities at both the central and district levels.

Looking at planned versus actual investment and its distribution across towns, the project
was implemented much as intended. Among sectors, nearly half of actual project
investments were in roads and footpaths. The next largest set, attracting one third of all
project expenditures, was in water supply and sanitation. Project start up was delayed as
it took time for the district staff to settle into the procedures and processes of a World
Bank financed operation. But by completion, which required just one six-month exten-
sion, nearly all of the credit was disbursed, considerable infrastructure investments had
been made and district management was much stronger.

Although not always complete, data provided by the districts point to increased urban
service levels in all project towns. Thus, in most towns, water supply coverage after the
project was higher than before, thanks to the project investments in this sector. But more
water network connections themselves do not guarantee an improved water supply
service when supply shortfalls leave the connections dry, as in several project towns. This
is because the supply systems were not designed to meet the very rapidly growing
demand driven by accelerated urbanization, the dynamics of which were not evident until
after this project had closed. In some cases, inappropriate technical designs have led to
blockages of water intakes of treatment plants by natural debris brought down by heavy
rains during the monsoon.
                                             viii


Solid waste investments introduced regular collection services for the first time in most
towns, disposing of the garbage in project-financed landfills typically some 5-10 kms
from town. Project road and footpath investments point to improvements over the project
period, as the extent of the paved networks expanded. Wide public support for all major
investments was assured through open meetings to discuss and agree to priorities.

Each district administration strengthened its financial and institutional capacity during
project implementation. Most saw their fiscal positions strengthen considerably thanks to
larger transfers from central government. Half the project districts manage a budget today
four times larger than before, with the other districts not far behind. Hands-on experience
while implementing the project helped build in-house procurement management skills
more than formal courses did. Consultants hired to help implement the project provided,
as intended, training and technical assistance to help strengthen financial management
and project planning and design skills of the staff in the districts and later in government
too. The IEG mission saw current district financial management and data handling skills
in action in receiving reports it requested of project results prepared by the districts
specifically for this evaluation. The interaction of the government’s agency responsible
for the project, the Ministry of Works and Human Settlements, with the project districts
became intense during project implementation, but diminished thereafter.

Project implementation gave district teams a first taste of procuring works and equipment
on what was, for them, a relatively large scale. The learning process was not without its
delays and difficulties. But, at the end of the day, the hands-on experience of the project
helped prepare the districts for a much larger role in procurement than they had ever had
before in the country. After project closing, a new national procurement manual
conferred far greater responsibility upon districts than had been the case, which the
project experience had prepared them to bear.

Communications between project teams in the capital Thimphu and the district offices
across the country posed significant logistical challenges during implementation.
Overland travel by road in Bhutan can be very protracted and, without a domestic
network of airfields, air travel is not an option. Today’s communications among districts
and between them and the capital rely heavily upon email. Before they had to use
telephone and fax. Overcoming the challenges, project teams at different locations
interacted quite intensely. Project implementation gave these district or ―municipal‖
engineers and other local staff important on-the-job learning experiences to hone new
skills in procurement, contracting, and works supervision in particular.

One indication of improved quality-of-life can be measured by better public health
outcomes. The incidence of diarrhea and dysentery—one measure of possible health
benefits arising from the kind of water and sanitation investments made by the project—
fell more rapidly during 1999-2009 in project districts than in districts not assisted by the
project. But this indicator varied considerably across the project districts, suggesting that
project water investment alone may not be the full explanation of the benefit observed.
More research and additional data would be needed to draw definitive conclusions about
the public health results of this project. In the meantime, the project also brought other
quality-of-life improvements, notably cleaner and safer streets and generally better road
access, notably during the monsoon.
                                             ix



Project economic rates of return (ERRs) at appraisal of 20.7 percent and at completion of
25.8 percent, covering one third of project investments (the water component) probably
overstate the likely benefits. Time saved from not having to collect water and savings of
drugs and hospital care may not be so significant given the relatively small numbers of
beneficiaries. On the other hand, there is evidence of efficiency shortcomings in the
performance of key project components, notably urban subdivisions that remain unused
and some water supply systems that operate only a few hours per day. Hence overall
efficiency is rated modest.

The overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory as the project achieved its
substantially relevant objective of improving the quality-of-life through better urban
services, albeit with moderate shortcomings. These include a completed but unused
subdivision infrastructure in one town and the less than full operation of some water
supply systems. The risk to development outcome is rated Moderate given the technical
difficulties of operating and maintaining some project infrastructure, and the challenges
of responding in timely ways to Bhutan’s accelerating urbanization and exploding
demand for urban services. Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory overall,
where a stronger performance during supervision made up for a weak project design at
entry. Borrower performance is rated Satisfactory overall, with strong central
government ownership of and commitment to the project, while initially weak
implementation performance by some district administrations strengthened as experience
was gained during project implementation. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) is rated
Negligible, being almost non-existent at appraisal, and subsequently impossible to
implement and utilize.

LESSONS

   To provide assistance effectively to ten towns (or more), an operation requires a
    wholesale project design that provides Bank support through a country intermediary.
    The Bank cannot provide hands-on retail assistance to so many municipalities,
    especially with Bhutan’s challenging logistics for access. With no strong country-
    level intermediary, the scope of a retail project should be limited to fewer towns.
   The project experience clearly demonstrates the need for building greater capacity for
    local authorities to assess the efficiency of their investments, especially to help them
    avoid losses from sub-projects that, having incurred considerable costs, are left idle
    and thereby generating few or no benefits.
   Baselines must be clearly drawn and identified at appraisal not only to make final
    evaluation more robust, but also to be sure that a project is focused clearly at the
    outset upon priority areas of need highlighted by the baseline data.
   As urbanization takes root and accelerates, as it is in Bhutan, it is important for each
    city and town to prepare and implement its own urban plan. The plan should assess its
    potential for developing efficiently within any physical constraints it might face,
    while respecting prevailing cultural values in land use planning and layouts.
   Public health benefits may be achieved through improved urban infrastructure and
    services even when these services are not operating at peak efficiency—when piped
    water supply is interrupted, for example. But evaluations of these impacts should
                                        x


always consider other possible causes of the public health impacts to make
convincing attribution to the operation under review. They also need count upon a

 1. Background: Bhutan’s Accelerating Urbanization
 1.1     The Bhutan Urban Development Project reviewed here was implemented during
 1999-2006, a period of shifts of the rural population from economically declining rural areas
 into towns at unprecedented rates in the country’s history. The sites of some current towns,
 such as the old capital and project town Trongsa, for instance, were not always chosen for
 their economic potential. With uneven topography, some sites can be very challenging to
 develop (Figs. 1-2). In
 1998 before this project,
 just 7.1 percent of
 Bhutan’s population
 lived in urban areas. By
 project completion in
 2006, the urban
 population share was 33
 percent. Currently, the
 proportion is projected to
 reach 73 percent by 2020
 (RGOB 2008 p. 29).
 Although on a small
 absolute scale, the
 acceleration and speed of
 urbanization in Bhutan
 are unmatched worldwide.        Figure 1. Trongsa's challenging site (from across canyon)
 From a modest 2.2 percent
 per annum before the project (Habitat 2001 p. 274), the annual growth of Bhutan’s urban
 population accelerated to the 5-6 percent per annum range during project implementation and
 is now projected to continue at its current 7.3 percent. Rapid urbanization like this quickly

protection and the preservation of Bhutanese cultural values (RGOB 2009). Bhutan’s
economy grew at a buoyant 7.5 percent per annum during the 2000 – 2006 project
implementation. GDP per capita, US$728 at project approval in 1999, rose to US$1,831 by
2009. Up-market tourism and hydroelectric power for export—that generates little
employment—are the main drivers of economic and urban development today. Rapid
economic growth leaves its problems, however. A weak demand for labor leaves 23 percent
of the population still affected by poverty and high urban unemployment among young
people especially.1 Urban services are in short supply as demands grow and urban planning
cannot keep up with the need for greater service provision.

  According to the 2009 Labour Force Survey by the Ministry of Labour, youth unemployment in that year
reached 13 percent, up from 9.9 percent in 2007. According to the ministry, the reasons include: high rural-
urban migration, saturation in government jobs, and a mismatch between skills available and the economy’s
needs: http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=13328 IEG currently
has an ongoing study reviewing the Bank’s work on skills building and youth employment worldwide.

But in 2008, shortly after project closing, the government’s Ministry of Works and Human
Settlement (MOWHS), with the help of the Cities Alliance, provided the missing policy
framework when it launched the Bhutan National Urbanization Strategy that aims at more
efficiency in rapid urbanization, ensuring a favorable impact upon the poor, and greater
urban development responsibilities by the districts. The strategy identifies three groups of
districts in Bhutan: (i) the more developed; (ii) the moderately developed; and (iii) the less
developed. The eight project districts are represented in all three groups (Table 1.1).

substantially relevant to the latest 2010 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Bhutan that

p. 2. The objective formulation was
identical in both sources.            - The project towns in Bhutan were: Jakar, Duksum, Lhuentse, Paro,

highlights the importance of addressing infrastructure and capacity building at the district
level throughout the country (2010 CPS p. 22), essential ingredients for improving service
delivery. At the time of appraisal, the objective was consistent with the call of the 1999
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Bank to support Bhutan’s own priorities in
investment in physical infrastructure and social services. The objective was also substantially
relevant mid-term to the 2005 CAS’s aim to strengthen public sector management and
provide better access to infrastructure for low-income people especially. Today the project
objective remains highly relevant to the government’s current Tenth (2008-2013) Five-Year
Plan that proposes investments in urban infrastructure and services in order to make the
towns more viable centers ―to live and invest in‖ (RGOB 2009 p. 34). It is also relevant to
                                                        4


the recent BNUS’s aim of consolidating the nation’s urban system through strengthening the
performance of district administrations throughout the country.

2.2     Relevance of design - Substantial: The project’s provision of basic infrastructure
was an appropriate means, working through the results chain, of improving the quality-of-life
in towns where potable water and basic sanitation deficits and sometimes impassable urban
streets and access roads constrained development potential. Project infrastructure was geared
to tackling these shortcomings. Project institutional development actions at both the central
and district levels that accounted for 12 percent of expected project costs were substantially
relevant instruments for strengthening Bhutan’s financial and institutional capacity to deliver
urban services. Strengthening the planning and implementation of urban investments were
the direct inputs into the results chain needed to achieve the desired outcomes of better
central and local government performance in these areas. At the central level, project TA
helped MOWHS better oversee urban service delivery throughout the country and take on a
key role of policy interlocutor for the Bank and others. At the local level, formal project
training in procurement and financial management and the hands-on experience of
implementing the project itself were good ways to build service delivery capacity.



3. Implementation Experience
3.1     The project was implemented much as intended in terms of the total investment and
allocations per town (Table 3.1). The actual implementation arrangements were also those
planned, with each district administration responsible for implementing the individually
planned project investments in its town(s), and technical oversight and assistance provided
by MOWHS. The four largest participants, Wangdue, Paro, Jakar and Trongsa, that together
accounted for two-thirds of project expenditures, were visited by IEG’s PPAR mission.

3.2      Across sectors, nearly half of actual project investments were in roads and footpaths,
such as building and re-paving urban streets and access roads, improving storm drainage and
laying in footpath access around town. Water supply and sanitation was the next largest
project sector, accounting for one third of all project expenditures. Most project investments
in this sector were in water collection from safe sources, its treatment and distribution to
private in-house connections and public standpipes.2 Investments in roads and water were
made in all ten towns. Project investments in drainage, solid waste collection and disposal,
and other works were on a smaller scale and were not made in all towns.

3.3     Project startup, when the first disbursement was made, was delayed as district staff
were unfamiliar with the procedures of a World Bank financed operation and took time to
follow them. As local teams became more accustomed to them, disbursements picked up a
good rhythm around mid-term. At completion, requiring just one six-month extension to
finish all components, nearly all of the credit was disbursed.

 The project made small investments, accounting for less than 0.03 percent of project costs, specifically in
sanitation consisting of building and renovating eight new public toilet blocks.
                                                                       5


3.4      During implementation, communication between project teams in MOWHS in the
capital Thimphu and in those in district offices across the country proved challenging. Travel
along narrow and winding mountain roads was (and remains) the only option for access,
taking up to 20 hours to the most distant project town Trashiyangtse, for instance. Logistical
challenges such as these discouraged many donors from supporting projects outside Bhutan’s
capital. At project startup, telecommunication was only possible by fax and phone. It is a
little easier today, with more than half the towns able to rely upon email.

3.5     Overcoming these challenges, project teams in the different towns and the capital
interacted frequently during project implementation. District officials regularly compared
notes on project progress with colleagues from other towns. The Bumthang district, located
in the geographical center of the country, was a popular venue for such encounters, as it was
for most of IEG’s meetings with municipal engineers from the more remote towns. Project
                                               6


implementation gave these municipal engineers from the districts considerable on-the-job
learning experiences, honing new skills in procurement, contracting and works supervision.

3.6      Districts’ adaptation to a much larger scale of business stimulated by the project was
at first challenging. Wangdue district even recommended in the Borrower’s Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR) that the first two years of a project should concentrate
solely on project planning and preparatory studies to build up this capacity before full scale
implementation takes off (ICR p. 48). District staff were unfamiliar with using the financial
management system software required by the World Bank. It proved to be incompatible with
existing government systems. Financial reports had to be resubmitted several times in both
systems, resulting in delayed disbursements and late payments to contractors.
Communication difficulties prevented more remote districts especially from receiving timely
assistance and advice needed.

3.7      The project later helped participating districts overcome these problems, however, by
hiring outside technical experts to provide advisory services to government and to the
districts in the areas of project management and local finances. It also provided training for
project staff, although this was done on an ad hoc basis in response to requests by staff
members themselves. Against these difficult odds, districts familiarized themselves with
project and broader financial management. Project accounts were subsequently submitted in
a timely fashion for annual audits that carried no serious qualifications. Furthermore, IEG’s
own experience with the project districts confirms their in-house financial management
capability. They were able to promptly provide accurate project financial information in
response to IEG requests.

SAFEGUARDS

3.8       Greater local institutional capacity enabled districts to comply with Bank involuntary
resettlement safeguards. In Bumthang, for example, the district prepared a resettlement action
plan to allow the new Dekiling township subdivision to go ahead. That a few resettled
families chose to question the terms of their relocation points to the operation of the
consultation and grievance processes required by this safeguard. The Bank had no objection
to the government’s environmental assessment for this category B project, prepared prior to
appraisal. The assessment paid particular attention to the operation’s water, sanitation and
solid waste components. During implementation the project complied with environmental
safeguards. In field visits, the IEG mission gathered no evidence of non-compliance. The
environment will require close scrutiny in the future, however, because of: (i) increased
production of wastewater (following greater water consumption) and the need to collect and
treat it; and (ii) the urgency of assuring basic treatment of a growing volume of solid waste to
avoid leachate pollution of the otherwise pristine valleys where the landfills are located.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E)

3.9     The project did not provide for an M&E system at appraisal, leaving it to the project
manager to establish one during implementation (PAD p. 5). Launching a new operation
without a clear idea of the direction toward its target and how to measure progress tells us
that the quality of the M&E design was negligible. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
                                                                        7


did list ―performance indicators‖ but these included ―beneficiary satisfaction‖, and ―district
capability of fulfilling its urban service responsibilities‖, without saying how they could be
measured (PAD p. 15). With a weak design like this, M&E implementation could barely take
off, but district authorities did improve their data collection to monitor the implementation of
the project itself, thanks to their experience with the project. Nevertheless, M&E utilization
moved forward only slowly, leaving both national and local authorities for much of the time
in the dark over what the project was or was not achieving.

DELIVERY OF PROJECT URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES

4.2     For water supply there were large increases in the number of people served between
1999 and 2009 in five of the districts for which data is available (Table 4.1). While there
were more connections, however, this does mean that water was always available through
them. In Trongsa and Wangdue, for example, IEG learned from local residents and district
engineers that water provided through the project is available only a few hours per day. A
similar problem was reported for Rangjung town in Trashigang district. The lack of water in
these connections results from supply systems that cannot meet the growing demand and
from blockages to intakes of water treatment plants by natural debris brought down during
heavy monsoon rains. Water supply in other towns, notably Paro and Jakar performed better.
Their systems included backup intakes and treatment tanks to ensure a 24 hour supply.
District engineers reported similar 24-hour water services in Tingtibi and Lhuentse.

4.3     Local residents and business people were forthcoming in describing the water service
to the IEG mission and readily gave their opinions about it (out of ear-shot of local officials
accompanying the mission). In all towns visited, they reported the quality of the water itself
was good. Their assessment was based upon how they perceived its appearance, smell, and
taste and from sickness in the family from contamination of water supplies.

4.4     Along with the infrastructure, the project proposed the idea of levying tariffs on water
consumption for the first time in the case of all the project towns except Paro. Residents told
the IEG mission that they found the tariffs, averaging US$0.02/m3 to be affordable. They
also reported that they indeed did pay these charges. But empirical data on actual revenue
collection and the actual operations and maintenance (O&M) costs of the services is not
available in each town to show us the share of O&M costs actually covered by user charges
collected. The very low water tariff set, however, is unlikely to generate significant direct
cost recovery in the short run. Not from empirical observation but from modeling
hypothetical results, the ICR itself concluded that a 40-fold increase in water tariffs would be
needed to fully cover O&M costs (ICR p. 26). There is little incentive to adopt such increases
while alternative government revenues flows to the subnational level remain strong.

4.5     For the six towns reporting baseline and endline data, solid waste collection and
disposal service coverage increased over the decade (Table 4.1). Residents interviewed by
IEG during field visits spoke of fairly regular collection services where there had been none
before. Collections are now made in an open trailer pulled by a tractor (Fig, 3). The project
also built solid waste disposal sites for most towns, consisting of walled compounds typically
located some 5-10 kms from the respective town center, where agreements on a chosen site
were reached among landowners, the public and the district. As planned, waste disposal was
into enclosures specially built by the project. Treatment remains rudimentary, with
compaction and soil cover, but with leachate collection into small treatment ponds.

4.6     Paved roads provision under the project ranged from re-paving existing streets to
laying out complete networks with associated storm drains and utility services in new
subdivisions. Five towns reported baseline and endline data that in three cases showed a
                                                         9


significant expansion of paved streets in their towns (Table 4.2).3 The IEG mission
inspections of project road investments in four towns found works completed to a high
standard, and still fully operational five years after they were built. Residents in all four
towns told the mission that the investments represented a significant improvement over the
previous conditions of unpaved streets prone to flooding and, at times, impassable.




Figure 3. Solid waste collection - Wangdue
4.7     Footpaths were built in all the project towns, but at exactly what cost is not known
since these investments were accounted for together with the roads. In the town of Trongsa,
the IEG mission saw project footpaths constituting a new network allowing pedestrians to
access the town’s dzong, or fortified monastery, from all parts of the town (Fig. 4). Most
were well built, but a few poorly constructed having been laid upon unstable foundations of
steep waterlogged slopes.

4.8      All project components were intended to enjoy public support. MOWHS told IEG
that all towns held public meetings to seek agreement on the priorities for project
investments. District officials confirmed that such meetings were held. Evidence that these
meetings were not just rubber-stamping top-down decisions already taken comes from Paro.
The town that had to forego a new solid waste disposal site for the lack of public agreement
about where to locate it. The project itself conducted a beneficiary survey in 2007 in three

3
 Trashiyangtse District’s report of no improvement in its two project towns may be an error, since there had
been significant project investment in this sector in at least one of them (Table 3.1). This is more likely to have
been repaving existing streets than constructing completely new ones.
                                                 10


towns, Rangjung, Tingtibi and Zhemgang, that found 80 percent of local residents were
satisfied with the improvements in urban services provided through the project (ICR p. 12)

4.9      In summary, project infrastructure investments in several sub-sectors yielded
important outputs through providing more urban infrastructure and services in towns that had
little prior to the operation. Where there is baseline data, the project impact upon urban


    Figure 4. Footpath access to the dzong – Trongsa




 Figure 4. Footpath to the Dzong - Trongsa
services is evident at the level of the project districts (Table 4.1). The scope of improvements
in water, solid waste and paved roads cannot be readily measured for the lack of before-
project baseline data in half the towns. The same is true for nearly all towns as far as
footpaths are concerned. Although the data set is still incomplete, district administrations’
efforts in collecting this data (at IEG’s request) is commendable. At the same time, however,
it points to the need to always assemble this data as part of project preparation and appraisal.
Even the incomplete data set currently available shows that many of the project’s
infrastructure outputs that contribute to the principal project quality-of-life result that is
assessed and rated later in this chapter of the PPAR.

DELIVERY OF LOCAL FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY

4.10 Assistance came mostly in the form of consultants’ support to help districts
implement the project itself through better procurement, construction supervision, and
financial management. As planned, consultants were hired for this purpose by MOWHS.
They were made available to districts on an as-needed basis. In the process of receiving this
support, district staff learned most on-the-job. Urban planning, too, was identified at
appraisal as a target for district-level technical assistance, but little was done in this area for
                                              11


lack of local demand. Learning by doing also came from the much larger financial operations
that the districts had to manage. Since project startup, the eight participating districts have

4.11 seen their budgets multiply. By 2009 their combined annual budget was US$50.4
million, three times higher than their 1999 budget of US$16.9 million. Half the project
districts, Trongsa, Wangdue, Lhuentse and Trashiyangtse, now manage a budget four times
larger than before, with other districts’ budgets more than doubling.

4.12 Project support to the implementation of the operation itself gave several district
teams their first experiences of procuring works and equipment on a relatively large scale.
Altogether, 85 percent of project spending went to private contractors whose work was
procured through competitively bid contracts. Shouldering this new responsibility was not
without its problems for the districts, however. District authorities had to re-draft bidding
documents several times to ensure they met Bank guidelines. Local decisions on pre-
selection and selection in procurement could become protracted too. These initially led to
delays, but processing sped up as officials in the towns and in the capital became more
familiar with the procedures. The project’s procurement advisor resident in Thimphu was key
in building up this capacity, mostly through answering frequently asked questions from the
towns. In untried territory such as this, it is notable that no case of mis-procurement was
recorded, nor were the complaints commonly fielded by unsuccessful bidders more than
normal.

4.13 Districts’ learning by doing procurement through project implementation set them up
to take on a much greater role in Bhutan after the project. With help of the Asian Develop-
ment Bank (ADB), the Ministry of Finance (MOF) developed a new national procurement
policy. It included a completely new 2009 procurement manual that raised the ceiling for
district-level responsibility to contracts up to US$1.5 million, twice the 1997 limit. District
staff accounted for 50 percent of the participants in MOF’s training program for the new
manual. The new policy and manual place districts center stage in the public sector
procurement. The project experience helped prepare them to take on this new responsibility.

RESULTS IN BETTER QUALITY-OF-LIFE THROUGH THE ENHANCED LEVEL AND COVERAGE
OF SERVICES

4.14 An important dimension of a better quality-of-life is improved public health that may
result from improved water and sanitation services of the type provided under this project.
With the help of MOWHS, IEG assembled data that, with further research and evaluation,
could point definitively to a positive project impact. It used Ministry of Health indicators of
the incidence of diarrhea and dysentery in the population. They show 1,394 cases of diarrhea
per 10,000 inhabitants in the project districts before the project in 1999, higher than the
equivalent national figure of 1,135 for that year (Table 4.2). By 2009, the same indicator for
the project districts had fallen to 934, lower than the equivalent national figure of 986. By
itself, however, this data cannot constitute definitive evidence of the better health
performance of the project districts than the non-project districts for three reasons, however.
First there was considerable variance of trends in diarrhea and dysentery across the
individual project districts. It worsened in Paro and Bumthang two important client districts
where the project made its largest water supply investments (Table 3.1), while there were
                                                     12


dramatic improvements in the other districts (except Trongsa) with smaller project water
investments. The results across the project districts do not show a correlation between project
water investments and health indicators. Second, data on trends in diarrhea and dysentery of
individual non-project districts are not available for this evaluation. That means that we do
not know how large the variance was among these 12 other districts that did not participate in
the project. Third, one would have to take into account the direct health investments and
programs in all of the districts that might have affected diarrhea and dysentery. Thus, further
data would be needed to draw definitive evaluation conclusions. But the information
available thus far does point to interesting possibilities that such conclusions might
eventually be drawn.

4.15 Such an impact was on the
minds of the designers and self-        Table 4-2. Public Health Improvement in Project

4.16 From their own perspective, individual town residents told the IEG mission about
their better quality-of-life thanks to receiving some urban services for the first time, such as
piped in-house water supply—even if not 24 hour—and solid waste collection. Their views
on the project’s investments in roads and footpaths concurred with the opinions of local
officials that the improvements led to a better quality-of-life, thanks to flood prevention and
better access. In one case, the perception of the improvement was dramatic, as in the
township of Jakar, where the project’s strengthening river embankments lessened the risk of
catastrophic damage from glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) through the Bumthang River
fed by a large melting glacier upstream.

4.17   On balance, efficacy is rated substantial.

EFFICIENCY

The appraisal estimated a project economic rate of return (ERR) of 20.7 percent based upon
transparently quantified economic benefits of: (i) time saved by beneficiaries not having to
collect water; (ii) health cost savings (of drugs and hospital care), and (iii) incremental
tourism revenues (PAD pp. 23-24). The ICR re-estimate, based upon the same benefits (and
similar costs), yielded an ERR of 25.8 percent. Both estimates refer to the project water
investments only, accounting for about one third of project costs. Both ERR estimates would
likely be lower with more conservative and realistic measurements of benefits. Time saved in
collecting water, involving one daily one round trip of 72 meters less and no more waiting in
line, may not be so significant. The savings of drugs and hospital care might also not be so
significant when costs are low and few people were likely to fall ill. Reduction of morbidity
and mortality might measure health benefits of these kinds of benefits better. On the tourism
side of the benefits highlighted by the PAD and the ICR, only part of Bhutan’s incremental
tourism revenues should be attributed to a project not aimed explicitly at tourism and which
invested in several project towns off the beaten tourist track. Although not reported by the
ICR, ERRs of project investments in roads and footpaths could easily have been measured, as
they have been in similar Bank-financed projects elsewhere. Typically, benefits from such
investments can be estimated from the increased real estate values that arise from the
improved urban infrastructure that better serves these properties. Such benefits are likely to
be high given the acute shortages of infrastructure prior to the project and the rapid rate of
urban growth in recent years. On the other hand, the poor performance of individual
components, notably the completed but unused subdivision in Jakar (Fig 5) and the

underperformance of some town water supply systems, point to losses of efficiency, leading
to this PPAR’ s modest efficiency rating.

5. Ratings
OUTCOME

5.1      Rated Moderately Satisfactory. The rating derives from the moderate shortcomings
in the project’s achievement of its substantially relevant objective and design, and modest
efficiency in doing so. The project helped substantially improve the quality-of-life through
better urban services supported by the public, and laid the foundation for financial and
institutional capacity strengthening (realized by the districts after project closing). Positive
evidence of these outcomes comes from a better quality-of-life of the project towns through a
decline in waterborne diseases thanks to the improved water supply for most, and better
access and reduced flooding thanks to project road and drainage improvements. There were
moderate shortcomings, however. They included a completed but unused subdivision
infrastructure and some water supply systems that cannot function effectively during the
monsoon due to blockages of intakes by natural debris brought down by heavy rains during
that season. There was less uncertainty about these results at the time of IEG’s PPAR mission
at the end of 2010 than there was at closing in mid-2006.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

5.2     Rated Moderate. Ensuring resilient benefit flows from the project investments into
the future will be a challenge, but one to which the district governments can rise. On the
technical side, some districts have experienced difficulties in keeping water supply services
in operation. Each district needs to build up it urban planning capabilities, targeted for
improvement, but neglected by the project. Better urban planning will enable local
government to respond to the rapidly growing demand for urban infrastructure and services
arising from Bhutan’s accelerated urbanization. Financially, it would appear that district
governments are consolidating their fiscal positions through additional transfers from the
center. Fiscal transfers are key to financial sustainability, since direct cost recovery from
project investments has been only at a very low level thus far. While local ownership of the
project and commitment to its goals have remained strong, districts will need to give more
attention to the efficient use of the infrastructure provided. Also, local M&E capacity needs
to be strengthened to help central and local government alike to be promptly aware of
changes in project performance to inform in a timely manner when corrective action is
needed.

BANK PERFORMANCE

5.3     Rated Moderately Satisfactory overall. Quality at entry is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. The project design paid only scant attention to the economic and financial
analysis of the operation. The economic analysis mistakenly attributed all the benefits of all
Bhutan’s growing foreign tourism to a small project in the country’s secondary towns that
had no specific tourism objective or component. The financial analysis did not point to cost
recovery targets, nor did it appraise the fiscal capacity of the districts to carry out and operate
                                                       15


the project at the outset. The neglect of M&E meant that there were no baseline measures of
urban service provision, for instance, to benchmark project achievements. Using a retail
project design, where project interventions are planned and executed individually for each
town, set up enormous logistical challenges during implementation to reach all ten towns
spread across the country, with different degrees of inaccessibility.4 IEG itself was only able
to visit four of the ten towns within the time constraints of its own PPAR mission. The
project design would also have been stronger had it been geared toward the process of rapid
urbanization that Bhutan is now experiencing, but the scale of this was not clear at the time
of appraisal in 1999. The implications of Bhutan’s rapidly accelerating urbanization were
only fully understood after project closing (RGOB 2008. On the other hand, the operation’s
focus upon Bhutan’s secondary towns meant that the project was well coordinated with other
donors’ programs such as the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) and DANIDA’s that
assisted the larger towns, particularly with road improvements.5 Supervision is rated
moderately satisfactory with missions focused upon the project’s intended outcome, while at
the same time, attending to detailed fiduciary matters, especially guiding and checking
procurement management at the district level. Missions were fielded regularly, but with
insufficient time to always make the long road journeys necessary to reach all the project
towns. Supervision missions could only visit two towns, Tingtibi and Trashiyantse, one time
each over a nearly ten-year period. Several planned visits had to be abandoned because fo
landslides blocking access roads to these towns. Nevertheless, and together with the
oversight provided by MOWHS from Thimphu, project supervision did help the districts
develop new skills in procurement as noted earlier in this PPAR. Supervision reporting was
candid about the challenges and shortcomings that project implementation encountered.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.4     Rated Satisfactory overall. Government performance, understood here to be that of
MOWHS and other central government ministries in Thimphu, is rated Satisfactory. The
national authorities showed strong ownership and commitment to the project through day-to-
day contact especially with the districts. Since the project was financed 100 percent by the
IDA Credit, government ownership could not be expressed through counterpart funding
contributions as it can be in other operations. The government engaged intensively with the
participating districts in providing support and technical assistance needed during project
implementation, especially on procurement, for example. Implementing agency performance,
understood here to be that of the district authorities responsible for the project towns, is rated

  IEG found from evaluating Bank-financed municipal development projects worldwide that a large number of
municipalities, such as the ten under this project, are generally better assisted through a ―wholesale‖ project
design, in which an Bank assistance to towns and cities is typically through a financial and operational
intermediary that has considerable autonomy in providing support to individual municipalities (World Bank
2009).
5
  The PAD noted that the World Bank should not invest in larger towns where development assistance was
already considerable (PAD p. 6). Since then, Bank assistance has extended to include Thimpu, through a
follow-on Second Urban Development Project, whose IDA Credit of US$12.0 million to finance 94 percent of
the project was approved in April 2010. Its objectives focus on strengthening municipal finance and
management systems in Thimphu and Phuentsholing and improving infrastructure services in northern Thimphu
where no formal services are currently available. The Credit was made effective in August 2010 and the first
disbursement has been made.

Satisfactory. District engineers and other staff took on the additional responsibilities of
project implementation willingly, and completed most of the works on time, helping their
districts take on their much larger responsibilities today in managing Bhutan’s transition to
urban development. In the towns visited by IEG, there were many instances of beneficiary
involvement in the choices of project infrastructure investments. While project components
were made ready for implementation, delays occurred in the early part of project
implementation as district administrations adjusted to the new scale and complexity of the
work introduced by the project. In spite of these challenges, no case of mis-procurement at
the district level was reported under the project. With the project’s weak M&E, the district
authorities could do little to take monitoring forward. At the request of IEG, they providing
consistent data that helped illustrate the project results in their towns thus far, and which
served to inform this PPAR’s evaluation.

6. Lessons
6.1    To provide assistance effectively to ten towns (or more), an operation requires a
wholesale project design that provides Bank support through a country intermediary. The
Bank cannot provide hands-on retail assistance to so many municipalities, especially with
Bhutan’s challenging logistics for access. With no strong country-level intermediary, the
scope of a retail project should be limited to fewer towns.

6.2     The project experience clearly demonstrates the need for building greater capacity for
local authorities to assess the efficiency of their investments, especially to help them avoid
losses from sub-projects that, having incurred considerable costs, are left idle and thereby
generating few or no benefits.

6.3     Baselines must be clearly drawn and identified at appraisal not only to make final
evaluation more robust, but also to be sure that a project is focused clearly at the outset upon
priority areas of need highlighted by the baseline data.

6.4     As urbanization takes root and accelerates as it is doing in Bhutan, it is important for
each city and town to prepare and implement its own urban plan. The plan should assess its
potential for developing efficiently within any physical constraints it might face, while
respecting prevailing cultural values in land use planning and layouts.

6.5    Public health benefits may be achieved through improved urban infrastructure and
services even when these services are not operating at peak efficiency—when piped water
supply is interrupted, for example. But evaluations of these impacts should always consider
other possible causes of the public health impacts to make convincing attribution to the
operation under review. They also need count upon a decent M&E system to reliably
measure the baselines and the results obtained.

Annex B. Specific Results from Project Towns
1.      The IEG mission made fieldtrips to four project towns in the in eastern and central
regions of Bhutan, namely: Paro, Wangdue, Trongsa and Jakar, where the IEG mission was
able to meet with local officials and project beneficiaries and inspect project investments in
situ (see Map at end of this report). During the field trip, the mission interviewed staff of the
remaining districts who travelled to Jakar and Trongsa for meetings with the mission. This
annex highlights more detailed findings of those visits.

TRONGSA

2.      This town, a former capital of Bhutan located some six hours by road to the east of
Thimphu, has a very challenging physical site for its urban development. The town expanded
around the sixteenth century dzong, or fortified monastery, located on a rock promontory that
strategically overlooks the deep canyon of the Sankosh River below. With very little flat land
for building, project investments sometimes took unexpected forms. Project-built
―footpaths‖, for instance, consisted mostly of stairways and steps to and from the dzong (Fig.
5). Most were well built and are still functioning, but IEG noted one section beginning to
collapse due to the instability of its foundation of waterlogged soil on a steep slope. Road
access to and from the dzong was improved through repaving that is still in good condition
five years after it was laid. It was in intensive use during IEG’s visit. The road drainage on
these roads along these steep slopes was in good condition.

3.       A new town center plaza financed by the project had to be built upon a raised plat-
form, as there was no space for a conventional square (Figs 7 and 8). It was well constructed
and in use by local residents, but in need of more maintenance. A park bench in the plaza
falling apart from lack of painting and repair clearly illustrated that need. A new hotel opened
after the completion of the plaza, however, a positive impact of the project infrastructure.

4.      The project also upgraded the local water supply through a new collection and
chlorination treatment plant at a mountain stream above the town, and the distribution
network to local residents and businesses. IEG heard from many residents and shopkeepers
that the water quality was good and the supply regular during the dry season (prevailing at
the time of IEG’s visit). During the monsoon, however, IEG learned from project engineers
that natural debris brought down by heavy rains blocked difficult-to-access intakes. Local
townspeople also confirmed monsoon season service interruptions and more turbid water at
that time when it became available.

5.       The project’s waste collection service was working quite well. Streets and sidewalks
were clear of litter—normal condition according to local people, not a special cleanup for the
evaluation visit! Regular collections of trash—using a tractor vehicle—were made for the
first time in the town. The disposal site, some 8 km south of Trongsa, was a walled area into
which garbage is dumped. There had been no compacting or covering of the waste as
expected. On the other hand, there was a leachate collection pond below the collection site
that appeared to be in operation. Overall, the site was being used and it seemed to have
considerable additional capacity for long-term use, but accumulation of more waste over time
could pose serious challenges to a pristine environment.

JAKAR

6.       Although often referred to as if it were a town, ―Bumthang‖ is in fact the name of the
district where the district head town of Jakar is located, some nine hours by road to the east
of Thimphu. At 2,800 meters Jakar is located at a higher elevation than the 2,200 meters of
Trongsa. Jakar also has more space for urban expansion, by the Bumthang River in a broad
valley—where a new airport is being built. Relocation of part of the town of Jakar to higher
ground might become necessary for two reasons. A major fire destroyed several houses in the
existing town in 2010 that have to be rebuilt elsewhere. Low-lying areas of the town might
be at risk should there be a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) from the advanced melting of
a large Himalayan glacier upstream on the Bumthang River.

7.       The project’s largest single investment in Jakar, was the 76-lot subdivision for the
Dekiling New Township consisting of paved streets, storm drainage, street lighting, water
and electricity, while sewage will have to retrofitted later. The subdivision has been well
built, but not been occupied and put to use since its completion in 2006, an extraordinary
waste of scarce resources since then (Fig 6). Local authorities in Jakar and RGOB authorities
in Thimphu explained that disagreements over the selection of beneficiaries and the
conditions of sale of the lots were responsible for the hiatus. Whatever the cause, the idle
asset is wasteful in two ways; (i) it imposes an opportunity cost through preventing the
money being used for some other investment that could have yielded a positive rate of return
during this period; (ii) the useful life of the existing infrastructure—on the surface and
underground—is shortened every day even when it is not being used. Moreover, the Dekiling
site has contributed nothing thus far to urgently relocate part of Jakar town mentioned above.

8.      The project also helped expand Jakar’s water supply. In this case, an intake from a
different river was tapped, giving Jakar town greater water supply security in having two
alternative sources. The collection and treatment plant was working well, and had a resident
caretaker who told IEG that the chemicals needed for treatment were always available and
applied. In spite of this, local residents spoke of daily interruptions to the supply, especially
during the monsoon, when silt and debris block the water intakes to the plant. Although such
blockages can be cleared through routine maintenance, there are signs that maintenance is
wanting, as evidenced by treatment plant valves rusting from lack of paint and lubrication
since they were installed five years ago.

9.       Through the project, Jakar gained solid waste collection and disposal systems for the
first time. Solid waste was disposed at a project-financed landfill some 5 km from town.
Residents told IEG that the collection service by tractor/open trailer worked well for them.

10.     Finally, mention should be made of the retaining wall/flood barrier built along the
banks of the Bumthang River near the center of Jakar, Bumthang’s most flood-prone
township. IEG’s visit was during the dry season, with the river low and flood protection not
in action, but local residents told the IEG mission that it had significantly curtailed floods in
that area during the last monsoon. Although not designed to resist the full effect of a GLOF,
                                              25


this investment can help mitigate some of the negative impact that such a disaster might
cause.

WANGDUE

11.     The largest town to participate in the project with its 7,500 inhabitants, Wangdue is to
the east of the capital, Thimphu, a two-hour road journey. It is located on the banks of the
Sankosh River at only 1,350 meters, a much lower elevation than the other towns visited by
IEG.

12.      The largest single project investment there was in the new township of Bajo, a
subdivision similar to Jakar's, but with 138 lots, on a larger scale. 131 of these had already
been sold at market prices (approximately Nu144,000 or US$3,000 for a 300m2 lot), for
which 235 applications had been received. The choice of beneficiaries, according to the
district authorities, was in compliance with published selection criteria that included, among
other things: applicants being up-to-date with taxes, and not having any other shop in the
District. At the time of IEG’s visit construction on most lots was proceeding apace after it
began in early 2010. Some ground floor shops were already open for business. Most
construction was of multi-family four floor units with retail outlets typically occupying the
ground floors and residential quarters those above. The structures were of reinforced
concrete, finished in officially sanctioned traditional Bhutanese designs with elaborately
decorated window-frames and eaves. Building methods are labor intensive and make use of
                                             26


local materials. Surprisingly, given the high rates of urban unemployment in Bhutan, officials
from Wangdue reported that laborers were not available locally to do this work. It is common
practice in Bhutan, to use foreign labor on construction projects. In this case all on-site labor
is by migrant workers from neighboring India’s poorer states of Bihar and Orissa. Although
now beginning to be put to use, this component suffered a similar hiatus to Jakar’s for a four-
year period. Clearly, these investments have to be managed more efficiently.

13.      Wangdue also had a new water supply system installed, with a better design of
collection stage involving successive stages of filtration that helped prevent the monsoon
supply blockages experienced elsewhere. In spite of this, local residents and shopkeepers
complained that water was available only a few hours per day. Even this inadequate service
might be enough to bring health benefits. Beneficiaries told IEG that they would simply wait
for the service to be restored and would not seek water from the contaminated sources that
they used before.. A key—perhaps short-term—reason for the shortage was temporary
consumption caused by the intense construction and occupation activity at the Bajo site.
Other project investments, such as solid waste collection appeared to be working well in the
town, as it was during IEG’s visit (and at other times, according to reports by residents to the
mission).

PARO

14.     About one hour by road to the west of Thimphu the capital, Paro at 2,250 meters
altitude hosts Bhutan’s only international airport. Paro is also one of the country’s principal
centers for international tourism, where
considerable tourism infrastructure in the
form of hotels and restaurants is found.

15.      Among the ten project towns, Paro
spent most on water supply, resulting in
one of the best performing systems funded
by the project. The water collection point
and treatment plant has back-up intakes
that can easily be brought into use if one
should fail through the monsoon blockages
mentioned earlier. The system of three
treatment tanks, always having one as a
back up, also contributes to a smooth
operation. The treatment plant has a
caretaker living on-site who can respond
quickly to operational problems as they
arise. The collection point, as in other
towns, is in a pristine forest environment
far from and above any area of habitation.
Down below in the town, residents and
shopkeepers told the IEG mission that they
had a 24/7 service and that the water
quality—by their perceptions of its color,
                                               Figure 9. Damaged street furniture - Paro
                                              27


smell and taste—was good. Interestingly, this supply system also services the international
airport, an asset that demands a reliable supply of water.

16.     Other important project investments include the market stands in Paro’s central
market. They were well built, although IEG noted that many stallholders (on a quiet day for
the market) preferred to display their produce on the ground, not using the stands to avoid the
rental cost. The market also included public toilets, but they were closed on the quiet day of
IEG’s visit.

17.      Smartening up the town’s central plaza did not work too well. The project financed
the paving and landscaping of the town’s main plaza and building an amphitheater to hold
public events, as proposed by the local District authority. Hardly anybody was in the square
at the time of IEG’s visit, and it was evident that the 250-seat amphitheater had not been used
for a long time. People living and working nearby told IEG that the lack of use was the
normal situation. The plaza has design and maintenance problems too. The amphitheater
design included a deep (decorative) moat behind the main stage, that had to be drained and
fenced off to prevent young children especially from falling in. The lack of maintenance is
evident from the park benches in the plaza that were damaged, remaining without repair for
a long time (Fig. 10).

18.     Finally like other towns, Paro had planned to develop solid waste disposal through a
landfill, but this has not been built. The district was unable to obtain the agreement of the
owner to acquire the chosen site, and the local community did not approve the proposed
location. Until this is resolved, the solid waste continues to be disposed of at open sites,
where some of it is incinerated.

OTHER TOWNS

19.  Findings from IEG’s meetings with representatives from other towns not visited are
summarized here.

20.     For ZHEMGANG town, the municipal engineer told IEG that the project provided a
new road from there to TINGTIBI town (within the same ZHEMGANG district) that was well
constructed, but the traffic flows were only light. TINGTIBI town had a similar subdivision
development to Wangdue’s and Jakar’s, but on a far smaller scale, but still hardly used like
Jakar’s. Houses have been built to date only on 6 of the 60 serviced plots provided there.
Water supply systems had mixed results. In ZHEMGANG town, water is available to
consumers for only a few hours per day because of inadequate supply. In the winter, the
sources dry up and the supply is cut altogether. The smaller project system in TINGTIBI town
faces a much lighter demand and is able to maintain a 24 hours supply year round to its
consumers. For LHUENTSE the project introduced the supply of treated water and direct
house connections with water meters for the first time, according to local officials. But it can
only supply enough water for the growing population of the town for about five hours per
day. More successfully, improved drainage has alleviated flooding that used to affect the
town regularly every monsoon. To stabilize a slope that threatened part of the town with
landslides, the project built a 100-meter section of four-meter high retaining wall. Also, 500
meters of road repaving improved access to the town. For TRASHIGANG district the
                                          28


municipal engineer reported that the district’s second town RANJUNG had benefited from the
repaving of the formerly potholed town streets. The road improvements cut travel time and
made the town more accessible, especially during heavy rains of the monsoon. The water
supply works well and provides a 24-hour service during the dry season. During the
monsoon, however, collection points get blocked (as reported by other towns) with the
consequent interruption to water supply to consumers. As in other towns, the project
provided basic solid waste collection and disposal for the first time.
