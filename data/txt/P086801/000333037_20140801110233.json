Sierra Leone\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory,\n            the risk to development outcome was high, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the measures necessary for environmental\n            and social safeguards compliance were revised and extended\n            several times during project implementation. Many of the\n            revisions were initiated by the two panels of experts. For\n            instance, the size of the environmental offset was revised\n            upwards, including the addition of the Loma Mountain\n            National Park. The number of people to be compensated under\n            the resettlement action plan, or RAP also was revised during\n            project implementation. The installation of a siren system\n            was added when the recruitment of an experienced operator\n            did not take place in time. While adjusting the social and\n            environmental activities to changing circumstances is\n            sometimes necessary, the scope and frequency of revisions is\n            notable. The Bank's environmental and social safeguards\n            policies apply to the entirety of an infrastructure project\n            supported by the Bank and its associated facilities,\n            regardless of the extent of Bank support. In the case of the\n            Bumbuna project, most construction activities already had\n            been completed when International Development Association,\n            or IDA financing became effective. The project tried to\n            retrofit good performance on a hydropower development that\n            was already near completion. As the Bank was not financing\n            construction, it had no formal relationship with the\n            contractor. Given the frequent power outages in Sierra\n            Leone, the GoSL's interest was mainly on commissioning\n            BHP as soon as possible. After project restructuring, the\n            operation exclusively supported environmental and social activities."}, "docdt": "2014-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
