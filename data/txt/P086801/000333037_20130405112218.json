          had been developed to provide electricity to the Western\n            Area of Freetown and some major towns along the transmission\n            Line. Compensation for the loss of property, land, house\n            crops etc., is in consonance with the World Bank operational\n            policy O.P 4:12 on in voluntary relocation and resettlement.\n            Project affected peoples' (PAPs) who had been\n            identified during the census stage of the update were to\n            benefit from compensations of moving and transition\n            allowances. This is not however a compensation per-sae, for\n            the loss of property, but rather a means to enhance\n            households to transport their belongings from their previous\n            settlements to new locations. To some households, the moving\n            and transition allowances served as 'seed money'\n            for starting a small business. Additionally in kind\n            compensation of a hundred acre land has been provided by the\n            Ministry of Lands and Country Planning as a resettlement\n            site for PAPs who are asset owners and who had lost their\n            properties to the project. PAPS were issued identification\n            cards and reference code numbers according to their\n            categories. A total number of 1,579 respondents were\n            recorded as eligible recipients of the moving transition\n            allowances. The Sierra Leone Commercial Bank was contracted\n            to make direct payments to all PAPS."}, "docdt": "2013-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
