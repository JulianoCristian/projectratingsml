                         relating to the installation of sirens is largely completed but is held up on account of non-receipt of equipment from the suppliers. The supplier has had issues with the Letter of Credit
                         (LC), which have been resolved, and he assured the shipment and delivery of equipment by end-February 2013. Once the sirens have been installed, it is envisaged to have
                         simulation exercises and relevant training undertaken, in close coordination with Emergency Action Unit (EAU) and Office of National Security (ONS). The Dam Safety Committee
                         has been strengthened with the inclusion of an Owner's Representative with technical background.

                         Power Plant Operation which is outside the scope of this project: Unit-1 has shut down since November 2012 on account of crack in the shaft and damages to the turbine runner;
                         Unit-2 is also being loaded to a maximum of 8 MW (against a rated capacity of 25 MW).

                         2. BWMA/Environment: Following is the update:
                         - BWMA: The BWMA operations are managed from its field offices in Bumbuna in a satisfactory manner. Community labor under cash-for-work (CfW) arrangements is extensively
                         involved. Office blocks and laboratory is being organized,
                         - Fisheries Assessment: Work has been completed; there are 38 typical fish species in the reservoir compared to 21 species found upstream pre-impoundment, whereas 63
                         freshwater species were identified prior to commissioning. At present, 110 fishermen who use boats for fishing.
                         - Health Assessment: In coordination with the Ministry of Health (MoH), the Assessment has been completed which provides the baseline demographic, health and nutrition
                         information. BWMA will be assisting in the MoH’s distribution of preventive and curative drugs and medicines.
                         - Water Quality Monitoring. Monthly water quality analysis is being done, indicating no evidence of stratification or the presence of significant eutrophic conditions. The reservoir
                         remains a fertile setting for fish growth.
                         - Clearing of Biomass in the Reservoir: Being undertaken on an ongoing basis through CfW-mobilized labor. An average of 48,920 cu.m per month of biomass (mostly tree branches)
                         was collected, with no incidence of biomass ever reaching the dam’s floating boom and intake gate.
                         - Marking of Navigational Channel: The navigational channel has been marked and BWMA has set up eight markers in the critical areas and eighteen markers along a demarcated
                         safe navigation pathway along the reservoir.
                         - Bumbuna Conservation Area (BCA): BWMA has delineated the physical boundaries of the BCA by planting 10,000 tree seedlings in the northern border and in the BCA. Another
                         5,000 tree seedlings were planted along the shoreline.
                         - Buffer Zone monitoring: Demarcation of the buffer zone along the reservoir has been started with the planting of 5,000 tree seedlings (e.g. non-invasive trees - moringa and fruit
                         trees), and signage and village environmental awareness campaigns are ongoing.
                         - Environmental awareness: BWMA has launched extensive awareness campaigns to protect the flora and fauna. More than 40 district and chiefdom wide meetings of key
                         stakeholders were organized, where over 300 people participated in the last two years.

                         - The GoSL is advancing the establishment of a National Protected Areas Authority (NPAA), which was created by law on 2nd August, 2012, under which the LMNP will be managed
                         and maintained in the future.
