                         Implementation Status Overview
                         An Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) mission visited Freetown and Bumbuna, Sierra Leone from September 23-29, 2013 to undertake a review of the status of
                         completion of key activities on the project. Many of the environmental management and social mitigation activities were completed before the closing of the project on June 30,
                         2013.

                         The mission, however, noted that a number of activities remained incomplete at the time of project-closing which continue to pose a great threat to the security and well-being of the
                         population and the environment around Bumbuna. Government of Sierra Leone’s (GoSL) has been requested to give urgent attention to complete the same at the earliest.

                         The mission also collected data for the project’s ICR. GoSL will be requested to submit to the Bank its own completion report, and will also have a chance to comment on the draft

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A number of safety, environmental and social mitigation activities remained incomplete posing threat to the security and well-being of the population and the environment around
                         Bumbuna, and these are requested to be completed at the earliest. The Bank staff would be available to GoSL to carry out supervision of implementation of these activities beyond
                         the closing date of the project.
