{"cdata!": "The project would assist the Government\n            of Sri Lanka in improving the economic efficiency of the tea\n            industry by lowering production costs and improving tea\n            quality in the project area, as well as in stemming the\n            decline in output of tea through: expanded programs of tea\n            replanting and infilling; strengthening the two major\n            Government corporations involved in estate management;\n            reduction in total number of factories, and expansion and\n            rehabilitation of the remainder; provision of vehicles for\n            personnel, green leaf and made-tea transport; and\n            rehabilitation of soil conservation works. The project would\n            also assist private estate owners and approximately 180\n            small-holder producers, and would provide improved housing\n            and medical facilities for estate laborers. The project\n            faces no special risks, but realization of full benefits\n            will depend mainly upon the management performance of the\n            two Government corporations involved."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
