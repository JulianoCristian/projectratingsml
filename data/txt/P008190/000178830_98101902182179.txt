INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DEIIECTOiiS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO BANCO DE DESARROLLO AGROPECUARIO
FOR A LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
WITH THE GUARANTEE CF VENEZUELA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of $U1 million to the Banco de Desarrollo Agro-
pecuario (BDA). The loan would finance the estimated foreign exchange
cost of a proposed three-year livestock credit program. It would be for
a term of fifteen years, including a five-and-a-half year period of grace,
and carry interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. It would be guaranteed by
the Republic of Venezuela.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Past Bank and IFC operations in Venezuela weresummarized in
paragraphs 2-4, of my Report to the Executive Directors on a proposed loan
to Venezuela for the Maiquetia International Airport project, dated
January 19, 1972 (Report No. P-1019). A statement on Bank loans and IFC
investments as at January 31, 1972, is attached as Annex I.  The $17 mil-
lion loan for the Maiquetia Airport project, signed on February 2, brought
total Bank lending, net of cancellations, up to $345 million. Of this
amount, about 40 percent has been for electric power, 35 percent for trans-
portation, and the rest for telecommunications and water supply.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
3.        A discussion of recent borrowing from sources other than the
Bank and of economic developments in Venezuela as they affect the future
requirements for external resources was contained in paragraphs 5-13 of
my Report on the Maiquetia Airport project. A country data sheet is
attached as Annex II.
PART III - THE PROJECT
4.        This would be the first project in Venezuelats agricultural
sector financed by the Bank. Several attempFt have been made during the
past ten years to find an agricultural project suitable for Bank financing,
but it proved difficult to reach agreement on priority areas for develop-
ment, on the scope and content of investment programs, on credit policies
in the sector and on appropriate institutional arrangements. In 1966,



- 2 -
however, the Government had concluded that it was essential to put
greater emphasis on the development of commercial agriculture and that
the provision of credit to commercial farmers and ranchers should be
dealt with separately from the heavily subsidized agricultural credit
programs which were previously extended to the entire sector.
5.        As the specialized credit agency for commercial agriculture,
the Government created the Banco de Desarrollo Agropecuario (BDA) in 1967
and transferred to it the responsibility for managing, at no loss to BDA,
the loan portfolio for commercial farmers of the Government's Banco
Agricola y Pecuario (BAP) which had had a poor record of loan recoveries.
BDA began lending on its own account in 1969. Identification and prepara-
tion of the proposed BDA project was carried out in late 1969/early 1970
with the help of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program, and appraisal took
place in late 1970. Congress delayed in approving the guarantee legisla-
tion, and the proposed loan could not be negotiated until January 1972.
The negotiating team was headed by Dr. Carlos Eduardo Galavis, President
of BDA.
6.        The project is designed to increase beef production in Venezuela
through better utilization of vast areas of pasture lands and to improve
the productivity of the national herd. The average carcass weight of
Venezuelan cattle is about 10 percent below that of Colombia's cattle
and 15-20 percent below that of Argentina and Uruguay. The offtake of
the national herd is only about 10 percent per annum, again below that
of a number of Latin American countries.  Nevertheless, Venezuela already
is a substantial livestock producer and supplies about 80 percent of its
market. The remainder is imported, mainly through unregistered cattle
imports from Colombia. Even with the projected increase in domestic
production in the coming five years, to which the proposed project will
contribute about one-fourth, the import gap is likely to increase through
the mid-1970's.
7.        The project would provide long, medium and short-term funds
and technical services for about 800 commercial ranchers to increase their
production through: application of better herd management practices;
establishment of improved pastures; up-grading of their breeding stock;
improvement of stock handling facilities; housing for labor; and necessary
machinery and equipment to carry out development programs and to operate
the ranches. To assist in the long-range development strategy of the
livestock industry, the Project would finance special consultant services,
tropical pasture specialists and provide overseas training grants for
project technicians. The project would also provide two small aircraft,
vehicles and communications equipment for the technical services staff of
BDA in support of their field work. A Loan and Project Summary is
attached as Annex III and a map shows the proposed project areas.



- 3 -
8.        The total project cost is estimated at $39 million.  The
proposed Bank loan of $11 million would be limited to the estimated
foreign exchange cost (or 28 percent), the balance of the financing
required being available from the Government ($15 million or 39 percent),
the ranchers ($7 million or 18 percent), and BDA ($6 million or 15 per-
cent).
9.        The project is mainly directed to the development of medium and
large ranches (with existing herds from about 200 to 500 breeding cows),
but there will be some lending to small producers (with existing herds of
about 50 breeding cows) and BDA would use a limited amount of project funds
to gain experience in lending to cooperative ranching enterprises.   he
possibility of including more small farmers in the project was explored.
However, smaller farmers are already receiving substantial assistance under
an integrated agricultural development program, financed with a $75 million
loan from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) signed in 1971. Under
that program, a total of about $36 million of farm credits is proposed to
raise production and income for some 63,000 low-income rural families in
four maZj ,-? regions of the country. These credits are extended at subsidized
interest rates of about 3 to 6 percent. Farmers benefitting from the IDB-
financed program would therefore not be interested in BDA loans, which will
be on commercial terms. IDB has recently approved a $7.5 million loan to
assist in eradicating brucellosis and foot and mouth disease in all the
areas covered by the proposed Bank loan.
10.       The project would provide about 800 ranches  with credit and
technical services to increase their production through application of
better herd management practices, establishment of imrproved pastures,
upgrading of breeding stock, improvement of stock handling facilities,
housing for labor and the necessary machinery and equipment to carry out
the ranch development plans and to operate the ranches. Reflecting the
regional differences within the livestock industry, the proposed ranch
develcpment involves four principal types of production units:
(a) about 250 breeding/growing ranches where herd density is
low and land areas are extensive, located principally in
the Llanos region in the southeast of Venezuela ("Model 1"
on the map attached);
(b) about 250 breeding/fattening ranches in the more developed
areas, mainly in the Andean foothills and the Lake Maracaibo
region ("Model 2");
(c) about 300 mixed beef breeding/fattening/dairy ranches in
areas with more intensive production systems mainly in the
Lake Maracaibo region. Two sizes of operations for this
type have been included, a larger unit of around 350 breed-
ing cows initially ("Miodel 3"), and a smaller unit beginning



with about 50 breeding cows ("Model 4"); and
(d) about 15 country-wide purebred beef cattle breeding
centers.
The new investments proposed under the project are estimated to yield a
financial rate of return of between 16 and 21 percent for the ranches and
23 percent for the purebred breeding centers.
U1.       The economic rate of return on the project is estimated at 17
percent. This figure does not make allowance for the expected impact of
the project on the future development of the livestock industry through
.the demonstration of the results that can be obtained from the application
of modern technology. To help achieve this broader objective, the project
would include:
(a) consultants' services to assist in the implementation of
a program of improvements in the grading, pricing and
marketing of cattle and beef products;
(b) tropical pasture specialists to determine the most suitable
forage types for conditions in the various regions of
Venezuela, along with the best techniques for establishing
improved pastures; and
(C) land clearing and animal nutrition specialists.
Moreover, overseas training grants would be provided for about 10 project
technicians.
12.       BDA is an efficient and businesslike organization, with sound
lending policies. Daring its two years of business, BDA already has
established a country-wide banking service.  BDA,'s Board members have
extensive farming background and its President and chief executive officer
is an experienced business and cattleman who, about ten years ago, served
as MLnister of Agriculture.  BDA has built up a strong staff of about 60
livestock and agricultural technicians, and has experienced personnel in
management and administrative positions.
13.       To strengthen BDA's capability in lending for commercial ranching,
BDA has agreed to establish a Livestock Development Uuit reporting directly
to the Deputy General Manager of BDA, and responsible to the management of
the BDA for the day-to-day administrative direction of the project. Its
Chief would be appointed in consultation with the Bank, and there would
also be a Technical Director whose qualification and experience would be
subject to Bank approval.



- 5 -
14.       In the past, manr agricultural and livestock activities in
Venezuela were isolated from market forces through various forms of price
support programs and subsidized credit, under which livestock loans were
extended for up to 16 years at 4 percent interest, but with only limited
technical services. The Government and BDA have agreed that the interest
rates to be charged to commercial ranchers on all funds made available
under the proposed project will be 9 percent per annum on outstanding
balances for long-term loans, and about 10.5 percent on short-term loans.
These interest rates, which approximate commercial rates in Venezuela, will
enable BDA to cover the costs of its funds, to finance the technical and
general services to be provided under the project, and to generate addi-
tional capital for further livestock development in future years.
15.       In line with the usual practice under Bank-financed livestock
projects, repayrment terms for the subloans would be tailored to the cash
flows of each sub-project, and would generally be from eight to ten years,
including grace periods of three to five years. The subloans would be
committed over a period of three years.  Disbursements would be completed
in about five-and-a-half years. Accordingly, a term of 15 years, including
five-and-a-half years of grace, is proposed for the Bank loan. In view of
its large grant contributions to BDA, the Government has decided that BDA
should carry the foreign exchange risk of the proposed loan.
16.       The two aircraft under the project would be procured under
international competitive bidding. However, this procedure would not be
appropriate for commodities required for on-ranch development, such as
agricultural machinery and equipment, fencing, ranch structures, cattle
and seeds, as well as radio telephone equipment and vehicles for the
project which would be obtained through existing commercial channels.
Requirements for these items are expected to vary considerably from ranch
to ranch, individual items are expected to be too small to attract inter-
national competitive bidding, and bulking for purposes of procurement would
be impractical. Adequate competition is assured by the presence in
Venezuela of numerous suppliers for agricultural supplies, both imported
and local. Furthermore, adequate facilities exist in Venezuela for
servicing agricultural machinery and equipment of a wide variety of makes.
No import licenses are required nor are import duties levied on agricul-
tural inputs, including livestock.
17.       Ihe proposed loan would finance (a) in full the foreign cost
of the two aircraft, consultant services, the technical director and
international travel grants; (b) the estimated foreign exchange component
of locally procured supplies and equipment; and (c) 36 percent of the
amounts disbursed by BDA under subloans for ranch development, estimated
as being equivalent to the foreign exchange component of the corresponding
investments.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and BDA, and the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Venezuela and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (idi), of
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed separate3lg. The draft
Agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for livestock projects.
19.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECONM   ATION
20.       I reconmend that the Ececutive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                  Banco de Desarrollo Agropecuario (BDA)
Guarantor:                 Republic of Venezuela
Amount:                    US$11.0 million equivalent.  The proposed loan
would cover the estimated foreign exchange cost
of the project. US$10 million would be on-lent by
BDA to finance new investment on participating
ranches and US$1 million would be applied to the
cost of aircraft, communications equipment, and tech-
nical services for project administration and studies.
Term and interest rate:    Payable in 15 years including 5-1/2 years of
grace at 7-1/A percent interest per annum.
Relending terms:           BDA would on-lend the proceeds of the loan to
participating ranchers and cooperative group
ranches for terms ranging from 8 to 10 years,
including grace periods ranging from 3 to 5
years, at 9 percent interest per annum on the
principal amount withdrawn and outstanding from
time to time.
Project:                   The project consists of the provision of long-
term loans for new ranch investment items and
short-term loans for seasonal production require-
ments to cattle ranchers and cooperative ranching
schemes in the principal livestock production
regions of Venezuela. It also includes technical
services to ensure successful implementation of
each ranch investment plan; employment of short-
term consultants on livestock marketing, meat
processing, tropical grass and legume pasture
establishment, land clearing techniques, and
animal nutrition; and acquisition by BDA of equip-
ment for transport, communications and offices.
Special Project            Project constitutes first effort made in Venezuela
Features:                  to provide long-term livestock credit on commercial
terms combined with substantial supporting technical
services.

Procurement                Because of the diversity and small size of individual
Arrangements:              purchases which are not suitable for bulking, goods
for on-ranch development and incremental working
capital inputs would be acquired through exdsting
commercial channels. These offer a wide choice to
individual participating ranchers and group ranching
schemes. Aircraft would be procured under inter-.
national competitive bidding.
