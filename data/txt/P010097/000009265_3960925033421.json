As should be expected with a pilot project, many\n            implementation delays were experienced -- some were\n            bureaucratic; however most were associated with the\n            \"learning process\" of applying a new technology.\n            There were \"teething problems\",(i.e. compensation,\n            equipment, etc). associated with these transfers. Eventually\n            these problems were overcome and the Training and Visits\n            (T&V) extension program became fully operational. The\n            International Development Association (IDA) was instrumental\n            in the successful completion of the project. Lessons learned\n            and experience gained from this project specifically relate\n            to: viability of horizontal (pipe) drainage in alleviating\n            waterlogging; (b) efficiency of trenching machines in\n            installing large collector drains; and (c)the need for a\n            well designed and implemented monitoring and evaluation\n            program. An appropriate Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)\n            program must be designed and carried out in all water sector\n            project and this is particularly true of subsurface drainage\n            projects. M&E is essential in determining project\n            results and a monitoring program is essential in determining\n            adequacy of design and installed system and as an aid in\n            efficiently operating and maintaining the completed project."}, "docdt": "1989-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
