The project comprises: (a) technical\n            assistance for key departments at MOH, including the Health\n            Manpower Institute (HMI) which has the responsibility of\n            training middle-level health workers; and (b) infrastructure\n            development, particularly for manpower training, including\n            civil works, equipment and supplies. The proposed\n            project's main benefits would be: (i) the strengthening\n            of MOH's planning, management and implementation\n            capacity, particularly for its basic health services/primary\n            health care (BHS/PHC) program; and (ii) the development,\n            through HMI, of health manpower to staff BHS/PHC services\n            and facilities. Project risks relate to: (i) retention of\n            MOH staff; (ii) timely recruitment of qualified experts; and\n            (iii) possible continued underutilization of HMI facilities.\n            These risks are minimized by the strong Government\n            commitment to this project, evidenced by specific measures\n            which the Government has taken."}, "docdt": "1982-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
