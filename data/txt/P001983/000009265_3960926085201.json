(PE) reform efforts,\n            which would be supported through a proposed PE Sector\n            Adjustment Operation.  More specifically, the project is to\n            address the long-term question of the strengthening of the\n            Government's ability to devise and implement PE reforms\n            as well as to monitor the sector's progress and manage\n            its development in the future.   This also entails\n            strengthening the capabilities of PE management to respond\n            to the changed policy environment. With this in mind, the\n            project aims to assist the Government in acquiring the\n            necessary technical administrative capacity to formulate and\n            implement the reform measures incorporated in the PE Sector\n            Adjustment Program."}, "docdt": "1987-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
