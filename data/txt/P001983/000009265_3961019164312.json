Public Enterprise Institutional\n            Development Project (PEIDP) in the Republic of Niger. The\n            PEIDP was designed to strengthen the Government's\n            ability to devise and implement Public Enterprise reforms,\n            monitor the sector's progress and manage its\n            development. Bank's performance was insufficient.\n            Borrower's performance was not satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) to be effective, the\n            project should be executed in a proper macro- and\n            socio-economic environment(; ii) a genuine and continuous\n            commitment from the government to a carefully and thoroughly\n            analyzed and planned program is a pre-requisite for support\n            (iii) an open and on-going dialogue between the government,\n            interested and affected parties and the private sector\n            should be established;( iv) a good monitoring and\n            evaluation; mechanism is necessary to collect relevant data\n            and information for the assessment of the program and design\n            of future ones; (v) technical expertise should be made\n            available t provide strategic support in project management\n            particularly when the reform processes are new and or\n            difficult; and (vi) the closing date of a project should not\n            be extended when realization of its objectives are remote."}, "docdt": "1995-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
