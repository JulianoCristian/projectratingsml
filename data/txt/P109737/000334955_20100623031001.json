Scaling up Sustainable Land Management (SLM)\n            Practice, Knowledge and Coordination Project will be a\n            three-and-a-half-year incremental GEF grant to the Federal\n            Republic of Nigeria, focused on mainstreaming SLM in\n            Nigeria's agricultural sector. There are two components\n            to the project. Component A: capacity building,\n            communications and information support. This component will\n            provide training and communications outreach on SLM planning\n            and practice at local, state and federal levels,\n            multi-sector coordination on land management investment at\n            state and federal levels, training on local land use\n            planning, as well as small community sub-project awards for\n            existing communities that are successfully implementing SLM\n            sub-projects under the baseline Third Fadama operation.\n            Component B: monitoring, evaluation and knowledge. This\n            component supports development of ecological and process\n            monitoring tools, and also establishes a technical knowledge\n            base on SLM, sustainable agriculture and related climate risk."}, "docdt": "2010-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
