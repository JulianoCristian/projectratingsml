                         The development and global environment objective of the GEF incremental grant is to improve the enabling environment for scaling upsustainable land management in
                         participating communities. The project development objective of the existing approved loan (with which the GEF incremental support will integrate) is to increase the
                         incomes of users of rural land and water resources.

                         the project is progressing steadily towards the achievement of the development objective of improving the enabling environment for scaling up sustainable land management in
                         participating communities. Land degradation and climate risks threat facing the productionlands of participating communities is gradually being reduced through communities’
                         embracement of SLM practices and positive perception to create an enabling environment for sustainable land management. Stakeholders were adequately sensitized through the
                         use of flyers and posters in five major indigenous languages and pidgin English; workshops and trainings which were further stepped down to various local governments were also

                         The above discrepancies could be attributed to the fact that activities which were not under the promoted SLM practices were recorded as SLM subprojects and activities by various

                         groups; but after the communities and states were re-sensitized, they were able to adequately comprehend what constituted the SLM subprojects and activities .Given the slow take-
                         off of the project as a result of political situation and election in the country which actually slowed down date of effectiveness and implementation of activities; the above achievement
                         is commendable when compared with the base line figure of 0.00 beneficiaries. One of the major achievements of the project in recent times as at September 2013 was the flagging
                         off of the SLM award with the disbursement of over $889,375.17 to 45 outstanding FCAs for the first and second installment of the award. This 1st and 2nd phase has not only
                         rewarded outstanding SLM practices but also increased the awareness on SLM and enhanced confidence that community efforts at scaling up SLM practices would not go un-
                         rewarded. Disbursement on the project stood at 92.85%.
