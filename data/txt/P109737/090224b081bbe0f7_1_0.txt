                         The development and global environment objective of the GEF incremental grant is to improve the enabling environment for scaling upsustainable land management in
                         participating communities. The project development objective of the existing approved loan (with which the GEF incremental support will integrate) is to increase the
                         incomes of users of rural land and water resources.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         One of the major achievements of the project in recent times was the flagging off of the SLM award with the disbursement of over $220,000 to outstanding FCAs for the first
                         installment in the 1st phase of the award. This 1st phase has not only rewarded outstanding SLM practices but also increased the awareness on SLM and enhanced confidence that
                         community efforts at scaling up SLM practices would not go unrewarded. The 2012 independent tracking of the SLM composite Index still remains the available empirical data to
                         demonstrate the improvement in the enabling environment for scaling up sustainable land management in Nigeria as it showed an increase from 0.323 composite index at baseline to

                         0.563 on a scale of 1 in May 2012. When the overall mean scores of the states were compared, it was observed that the highest mean score was recorded by Sokoto (6.81) followed
                         by Kwara (6.77), Ebonyi (6.74), Kogi (6.66), Benue (6.53), Ondo (6.44), Taraba (6.32), Osun (6.13), Delta (6.06) and Kaduna (6.05). However, the states with the lowest mean scores
                         were Akwa-Ibom (4.09), Edo (4.59), Kano (4.66) and Jigawa (4.9). In general, it was observed that Program resources, legal and regulatory environment attracted the lowest mean
                         scores which was an indication that the respondents were not satisfied with the level of funding and budgetary allocation to SLM programmes. Similarly the low scores for legal and

                         regulatory environment meant that legal and regulatory environment related to SLM might be in place but lacked enforcement. These observations and recommendations are
                         providing the necessary guides in the implementation of the SLM Project.

                         Other major progress recorded include the distribution of computers and mapping softwares for the selected 62 LGAs that are participating in the land use planning. The status of the
                         project outputs showed an improvement in the number of LDPs with SLM sub-projects. A total of 1,096 LDPs (25%) out of the total 4,402 LDPs prepared by the project contained
                         3,076 SLM sub-projects. Out of this number, 2,490 (81%) SLM sub-projects are fully implemented, and their constituent tree planting activities covering about 100,000 ha, with 17,932
                         males and 15,811 (47%) females being the beneficiaries. The grant disbursement status as at April 3, 2013 was 63.23%.
