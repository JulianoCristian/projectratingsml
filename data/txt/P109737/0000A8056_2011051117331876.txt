                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development and global environment objective of the GEF incremental grant is to improve the enabling environment for scaling up sustainable land
                         management in participating communities. The project development objective of the existing approved loan (with which the GEF incremental support will
                         integrate) is to increase the incomes of users of rural land and water resources.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved by the board on July 8, 2010 and the grant agreement signed with the Federal Government of Nigeria on November 25, 2010. The Subsidiary Financing
                         Agreement has been signed with one of the states and its Legal Opinion is also under consideration at the Federal Ministry of Finance. The team is following up with the Ministry of
                         Finance to obtain the final document for effectiveness. The National Coordinating Office is fully functional and all the key project staff are also in place in the participating states. The
                         project has laid out a six months action plan that will jump start implementation immediately the project becomes effective.
