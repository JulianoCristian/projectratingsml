                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved by the board on July 8, 2010 and the grant agreement signed with the Federal Government of Nigeria on November 25, 2010. The political situation early in
                         the year dragged effectiveness to May 2011. The six month action plan is about 50% implemented as at this reporting period and effort is being intensified to significantly execute the
                         remaining part of the action plan before the end of the year. The disbursement status (including firm commitment) is 10.34% while the 2012 AWPB is expected to take the
                         disbursement status to about 50%.
