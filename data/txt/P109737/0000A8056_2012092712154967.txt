                         The development and global environment objective of the GEF incremental grant is to improve the enabling environment for scaling upsustainable land management in
                         participating communities. The project development objective of the existing approved loan (with which the GEF incremental support will integrate) is to increase the
                         incomes of users of rural land and water resources.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The recently concluded 6th World Bank/FGN supervision mission recorded significant improvement in the enabling environment for scaling up sustainable land management in
                         Nigeria from 0.323 composite index at baseline to 0.563 on a scale of 1 as contained in the report of the independent tracking of the composite Index. When the overall mean scores
                         of the states were compared, it was observed that the highest mean score was recorded by Sokoto (6.81) followed by Kwara (6.77), Ebonyi (6.74), Kogi (6.66), Benue (6.53), Ondo
                         (6.44), Taraba (6.32), Osun (6.13), Delta (6.06) and Kaduna (6.05). However, the states with the lowest mean scores were Akwa-Ibom (4.09), Edo (4.59), Kano (4.66) and Jigawa

                         (4.9). In general, it was observed that Program resources and Legal and regulatory environment attracted the lowest mean scores which was an indication that the respondents were
                         not satisfied with the level of funding and budgetary allocation to SLM programmes. Similarly the low scores for legal and regulatory environment meant that legal and regulatory
                         environment related to SLM might be in place but lacked enforcement.

                         Other major progress recorded include the selection of a total of 62 LGAs i.e two (2) LGAs per State, for the land use planning. Purchase of computers and mapping software while
                         installation, distribution and training were delayed till the end of the supervision mission. The mission also updated project outputs which show that a total of 1,230 LDPs (31.29%) out
                         of the total 3,931LDPs prepared by the project contained 2,592 SLM sub-projects. Out of this number, 1,650(63.66%) SLM sub-projects have been fully implemented, and their
                         constituent tree planting activities covering about 14,655.2 ha, with 51,141 males and 30,245 (37.2%) females being the beneficiaries. The grant disbursement status as at June 21,
                         2012 was 33.19%. Completion of procurement procedures for the development of Indicator tool for local and global environmental benefits, and development of tools for tracking
                         Vegetation cover and land degradation, launching of the SLM website and concluding the preparatory work for the SLM grant award are the major activities for the 3rd quarter of the
                         year.
