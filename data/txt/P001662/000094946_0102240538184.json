On\n            balance and considering that the decline of the Electricity\n            Supply Commission's (ESCOM) raises serious concerns\n            about the sustainability of the project in the longer term\n            and the utility's ability to expand electricity access,\n            the achievement of the overall development objective is\n            unsatisfactory. Project sustainability is unlikely, unless\n            the viability of the power sector is restored to ensure\n            efficient operation and maintenance of the power plants.\n            Although the World Bank could have been more proactive in\n            the early years of implementation, considering the intensive\n            supervision towards the end of the project and careful\n            management of the closing date, Bank performance, on\n            balance, was satisfactory. Considering especially the\n            continuous deterioration of ESCOM, the borrower's\n            performance overall was unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            were: Cofinanciers should participate in project preparation\n            beginning from pre-appraisal, and also participate in the\n            appraisal and negotiations of the credit. Subdividing the\n            project into numerous contract packages because of\n            co-financing considerations led to coordination problems\n            during implementation. Energy lending in Malawi should focus\n            on four priorities--expanding access to modern energy,\n            increasing private participation to reduce the fiscal burden\n            of the energy sector, improving reliability, and increasing\n            regional integration and energy trade."}, "docdt": "2000-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
