The subsidiary\n            objectives are to improve the quality of power supply and to\n            strengthen energy sector institutions to plan and manage\n            energy sector activities at sectoral and sub-sectoral\n            levels.  The power component comprises:  (a) increasing the\n            hydro generation capacity by 50MW through the construction\n            of the first phase of a hydroelectric power plant at\n            Kapichira Falls, including related transmission system\n            expansion, and engineering services for design and\n            supervision; (b) rehabilitation of the existing hydro,\n            standby gas turbine and diesel power plants to improve their\n            availability; (c) reinforcing and expanding the transmission\n            and distribution systems, to improve reliability, reduce\n            losses and connect new consumers; (d) strengthening the\n            Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi through the\n            provision of computer hardware and software, studies and\n            training.  The non-power component will:  (a) assist in\n            energy planning and policy formulation through provision of\n            technical assistance; (b) support the Petroleum Control\n            Commission in least cost petroleum product sourcing through\n            technical assistance; and (c) provide technical assistance\n            to the Tobacco Control Commission in improving barn design\n            for smallholder tobacco curing, to reduce woodfuel consumption."}, "docdt": "1992-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
