                         Overall progress in project implementation has accelerated since the previous mission in May, 2011. The project is on track to meet most, and potentially all, of its objectives by its
                         planned closing date of June 30, 2012, although this will require a very intensive effort to complete existing commitments and fully process remaining ones by that time. For these
                         reasons full achievement of all objectives is not guaranteed. Over 4 million state land deeds for land parcels (shares) have now been issued on the basis of individually demarcated
                         land parcels (on site). The geographical descriptions of these parcels are supported by orthophotos generated by the project which now cover 23 out of 27 oblasts in Ukraine and

                         parcel index maps for these parcels completed in 14 out of 18 target oblasts. The State Land Cadastre has been established in accordance with the July, 2011 Law on Cadastre and
                         the computerized cadastral information system through which the cadastre will be maintained is in an advanced stage of preparation and is gradually being rolled out into oblast and
                         regional offices. A wide variety of public information and training activities in support of these objectives have been carried out.
