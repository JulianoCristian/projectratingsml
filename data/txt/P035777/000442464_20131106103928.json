moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: land projects\n            tend to be long and complex and require a great deal of\n            patience and preparation. This project was envisioned as a\n            nine-year long project and was completed with a ten-month\n            extension. The Bank needs to take a long term vision of\n            engagement and work with the client to reach the mutually\n            agreed goals despite the many hardships that emerge. The\n            Bank should not rely on the promise of political reform\n            alone but engage with governments only once their commitment\n            to the reform agenda has been proven. In case the political\n            commitment to reform remains unproven, the Bank should\n            design projects that are flexible and can work around the\n            existing, somewhat unstable, political economy conditions in\n            the country. The lack of clarity and reliance on subjective\n            targets and indicators make it difficult to assess project\n            progress and allows people to rely on the more formulaic\n            institutional indicators that may not fully capture the\n            impact that a project is having. In terms of promoting legal\n            or institutional reforms in Ukraine, the Bank should look at\n            all its instruments as a set of tools that can be used but\n            requiring that the structure is in place prior to project\n            implementation may be a more reasonable solution. The role\n            of the independent quality assurance contractor is important\n            to ensure that the system is fully documented and to\n            encourage the local team to introduce international\n            standards for version control, testing, and system maintenance."}, "docdt": "2013-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
