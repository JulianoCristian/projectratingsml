                         Overall progress in project implementation has accelerated since the previous mission in September 2011, but critical actions remain to achieve the project's development objective.
                         Over 4 million state land deeds for land parcels (shares) have been issued on the basis of individually demarcated land parcels (on site). The geographical descriptions of these
                         parcels are supported by orthophotos generated by the project which cover 27 oblasts in Ukraine and parcel index maps for these parcels have been completed in 21 (out of the
                         target of 18) oblasts. All contracts for titling, orthophoto mapping and cadastral index mapping will be completed and quality controlled before June 2012, completing nation-wide

                         coverage for Ukraine. The State Land Cadastre has been established in accordance with the July 2011 Law on Cadastre and the computerized cadastral and registration information
                         system (CRS) through which the cadastre will be maintained is being tested in two oblasts and will then be gradually being rolled out into all oblast and regional offices. A Users
                         Manual has been distributed to all oblast and raion offices, system administrators have been trained and training of users trainers is ongoing. The data of more than 16 million parcels
                         have been uploaded into the new system of the 22 million available in digital form. Significant progress has been made on the reconstruction of the two data centers and equipment
                         supply and installation. A wide variety of public information and training activities in support of these objectives have been carried out. The critical remaining actions are to finalize the
                         cadastral and registration information system operation, data loading and roll out and prepare supporting regulations for the system's operation.
