SUMMARY
The proposed changes are made to cancel the sum of US$11,850,000 from savings.


PROJECT STATUS
The project is at moderately satisfactory status. It is progressing towards meeting the
development objective within the time frame of the project and is expected to meet all
targets before the end of the project period. The progress with completing large mapping
contracts that are required in order to produce cadastral index maps is behind schedule
and for this reason the project is classified as only moderately satisfactory.


PROPOSED CHANGES
           o Cancellations

There are two activities included within the procurement plan that can no longer be
completed within the time frame of the project.

It was planned during project preparation that data and scanned documents from records
held at local cadastre offices would be entered into the cadastre software. In the PAD it
was estimated that up to 50 million records, that are not part of the agricultural lands
being titled under the project could be automated and included in the database. (Note that
these lands are typically urban land plots, dacha plots, garden plots, and the like.) This
activity was included within the original description of Component E, which was
cancelled as part of the restructuring completed in April 2009. However, some funds
were retained in the procurement plan in order to complete this work. It has proven to be
more complex than originally envisaged to do and even pilot work to test methodology
has not been successfully implemented. It will not be possible to complete this work
within the remaining time frame of the project and, as it is the responsibility of the State
Land Cadastre Center (SLCC) to enter data into the databases, it was agreed during the
implementation visit in May that they would complete this work gradually using their
own resources over the coming years. A sum of US$10,050,000 will no longer be
required from Loan funds.

Once State Deeds are issued to owners it is the responsibility of the SLCC to register the
State Deeds in the cadastre system. This is automatically done by the SLCC, but a fee is
charged for this service by the SLCC. This activity was originally funded under
Component E of the project. Component E was cancelled during the project restructuring
that was completed in April 2009, but the sum of US$1,800,000 was retained as
                                             4
operating costs for payment to the SLCC in compensation for the registration of the State
Deeds. A procedure for paying for this work was prepared by the State Committee for
Land Resources (SCLR) and approved by the Bank. However, the Ministry of Finance
did not approve the procedure because of concern that the public have often already paid
for registration and there may be double payments made to the SLCC. As this sum of
$1,800,000 cannot be utilized for its designated purpose, it was agreed to cancel these
funds.
