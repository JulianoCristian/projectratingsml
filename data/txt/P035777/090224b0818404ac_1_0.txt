                         Most of the project activities are progressing well toward the achievement of the project development objectives. The mapping and land certification subcomponents are now in a
                         stage of near completion and all other components are well-advanced with new aerial photography, orthophotos and parcel index maps covering the entire country. Public awareness
                         activities, legal drafting of cadastral regulations, and training/capacity development activities are achieving good results which are on track to meet or exceed targets by the Closing
                         Date. However, important remaining work remains to be done in a short period in the cadastral development subcomponent. New decisions made in the Government’s program to

                         finalize the electronic cadastre, however, raise new risks of full achieving all aspects of the Project Development Objective, and call for careful attention and mitigation measures.
                         Fully achieving the aims of the subcomponent require the continuation of efforts by SALRU/SLCC to digitize data and transform spatial data into a single national coordinate system
                         to meet the requirements of the Law on Cadastre for electronic cadastre, and to resolve software development questions. With continuing progress according to updated
                         benchmarks, this subcomponent can reach its target by the extended Closing Date.
