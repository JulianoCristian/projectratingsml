                         The project development objectives are on track to be successfully achieved and the project will finalize all activities by the extended Closing Date of April 30, 2013. Significant work
                         to launch the electronic cadastre system was completed since the previous mission through additional in-house development of software, data preparation and training with the result
                         that the electronic cadastre system is now fully operational in all 592 local and other offices. This progress has essentially resolved the risks noted about the launch of the electronic
                         cadastre system in previous missions. Training of operators, digitization of documents, transformation of spatial data, electronic linkages to the State Registration System to give the
