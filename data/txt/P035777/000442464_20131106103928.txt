Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document) 
PDO from the Loan Agreement (LA) schedule 2, page 19. since the LA is legally binding: It
states that the objectives are to assist the borrower in: (i) privatization of the lands of state and
communal farm enterprises, agencies and organizations through transfer to the employees of
these enterprises, agencies and organizations as well as retirees from among them, designating
for each of them a land parcel (share); (ii) allocating land parcels to owners of land parcels
(shares) in kind (on site) and issuing state land deeds to them; (iii) encouraging the restructuring
of farm enterprises into more efficient units, with due consideration for environmental and social
safeguards; and (iv) establishing a cadastre and title registry system where rights to immovable
property can be adequately registered.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority) 
The revised PDO, which were incorporated through a restructure in November 2008, was to
assist the Borrower in:
  (i) privatization of the lands of state and communal farm enterprises, agencies and
organizations through transfer to the employees of these enterprises, agencies and organizations
as well as retirees from among them, designating for each of them a land parcel (share);
  (ii) allocating land parcels to owners of land parcels (shares) in kind (on site) and issuing state
land deeds to them; and
  (iii) establishing a land cadastre.

In 2003, the Results Framework (RF) for this project followed the models utilized at that time. In
2006, for the first restructuring, the amendment included a revised RF utilizing the new format,
which included much more specific targets, as was utilized for new projects in 2006. The formats
and approach for the RF in 2003 and 2006 were different, which makes comparisons in the table
below less straightforward.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

In the decade following Ukraine’s independence in 1991, the agriculture sector experienced a
contraction due to low demand, poor management, lack of robust property rights and structural
problems at the farm level. By the early 2000s, a number of factors contributed to an improved
environment for agriculture, although problems with property rights and credit remained. One
initiative that sought to overcome some of the remaining problems was the government’s land
reform program, which aimed to transform the nature of rural agriculture from a Soviet era
collectivized system to a market oriented system based on clearly defined rights. The first stage
of that program – to transfer ownership of collectives to their members in undivided shares – was
mostly completed by 1998, and the second stage – to issue land share certificates for an un-
demarcated parcel – was completed soon after. The third stage was to issue state deeds for
demarcated parcels, which would build on the government’s reforms facilitating renting of
agricultural land, to improve access to land for entrepreneurs and thereby increase efficiency of
production, plus improve access to low cost credit and provide rental income to owners. In
parallel, revisions to the legal framework relating to property rights were slowly progressing.

The Rural Land Titling and Cadastre Development Project (the project) sought to build on these
initiatives, and in doing so support achievement of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
objectives of poverty reduction and job creation. This project reflected a typical post-Soviet land
privatization/administration program that required international expertise in land policy,
institutional change and technical advice. Land reform is often a complex process where land
should be allocated as equitably as possible, which requires a clear legal/regulatory framework,
significant technical field work (surveying and mapping), issuing of legal documents, awareness
raising for beneficiaries, and a cadre of professionals to complete the work. Once land has been
allocated, the rights should be recorded in a secure register that is accessible to interested parties.
Post-Soviet land reform in Ukraine required substantial changes to all of these elements. Bank
involvement was regarded as critical in order to: (i) introduce international best practice into the
design and implementation of a modern land administration system; (ii) ensure appropriate
technical standards; and (iii) strengthen implementation capacity of relevant government
institutions. While the land allocation process was already underway at the time of project
design, with two million state deeds issued, the government requested funds to help complete the
process for all eligible rural citizens (approximately 6.5 million state deeds in total). The project
would also support completion of the legal/regulatory framework and technical work (aerial
photographs, digital orthophotos and cadastral maps) and development of a new registration
system for the whole country, which would benefit both rural and urban land owners.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)

The wording of the Project Development Objective (PDO) is different in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) page 2,1 in the PAD Annex 1,2 and in the Loan Agreement (LA) schedule 2,

                                                       
1
  The PDO as stated on Page 2 of the PAD is to: “establish a national cadastre and title registration system, allocate
land parcels to individuals in rural areas on an equitable basis, establish their property rights by issuing state deeds

                                                           1 
 
page 19. In essence the three PDOs are the same and differ only in terms of language and detail.
The version from the LA will be used for this report because it is legally binding and it is more
detailed, and hence more appropriate, given the scope of the project. It states the PDO is:
             “(i) privatization of the lands of state and communal farm enterprises, agencies and organizations as well as
             retirees from among them, designating for each of them a land parcel (share); (ii) allocating land parcels to
             owners of land parcels (shares) in kind (on site) and issuing state deeds to them; (iii) encouraging the
             restructuring of farm enterprises into more efficient units, with due consideration for environmental and
             social safeguards; and (iv) establishing a cadastre and title registry system where rights to immovable
             property can be adequately registered.

Key outcome and intermediate indicators, as listed in Annex 1 to the PAD, are detailed on the
chart in section 1.3 below:

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The revised PDO, which was adopted as part of the Level 1 restructuring in November 2008, was
to assist the Borrower in: (i) privatization of the lands of state and communal farm enterprises,
agencies and organizations through transfer to the employees of these enterprises, agencies and
organizations as well as retirees from among them, designating for each of them a land parcel
(share); (ii) allocating land parcels to owners of land parcels (shares) in kind (on site) and
issuing state deeds to them; and (iii) establishing a land cadastre.

There were a variety of changes to the PDO. First, the revised PDO language was aligned more
closely to the description of the project appearing in the LA. Second, the word “land” was
inserted before the word “cadastre” in point iii, while reference to a “title registry system” was
deleted. Third, the words “encourage the restructuring of farm enterprises into more efficient
units, with due consideration for environmental and social safeguards” were deleted. The PDO
and intermediate indicators before and after restructuring are outlined in the table below:

The revisions were necessary for various reasons. First, the wording from the LA schedule 2 was
included for the sake of consistency. Second, the national target for issuing state deeds3 would
remain at 4 million but it was clarified that the project would fund 800,000 since alternative
funds would be used for the other 3.2 million. While the specific project target of 800,000 titles

  Throughout project documentation the terms ‘state deeds’, ‘state acts’, and ‘titles’ are used interchangeably and
refer to the legal document allocated to individuals for land that was used for the basis of registration. The Ukrainian
term is GosAkt. For the sake of consistency this report will use the term ‘state deed’ except in cases that specifically
quote the PDO or indicators from the PAD, Legal Agreement restructuring paper etc.

was made in 2006 as part of the initial discussions for restructuring4, it was formalized as part of
the 2008 Level 1 restructuring. Third, the changes to the unified cadastre and title registration
system were necessary because legal and institutional obstacles prevented the State Agency for
Land Resources of Ukraine (SALRU) and its subsidiary the State Land Cadastre Center (SLCC)
from initiating the system as mandated by the 2004 Law on State Registration of Proprietary
Rights. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) refused to approve the necessary by-laws to implement
that law because it was operating a separate legal registry of its own and did not wish to have its
system replaced by a new system under the authority of the SALRU/SLCC.5 Thus, the revised
PDO speaks only of a land cadastre.

Also, deletion of references to the SLCC was required because the SLCC would not be receiving
income from registration work as the administrator of the unified cadastre and title registration
and, therefore, the SLCC management was unwilling to fulfill the requirements for the planned
reform such as sharing financial information on accounts or developing a Business Plan
acceptable to the Bank.6 Consequently, it was agreed to cancel component E (Cadastre System
Development) but some of the project funds originally assigned to the SLCC were reallocated to
the SALRU under component D2 (Cadastral Information System) to develop the land cadastre
system. Technical cooperation and coordination continued with the SLCC, as the subsidiary of
the SALRU.

Finally, the farm restructuring process did not result in the expected shift to small-scale farming,
with most owners deciding to rent out their properties rather than farm the lands themselves. In
addition, there never was real commitment from the borrowers to implement the activities even
though during project design the idea was heavily endorsed by Bank management. Thus, the
project activities relating to the establishment of farm advisory services and the monitoring of
improved economic efficiency of the farms were removed.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The target population was holders of property rights to agricultural land, whether rural or urban
dwellers, with a particular focus on the poorer and less powerful property right holders, through
a program of providing greater security for their rights, improving the transferability of rights,
and consequently the ability to use the rights to secure mortgage loans. Benefits were to arise due
to a clearer legal structure, improved means of establishing and recording property rights,
increased protection of rights and ease of using enforcement measures, plus greater access to
lower cost credit. Further, through restructuring of collective farms and issuing state deeds to
individuals, right holders were to benefit through direct control over their property, with
increases in productivity or income through rents. More broadly, as a result of these
developments, it was envisaged that there would be benefits to the country’s economy, and thus
the entire population. Following the November 2008 restructuring, rural citizens would no longer

  The aim of the unified title and cadastre registration system was to link the information traditionally maintained by
the cadastre (mainly technical mapping information for land parcels) with the information in the deeds registry
(legal rights). This linkage is fundamental for the development of a modern land administration system.

  The SLCC and its local offices were created as self-financing legal entities wholly owned by the Government,
under the authority of the SALRU.

benefit from farm advisory services but they would continue to benefit from other project
activities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

There were seven components to the Specific Investment Lending (SIL) that were to support
progress in reaching the PDO. These were:

    A. Institutional Development and Legal Reform, which was to reform the SALRU and its
       subsidiary the SLCC from a Soviet-style land use planning organization to one more
       suited to a market economy, with improved zoning regulation and environmental
       advisory services for the public, plus an improved legal framework for property rights.
    B. Public Awareness, which was to increase the public’s understanding about the nature of
       private property rights, the program of systematic titling of their rights, their entitlements
       and obligations as right holders, including rights to lease out property, and farm
       management matters.
    C. Training, which was to develop the capacity of the large numbers of staff needed to carry
       out the restructuring and registration work. Long-term, university based training was to
       ensure that new graduates would be familiar with market based economic principles and
       a system of private property rights.
    D. Land Survey Works, the second largest component by value, which was to systematically
       divide land of former collective farms so that deeds to individual parcels could be issued
       to each right holder.
    E. Cadastre System Development, the largest component by value, which was to support
       institutional reform for the SLCC and the development of a national cadastre system that
       would have various functions, including the basis for a unified title registration system
       which records rights and transactions. In the longer term, the system was to form a basis
       for land taxes, planning and geospatial information systems. The design was to be
       implemented in three phases: (1) interim system development, (2) cadastre system
       development and rural office network, and (3) registry module upgrade and urban office
       network. The ideal scenario was identified where the unified title/cadastre law would be
       adopted at the early stages of the project, but the PAD also noted a ‘second best’ solution
       with additional flexibility to allow alternative institutional arrangements until the legal
       basis for the unified system was put in place.
    F. Farm Restructuring Services, which was to provide advisory services to new or potential
       land owners on such matters as legal rights and obligations of land owners, renting of
       land, dispute resolution options, and planning for land used in common with other
       owners. Advice was also to be provided to former collectives to deal with property and
       financial issues arising from the shift to a system of private property rights.
    G. Project Implementation, which was to ensure that the project was efficiently and
       effectively implemented with support from a project implementation unit (PIU).

1.6 Revised Components

Following the November 2008 restructuring, component F (Farm Restructuring Services) was
cancelled. Component E (Cadastre System Development) was also cancelled: the activities
related to the institutional reform of the SLCC were cancelled while the original unified cadastre
and title registration system development was narrowed to focus only on the land cadastre and
funds were moved to component D2 under the authority of the SALRU in order to complete
development of the land cadastre system and provide the secure registration of state deeds that
were being issued. Component G (Project Implementation) was modified to reflect the narrower
focus of the project. The other components were not changed.

1.7 Other significant changes

In addition to the Level 1 restructuring in November, 2008 (Section 1.3 above), there were four
level 2 restructurings and some other changes during the course of the project that are
summarized below:

       A PPF was established which allowed the PIU to be set up and some initial work was
        done although no funds were disbursed before the project became effective and they were
        absorbed into the main project budget;
       Component E of the project was suspended on February 21, 2006 because of the inability
        of the SLCC to implement the unified title and cadastre registry system. This meant that
        the SLCC funds allocated for running the registration system could not be utilized and the
        SLCC business plan would not be required until the suspension was lifted. Attempts to
        solve the impasse between the MOJ and SALRU regarding the unified system and to
        restructure the project continued without success. Component E remained suspended
        until it was cancelled during the 2008 Level 1 restructuring.
       Level 2 restructuring: cancellation of $74 million by letter dated July 24, 2006. The sum
        of $54 million was cancelled because much of the work for issuing state deeds under
        component D had been completed using other sources of fund and, therefore, cost savings
        from the loan could be made. The sum of $24 million was cancelled because the SLCC
        had not utilized funds under component E to cover operating costs in 2004, 2005 and half
        of 2006;
       Level 2 restructuring: cancellation of $19.6 million by letter dated June 2, 2008 for funds
        related to support for the SLCC (under component E) since direct support to the SLCC
        was dropped from the project;
       Level 2 restructuring: cancellation of $11.85 million by letter June 24, 2010 of which
        $10.05 million related to some works under component D that could not be completed
        within the timeframe of the project and $1.8 million for further cost savings for
        registration of state deeds that were paid for through other means;
       Under a Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL), which was prepared in parallel with the
        project and coordinated with it, the government was obliged to adopt the legal basis for
        implementing a unified title registry. Although the government failed to do so, the funds
        under the PAL were nonetheless released to the government; and
       Extension of the project closing date by 10 months to provide sufficient time to finalize
        the nation-wide rollout of the IT system and to populate the system with data.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis: The PAD and aides memoire from the preparation
missions demonstrate a thorough planning process, utilizing a full range of professional expertise
to investigate circumstances, advise on options, draw on lessons learned both in Ukraine and the
region, and develop a project with their counterparts. Relevant reports were reviewed, project
alternatives were outlined and a review of lessons learned was included.

Assessment of the project design/Quality at Entry: The project had numerous components and
sub-components. With the exception of component F which was under the control of the
Ministry of Agrarian Reform, they were all under the control of the SALRU (or its subsidiary,
the SLCC). The lengthy project period (nine years) was consciously chosen so that there would
be adequate time to complete the work of such a large scope in a country as big as Ukraine. The
components and activities were relevant for the post-Soviet context at that time and attempted to
address the full complement of policy, institutional and legal/regulatory aspects for rural land
privatization, development of a modern land administration system, and provision of farm
advisory services. However, the Bank overestimated the ability of the government to manage the
complex activities or to deliver on the reforms promised during project design. Subsequent
institutional rivalry and political factors would adversely impact project implementation. Later, a
2009 Quality Assessment Group (QAG) Learning Review of ECA Disbursements found that the
project was “over-designed and beyond the capacity of the government agencies to manage”,
with 5 major components, including one with little government ownership – component F, Farm
Restructuring Services. In addition to delaying implementation, Component F diverted attention
from main project themes.7 These issues were addressed in the Level 1 restructuring when the
project focus was reduced and targeted to the land cadastre.

Adequacy of government’s commitment: There was strong commitment from the government
between its request for a project in 2000 and Board approval in mid-2003. As the PAD noted, the
President and Parliament had developed the legislative framework to support private ownership
of agricultural land, and the SALRU had actively issued over 2 million state deeds. The
government sought the project to expedite the completion of its existing national program and to
complete the complimentary activities such as development of the registration system. However,
substantial changes within the government resulted in a period of inertia from late 2003 to 2008
and numerous changes within the management of the implementing agency further delayed
progress. It was not until the last years of the project that the political and institutional issues
were settled, a stable management structure within the implementing agency was established,
and there was more commitment and focus on completing project activities.

Assessment of risks: The PAD lists a set of potential problems that are consistent with the type of
project, objectives, institutional situation and broader legislative, economic and political context

  A QAG report issued on 07/29/2003 rated the project Quality at Entry (QAE) rating of ‘satisfactory’. The report
acknowledges the difficulty of addressing land issues in Ukraine and the Bank team’s persistence in addressing the
overall goal and steps in the land reform process. The report did note some weaknesses in the monitoring and
evaluation framework and imprecision in the outputs and outcomes. 

                                                         7 
 
of Ukraine in the early 2000s. They are the types of risks encountered in other land projects and
most risks were rated as substantial. The PAD mentions the specific problems with institutional
rivalry and that the Ministry of Justice had a competing interest for the legal registry. The
preparation team was aware of the risks that ultimately affected the project and used the
DPL/PAL to increase leverage with the government. Nevertheless, while the risks were
identified and mitigation measures put in place, those measures were neither fully executed nor
sufficient to result in the planned reforms.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation saw the full range of possibilities arise: from the straightforward and successful
to the highly problematic and unsuccessful. Components A (Institutional Development and Legal
Reform), B (Public Awareness), C (Training) and G (Project Implementation) progressed with
few problems. Component D gave rise to routine problems that are commonly associated with
large contracts, such as the aerial photography/land survey contracts and the IT system
development contract. Procuring and managing such large contracts were new to the government
and PIU and it took time to ‘learn by doing’. At the other end of the spectrum, most of the
activities in component E and F were ultimately unsuccessful and resulted in suspension,
cancellations of funds and restructuring. The details of progress of each of the components are
considered in more detail in Annex 2.

The project had three Washington based task team leaders (TTLs) over the life of the project
although the second TTL had been part of the initial design team and provided continuity
through much of the project lifespan. The last TTL spoke Russian which greatly facilitated direct
communication with counterparts and helped to strengthen the relationship between the
supervision team and the SALRU/SLCC. An initial mid-term assessment recognized the need for
substantial changes and the Level 1 restructuring and the 2009 Mid-Term Review was used for
further project assessment.

The project faced many challenges, particularly at the beginning, including:

       institutional problems between the SALRU and the MOJ regarding the SALRU’s
        mandate to create a unified cadaster and title registry, with the MOJ refusing to issue the
        necessary regulations that would relinquish its control over the legal register, even though
        the MOJ had been part of the project negotiation team and had not objected to the
        proposed unified system at that time;
       related to the institutional problems, administrative problems within the government and
        Parliament in terms of dealing with matters promptly. For example, the Level 1
        restructuring took almost 2 years to complete due to a lack of decision making or sense of
        urgency within the government;
       poor capacity and lack of willingness of the SLCCs to implement reforms, the secretive
        nature of the SLCC’s operations, and a lack of willingness by the SLCC to open its
        operational activities to public scrutiny, which ultimately resulted in cancellation of funds
        for related activities;
       payment delays to contractors, linked to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) processes,
        adversely affected the mapping contractors’ ability to perform and deliver;

                                                  8 
 
        contractual disputes regarding aerial photography/land survey and development of the IT
         system slowed progress and diverted resources away from other activities. The contract
         dispute for one aerial photography contract remained unresolved at project closing,
         although the work was retendered and completed prior to project closure. The contract for
         the IT system was cancelled upon mutual agreement of the contractor and the SALRU,
         and the alternative in-house development was completed and the system installed in all
         cadastral offices prior to the end of the project;
        as the QAG Learning Review of ECA Disbursements notes, government financial
         management (FM) and procurement procedures were perceived as complex and dealt
         with partly through stringent and complex requirements in the Loan Agreement. These
         complex requirements resulted in subsequent implementation delays; and
        also noted in the QAG Learning Review of ECA Disbursements, the failure of the Bank
         to hold the government to its commitment under a PAL had a negative impact on
         implementation. Under the PAL, the government had agreed to undertake certain legal
         reforms, including implementing regulations to establish the joint cadastre and title
         registry system. Although the SLCC was ready at the beginning of 2005 to operate a
         unified registration system (software was ready, staff trained and local offices prepared),
         the MOJ’s failure to issue the necessary regulations prevented the SLCC from
         commencing. Important leverage for the project was lost when the Bank did not hold the
         government to its undertaking in this regard and the funds were dispersed anyway.8

The problems noted above had an impact on the efficiency of implementation support and
supervision. Due to the unresolved institutional and political issues at the beginning of the
project, the Bank team and management had to spend significant time working with the
government to discuss options and then restructure the project accordingly, a process which took
over two years to complete. However, once the institutional question was resolved, the new law
approved, and the project restructured to reflect the changes, progress improved and the project
ended successfully. The factors that gave rise to the positive outcomes were:

        in the final two years of the project, strong political support from the President of Ukraine
         and a professional management team with technical expertise at the implementing agency
         provided the necessary leadership to complete all project activities;
        perseverance of the Bank team to work through problems with the borrower in an open
         and constructive manner, including detailed discussions on the institutional issues that
         arose when the MOJ refused to issue the necessary regulations for the unified cadastre
         and title registration, which ultimately resulted in new legislation clarifying the
         institutional structure;
        flexibility to adopt the ‘second best’ option outlined in the PAD for the unified cadastre
         and title registration, which was narrowed to focus on finalizing the land cadastre system
         under the SALRU while ensuring interoperability that can support any institutional

  The QAG ECA Disbursement Learning Review states: “DPO link was ineffective, and disruptive. Bank credibility
was reduced when the complementary PAL legal reforms were not achieved, but the PAL disbursed anyway, and
this loss of credibility seems to have affected the Bank's credibility more broadly, including on this project.”(QAG
Report, page 3 Section b point 2: Panel Assessments and Recommendations)

        arrangement and has ultimately resulted in a system that now has automatic links to the
        MOJ legal registry;
       acceptance of changed circumstances and realistic responses in reallocating funds or
        cancelling components, such as the lack of demand for farm restructuring advice or lack
        of progress on meeting the Bank’s requirements with regard to the finances and
        management of the SLCC;
       Bank management agreed to extend the project by ten months to complete the nation-
        wide IT system rollout and upload data even though there was reasonable concern about
        the risks. The Bank supervision team helped to develop a detailed work plan that was
        followed up with monthly and weekly videoconferences to ensure implementation; and

        implementation support and supervision through the World Bank/FAO Cooperative

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design: Annex 1 to the PAD contains a set of monitoring indicators that match the
elements of the PDO and activities under each component. The indicators are a mix of
quantitative and qualitative measures, and they provide the essential basis for assessing progress
in meeting the PDO. The results framework (RF) indicated that the data would be collected,
through reports, social assessments, customer surveys, and tests of knowledge. The M&E design
benefited from a social assessment through which land allocation was examined, with particular
focus on rural inhabitants’ perceptions of asset allocation and knowledge of their rights.
Furthermore, the project applied lessons learned from previous successful projects by
incorporating indicators such as training.

Nevertheless, a few shortcomings have been noted. First, the 2003 RF was output-based rather
than outcome-oriented as was the common Bank practice for projects at that time. Even though
outcomes were implied in the PAD text (e.g. training, public awareness), they were not explicitly
stated in the Annex 1 RF. Baseline information was not included and some indicators did not
have an end target value. The RF was revised in 2006 to reflect a more concrete set of activities
with targets and was later incorporated into the 2008 Level 1 restructuring. Second, data for the
core indicator of female ownership rights resulting from the project was introduced by the Bank
for all land projects in 2012. However, these data were never collected because the indicator was
introduced towards the end of the project. Finally, some inconsistencies between the restructured
PDOs and indicators were identified and had to be revised in order to measure progress more
adequately.

M&E implementation: Based on the PAD, a set of indicators was developed at the beginning of
the project and data were routinely collected, reported and evaluated. The M&E results covered
both quantitative data gathered directly from SLCC offices and qualitative data, derived
primarily from the surveys that were conducted on a regular basis throughout the project. The
PIU had an M&E specialist and the Bank team provided support and guidance on collection and
review of data for each indicator. Two independent surveys were done in 2004 and 2005 to
examine the impact of land titling and to assess the level of public awareness and attitudes to
land reform. Another independent sociological survey was conducted in 2010 to evaluate the

                                                10 
 
status of land reform in Ukraine. One weakness noted is that the results of the social surveys are
not clearly captured in the RF reporting. For example, for Component B, reporting on whether
owners feel more secure with state acts as opposed to the earlier share certificates included
information only as to the extent and coverage of the public awareness campaigns. Thus, output
rather than outcome oriented. Finally, the beneficiary and stakeholder surveys done at the end of
the project were used to assess user satisfaction with the new cadastre system. (see Annex 5 for
further details).

M&E utilization: The results of the M&E were closely considered and used by the Bank team,
PIU and SALRU/SLCC in relation to project activities to confirm the success of certain activities
and to adjust others in which the results indicated that a change of direction was required. It
appears that the SALRU has not utilized the data beyond the project and, with the closure of the
project and loss of the PIU M&E officer, M&E activities promoted under the project appear to
have ceased. However, the SLCC continues to closely and regularly monitor the activities that
are within its core functions, especially the performance of the new IT system.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards: The environmental safeguards specialist carried out regular review and the project
rating was consistently satisfactory. As a result, the overall rating of safeguard compliance for
the project is satisfactory. The project triggered one safeguard policy—environmental
assessment—and was a Category F project. A rather extensive assessment of the risks involved
under the project found that the division of land into individual parcels, as part of the titling
process, had the potential to cause negative environmental impacts. There is no explanation in
the PAD of how parcelization could have this impact, as only existing farmland would be
subdivided. Nonetheless, mitigation measures were included in the procedure manual for land
subdivision, staff were trained in appropriate procedures, and an environmental assessment was
to be conducted on each farm before its division. The issue of environmental protection was not
raised at any time during implementation as being problematic.

Procurement: The overall rating for procurement during the project cycle is moderately
satisfactory. Procurement plans for project implementation were developed and revised as the
PDOs and project components changed. The overall project risk for procurement was rated
Medium to High, considering the lack of Bank procurement experience in the PIU and the
procurement environment in Ukraine at the time. Procurement staffing at the PIU was adequate
and the staff became more knowledgeable and efficient as the project progressed. However,
projects related to the large mapping and IT contracts were delayed as a result of the failure to
meet major deadlines in the agreed procurement plans. It should be noted that the two major
contract disputes were the result of implementation issues, not procurement related problems.

Financial Management: Overall, Financial Management (FM) for the project components is
rated moderately satisfactory. This includes project accounting and reporting arrangements,
staffing, internal control procedures, planning and budgeting, counterpart funding, and financial
manual and external audits. The project was generally in compliance with the financial
management requirements of the Loan Agreement, which were very complex, as well as with the
Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) and audit reports. The FM staff within the PIU performed

                                                11 
 
capably and all audits had a clear opinion. There were some issues related to the processes and
timeliness of the MOF to release funds which caused delays with contract payments and had the
follow on effect of delaying contract implementation as the delay caused a cash flow problem for
some contractors. In addition, the SLCC did not cooperate in financial matters, and therefore that
aspect of reporting, disbursement and procurement was poor prior to the suspension and then
cancellation of funds for component E.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

In the final months of the project, the new IT system allowing the public to access the cadastre
data for land became operational and data for all registered parcels were loaded into the system.
Under the new law the SLCC provides cadastre information to the MOJ and these data populate
the MOJ legal registry database, thereby creating the crucial link between the cadastre and legal
data. This is a long-term activity, but initial cooperation has proceeded successfully. Continued
cooperation between the SALRU/SLCC and MOJ will increase the number of beneficiaries of
improved land administration services. Thus, while the country did not adopt a unified title
registration system under a single agency as envisioned in the ideal scenario for Component E,
accepting the ‘second best’ option has resulted in the country moving closer to a streamlined
process where cadastre and registration data are shared and accessed using interoperable IT
systems.9

Nevertheless, it is important to note that the while the roll out of the new IT system is a
substantial step, additional work remains. First, further development and stabilization of the
system and its link to the MOJ registry need to be part of a long term strategy. Maintenance and
sustainability of the vital spatial data assets produced under the project (i.e. the digital orthophoto
maps and the cadastral index maps) should be planned and supported with adequate human and
financial resources. As of the end of September, 2013, the SLCC confirms that the strategy has
been approved and that a tender is underway to procure equipment to continue production and
updating of the spatial data. The training of IT staff continues and there has been no system
interruption during the first 9 months of operation.

Second, the current cadastral index maps only reflect the parcels of land which have been
registered under the project and others that were available in digital form. Thus, the records are
incomplete and a plan is needed to include all private and public land parcels in the country, as
well as registration of buildings. This is also a long term activity but initial steps have been made
to inventory all land and a pilot project for building cadastre registration has been completed. In
addition, registrations continue on a daily basis from land owners.

Third, further institutional cooperation between the MOJ and SALRU/SLCC is needed to
facilitate the completion of a linked cadastre-legal registration system and ultimately introduce a
one-stop-shop for clients. The current law sets the framework for data sharing between the
institutions and a technical working group is working on simplifying procedures, planning the

  There is no single, best approach for linking cadastre and legal data. Some countries in the ECA region have
chosen to adopt the single agency approach (United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Albania, Georgia, Kyrgyz
Republic) while others maintain separate institutions and link the data through interoperable IT systems (Germany,
                                       
Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia).

                                                        12 
 
introduction of digitally signed extracts, and enhancing the notary module to allow clients to
conduct all business without having to visit a cadastre office.

With regard to policy, the Bank and USAID sponsored an assessment under the Bank’s Land
Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) in 2011. The purpose of the LGAF is to assess a
country’s land governance position and develop policy and other responses to improve that
position. The Ukraine LGAF report, produced in 2012, pointed to numerous areas for further
reform across six thematic categories that could form the basis for policy, legislative and
administrative change. Important policy issues of a broader nature remain outstanding,
particularly the continued moratorium on the sale of agricultural holdings. The project has
contributed to the resolution of this outstanding issue by completing the technical mapping work
that is considered by the government as a prerequisite for opening up an agricultural land market.
It is interesting to note that interviews with the rural population actually identified a large portion
of the population who are against lifting the moratorium due to fears over losing their rights or
being subject to outside pressures.

The government has expressed interest in another project to assist the SALRU to continue
developing its system and the Bank is currently engaged in providing technical assistance (TA)
for the sector and is developing an Institutional Development Fund proposal on ‘evidenced based
policy making for agricultural land’.

Overall, Ukraine is in a much better position to advance its cadastre system now than at any time
during the project in terms of institutional mandates and capacity. Most of the institutional issues
have been resolved and capacity has been greatly expanded. In addition, the mapping work and
new IT system produced under the project serve as the foundations for development of a
National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) that is a key priority for land agencies and
governments around the world.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Objectives: the project’s objectives to provide people with robust land rights and to establish a
system of publicly recorded property rights, together with an informed body of property owners,
remain highly relevant today. As Ukraine continues its move to a market economy, real property
rights and an economically and legally literate community have supported the process, and they
will form a strong foundation for future development and economic growth. The President of
Ukraine’s Program of Economic Reforms 2010-14 included the goal of efficient operation of the
land market and makes reference to the completion of issuing state deeds and the electronic land
cadastre system. The view of the relevance of the project’s objectives can also be seen from the
same broad objectives being adopted through numerous other Bank sponsored projects in the
ECA region where the countries have sought to establish and develop market economies.

Design: The main goals of the project, to convert vague land shares to formally registered state
deeds to specific land parcels and to create an efficient registration system, remain fundamental
and highly relevant. However, the project appears to have been too large and ambitious in both

                                                  13 
 
scope and funding, although this conclusion is based more on the capacity of the government to
deliver than on the relevance or the needs of the country. Further, it does not appear that there
was any real support or interest by the government for Component F (Farm Restructuring
Services). However, the education and training components were appropriate and ensured that
the human element was adequately addressed and the legal/regulatory component supported
development of a functioning framework, once the political and institutional decisions were
made. Changes were made to the project’s design as events evolved, and it therefore remained
relevant to the time.

Implementation: the approach adopted during implementation, which was flexible within the
confines of the overall project design, was relevant to the needs of Ukraine over time. Due to
close and continuous supervision, developments and problems could be monitored as they arose,
and suitable responses formulated and implemented. Bureaucracy within the Bank and the
Ukraine government sometimes slowed the process, but overall, those implementing the project
were able to modify or develop activities so that the results remained relevant to the country. As
an illustration, at restructuring the ‘second best’ option for the IT system was adopted and
implemented. Further, where changed circumstances required it, such as with components E and
F, all parties responded in a pragmatic way by cancelling funds and activities.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Overall, the project has made a positive impact on securing property rights, developing a modern
land administration system and supporting the introduction of a land market in Ukraine. At the
beginning of the project, work was already underway to allocate land but the government sought
Bank support to increase the number of state deeds issued to eligible owners, to assist in
developing a sound legal/regulatory framework, to educate the rural population, to strengthen the
capacity of cadastre office staff and other land professionals, to complete the technical mapping
work, and to develop a national system to record rights. The project provided much of the
necessary technical assistance and other support to achieve these results and Ukraine now stands
as a leader in the region with regard to its modern cadastre system, with national coverage,
supported by digital records and on-line access. A few of the smaller countries in the region
(such as the Netherlands, Lithuania and Macedonia) have equally comprehensive cadastre
systems and on-line services, but it is rare for larger countries to achieve this level of complete
coverage or sophistication. Germany and Spain do have such coverage and on-line services, but
France, for example, does not. The positive impact is reflected in the stakeholder workshops and
survey that were conducted as part of this intensive learning ICR (see Annex 5).

A more detailed review of the PDO before and after the Level 1 restructuring result in the
following assessment: Under the original PDO and design, as stated in section 1.2, the project is
rated as unsatisfactory. The original PDO reflects an overly ambitious project design that
included the creation of a unified cadastre and title registration system under the SALRU that
had to be abandoned due to institutional rivalry, and the support to farm restructuring component
for which there was little government interest or commitment. Thus, these two objectives could
not be achieved and resulted in project suspension, cancellations of funds and restructuring.
Although it can be argued that all other project objectives were achieved and the ‘second best’
solution for the cadastre system was adopted, ultimately creating a fully automated cadastre with

                                                14 
 
links to the legal register, and $54 million in cancellations due to savings because other funding
was found for issuing state deeds, there were nevertheless significant other cancellations and
problems that lead to this initial unsatisfactory rating.
However, following the 2008 restructuring, the PDO was changed (see section 1.2) and
achievement of those objectives should be considered satisfactory. All objectives were met or
exceeded, and the outcomes include the following:

Privatization of rural land is complete and citizens have secure land rights: The project
contributed to completion of the rural land titling process. Although the project supported issuing
a more limited number of titles than envisioned during the design phase because other sources of
funds were used, the project nevertheless impacted the process through development of the regulatory
framework, the manuals for completing the work, the production of orthophoto maps and cadastral index
maps for the entire country, the field survey work (albeit with a reduced amount to that originally
planned), development of the national cadastre system, and the registration of the titles into that system.
All titles issued for rural land plus an additional 10+ million titles for other types of land are
securely recorded in the system. Thus, the project contributed to the equitable allocation of rural
land, secure recording of land rights for all types of land, and the on-going development of a land
market.

The national cadastre system is complete: The project produced aerial photographs, digital
orthophoto maps, and cadastral index maps for the entire country, and assisted the government
on how to transform the 1000+ local systems into a single national coordinate system that is
compliant with European standards. These spatial data serve as the basis for further development
of a National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and are being combined with other existing data
sets, such as soil quality maps, using best practice principles endorsed by the project for
technical standards, collection, use, and sharing.

More informed land owners and increasing confidence: The extensive public awareness
campaign conducted under the project helped to ensure equitable distribution of land by
informing people of their rights and choices. It has also resulted in more knowledgeable land
owners, thereby increasing their understanding and power when deciding how to use or allocate
their land, and the new system allows them to access cadastral information online. While public
disclosure of some data is currently restricted by law, the public can access all of the cadastre
maps online and locate their properties. This is an important first step in increasing openness and
transparency of property related data, thereby increasing the public’s confidence in the system.

Lowering Transaction Costs: The new IT system has brought about a dramatic decrease in
transaction costs. The cost of obtaining a land parcel registration was reduced by two-thirds, and
the cost of obtaining a cadastral extract was reduced by half. (see annex 3 for details).

Improved Service Delivery: Cadastre offices are now able to offer more efficient and effective
services to citizens due to the project: business processes have been reengineered, spatial data
exists for the entire country, the cadastre system is uniform throughout the country, and the new
IT system is based on modern principles and technology that is accessible via the web on the
SLCC’s geoportal. Under the new law, the critical link to the MOJ State Registration Service has
been made and cadastral information is now automatically sent to the legal registry. In the first 9
months of 2013 more than 900,000 new parcels have been registered and there have been 2.5
                                                    15 
 
million hits on the geoportal. The average time for those registrations was 21 minutes (from
application acceptance in the system to issuance of the registration certificate) and required only
one visit to the cadastre office, which is a substantial improvement over the former process that
often required several visits and days or weeks to complete. The beneficiary survey results (See
Annex 5) show that users gave the highest level of satisfaction to working with the new IT
system.

Increasing the number of land professionals: The project contributed directly to building a
cadre of land professionals who can provide the necessary services to support private ownership
and the emerging land market. All existing and new cadastre office staff received training and 9
universities were equipped, lecturers were trained and they are now providing courses in land
cadastre and land survey.

In summary, although the project experienced many setbacks and difficulties it ultimately met,
and in some cases exceeded, the revised objectives and targets and has had a lasting impact on
the land sector in the country. Achievement of the revised PDOs should, therefore, be considered
satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

One of the main goals of the project was to establish a national land cadastre system where all
local offices use the same system and follow standard procedures. In particular, it helped develop
a new IT system to improve the efficiency of transactions by reducing transaction time as well as
transaction cost.

Reduction in Time to Process Transactions
The process to register a land plot has been reduced from several days to 21 minutes. This is the
nationwide average of the time between accepting documents from the people and issuing a
certificate after successful registration in the cadastre. Since initial registration was completed
for more than 16 million parcels under the project, these land owners no longer have to spend
time or money to gather and register their documents and will benefit from faster service for any
future transactions.

Moreover, with business processes reengineered and the new system in place people who want to
register new parcels need to visit only one office (rayon office) as opposed to two offices (rayon
and oblast offices) as was the case previously. This has further reduced the time it takes to
register a land plot or subsequent transactions.

Reduction in Cost of transactions
A well-functioning property rights system minimizes transaction costs, which in turn should
stimulate land markets and facilitate the provision of mortgage loans. Until recently, the legal
rights to land and buildings were recorded separately. In fact, there were seven separate registries
maintained by different bodies and institutions to record rights concerning immovable property.
The consolidation of these registries into a single agency under the MOJ State Registration
Service, combined with the work done under the project to improve cadastral data and services,
are a significant step towards creating an efficient system for registering property rights. As a

                                                16 
 
result, the cost of obtaining a land parcel registration was reduced by two-thirds, and the cost of
obtaining a cadastral extract was reduced by half. (See Annex 3 for details).

The financial sustainability of the SLCC is important to guarantee that these gains in efficiency
are maintained and further improvements are made. Currently, the recurrent costs to SLCC
exceed what users are being charged. However, this gap is closing which is a positive
development for SLCC’s financial sustainability as it will help secure the long term efficiency of
this project. Once SLCC’s revenues exceed its costs, some of those gains can be transferred to
the customers through lower cost of service and/or used to add more registration data into the
system so more land owners can benefit.

Costs of titling:
With regard to contracting of survey and other registration work, the systematic titling costs
under the project, roughly estimated at $ 16 / parcel, indicate a good level of cost effectiveness
typical for the region10.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
A rating of moderately satisfactory for the overall project outcome is justified because: (a) all
revised PDO and intermediate indicators were achieved and in some cases exceeded, strongly
contributing to positive change in a complex sector in such a large country that has experienced
significant political change and uncertainty; (b) the project remains highly relevant and has had a
positive impact on equitable allocation of land rights, providing secure title to those rights and
enhancing the efficiency and transparency of Ukrainian land markets; and (c) the project has
resulted in important efficiency gains in terms of a reduction in transaction costs and improved
service delivery.

While the project went through several restructurings, the Level 1 restructuring was completed
with only 24% of funds disbursed. Applying the methodology from the ICR Guidelines, a
weighted rating of 4.28 is calculated and corresponds to an overall rating of moderately
satisfactory (see chart below).

The revised PDO, targets and activities were relevant to the needs of the country during the
project period, and as technology and needs evolved, so did certain activities evolve to take
advantage of developments, particularly the possibility of an on-line IT system. Over the course
of the project the necessary legal/regulatory framework was enacted, aerial photographs and base
mapping were produced for the entire country, and the national rural land allocation process was
completed with the project funding over 700,000 state deeds. While the number is somewhat
below the target of 800,000, the project issued state deeds to all eligible recipients in the project
areas. For some activities, the project contributed to exceeded expectations, such as the creation
and populating of the new IT system for the cadastre, with on line access, that covers almost 17
million properties, which is 2.6 times higher than the intended target, and important efficiency
gains were achieved.

Because many of the key performance indicators in Annex 1 to the PAD are expressed in
subjective terms that cannot be easily measured, it is difficult to objectively judge, but reports by
participants in training courses and results of customer surveys indicate that the training and
public awareness components were successful and have contributed to more knowledgeable land
owners that can exercise their rights based on informed decisions. These clients receive
improved services from the cadastral offices due to the training programs that were implemented
under the project. Further, the development of modern surveying and other courses required for a
modern cadastre system, plus the training of lecturers and the provision of equipment, has
transformed the tertiary education sector in these fields.

The project undoubtedly experienced difficulties throughout implementation. As noted
previously, the original project design had flaws, mainly due to an over-ambitious scope and
unrealistic expectations about the political economy. Delays caused by bureaucracy and certain
periods of lack of political leadership retarded what should have been prompt progress. The
project had unsatisfactory or moderately unsatisfactory ratings during FY05 - FY09 (remedied
through the restructuring) and briefly in FY13 (due to concerns about completing the in-house
development of the IT system before project closing). Two components comprising over 50 per
cent of the original loan funds were cancelled and the PDO was revised. A significant amount of
Bank resources for supervision and implementation support were needed to navigate the
changing political environment and institutional rivalry.

Despite these challenges and setbacks, both the government and Bank teams addressed the issues
and revised the activities accordingly. The project achieved the revised PDO and has made an
important contribution to a more complete, equitable, secure and open property rights system in
Ukraine. Therefore, the overall rating of moderately satisfactory is justified.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Project targeted poverty and social development, and although it did not specifically target
women, given the high proportion of women owners of agricultural land (approximately 60 per
cent, against 40 per cent for male owners), the Project’s positive outcomes have benefited many


                                                 18 
 
women in rural communities and also those in urban areas who had moved from rural areas or
inherited property rights.

With respect to poverty, as envisaged in the PAD, the project’s results have benefited people
who previously had unclear rights to land and little knowledge, bargaining power or capacity to
deal with those who rented their land, particularly managers of former collectives, and who were
running agricultural enterprises. Now, the numerous holders of state deeds have been provided
with more information about property rights and formal documents testifying to their rights to
particular properties. Survey results and responses to the publicity campaigns show that many
people became more knowledgeable and that the state deed to a particular property was seen as a
more robust form of right than a share of an undivided field. This has given them greater
bargaining power, with the expectation that they will receive better rents for their land.
For instance, the percentage of landowners that obtained money for renting their land increased
from 83.5% in 2010 to 95.2% in 2012. During the same period, the average annual rent per
hectare measured in 2012 dollars increased almost 12% from $68 to $76. These figures reflect a
major improvement from the situation in 2003 when only 13% of landowners obtained money
for renting their land and the average price per hectare was only $22—nearly 2.5 times lower
than the figure in 2012. (see details in Annex 3). While the Bank project was not the sole
supporter of titling activities, it nevertheless made important contributions to securing property
rights through issuing state deeds and supporting the development of the land cadastre and new
IT system to map, record and administer those deeds.

In social development terms, there is potential for the more efficient land administration system
to facilitate the use of property as collateral, and thus allow significant numbers of citizens to
exploit the equity of their land for business purposes. Further, once the moratorium on the sale of
agricultural land is lifted many people who no longer have a connection to the land or rural
communities will be able to sell their properties and use the funds for other socially or
economically productive activities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project was designed to fit within and support the SALRU/SLCC’s existing mandate and
operations, so to this extent, the project was primarily intended to strengthen rather than to
change it. Through support across laws, building renovations, staff training, creation of maps and
a database of properties, the project has strengthened the SALRU/SLCC from an operational
viewpoint and as a respected source of reliable data on land parcels. The SALRU/SLCC stand as
more professional and more relevant organizations today than at the beginning of the project
commencement, and this progress is partly attributed to the project’s contributions.

Further, as the SALRU/SLCC has developed over time, particularly in the last two years, the
project has been able to support that process of change. By the project’s close, the SLCC had
developed into a more open and customer focused organization, and one that was leading
progress in the land management field. Furthermore, a workable relationship with the MOJ is
beginning to emerge and will facilitate further linkage of cadastre and legal registry information.
The engagement and support of the Bank has also strengthened the SLCC’s position in arguing
for change, particularly introduction of international best practices, and Bank experts have

                                                19 
 
advised and reassured SALRU/SLCC management on appropriate technical directions. This
support from the Bank has supported the SALRU/SLCC’s move to a more respected and
authoritative organization within the government, among land market professionals and within
the broader community.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

One significant accomplishment of the project was the production of aerial photographs and
digital base maps for the entire country. These spatial data products were created for cadastral
registration but subsequent events highlighted the multi-purpose use aspect. When the
government requested information on nation-wide land use and composition, the SALRU was
able to respond quickly and comprehensively with the information. The use of aerial photographs
and other spatial data products is an increasing focus of countries in the ECA region, and
throughout the world, as they seek to develop a NSDI. The national coverage with recent
photographs and maps produced under the project provides a strong basis for Ukraine to develop
its NSDI system and the goal of data being available, quickly and cost-effectively, for multiple
purposes.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Land market stakeholders view the new IT system as an important tool in the Ukrainian market,
and the latest survey to assess user satisfaction with the system was very positive. The majority
of users rate the system between 8 and 10 on a 10-point scale. In addition, employees of land
management agencies said they benefit from the reduction in time in processing customer
requests and viewed any map inaccuracies as a temporary drawback. Land owners welcome the
opportunity to access information on-line and their feedback shows that they are actively using
the system (2.5 million hits in the first 9 months of operation). Although some users were not
happy about the fact that maps cannot be accessed without knowing the specific cadastral
numbers or by their name, those limitations are due to data privacy legislation. Other technical
issues can be resolved as system functions are refined and further services are developed.
Overall, the user feedback has been positive and user engagement is high.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The risk that the various development outcomes achieved under the project will not be
maintained is moderate, mainly due to political factors rather than the relevance or technical
quality of the work done under the project. As noted previously, secure property rights and a
solid land administration system are important for the rural sector and land market. Under the
project, various aspects of land management and the population’s understanding of their rights
and duties have been established and, once created, they should be accepted as the norm and
expected to be maintained. Further, as people are more aware of their rights, as agricultural and
other property becomes a more important economic factor, and as Ukraine shifts to a more open
society and a more market-oriented economy, land market professionals and the public will
maintain strong demands for high quality land related information and services. Nevertheless,

                                               20 
 
political aspects and government commitment to continuing key reforms in the rural areas,
especially introduction of a rural land market, remain uncertain.

From the technical side, the main threat would be that the information, records, IT system and
staff knowledge are not maintained. This would progressively devalue the information and
institutional capacity that has been produced. At the end of the project it was noted that some
issues remained for the sustainability and proper maintenance of the system. However, the SLCC
has maintained steady improvements and increased its own investments into the system since the
project ended. The results and performance of the system have been widely publicized and
demand for more information is rising. Since the institutional mandate for the SLCC appears
stable for the moment, and the cadastral system put in place with the support of the project
reflects a modern, technically advanced structure, the overall risk to the development outcome is
moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank team was experienced and knowledgeable in their fields and in the region, and they
applied a fairly standard model of institutional development and land titling to meet the needs of
Ukraine in the early 2000s. The project was technically sound and logically sequenced. Over an
extended period, the team worked closely with counterparts to design the project’s activities to
achieve the PDO. However, the project team and Bank management underestimated the effect of
the political economy and allowed the project to proceed without the necessary legal and
institutional framework in place. While the political and institutional risks were identified and
mitigation measures such as using the PAL to gain leverage were put in place, the measures
proved to be insufficient. Also, the design was later determined to be overly complex and
included a component that the government was not really interested in, and these shortcomings
had to be remedied through cancellations and restructuring. Thus, a rating of moderately
unsatisfactory is applied.

(b) Quality of Supervision: Moderately Satisfactory

Bank supervision of the project was persistent, supporting the project activities that were running
well and working through the various problems as they arose in a cooperative fashion with the
SALRU. Supervision missions visited regularly and the task team leaders conducted regular
video conferences as the need arose. The weekly video conferences that were held in the final
year of the project were instrumental in ensuring the completion and nationwide rollout of the IT
system. Overall, the advice was generally appropriate and well-targeted, drawing on technical
expertise where necessary. Further, appropriate changes to project design and activities were
introduced to help achieve the PDO and also meet the needs of both the SALRU/SLCC and the
country. The Bank team adjusted to the realities of the situation and addressed the hurdles that
arose although, as noted in the QAG Learning Review of ECA Disbursements, the Bank was
perhaps too accommodating to the SALRU and the government, giving them additional time to
act and providing the government with funds without meeting its obligations under the PAL.

                                                21 
 
Nevertheless, the dedication of the supervision team to work through the problems contributed
significantly to a successful outcome of the project and is therefore rated as moderately
satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank’s performance was adequate to the tasks and facilitated the project’s success, as
demonstrated by the final results for the outcome and performance indicators. While in hindsight
it can be seen that there are issues with the quality at entry, supervision was generally
appropriate to ensure that the project was successfully completed and the PDO was reached. The
Bank could have been more active in dealing with the institutional, political and bureaucratic
hurdles facing project progress, and therefore to have acted more quickly to cut funds or
restructure, as well as holding the government to its obligations under the PAL. On balance,
therefore, when viewed in context across the entirety of the project and the significant outcomes
achieved, these failings are moderate and an overall rating of moderately satisfactory can be
attributed.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance:           Moderately Unsatisfactory

The first decade of the twenty first century in Ukraine was a difficult time in the country’s
political development, and the difficulties were reflected in the government’s performance.
While there continued to be strong ownership and commitment to the project’s objectives (as
reformulated under the restructure), and the government even stepped up the program for issuing
state deeds using a variety of funding, there were routinely problems in the timely resolution of
issues and, in the middle of the project, wavering support for the SALRU/SLCC itself.
Conversely, towards the end of the project, the government was performing better and provided
the necessary support to the agency and project activities.

Across the project period, the government’s performance displayed a number of shortcomings.
The main problematic areas were the failure to resolve the institutional problem between the
SALRU/SLCC and MOJ regarding the cadastre and legal registry and the failure to promptly
process the restructuring. However, the government engaged regularly with the Bank team on the
issues and options, and ultimately changed the law to reflect the final policy decision to keep the
cadastre and legal registry as separate entities. The other more general problem was a lack of
support to the SALRU/SLCC at various times and the numerous changes in senior management
that impeded project implementation. Despite strong commitment to the project’s objectives
toward the end of the project, the government’s performance must be regarded as moderately
unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:            Moderately Satisfactory

Across the entire project preparation and implementation period there were numerous changes to
management within the SALRU/SLCC and thus approaches varied. During certain periods, it is
clear from the Aides Memoire that the SALRU/SLCC did not fully engage with project activities


                                                22 
 
or respond to issues in a timely manner, while at other times, particularly at the end,
SALRU/SLCC management were highly engaged and focused on completing project activities.

In terms, therefore, of commitment, appointment and engagement of some key staff, and prompt
resolution of issues, the experience is mixed across the project period. In the early stages of the
project the SALRU failed to ensure that the SLCC (which was subordinate to the SALRU) met
its obligations under the project and loan agreement, and disbursement levels were low for much
of the period. The SALRU itself faced difficulties in meeting its obligations by the cumbersome
and bureaucratic systems within the government, the institutional disputes between the SALRU
and MOJ, as well as the broader contentious political climate. However, in other areas of
performance, such as engagement with stakeholders, fiduciary obligations, M&E arrangements
and transition arrangements, the SALRU/SLCC performed without any real failings. At the final
stages of the project, the management team was fully engaged and committed to finalizing the
cadastre system and was instrumental in achieving project results. Further, at the oblast and local
levels, there was continued strong engagement and support for the project’s activities.

On this basis, and when ultimately judged against the SALRU/SLCC’s overall performance,
there was generally adequate performance, and the shortcomings that did occur were moderate,
thus resulting in a rating of moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

Both government performance and, to a lesser degree, the implementing agency demonstrated
moderate shortcomings across the project lifespan. The impact is reflected in the cancellations,
restructurings, lengthy periods for approvals, and the slow disbursement profile, although it
should be noted that none of these impacts ultimately prevented the project from achieving its
goals. As noted above, in the final years of the project, both the government and SALRU/SLCC
showed more commitment to the project objectives and the project ended with all targets and
outcomes achieved.

Overall, the shortcomings in the middle of the project were such that they cannot significantly
offset the strong performance and achievements reached in the final years, and thus an overall
assessment of moderately satisfactory is appropriate.

6. Lessons Learned

Overall, the project achieved impressive results, especially considering the problems that were
encountered throughout implementation. At the same time, it is important to assess what could
have been done differently to address the short comings with project design and implementation,
and to note the actions that led to the successful completion so that they can be replicated
elsewhere. Both types of lessons can help the Bank conduct its business better in Ukraine, in the
ECA region, and in other parts of the world. The main lessons learned from this project are:

Perseverance pays off: Land projects tend to be long and complex and require a great deal of
patience and preparation. This project was envisioned as a nine-year long project and was
completed with a ten-month extension. The Bank needs to take a long term vision of engagement

                                                23 
 
and work with the client to reach the mutually agreed goals despite the many hardships that
emerge. Projects that address land and property rights generally encounter politically, socially,
and economically sensitive issues, and often require longer than the general 4-5 year project
cycle. These issues surrounding these projects can include vested interests (for change or for
inertia), complex legal and technical work, social tensions over allocation and use of land,
emotional or historical ties to the land, political platforms, rapidly changing technology,
government budget constraints, etc. Teams that design and supervise land projects must balance
these many factors and remain engaged and determined even as events change. As experience
from this and other land projects shows, perseverance pays off. While this was a frustrating
project for many Bank staff, both the Bank team and management were proactive in addressing
the problems, cancelling unnecessary funds and restructuring as needed. While land projects
often contain high risk, they can likewise produce high rewards. The final project extension in
2012 was viewed as risky but it ultimately paid off with the project outcomes and revised PDO
indicators fully achieved or exceeded. The commitment from the supervision team, as evidenced
through weekly video conferences and regular communication with the client, greatly facilitated
the final successful outcome.

Do not underestimate the political economy: High level political support and direction is
essential for any project that seeks to introduce fundamental reforms such as post- Soviet land
privatization, and project teams need to make a realistic assessment of the political economy
right from the start. A project that reflects a sound technical analysis and needs assessment, and
which uses best practise models, can nevertheless be defeated or impeded by political infighting.
Component E is a good example of designing a modern, unified title registration system but
vested interests and lack of political leadership and decisive decision-making at the initial stages
ultimately required a revised approach and focus on a smaller, more targeted goal. In the case of
component F there was limited or no support from the government or implementing agency for
the activities, but the component was included anyway. While the goal and activities made sense
with respect to post-Soviet agricultural sector reform, they were nevertheless not a priority for
the government and had to be dropped.

The PAD identified the risks that actually arose. For example, the failure of the legal framework
to evolve and the inability to link the cadastre to the legal registry were listed as substantial risks.
The PAD recognized the “competing interests” of MOJ as a possible controversial aspect. The
failure of the SALRU/SLCC to restructure in line with project proposals envisioned under
component E was identified as a high risk. Mitigation measures for these aforementioned risks
included making the adoption of the legal framework and the establishment of a single unified
registry and cadastre as conditions for the PAL and DPL, as well as a condition for funding
under phase 3 of the cadastre system development. In hindsight, it can be argued that the political
economy risk was underestimated and the failure of the Bank to follow through on its own risk
mitigation measures affected project implementation.

A year into the project, Ukraine had its Orange Revolution and the 2004 constitutional
amendment devolved power from the presidential to parliamentary level, creating a
Parliamentary-Presidential Republic. This change essentially blurred the reporting lines and
transmitted the uncertainty and personal rivalries to Ukraine’s institutions. While the ICR review
does not take into account such political factors, there are two important lessons learned. First,

                                                  24 
 
the Bank should not rely on the promise of political reform alone but engage with governments
only once their commitment to the reform agenda has been proven. Second, in case the political
commitment to reform remains unproven, the Bank should design projects that are flexible and
can work around the existing, somewhat unstable, political economy conditions in the country.
The fact that the new IT system was designed around the ‘second best’ option shows that a
flexible project design can help guide the Bank even when the political situation in client
countries becomes unfavourable to project interests.

Need for Clear Project Design and Results Framework: In hindsight one can also see that the
project was over-ambitious and the design proved to be inadequate to adjust to the various issues
that arose during implementation. Once such issues do arise, the Bank needs to be responsive,
make quick decisions and start the restructuring process as soon as the need is identified. The
Level 1 restructuring took almost 2 years to complete due to a combination of lengthy
discussions with the government and internal debates within the Bank about what would and
would not be acceptable revisions to project activities. Following the restructuring, the Bank’s
quality of implementation support must be consistently maintained. With regard to the Results
Framework (RF) the original design of the project was not adequate to capture project outcomes
and relied heavily on subjective criteria. Most of the original indicators focused on outputs rather
than outcomes and clear baseline data and targets were missing. While general project outcomes
are implied in the PAD, they are not clearly stated in a detailed RF. This lack of clarity and
reliance on subjective targets and indicators make it difficult to assess project progress and
allows people to rely on the more formulaic institutional indicators that may not fully capture the
impact that a project is having.

Bank Teams Should Not Offer Levers that are Not Appropriate: Where difficult policy issues
need to be resolved and they are to be resolved in a parallel DPO, every effort should be made to
stick to the agreement. In this case the Bank agreed to make an exception in the interest of the
overall country portfolio and not hold the government accountable under a PAL conditionality,
which had a negative impact on the project. The lesson learned is that the Bank should consider
carefully which instruments and mitigation measures are appropriate for a project and balance
the risk of using or not using the leverage if it is needed. In terms of promoting legal or
institutional reforms in Ukraine, the Bank should look at all its instruments as a set of tools that
could be used but requiring that the structure is in place prior to project implementation may be a
more reasonable solution.

Challenges with large ICB contracts and the need for a phased approach to IT systems: Over the
last two decades, land projects in the ECA region have routinely encountered significant delays,
contracting issues, and technical problems with large ICB contracts for mapping and IT systems.
Over the course of this project one mapping ICB contract failed and is now the subject of a court
case, although project targets for mapping were met because the contract was re-tendered, and
the original ICB IT system contract was terminated upon mutual agreement and the SLCC
proceeded with in-house development which was ultimately successful.

The reasons for problems with ICBs can be attributed to several factors. First, many
implementing agencies and the governments are unfamiliar with Bank procurement rules and
require significant capacity building support, especially at the beginning. Second, the technical

                                                25 
 
specifications for the contracts need to be detailed and clear, and experience has shown that
international technical assistance is often needed. Third, bidders tend to underbid to win the
contract which subsequently requires careful and consistent quality control, contract monitoring
and supervision. Thus, both the project and the Bank teams must have adequate budgets to
manage and monitor this complex, technical work. The general trend in ECA to reduce project
implementation support budgets over the past 3-4 years has made it difficult for the land team to
provide detailed technical support and supervision. In the case of this project, the land team
would not have been able to provide the high quality of implementation support without the
support of consultants engaged under the joint Bank-UNFAO Technical Cooperation who
comprised almost half of the supervision team. In addition, while the Bank has well qualified
land surveyors, there is no in-house expertise for land administration IT systems. The ECA land
team have relied almost exclusively on the UNFAO expert. This has been adequate to date but is
not a permanent solution, especially as land projects in the region are becoming increasingly
technology-oriented. Finally, technology is advancing so rapidly that even well-drafted technical
specifications for equipment, architecture, platforms, data standards, delivery formats, etc.
quickly lose their relevance from the time they are agreed upon to when they need to be
executed. This means that contracts may need to have additional flexibility to ensure that the
latest technology is being used in the development of IT systems. 11

With regard to IT systems, this project serves as an excellent example that a phased, step-by-step
approach to the development of IT systems can prove to be very useful, and this approach should
be considered for IT systems in land projects elsewhere. The IT component was well designed in
the PAD where development and roll out was done in three phases: (a) development of the
interim system, (b) development of cadastre system and establishment of a rural office network,
and (c) upgrade of the registry module and establishment of the urban office network. The PAD
clearly outlined the “ideal scenario” for part (c), the single agency in case the cadastre and/or
title registry law was passed but at the same time outlined the ‘second best’ solution in case the
law was not passed. This flexible project design proved to be instrumental in the successful
development of the IT system and the establishment of the national land cadastre. New
legislation now requires the linkage of the cadastral and legal data, which was one of the main
reasons for the initial push to create a single agency cadastre and registry system.

Several projects in the ECA region that involve the rollout of IT systems show that those with a
phased approach to IT development using in-house expertise and outside, professional quality
control (as experienced in Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and Kyrgyz Republic)
have a far higher chance of success than IT development done through large ICB contracts (as
experienced in Serbia and Croatia).

A phased rollout also ensures that capacity is built over the course of the project and land
agencies are prepared to assume new responsibilities, use new technology and provide new
services to clients. In the case of Ukraine, the substantial investment in in-house human and
system resources proved to be the cornerstone of successful IT system rollout when there was a
standoff between the Government and the IT contractor and the international contract was finally
                                                       
11
    The ECA Land team plans to review all these aspects in greater detail in the forthcoming paper “ECA Land:
lessons learned that reflects on the 20 years of Bank experience on land related projects in the region.”

cancelled. Furthermore, introducing independent quality assurance and quality control is a good
international practice. The role of the independent quality assurance contractor is important to
ensure that the system is fully documented and to encourage the local team to introduce
international standards for version control, testing and system maintenance.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

There are no comments or issues raised in the client’s final project report. The general feedback
was positive and the consistent and constructive engagement between the Bank and
implementing agency was noted. A summary of the report is found in Annex 6.

However, SALRU reviewed the draft version of this ICR and, in a letter dated October 4, 2013,
disagreed with the overall project rating of moderately satisfactory. In their opinion, the project
was successfully completed, its goals were achieved as evidenced by the performance indicators,
and its outcome has a “considerable positive impact on the country’s socio-economic
development.” SALRU added that they do not think the restructuring should affect the final
evaluation of the project as it was a mutual agreement between the Bank and the Borrower. The
full letter is found in annex 7.

Response: The author of this ICR acknowledges the impressive results of the project as well as
the dedication and commitment of the SALRU and SLCC management and technical teams in
the final years of the project to achieve these results. While there is little dispute about the
results, the project experienced problems in the early stages which, in taking a holistic view, led
to the moderately satisfactory rating.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

Comments to the draft ICR were provided by UNFAO whose technical assistance and
supervision support were instrumental to the project. UNFAO has supported the project through
the World Bank-UNFAO Cooperative Program with three experts in land policy, IT systems and
cadastral mapping/land survey. The UNFAO noted that phases 1 and 2 of the Component E
system development were achieved, and the “second best” option for phase 3 was accepted and
then achieved. While component E was dropped from the project and the work was narrowed to
focus on the cadastre, the technical design of the system was still developed with the support of
the project (under component D). Potential issues with the institutional and legal framework
were foreseen in the PAD and, therefore, the ‘second best’ option was included to allow
flexibility. Moreover, the results of implementing the ‘second best’ option exceeded expectations
in areas like the introduction of reengineered business processes to increase efficiency and
minimize opportunities for corruption, e-signatures for greater personal responsibility in the local
offices and online access to the cadastral maps.

According to the FAO, the revised objectives following the 2008 restructuring have been
achieved or exceeded. For example, registration of over 16 titles far exceeded the plan to register
the 6 million rural titles. Under Component D2, the new IT system was launched on January 1,
2013, and it has already achieved impressive results such as the reduction in time to register a
parcel from several days to just 21 minutes and the registration of over 900,000 new land parcels.
The SALRU is also focusing on data quality improvements and over 2 million errors have
already been corrected, many of which were identified by users submitting reference to the errors
through the online geoportal. UNFAO noted that system sustainability has been ensured in terms
of human capital as well as other resources. The system has been audited by an independent
quality assurance contractor and assessed as stable and compliant with relevant standards.
Further developments are underway with the launch of new services like the digitalization of soil
maps and urban plans, and a 3D model has been developed to use NSDI for climate change
monitoring and disaster risk management. They also highlight the political, managerial and
technical support that was provided in the final two years of the project. For complete comments
see Annex 8.

Response: The author again acknowledges the impressive results of the project as well as the
important support to the project provided by FAO experts. Many of the findings and updated
system performance figures have been incorporated into this ICR.

For comments from other stakeholders, see results of the client survey and stakeholder
consultations in Annexes 5 and 6.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component A Institutional Development and Legal Reform

According to the PAD, this component was intended to provide SALRU with resources to
transform itself from a “Soviet-style land use planning to land use regulation better suited to a
market economy”. Funds were to be used to improve zoning regulation and environmental
advisory services provided by SALRU at its network of offices (24 oblast offices, plus the
Crimea, Kyiv and Sevastopol), plus city and rayon offices under them. The component was also
to support development of the legal framework.

Details of specific activities under this component are not included in the PAD, but during the
course of the project, the activities focused on creating appropriate office environments for staff
to work and for customers to be served. Project funds were used primarily to supply office
furniture and equipment, such as computers and copying machines. In total, some 692 offices
were equipped using project funds.

Component A also included activities relating to legal reform. The aim was to develop and draft
legislation required to improve land management, including amendments to existing legislation,
plus technical regulations to assist implementation. Under several contracts, lawyers established
a library of international land laws, examined and reported on international experience, made
proposals for reform, and in the final contract, developed a body of draft laws in coordination
with SALRU, and presented it to key stakeholders through a series of workshops. Included in
this body of draft legislation were 14 laws, ten Cabinet of Ministers’ decrees and 11 executive
orders.

Component B Public Awareness

The public awareness component was intended to focus on small land holders to inform them of
their rights to state deeds, and to educate them on their land use rights and obligations.
Information was also to be provided on farm management, legal procedures relating to land, and
leasing of parcels.

Contractors were engaged to deliver the messages through a variety of means – publication of
brochures, production and airing of television segments, publishing articles, educating
journalists, and development of a web page. About 150 television and 100 radio programs were
broadcast, including the regular television and radio program "My land is my property". There
were 475 issues of 25 regional newspapers, five press tours, four training seminars and 120
publications. SALRU produced not only the project website (www.zemreforma.info), but also a
web portal to ensure that information is available after the project closed (www.land.gov.ua).

As part of the component, three extensive sociological studies of the public regarding land
relations were undertaken, with the results being disseminated at two conferences. The indicators
were exceeded.




                                                30 
 
Component C            Training

The PAD envisaged two forms of training:

       Short-term training, which was required as part of the process of issuing state deeds to
        equip large numbers of specialists (consultants, lawyers and surveyors) with the
        necessary knowledge and skills to issue the deeds. Similarly staff of the SALRU and CC
        would require training to support the project and its activities and objectives; and
       Long-term training, which would equip agrarian universities and assist them to develop
        their courses and training capacity. In this way, they could produce graduates with
        appropriate land management and cadastre skills and knowledge to work for SALRU or
        CC, or in the private sector and support the move to market economy.

A large number of training activities occurred under the project:

       refresher training was conducted for some 3,273 specialists of the land resources
        agencies, including from 549 rayon offices of SALRU. That figure includes 78 staff who
        undertook train-the-trainers courses;
       materials, equipment and specialized software were supplied to nine major universities;
       training and methodological approaches were updated in 22 state-owned universities
        providing courses in land management, including through the development of 9
        methodological manuals;
       refreshment training for 557 lecturers involved in land management from 22 state-owned
        universities;
       establishment of a specialized training center for training and refresher courses for
        surveyors.

Component D            Land Survey Works

Component D involved the technical work for land survey and cadastre. Under the PAD,
this component focused on the systematic subdivision of the land of former collective farms and
the issuing of State deeds for Land free-of-charge to individual rural land owners. The process
required the preparation of base maps, a substantial amount of preparatory investigation and
consultation with the owners of former collective farms, agreeing on farm restructuring and
subdivision plans, land survey work, and ultimately the issuing of State deeds for Land as well as
developing the national land cadastre database.  

For the D.1 mapping component the results include:

       Conversion of share certificates into state deeds: with support from the project 711,678
        (includes complete files and “variations”, in which State deeds could not be issued (e.g.,
        due to missing or deceased owners). Also, an additional 3.29 million land share
        certificates were converted into state deeds (GosActs) with other resources.
       Mapping: More than 600,000 sq.km of modern mapping was delivered thus fully
        equipping Ukraine with base mapping of uniform quality for the first time after
        independence: up-to-date aerial photography, an up-to date digital orthophoto map in

                                                31 
 
             appropriate large scales, as well as a digital Cadastral Index Map (CIM) recording and
             making visible in their spatial context all the privatized and surveyed land parcels with
             unique parcel identifiers and field quality control.
            Integration of spatial data in the electronic National Cadastre System (NCS): The titling
             and mapping products under the Project were successfully loaded nationwide in the NCS
             and the spatial data have been transformed into the single national coordinate system,
             fully integrated in the NCS, and stored together with the other (archive and operational)
             spatial, alpha numeric and image data.
            The short- and mid-term data quality improvement concept and implementation plan was
             developed and implemented. Batch corrections, mostly of spatially misplaced parcels,
             were implemented with in-house developed software modules and participatory,
             formalized feedback from the public. This level of public commitment in data quality
             improvement corresponds to the best global practices.
            The project mapping activities instigated several parallel projects, which produced
             valuable by-products with far reaching positive impacts for improved land governance.
             including:

             – A comprehensive inventory of all existing archive mapping source materials was
               carried out throughout the country in all the relevant central, oblast and rayon
               authorities, which held archive mapping and land-related documentation. This
               inventory and source materials informed the establishment of the cadastre maps, and
               enabled the planning of archive map digitizing works;
             – A complete redesign, reconfiguration and re-survey of the Geodetic Reference
               Infrastructure of Ukraine was carried out, digital mapping data produced and
               uploaded into the NCS, thus launched an efficient and smooth transition to a modern
               (GNSS15) geodetic reference network and coordinate system in all sectors of
               Ukrainian economy that use spatial data;
             – The integration of mapping data in the unified data base allowed the identification of
               existing spatial data issues, and the development of spatial data quality improvement
               concept and implementation plan; and
             – A complete record (database and standard spatial identification) of existing
               administrative territorial units (state, oblast, autonomous region, cities, rayon,
               villages, settlement areas, spatial planning zones, etc.) has been established and
               settlement of territorial boundary disputes between various level jurisdictions has
               been initiated.

For the D.2 Cadastral Information System sub-component the project would develop a land
national cadastre system. Although not originally envisioned as a fully digital, on-line system,
the final system that was developed and rolled out in the final year of the project reflects modern
land administration principles and allows digital exchange of information with customers,
including the legal registry held at MOJ. Main project activities and results include:
     The contract with the international software development company was terminated upon
        mutual agreement although the company did produce the business processes analyses,

       Global Navigation Satellite System  

                                                          32 
 
        business processes reengineering, proposals for legal changes, and the supply of
        graphical licenses. Development of the final system (NCS) proceeded in-house.
       The NCS was put into operation nationwide on January 1, 2013 and covers central level
        (central and reserve data centers), oblast level (all 25 oblasts plus 2 cities with the status
        of an oblast) and rayon level (all 549 rayons). Several additional sub-systems were also
        implemented including: online exchange of information with the MOJ/State Registration
        Service and Notaries, a Geo-portal (Public cadastre map) with an e-service for citizen to
        report errors, an online application tracking system and a digital archive for both
        historical and incoming documents.
       For the digital archive a total of16.8 million State deeds were scanned, indexed, data
        entered, verified and uploaded into secure central database and all cadastre index maps
        were vectorised and uploaded into the system.
       For the Geo-portal (Public Cadastre Map): all orthophoto maps, cadastre index maps and
        soil maps are available to the general public through on-line access in regular web
        browsers. During the first month, the system recorded 600,000 hits on the Geo-portal,
        more than 10,000 reports were registered and 7,700 reported technical errors were
        corrected.
All of these activities result in improved services to users, improved staff and office performance
monitoring, faster data quality improvement, and improved transparency and minimized
opportunities for corruption.


Component E Cadastre System Development

       This component was cancelled although the activities related to IT system development
were transferred to component D2 where phase 1 and 2 were completed as planned and the
‘second best approach’ was adopted and completed for phase 3.

Component F Farm Restructuring Services

        This component was cancelled.

Component G            Project Implementation

The PAD foresaw the difficulty with the implementation of Bank-financed projects in Ukraine,
particularly in the agricultural sector, and stated that the risk of implementation failure without a
competent PIU was significant. Therefore, a PIU structure of 12 professional staff and 9 or 10
support staff was proposed. Additionally, the PAD proposed the hiring of 3 regional
representatives in each of the 24 oblasts. Seven of the key positions including PIU Director,
procurement officer, and financial manager had been advertised ahead of the project and funded
under the PPF.

Project implementation remained challenging in the initial years of the project due to, especially,
the institutional rivalry between the MOJ and SALRU, and little government interest or
commitment to the project. As a result, the project was restructured and objectives related to the
creation of a unified title and cadastre system and farm restructuring were abandoned. Towards

                                                 33 
 
the later years of the project, the PIU was more involved and committed to implementing agreed
project activities, and as a result, PDO achievement was on track for the extended Closing Date
of April 30, 2013. Between the final two missions, significant work to launch the electronic
cadastre system was completed through additional in-house development of software, data
preparation and training with the result that the electronic cadastre system is now fully
operational in all 592 local and other offices. This progress essentially resolved the risks that had
been noted about the launch of the electronic cadastre system.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Rural Land Titling and Cadastre Development Project (“the Project”) was considered the
first in a series of investments that would be needed to improve property rights for immovable
properties in Ukraine. The economic analysis in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
identified indirect economic benefits linked to the broader property rights agenda, which
included improvement in investor confidence, increase in financial liquidity, reduction of
transaction costs, and protection of the land rights of vulnerable groups. The economic analysis
also identified direct economic benefits from the Project, which included improvement in the
efficiency of agricultural land use, stimulation of the rental market, and improvement of
agricultural productivity. The economic analysis in the PAD did not calculate ex-ante
parameters—Net Present Value (NPV) and the Economic Rate of Return (ERR)—for the direct
benefits.

In this economic analysis, first, the evolution of the broader property rights agenda in Ukraine is
discussed. Second, evidence of direct Project benefits is provided. A cash flow analysis is
performed to estimate ex-post parameters for the NPV and ERR based on perceived benefits
from the stimulation of the land rental market. These estimates indicate that the Project is a
sensible investment. More benefits are expected in the near future as the property rights agenda
gets consolidated.

The Development of the Property Rights Agenda in Ukraine, 2003-2013

In the early 2000s, Ukraine was still making a transition from a planned economy to a market
economy with full property rights. During project preparation, the system for recording and
transacting property rights was still under development. Although land shares had been allocated
to farmers, they still needed to be converted to state deeds. The benefits from transitioning to a
full market economy were expected to be significant. These benefits included an improvement in
investor confidence, an increase in financial liquidity (mortgage market), a reduction of
transaction costs, and protection of the land rights of vulnerable groups. The context of land
markets is briefly explained before addressing each of these benefits.

During the last decade, land markets have evolved differently in urban and rural areas. There are
no major restrictions in the market for urban land. Ownership of apartments has been transferred
to the occupants. Although the land under most apartments still remains under state property, this
does not restrict the transaction of properties. On the other hand, the agricultural land market is
still heavily limited. Virtually the sale of all agricultural land is banned by a temporary
moratorium which was instituted in the transitional provisions of the Land Code in 2001. The
moratorium has been renewed in several occasions and it is currently set to expire on January 1,
2016. Land sales are only allowed under limited circumstances to Ukrainian citizens; foreign
citizens are banned from owning agricultural land. The draft “Land Market Law” is still under
discussion and the policy consequences of this new legislation are still unpredictable. The
approval of this law is the last condition for lifting the moratorium. Next, the development in
each of the identified benefits from the Project is addressed.

Investor Confidence. Investor confidence does not seem to have significantly improved over the
last decade for reasons that are outside the Project’s control. In urban land markets, Ukraine was
severely affected by the global financial crisis. Ukraine experienced a housing boom between
2004 and 2008, but the market collapsed and property prices have not yet recovered. In March
2013, house prices were still 46.2 percent below the peak price recorded in September 2008.16
The construction business was severely affected by the crisis as well. In general, the economy is
slowly recovering. In this recent period, the economy has been hit by the euro zone debt crisis. In
2012, the GDP grew only by 0.2 percent and it is predicted to grow by 2.5 percent in 2013. In
rural land markets, the moratorium on land sales and the uncertainty over the “Land Market
Law” have arguably diminished investor confidence. Ukraine has still managed to attract
significant investments in the agricultural sector, but they are probably below the country’s
potential.

Financial Liquidity. Individuals and companies in Ukraine have a relatively high net worth in
terms of fixed assets. During project preparation, it was argued that an underdeveloped property
rights system and mortgage banking system hindered the transformation of immovable property
into liquid assets. However, the mortgage loan market is still constrained by many factors. It is
estimated that more than 75 percent of the population do not qualify for a bank loan; developers
also have problems getting access to finance.17 Many banks also toughen the requirements for
issuing mortgage loans during the financial crisis.18 Presently, the mortgage market is also
hampered by the high inflation. For agricultural land plots the moratorium places restrictions on
long-term collaterization of land assets. Instead farmers have to take annual loans collaterized by
future harvest. Even if the moratorium is lifted, the attitude of the rural population is quite
negative with respect to using their agricultural plots as collateral. In a survey of agricultural
households conducted by the Project in 2012, only 7.2 percent of respondents said that they
would be interested in obtaining a loan using their plot as collateral.

Transaction Costs. A well-functioning property rights system minimizes transaction costs, which
in turn should stimulate land markets and facilitate the provision of mortgage loans. Ukraine is
still evolving towards the development of an efficient system for the registration of property
rights of immovable properties. On January 1, 2013, the new State Registration Service became
operational. The State Registration Service will record the legal rights of immovable properties
to both land and buildings. Until recently, the legal rights to land and buildings were recorded
separately. In fact, there were seven separate registries maintained by different bodies and
institutions to record rights concerning immovable properties. The consolidation of all these
registries into a single one under the State Registration Service is a significant step towards an
efficient system for recording property rights. The State Land Cadastre Center (SLCC) will
continue to maintain the cadastre to record information about the location and characteristics of
the plots.

During project implementation, the SLCC has already improved efficiency in the registration of
land transactions. The SLCC is in charge of three types of registration services: state deeds for
the right of ownership, state deeds for the right of permanent use, and lease contracts. Figure 1
shows the number of transactions by type (data for 2007 and 2012 was unavailable). During this
period, the registration of state deeds for ownership rights was the transaction with the largest
number of requests. The number of requests for this transaction, however, decreased
significantly in 2011. The second most important transaction in terms of volume is the
registration of lease contracts. During the period of project implementation, there was a notable
increase in the number of lease contracts that were registered. The Project had public information
campaigns that raised awareness about the importance of registering the lease contracts.

The Project made important contributions to the establishment of a modern cadastre system. In
particular, the Project assisted with the development of an IT system to improve efficiency of
transactions. As reflected in the IT Systems performance review, some of the benefits include:
     Reduction in the time to process transactions: the process to register a land plot was
        reduced from several weeks to 21 minutes, and the number of transactions required to
        obtain a cadastral extract was reduced by half.
     Reduction in cost: The cost of obtaining a land parcel registration was reduced by two-
        thirds, and the cost of obtaining a cadastral extract was reduced by half.
     Greater access to information: Cadastral map information became available online for
        free and users can check the status of their applications online.

Furthermore, the cost of service delivery to the clients has improved. Between 2004 and 2012,
the nominal average fee increased from US $6.00 to US $ 6.96 dollars. In real terms, the average
fee decreased by 52 percent during this same period (see figure 2). The Doing Business data also
shows that the cost of registering a property transaction has decreased in recent years (see figure
3). The Doing Business’s methodology consists of recording the cost as a percentage of property
value and includes all costs related to the transactions (cadastre, registry, and notaries).

The financial sustainability of the SLCC is important to guarantee that these gains in efficiency
are maintained and further improvements are made. However, SLCC’s recurrent costs are still
well above the revenue collection from user charges (see figure 4). The cost figures include all
expenses incurred by the SLCC (disaggregated data for the cost of supplying cadastral activities
was not available). The trend shows that the gap between recurrent costs and user charges has
been narrowing. This signals a positive trend. Ensuring the financial sustainability of the SLCC
is one of the priorities for the future.

Rights of Vulnerable Groups. The Project contributed with the conversion of 0.8 million land
certificates out of the 4 million processed by the SLCC during this period. The systematic
conversion of these certificates into state deeds ensured an equitable treatment for disadvantaged
groups. Now, the owners of these agricultural plots enjoy secure tenure of their immovable
property and are less vulnerable to political influences or market forces. In the next section,
specific project benefits are quantified in order to calculate economic parameters of efficiency.

Direct Economic Benefits of the Project: A View from the Land Rental Market

The economic analysis in the PAD identified the development of land rental markets and the
enforcement of lease contracts as one of the Project’s direct benefits. Under the current
restrictions on land sales, the land rental markets play a prominent role in Ukraine’s agricultural
sector. Large corporate farms acquire land through leasing, mainly from state farms and land
reform beneficiaries. Lease contracts can be annual or multi-annual. Land rentals are a
mechanism through which the markets can allocate land to the most efficient user. During
project preparation, it was estimated that 80 percent of land share owners rented their plots. Land
rental markets have an important effect on economic growth in Ukraine.

Although the role of agriculture has shrank since Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union,
this sector still accounts for 8.2 percent of GDP and employed 15 percent of the active
population.19 Ukraine is endowed with fertile black soils that are attractive to agricultural
producers and investors. The value of capital assets in the agricultural sector (including land) has
actually been increasing in the period 2005-2010 (figure 5). The value of capital assets for this
sector was estimated at $14.6 billion in 2010.

                Forestry Sector

The Project supported the conversion of land share certificates into state deeds as well as a public
awareness campaign to provide landowners with information about their rights and obligations.
Before the Project, land reform beneficiaries did not have precise information about the physical
location of their land shares. The Project carried out the identification and delimitation of the
land plots as well as the process of converting the shares into state deeds to complete the
privatization of these assets. The Project also sponsored a public awareness campaign that
provided information about the legal procedures concerning land ownership and land rental. The
public awareness campaign also financed sociological surveys to monitor dynamics in rural land

markets and the perceptions of the rural population. These surveys were carried out in 2010,
2011, and 2012.

The direct economic benefits of the Project can be estimated by quantifying the effects on the
development of the land rental market. The sociological surveys reveal important information
about the change in dynamics in the land rental markets. Between 2010 and 2012, the percentage
of landowners that obtained money for renting their land increased from 83.5 to 95.2 percent.
During the same period, the average annual rent per hectare increased from $68 to $76 (2012).
These are major differences compared to the situation in the early 2000s. In 2003, it is estimated
that only 13 percent of land share owners received monetary payments and the average payment
was only $22 per hectare.20 The rental rates reported in the sociological surveys are also above
the average per hectare of $44 reported in a recent study.21 The comparison of these results
shows that land rental markets are becoming more formal and that the terms of the lease
agreements have improved for landowners.

Although causality of these results cannot be solely attributed to the Project, it is likely that the
conversion to state deeds and the public awareness campaign played an important role in
improving the conditions in the land rental market. The results of the sociological surveys in
2010 and 2012 are used to estimate the economic benefits from the development of land rental
markets. These dates are actually appropriate considering that the firms hired to conduct the
surveying works completed activities between 2010 and 2012. Nevertheless, project effect would
probably have been larger if the land rental markets results from 2003 were available. Next, the
data and model are explained.

The Project financed the conversion of 711,678 land certificates into state deeds. These state
deeds benefited approximately 574,000 landowners.22 Considering that landowners received an
average of 4 hectares during the land reform, the state deeds are estimated to cover an
approximate area of 2.3 million hectares of agricultural land. Based on the assumption in the
PAD, it is estimated that 80 percent of the land owners are leasing land. The assumption is that
with conversion to state deeds and more information about rental markets, landowners are able to
enter into better contractual terms with the leaseholders. In this model, the differences observed
in percentage of landowner receiving rent and increase in the rental rate between 2010 and 2012
are attributed to the project. The average land size per landowner is held fixed at 4 hectares (see
table 1).

Under these assumptions, the Project contributed to expand rental payments to 209,699 hectares
of agricultural land in 2012. Landowners received a total amount of incremental rental income of
$28.8 million during this year. This is a significant increase in income for these rural households.
Although this income is a money transfer from the leaseholder to the lessor, it is feasible to

   According to the 2012 survey, each landowner had on average 1.24 certificates.

assume that the leaseholder is expecting a return on agricultural land that is larger than the rental
cost in order to make the farming operation profitable. In fact, a study conducted by the
European Commission estimated the return on agricultural land to be $239 in 2012, which is
more than three times the value of the rent at $76.23 In order to calculate economic parameters
for the Project, the increase in rental income is equated to an increase in the return to agricultural
land. This is considered to be a minimum expected return to the land.

A cash flow analysis is conducted to assess the project’s net economic benefits. The cash flow
has a twenty-year horizon and applies a discount rate of 12 percent. In the analysis, it is assumed
that the benefits of increased rental income are a measure of the incremental return on
agricultural land. The benefits begin accruing in 2012 and continue until the end of the period.
The costs include the project’s investment costs incurred under the World Bank Loan and
Government contribution as well as the SLCC’s recurrent costs. Information on recurrent costs
is only available for the period between 2007 and 2012. For the initial period between 2004 and
2006, the analysis assumes the same costs as in 2007. For 2013 onward, the analysis assumes the
costs in 2012 increased by an annual 2.5 percent.

The cash flow analysis shows that the project is a sensible investment compared to the potential
increase in agricultural production. Panel A in table 2 shows a cash flow analysis that only
incorporates the costs of Component D for the investment costs. The project has an NPV of
$44.3 million and an ERR of 31 percent. Panel B shows the results of the cash flow analysis that
incorporates all project expenses. The economic parameters are still positive: the NPV is $33.3
million and the ERR is 22 percent.

The cash flow analysis is repeated with switch values to check the sensibility of these results. In
the first scenario, the incremental number of hectares subject to new rental income is reduced by
50 percent. In this scenario, the NPV becomes negative. In the second scenario, the economic
return on a hectare is assumed to be $239. Under this scenario, the NPV is $88.7 million and the
ERR 33 percent. The third scenario assumes that the number of hectares is reduced in half but
the return on a hectare is $239. In this case, the NPV is $23.7 million and the ERR 20 percent.
This scenario could be considered the most sensible because it combines a reduction in the target
land area and a more realistic estimate of economic returns on land. The results of the third
scenario are close to the parameters shown in Panel B, which were calculated using the baseline
assumptions.

In sum, Ukraine has made significant progress for improving the property rights system but there
are still significant challenges ahead. The development of a mortgage market is dependent on the
conditions of the financial market and the liberalization of the rural land market. One of the most
important challenges is the development of a rural land market under conditions that promote
both equity and economic growth. The approval of the “Land Market Law” and the lifting of the
moratorium are the two key actions for the future. The SLCC has shown improvement in the
delivery of cadastral services, but more actions are needed to ensure that operations are
financially sustainable. The State Registration Services is expected to have a significant effect on
the cost and time for registering legal rights. Finally, there is some evidence that the Project was

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results


5.1 Summary

All market stakeholders from land plot owners to the representatives of business
communities consider the implementation of the electronic National Cadastral System
(NCS) to be an important new step for the real estate market of Ukraine. For this survey,
(a) three categories of users—proprietors of urban/suburban plots, rural land plot owners,
and realtors—were interviewed, (b) an online poll of land owners and specialists was
conducted, and (c) two focus groups with land plot owners and representatives of the
business communities were organized.

The results of focus groups, which included representatives of business communities,
show that the general review of NCS by business community representatives is positive
since the system constitutes a new tool for operation on the market. This is why their
suggestions on NCS improvement mostly involve their professional occupation, in
particular, adding information about designated purpose of estate, type of ownership,
possibility of land plot privatization, and data about protective zones according to the
effective legislation.

Employees of land management agencies, both urban and rural, have the unanimous
opinion regarding situation before and after the introduction of the system. They report
about general benefit of NCS being reduction of time required for processing of
customers’ requests. Map inaccuracies are considered a temporary drawback.

Land owners use the system to make sure of their title to the estate and in case of non-
compliances they file requests for the correction of such inconsistencies. Many land
owners are not very happy about the fact that the map can only be accessed using a
cadastral number. One should also take into account the fact that land owners in rural
areas are mostly elderly people with scarce experience of using similar systems and have
lower expectations.

The results of weighing factor analysis of NCS assessment by users shows that          the
highest appreciation was given to the general level of satisfaction of working with    the
system. The ratings of such aspects as search accuracy, problem solution using         the
system and hit ratio (the situation when a user has found what he was searching)       are
below the mark.

All users consider inaccuracies of land plot display to be the greatest flaw of the system.
They also expressed their suggestions regarding system improvements, which differ
depending on the role the users play in the real estate market.

Owners of urban and suburban land plots usually suggested that more information be
added to the system so that it reflects land plot fitness for construction and data about
owners. Rural land owners would like to see additional information on the names of the
streets, soil composition, and terrain. Business community representatives want more

The main change in their work is the fact that they do not have to handle huge amounts of
paper documents anymore. Many issues can be solved with the help of electronic
resources; the cadastral system creates all necessary templates of land records and
registers. This reduces the time required to serve customers.

Customers now can place a request and get the results in a ‘single window.’ After receipt
of state deeds for land plots, owners can use NCS to check the accuracy of data
introduced to the uniform database, or see land plot configuration.

Introduction of electronic cadastral system increased the transparency of data about state
deeds of ownership and land plot owners for the employees of land management
agencies. The time of execution of state act has been reduced as long as customers file all
necessary documents. The ease of use and load performance of the map are its
advantages.

Major users’ suggestion regarding NCS quality improvement is improving the zoom
level. Employees of land management agencies believe that perfect variant for map
information capacity increase is adding data about premises located on the land plot.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

    1. Letter from the State Agency of Ukraine For Land Resources regarding the draft
       ICR, dated October 4, 2013, protocol #30-28-0 24-17382/2-13:

       Dear Mr. Childress:

       Further to your letter of 09.20.2013 please be advised as follows. SALR has
reviewed the Draft Report on Completion of the Rural Land Titling and Cadastre
Development Project.

       Paragraph 1.6 Revised Components should be supplemented on page 9 with the
information that component E was deleted and cadastre development activities were
included in Component D, which was expanded by subcomponent D2.

       In the second sentence of Para. 2.2 Implementation, we suggest to delete the
words “and G (Project Implementation)” on page 11, as Addendum 2 has no description
of component G and it is not clear what issues the component discusses. In the fourth
sentence of this paragraph, we suggest to change the word “large” for “subject,” that is
what was new was the management of not such large contracts, but contracts of such
subject of procurement.

       In the fourth sentence of section Procurement, the acronym “PMU” on page 14
should be replaced by “PIU,” and in the third sentence of this paragraph and the section
Large ICB contracts for mapping and IT systems in land projects have many unique
challenges on page 28, the acronym “PIU” should be replaced by “SALRU,” as procurers
were on the PIU (project implementation unit), not on the SALRU/PMU (project
management unit). Also, in the fifth, last but one sentence of Procurement, the words
“agreed procurement plans” on page 14 should be replaced by “contract implementation
terms,” as most of the land surveying and mapping contracts were entered into in 2005-
06 and the delays were due to late performance of the contracts, not due to the
procurement plan. For example, in 2010-11, unintended contracts were concluded in
connection with termination of a Swiss Photo contact.

        In the section Outputs, the figure “35” on page 19 should be replaced by “34,” and
in the description of component A of Addendum 2 on page 31 and in the second
paragraph of section The main purpose of subcomponent A2 Legal Reform on page 55,
the words “ten Cabinet of Ministers` decrees” should be replaced by “nine Cabinet of
Ministers` decrees,” according to the actually performed contracts.

       In item (h) of section Subcomponent D2 Cadastre System Development, the words
”quality control of software for State Land Cadastre” on page 60 need to be changed for
“quality control of NCS software.” Also, the section Component G Project
Implementation on this page should be supplemented with information about the audit
conducted in 2012 and 2013.


                                           52 
 
        Addendum 1 Project Costs and Financing, on page 30, should be updated
according to actual costs (Attachment 1 to this Letter) and the indicated total amount of
financing at the foot of the page should be adjusted accordingly. The Table in paragraph
1.5 Financing and Expenditure of Funds on page 54 also needs updating (Attachment 1
to this Letter).

         Also, we want to call the attention of the Bank to that we disagree and cannot
agree with the general evaluation of the Project as moderately satisfactory, since on our
part all tasks have been completed which is evidenced by the results of the missions, and
the Project has attained all of its goals proof of which are the indicative indicators of
achievement of Project objectives set out in the side letter to the Loan Agreement. We
think the restructuring of the Project carried out by mutual agreement between Ukraine
and the Bank should not affect the final evaluation of the Project. In our opinion, the
Project was completed successfully and its outcome has a considerable positive impact on
the country’s socioeconomic development.

       In conclusion, allow me to thank you and the team of the Bank for active support
in implementing the Project. Looking forward to continued fruitful cooperation.

                                            Sincerely,

                                            (signed)
                                         A.M.Kadomsky

2. Client Completion Report:

1. Introduction and Project background
1.1. Brief background on the country and on the privatization of land; rationale to
the project
In 1991 process of land relations reforming started in Ukraine. There were not only
changes in land ownership and land use structure, but also changes in distribution of
primary land types.

As of January 1, 2013, the primary types of land use over 60,355 thousand hectares of
Ukraine’s surface area were: agricultural lands (70.8%), forests and forested areas
(17.6%), built-up areas (4.2%), areas covered with surface water (4.0%), open lands with
or without insignificant vegetation such as stony areas, sands, ravines (1.7%), open bog
covered areas (1.6%), and open dry lands with special vegetation (0.03%).


                                            53 
 
In view of ad hoc allocation of land rights in Ukraine in 2001, and the need for land
sharing and creation of a cadastre system to implement land market, the project concept
preparation for Rural Land Titling and Cadastre Development Project (“Project”) was
initiated. In January 2002, the concept was considered and approved by the
Governmental Committee for Agriculture Sector Reform at the Cabinet of Ministers of
Ukraine. A draft Project Preparation Advance letter to the World Bank was also
approved.

      1.2. Objective of the project (including modification during restructuring)
The objectives of the Project were to assist the Borrower with: (i) privatization of the
lands of state and communal farm enterprises, agencies and organizations through
transfer to the employees of these enterprises, agencies and organizations as well as
retirees from among them, designating for each of them a land parcel (share); (ii)
allocating land parcels to owners of land parcels (shares) in kind (on site) and issuing
state deeds to them; (iii) establishing a land cadastre system.

1.3. Pre-Project situation of cadastral and registration
In late 1990s and early 2000s, the process of ownership rights registration for immovable
property was almost non-existent, and only a few incomplete and uncoordinated
documents dealing with property rights and registration existed. This illustrated the
unsystematic and fragmented character of ownership rights registration system in
Ukraine.

The responsibility for the establishment of a registration system for ownership rights to
movable and immovable property was given the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine.
In accordance with the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (CoM) No. 661
dated May 16, 2002 the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) was assigned the responsibility for
State Registry of Ownership Rights to Immovable Property (except for land parcels), and
State Committee of Ukraine for Land Resources (SALRU) was assigned the
responsibility for State Registry of Land. At the same time State owned enterprise (SOE)
"State Land Cadastre Center" (SALRU) at SALRU appointed a database administrator
for the State Registry of Lands, and SOE "Informational Center" (IC) at MoJ appointed a
database administrator for the State Registry of Ownership Rights to Immovable
Property. State Registration of Ownership Rights to Immovable Property was carried out
by Technical Inventory Bureaus (TIB) operating in appropriate administrative and
territorial units. In the absence of a central repository, territorial bodies for land resources
as well as structural divisions of State Land Cadastre Center operating in all oblasts and
raions of Ukraine maintained land records and registered land parcels. Moreover, MoJ
registered mortgages, deeds for immovable property and judicial encumbrances for rights
to immovable property.

Early in 2003 the President of Ukraine issued the Decree No. 134 dated February 17,
2003 "On actions for establishment of a unified system for State Registration of Lands,
Immovable Property and Ownership Rights to them as a part of State Land Cadastre." In
pursuance of the President's Decree CoM issued its own decrees No. 689 dated May 15,
2003 "On actions for establishment of a unified system for state registration of lands,

                                              54 
 
immovable property and ownership rights to them as a part of state land cadastre" and
No. 1088 dated July 17, 2003 "On establishment of a unified system for state registration
of lands, immovable property and ownership rights to them as a part of state land
cadastre." In July 2004 the Supreme Council (Verkhovna Rada) of Ukraine adopted the
Law of Ukraine "On state registration of proprietary rights to immovable property and
their encumbrances" used as the basis for the establishment of a unified (national)
cadastre registration system where SALRU had to be a holder and SLCC had to be an
administrator.

1.4. Legal/institutional basis for the cadastre and registration of land and
immovable property

In 2006, a change in the course was implemented. This change envisaged the transfer of
responsibility for state registration of immovable property from SALRU to MoJ. As a
result of this, the Law of Ukraine "On state registration of proprietary rights to
immovable property and their encumbrances" was never implemented. These changes
were actually completed when the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in February 2010 adopted
the Law of Ukraine "On amendment of the Law of Ukraine On State Registration of
Proprietary Rights to Immovable Property and their Encumbrances" and other legal acts
envisaging transfer of responsibility for state registration of ownership rights for property
to MoJ, and in July 2011, the Law of Ukraine "On State Land Cadastre" envisaging that
bodies of State Agency for Land Resources of Ukraine (SALRU) would have the
responsibility for the establishment and maintenance of the state land cadastre, state
registration of land parcels, their encumbrances and the maintenance of land records and
issuance of extracts from the State Land Cadastre about land parcels. Both the Laws
came into full effect on January 1, 2013.

To further the above laws, the CoM adopted a series of eight normative and legal acts on
ownership rights, land inventory, cadastre maintenance etc.

Most recently, on November 20, 2012, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the Law
of Ukraine No. 5508-VI "On amendment of CoM Decree "On State Duty" as it pertains
to rate for registration of proprietary rights to immovable property."

1.5. Financing and expenditure of funds
The Project was financed from three sources: Loan Funds, Investment of Ukrainian
Government, and SLCC funds (within Component E which was cancelled during the
restructuring).

Information about expenditures financing for various Project components and sources of
financing is provided below.

Per the Amendment to the Loan Agreement dated April 17, 2009, 100% of the Project
funding would come out of Loan Funds.In accordance with the conditions of the Loan
Agreement the Ministry of Finances of Ukraine (MoF) opened two Special Accounts in
BNP Paribas Bank (Frankfurt, Germany): –the first to finance expenditures under
components A, B, C, D, and G of the Project, and the second to finance component E
expenditures.

For the purpose of currency exchange and money transfer in national currency two
accounts in foreign currency and two accounts in national currency were opened in JSC
«Brokbiznesbank» to finance to finance expenditures under components A, B, C, D, and
G and Component E of the Project appropriately.

Moreover to finance expenditures during the Project, eleven letters of credit were opened
in BNP Paribas Bank (Frankfurt, Germany).

2. Project components

Component A. Institutional Development and Legal Reform
The main purpose of subcomponent A1 is to create appropriate conditions for the
delivery of services to citizens to ensure their constitutional rights to land by regional and
territorial bodies of land resources, and to enable them to comply with state policy in the
area of land relations.

For this purpose the subcomponent strengthened the logistical base of land resources
bodies, increased level of their work organization and improved conditions for the daily
delivery of information services on land relations issues to citizens.

Within subcomponent A1, the supply of necessary office furniture, office equipment,
computer and copying equipment was guaranteed for SALRU, Republic Committee for

                                             56 
 
Land Resources of AR of Crimea, 24 oblast and Kyiv and Sevastopol city Main
Departments for Land Resources and 665 raion and town departments (offices) for land
resources—in total for 692 offices for land resources.

The main purpose of subcomponent A2 "Legal Reform" was to prepare appropriate
legislation needed to improve management in the area of land use, in particular to prepare
necessary legislation and/or amendments to existing legislation after enactment of the
Land Code and future enactment of laws regulating system of cadastre and property
registration to be established, including technical assistance in the analysis of existing
legal status and in the creation of a library of international and national laws and
commentaries to them.

In order to achieve the subcomponent objectives an analysis of efficiency and adequacy
of law codes, laws, regulations was carried out; lessons learned from operation of the
laws in the developed world and possibilities of their adoption in the legislation of
Ukraine were studied; and proposals regarding improvement of the legislation, drafts
relevant laws and regulations for furthering the Land Code of Ukraine were elaborated.
Moreover, a comparison of the Land Code of Ukraine and other normative and legal acts
of Ukraine, land laws and regulations in the area of environmental, agricultural,
commercial and civil law was carried out for the purpose of studying contradictions
between them. On this basis of this study: (a) recommendations were prepared for
amending the land laws; (b) a list of materials was prepared to create a legal library at
SALRU with materials on land, agricultural and environmental legislation as well as
judicial practice of European group of countries in original languages and translated into
Ukrainian; (c) court practice and comments from experts in the area of use and
development of land legislation of Ukraine were selected; (d) international legal expert
evaluation was carried out for drafts and existing legal acts regulating land relations in
order to bring them into compliance with EU standards. Fourteen draft laws of Ukraine,
ten draft Decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and eleven draft orders of
executive bodies were developed.

Between 2008 and 2011, the implementation of subcomponent A2 was suspended
because of unregulated issue of priorities in the area of land legislation development, in
particular, because of absence of the key Law of Ukraine "On State Land Cadastre,"
which was adopted only in July 2011.

Normative and legal acts were developed and finalized to remove gaps and correct
existing contradictions in the land law, in particular to improve: (a) legal regulation of
non-agricultural land use in order to remove conflicts in the regulation of the effective
and efficient use and disposal of lands transferred from state ownership into collective
ownership and consolidation of land, and to ensure the protection and restoration of
useful properties of land; (b) legal regulation of relations connected with land survey
works, as it pertains to types, composition and content of the land management
documentation; (c) legal relations related to the State Cadastre of Ukraine maintenance,
improvement of economic and legal mechanism for the regulation of land relations for
allocation of lands for non-agricultural and non-forestry needs, optimizing land use and

                                            57 
 
land management at the regional level, improvement of land management-related
legislation; (d) legal regulation of relations connected with normative monetary valuation
of land parcels; and (e) legal regulation of relations connected with land auctions, etc.
Implementation of the component has been successfully completed and all indicators
were achieved.

Component B. Public Awareness

The main purpose of the component was to provide information to all state deeds
owners of their ownership and user rights and obligations, legal procedures related to
owning and renting land parcels by way of carrying out media campaigns, and
sociological studies to identify characteristics of the current state of land use, determine
its trends, and forecast the likely situation in the case of changes in legislation. In order to
achieve the goal, a series of contracts were signed.

To achieve the goal the following measures were taken: (a) during the Project period, a
system was provided to inform land owners, representatives of local authorities and
agricultural businesses in rural areas, as well as media informing citizens about land
relations, which included four information campaigns where central television, radio and
regional newspapers, internet were used as along with SALRU’s own printed materials
(broadcasts include 150 television and 100 radio programs, stories, live broadcasts,
including the regular television and radio program "My land is my property," 475 issues
of 25 regional newspapers, 5 press tours, 4 training seminars, and 120 publications
actualized the project website www.zemreforma.info, etc.), (b) a webportal
(www.land.gov.ua) was created to ensure the dissemination of information to the society
in the period after the project closing; (c) three comprehensive sociological studies of
land relations were carried out, and their results were disseminated through two
conferences and a special edition publication.
Implementation of the component was successful: achievement of the planned indicator
was exceeded, and at the same time the implementation was cost effective.

Component С «Training»
        The main purpose of the component is:
    1. Carrying out a comprehensive program of short-term training in land management
and land survey aimed at ensuring that qualified and highly specialized personnel are
available under the Project to restructure the large farm enterprises and convert four
million (4,000,000) land share certificates to state deeds, including training of district-
(raion) and village-level staff of the SALRU enabling them to utilize and administer the
automated systems to be established under Component D.2 of the Project, preparation of
training materials, and provision of technical assistance for course development and
workshops for training of trainers, English language courses for SALRU and PIU and
study tours for key personnel to review comparative practices abroad.
    2. Carrying out a selected program of long-term training to equip universities
selected by the SALRU on the needs of new land management graduates, and to assist
them in further developing their courses and long-term training capacity, including
provision of required study tours to university staff.

                                              58 
 
In order to achieve the goal series of actions were implemented and the following results
were achieved:
     carried out refreshment training for 3,273 specialists out of the land resources
bodies in 549 raion territorial divisions of SALRU, from all SALRU's 27 main
departments in oblasts and cities of Kyiv and;
This figure includes 78 specialists who have completed train-the-trainers courses for two
levels of Cadastre Registration System in March 2012 out of the Project funds. Moreover
the same specialists from SALRU and SLCC completed trainings on the system roll-out,
on registration procedure carrying out, and the system administration in the second half
of 2012 and at the beginning of 2013. But the last training was carried out without
engagement of the Project funds, therefore the number of persons who completed this
training is not included in the Project’s data.
     strengthened logistical base of nine leading universities by supplying them
equipment and specialized software;
     renewed training and methodological base in 22 state-owned universities training
specialists for land resources bodies, through the development of 9 methodological
manuals;
     conducted refresher training for 557 lecturers from 22 state-owned universities
training specialists for land resources bodies;
     elaborated a concept for development, and provided logistical support specialized
training and methodological center which will provide support, assistance and
coordination of training and refresher courses for specialists-land surveyors.
Refresher training for SALRU’s territorial bodies’ specialists ensured professional
support for land resources bodies’ specialists in the area of roll-out and implementation
of the National Cadastre System and land resources management—both tasks fall under
the primary tasks of Land Reform implementation in Ukraine.
Refresher training for university lecturers from universities training specialists for land
resources system as well as logistical, training and methodological support of these
universities enabled them to train highly qualified specialists with the latest theoretical
and practical knowledge in the area of cadastre maintenance and land resources
management.

The goal of the component has been achieved and its target indicators exceeded.

Component D «Land Survey Works and Cadastre System Development»
The main purpose of subcomponent D1 «Land survey works» was to carry an integrated
program to systematically privatize the land of the Borrower's former collective farms
and issue free-of-charge state deeds for land to individual rural land owners, including
preparatory investigation and consultation with the owners of the said collective farms
(such as the provision of information to the inhabitants of each region falling under such
process), the preparation of base maps and the surveying of boundaries of the collective
farms, the identification of holders of existing land share certificates and development of
the list thereof, and the identification and delineation of land and assets to be transferred,
the preparation of environmental assessments, farm restructuring and subdivision plans
and land survey work to convert about four million land share certificates, carrying out
quality control of the works, and issuing of the state deeds for lands, paying all

                                             59 
 
expenditures related to state deeds registration since the beginning of the project
implementation.

In order to achieve the objectives of the subcomponent, a package of land survey works
was performed and related legal and administrative measures were taken including field
survey of agricultural lands to be shared with the owners of land shares (shares), with
reference to the State geodetic network, drawing up land management documentation for
shares allocation in situ, the distribution of land between owners of land shares (pai) at
meeting, determining land boundaries in situ, registration of state property rights to land
and their issuance to owners. During the first stage of the component implementation, a
series of contracts were signed for pilot projects’ implementation to test specifications for
land survey works and make appropriate changes for further contracts envisaging
performance of main scope of the work.

During the implementation period of the subcomponent and before the beginning of this
work performance under the Project (2005) the President of Ukraine issued a series of
orders aimed to accelerate issuance of state deeds to land shares (pai) owners and
appropriate large-scale works were performed outside the Project with regard to 3,290
thousand certificates.

As a result of the works state deeds were issued in exchange for 513,668 certificates,
including 14,831 certificates converted under pilot contracts. Moreover, state deeds were
drawn up in exchange for 3,605 certificates which were not issued because of changes in
legislation, which came into effect on January 1, 2013. Works for converting 175,975
certificates were deemed "variation" caused by death or absence in the place of residence
of land shares (pai) owners, since in these cases issuance of state deeds to citizens was
impossible.

In this way the Project covered all vulnerable people - the owners of land shares (pai),
whose certificates for land shares (pai) were converted into state deeds for free.
In order to create cartographic basis for the Cadastre and Land Management System, the
following tasks were performed: aerial photography works in the scale of 1:25000 for the
whole territory of Ukraine followed by the creation of orthophoto maps at the scale 1:10
000 for the total area of 602,761.83 sq. km. and orthophoto maps at the scale 1:5 000 for
villages for the total area of 57,185.20 square kilometers; aerial photography works at the
scale of 1:8000 followed by the creation of orthophoto maps at the scale 1:2 000 for
townships and towns with population less than 200 thousand persons; these works also
cover water conservation zones along the Southern Coast of the Crimea and the Azov Sea
coast in Donets'ka oblast with the total area of 23,846.21 sq. km.; and creation of base
and index cadastral maps for the total area of 600,377.69 sq. km.

In this way the mapping works under the Project ensured cartographic basis of unified
quality and in a single unified coordinate system for the first time since Ukrainian
independence was proclaimed in 1991. Also, in order to provide an independent
assessment of quality of land survey and mapping works performed under subcomponent


                                             60 
 
D1 of the Project, a selective field quality control of 5% - 7% of the total scope of work
was conducted in every oblast.

The results of this selective quality control of land surveying and mapping works show
that works performed are generally in compliance with regulatory and technical
documents and terms of reference.

Implementation of the subcomponent ensured achievement of one of primary goals of
Land Reform in Ukraine, implemented in the country which started in 1990: to demarcate
the boundaries of agricultural land parcels (being land shares or pai) in situ and to register
these parcels in the cadastre system after determining their legal status, including private
ownership rights, which is very important for rural residents as well as for farmers and
agricultural enterprises which take the land parcels on lease.

Creation of cartographical base for cadastre maintenance, which was done for the entire
territory of Ukraine for the first time in the last 30 years, guarantees to land parcels
owners their rights to their property and provides the possibility to demarcate and manage
land parcels boundaries in situ and to decide wide variety of land policy issues, in
particular, to increase the efficiency of land resources management, to carry out land
valuation, to implement economic instruments for efficient and expedient land use and
land mortgage system development.

On the Closing Date of the Project all the works under subcomponent D1 are completed
and all its goals have been achieved.

Component E «Cadastre System Development»
The main purpose of the component E was to develop the national cadastre system to
establish its use as the basis of an ownership rights registration system envisaging
registration of legal ownership rights, transfers of these rights, mortgages, and
encumbrances for property, as well as institutional development of the SLCC, including
the modernization of the Center's network consisting of about six hundred sixty two
divisions, and to develop and establish a three-tier system of computerized cadastre and
registration that would include data registration, global positioning system and to provide
other equipment and transport for land management purposes

At the beginning of the project, the State Land Cadastre Center was determined an
institutional authority for the component E implementation. However, because of non-
implementation of the Law of Ukraine "On state registration of proprietary rights to
immovable property and their encumbrances" and other legislation related to the
development of state land cadastre and registry of rights to immovable property,
Component E was suspended and subsequently cancelled. Only after the project
restructuring, which lasted from 2006 to 2009, SALRU recommenced development of the
State Land Cadastre within modified component D2.

Subcomponent D2 «Cadastre System Development»


                                             61 
 
Within subcomponent D2, (a) computers, copying machines and scanners were supplied
to all SALRU's territorial units in 24 oblasts, AR of Crimea, and cities of Kyiv and
Sevastopol; (b) server and network equipment, power supply units and diesel (generator
units for Main (Kyiv) and Reserve (Yahotyn) data processing centers) were installed; (c)
premises were refurbished; (d) Main and Reserve data centers’ equipment was supplied
and installed, and power lines were laid and helped connect the Main and Reserve data
centers to the ITS building; (e) training was carried out; (f) orthophoto maps and index
cadastral maps for the whole territory of Ukraine were uploaded to State Land Cadastre
systems, cadastral and GIS software were installed, software for Improved Pilot Cadastre
Registration System (CRS) was developed and it has become the basis for standard
functions of the cadastre system that was configured in accordance with requirements of
current legislation regarding State Land Cadastre maintenance and launched on January
1, 2013; (g) goods supply for creation of Integrated Information Security System for
cadastre was carried out; (h) quality control of software for State Land Cadastre was
conducted; and (i) information exchange between State Land Cadastre and Registry of
proprietary rights to immovable property was ensured.

In this way, hardware, software, and created infrastructure has ensured implementation
and will ensure further smooth operation of the State Land Cadastre system which
evidences that the component's objectives have been achieved. The benefits of a
developed cadastre system include reduced waiting time, faster processing of data to
obtain cadastre extracts, and significant decrease in cost of parcel registration and
obtaining cadastre extract.

Component G «Project implementation»

Within the framework of the Component G “Project Implementation,” the following
elements were carried out: ongoing project management, including management of
financial activities, loan disbursement, procurement, support of contracts implementation
signed with contractors (suppliers/agents/consultants), drafting reports for submission to
the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Finance in accordance with
CoM Decree No. 1027 dated 26.11.2008), as well as reports to the World Bank in
accordance with conditions of the Loan Agreement.

Relevant agencies ensured audits of the Project's financial statements for 2003, 2004,
2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011.

In accordance with the conditions of the Loan Agreement the reports on audits of
Project's financial statements for above mentioned years were submitted to the World
Bank and accepted by the Bank. In total the PIU’s relevant agencies ensured signing of
221 contracts, and provided current management for each component of the Project in
2003-2013.

3. Project Monitoring and Evaluation
Project M&E activities were carried out regularly both on the Bank side and on Ukrainian
side. In accordance with the conditions of the Loan Agreement SALRU submitted to the

                                            62 
 
World Bank quarterly financial monitoring reports for the Project which included: (a)
management report, (b) procurement report, and (c) the financial statements
Moreover the PIU submitted to the World Bank quarterly reports regarding (a) progress
in procurement, (b) progress in Project Development Indicators achievement agreed by
way of negotiations or revised later; (c) short report about actions completed for each
component.

In order to monitor and evaluate the Project implementation, representatives from the
World Bank carried out monitoring missions two times per year with participation of the
Ukrainian representatives.

During the missions, the issues regarding implementation status of Project's components,
implementation of the procurement plan, disbursement of loan funds were considered,
and Agreed Actions for further implementation of the Project were signed based on this
assessment.

The Agreed Actions status was discussed regularly using video conferences attended by
the Task Team Leader, First Deputy Chairman of the State Agency/Project Coordinator
and Project Director. Such a level of representation provided the possibility to take timely
decisions in regard to future actions needed for the Project implementation.

From Ukrainian side in accordance with legislation (CoM's Decrees No. 1317 dated
10.10.2001, and then No.1027 dated 26.11.2008) reporting documents for the Project
monitoring were submitted to the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of
Ukraine, the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
Ukraine.

Having analyzed the reports for the Project the Ministry of Economic Development and
Trade of Ukraine prepared quarterly proposals for the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in
order to take the necessary measures needed to resolve the project issues to ensure its
successful implementation and completion.

Regular annual audits of the Project activities were performed by Accounts Chamber of
Ukraine and the State Financial Inspection of Ukraine. Monitoring and evaluation of the
Project was performed twice a year during project portfolio review in Ukraine by the
World Bank. As a result of M&E of the Project by the Bank and CoM, a series of
management decisions were taken including decisions about the Project restructuring and
extension of the Closing Date.

4. Financial management

Financial Management of the Project was carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's Guidelines clarifying the requirements of the Bank to the loan disbursement,
preparation of financial statements and carrying out independent audits. Regular annual
audits of the Project activities whereas performed by Accounts Chamber of Ukraine and
the State Financial Inspection of Ukraine.

                                            63 
 
Financial Management of the Project was carried out by MoF, SALRU, SLCC and PIU
consultants, in particular: by Department for debt and international financial policy
(MoF), Department of Financial Support and the Department of Accounting and
Reporting (SALRU), Financial and Economic Department (SLCC), and the Finance
Division of PIU.

During the project implementation, the finance department of PIU included: Deputy
Director of PIU for Procurement and Finance, Project finance manager, PIU accountant
and Component D accountant. In the last two years of the Project implementation,
Finance Department functions were performed by PIU's Financial Manager and
Accountant of component D. The process of financial management of the Project may be
divided into three parts:
     Drawing up and correcting general project budget by categories and components
for the entire period of the Project implementation and detailed budget with distribution
of funding for the next year in accordance with the World Bank requirements based on
the Procurement Plan agreed with the World Bank and approved by decisions of
SALRU's Tender Committee.
     Preparation and correcting of the budget request for the amount of assignments
from General Fund (funds of the Government of Ukraine) and Special Fund (Loan funds)
of the State Budget of Ukraine needed to finance Project's expenditure for the next
budget period in accordance with the current legislation of Ukraine.
     Drawing up and correcting the cost estimate for the current year (with monthly
breakdown of expenditures from general and special funds of the State Budget of
Ukraine) in accordance with requirements of the current legislation of Ukraine.
In accordance with the Loan Agreement, yearly independent audits of the Project's
Financial Statements were conducted, and its results were used as the basis for the report
in accordance with standards acceptable to the Bank. Some observations and
recommendations provided in the Management Letters from independent auditors to
SALRU's management were taken into account during the work.
Financial management system has been developed on the basis of software package "1C
Enterprise 7.7. Accounting for budgetary institutions of Ukraine". Additional software
module used with the default configuration provided possibility to keep records of
Project's expenditure using Plan of accounts for the Project and to prepare Financial
Statements under the Project in accordance with IBRD requirements. The system is
designed for simultaneous operation of multiple users.

5. Procurement
Procurement under the Project was carried out in accordance with rules and procedures
prescribed by the Bank pursuant to the Bank's Procurement Guidelines « Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits» for works, goods, and technical services and
pursuant to "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers" for procurement of consultants' services as provided in the Loan Agreement.
To support procurement process under the Project, Procurement Specialists, who have
prior experience in procurement under the World Bank's rules and procedures, were
employed. To improve and the quality of procurement, the specialists attended every

                                           64 
 
training for procurement held by the World Bank Country Office and in addition they
attended joint training courses held by the Bank and International Training Center
(Torino, Italy).

Support of contracts concluded under the Project was ensured by coordinators of
corresponding components that were a part of PIU project and appropriate departments of
SALRU.

Procurement under the Project was agreed with procurement specialists from the Bank.
Post Reviews of procurement under the Project were carried out permanently by the
Bank's Procurement Specialists and were successful with no objections. Independent
auditors from the Bank also carried out yearly procurement audits and had no objections.
But problematic situations took place during the Project implementation. As a result of
bidding № DKZ-D2-ICB.9.201 «Development of Cadastre System» unsuccessful bidders
initiated two court proceedings for alleged violations of procurement procedures, but
after their consideration by the Commercial Court of Kyiv both cases were dismissed.
Moreover during their contracts implementation Blominfo A/S (Denmark) and Blom
ASA of Norvey applied to the Adjudicator regarding certain issues of the contracts
implementation.

BSF Swissphoto AG (consortium Swissphoto), whose contract for land survey and
mapping works was terminated because of non-implementation thereof with appropriate
seizure of performance security, applied to the Adjudicator requesting to repay bank
guaranties and to pay additionally for works partially completed under the contract.

6. Social and economic benefits of the Project
As a result of subcomponent A1 implementation, the following social and economic
benefits were provided:
     strengthened logistical base of land resources bodies;
     increased level of their work organization and improved land resources
management;
     improved information services delivery to citizens in the area of land relations.
Information campaigns under Component B were the first (and so far the only) example
of systematic coverage of land relations in Ukraine in terms of the interests of an average
land owner. Through the dissemination of information about land owners’ rights, the
campaign activities facilitated to correct the information asymmetry between various
layers of society. Ability to use rights was one of the factors promoting constant increase
in the number of people who receive monetary rent for use of their parcels, and the
amount of the rent significantly increased. Awareness of their rights allowed share (pai)
owners to feel more confident, a sign of which was a decrease of fears in relation to
introduction of the land market. Thanks to the clarification about the National Cadastre
System, the possibilities for share owners in terms of protection of their ownership rights
and for society in terms of control over legality of land resources use, a base was
established as early as in May 2012 for acceptance of this innovation by citizens.


                                            65 
 
Results of sociological research revealed characteristics of modern status of land use, its
trends, and enabled forecasting in the case of changes in legislation and may be used for
improvement of Ukrainian land policy.

Component C results enabled universities to train specialists with the current level of
theoretical and practical knowledge in the area of land management and cadastre, and
provided not only refresher training to specialists from government land resources bodies,
but also created conditions for their further training with the use of modern equipment
and professional software.

Implementation of the Component D “Land surveys and cadastre system development”
enabled citizens of Ukraine: (a) to exercise their rights to land shares (pai) at no charge;
(b) to complete privatization of agricultural land in Ukraine, which in turn promoted
formation of land market; (c) provided an opportunity to implement important socio-
economic processes in rural areas; (d) enabled increase of local budgets revenues; and (e)
created more favorable conditions for foreign and domestic capital investment in
agriculture.

At the same time, implementation of the cadastre system facilitated development of land
relations and ownership protection, implementation of land market, and promoted
reduction of corruption occurrences in the area land relations. The system developed
provides: (a) protection of land owners’ and land users’ rights; (b) acceleration of land
registration and simplified access of citizens and legal persons to the land cadastre data;
(c) reduction in time and costs during transactions with land parcels; and (d) increase in
efficiency of finding (delivery) and management of cadastral data, reduced costs of
collecting and maintaining of cadastre information, conducting analysis (including spatial
analysis) of cadastral information, simplified assessment and analysis of market and
rental value of land, fast decision making at regional and national levels in the area of
land valuation, land use planning, land protection, monitoring, and management of land
resources in the country. The main advantages of developed cadastre system are: public
cadastre map with feedback function and an ability of the system to reveal and correct
errors committed in past and to avoid them in future. This enables the cadastre system to
ensure completeness, accuracy, up-to-datedness, and reliability of data about land parcels
and rights to them.

7. Sustainability of the Project Results and Future Needs
As a result of the project logistical support to SALRU allows for an improvement in the
delivery of public services. The development of normative and legal acts over the course
of the project will help in the creation of a transparent land market. The public outreach
efforts during the Project have not only led to the expansion of the free information
available to the public through the new portal www.land.gov.ua, but also created a more
informed citizenry. Training activities are being used to educate specialists with the latest
high technology cadastre system and further support in this area is required. Project
results have had a positive impact on a series of issues including efficient land
management, greater transparency, and simplification of registration procedures, and
lower registration costs.

                                             66 
 
It is also necessary to implement self-financing mechanism for the cadastre system i.e. to
channel funds obtained from services delivery for needs and development of the system
itself, which is extremely important to build the National Spatial Data Infrastructure. By
completing much of the technical mapping work that is considered by the government as
a prerequisite for opening up a land market, the project has contributed to the resolution
of some important policy issues discussed in the LGAF.

8. Bank Performance

The project management team from the Bank has created an effective scheme of the
Project’s organization with the help of Task Team Leaders (there were 3 TTLs during the
entire project implementation period) and other qualified professionals.

The team provided prompt resolution/settlement of all problematic issues and took
necessary decisions during the project, especially during restructurings. Full-scale
advisory support was available on technical, financial, procedural, and legal issues in
accordance with global best practices. Procurement documents were agreed to promptly
in accordance with agreed terms and proposals and remarks to them were reasonable.
Financial transactions (replenishment, letters of credit finalization, special commitments,
and payments) under the Project were carried out in the prescribed manner that promoted
the disbursement of loan funds. Close contact between the Bank and the Ukrainian side
enabled the achievement of project objectives. Thus, the scheme of the project
organization was efficient, professional, and highly effective.

Supervision of the project implementation was carried out by the World Bank on a
regular basis. Monitoring missions were conducted for the Project were conducted twice
a year, and videoconferences with management of SALRU, SLCC and representatives of
contractors were held regularly.

On the Bank's side the missions involved specialists in Procurement, Finance, Legal
Issues, Land Management and IT specialists, and specialists for cadastre and cartography.
As a result of the Bank's missions the Ukrainian side received letters with Aide Memoires
on the progress in the project implementation where resolving of current issues under the
project was emphasized. In this way, overseeing of the project implementation was
carried out objectively, impartially and in a professional manner.

Annex 8: Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


     COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT 24

FAO has been supporting the Rural Land Titling and Cadastre Development Project in
the framework of the World Bank-FAO Cooperative Programme from its early stages.
Three FAO experts (land policy and reform expert in 2005, and information technology,
cadastral mapping and land surveys experts from the autumn of 2010 until project
completion in 2013) have been involved in the implementation support and supervision
missions. The fluency in Russian of two of the experts has contributed to better level of
communication and understanding with the government counterparts. The expertise since
2010 covered the supervision of the biggest project Component D: Land Survey Works
and Cadastre System Development.

Sub-Component D1: Titling, Mapping and Quality Control Works

D1 aspired to achieve the following targets (cf. revised key performance indicators, June
2010):

    Issued personal titles for rural ground areas in exchange for 4 million certificates for
     the right of property of land parcels (‘pai’); – achieved, including
         o 711,678 titles under project contracted activities, and 3.29 million titles with
             support from other sources

The target for this PDO outcome indicator has been achieved within the Project’s
lifespan. Project titling work estimates proved to have been overestimated during project
design, due to a high incidence of target beneficiaries anticipating or by-passing the
project supported titling services. Despite that, all targeted rural lands have been
subdivided within the Project. More than 0.7 million individual rural land parcels have
been allocated (with their property boundaries surveyed and unique parcel identifiers
assigned), then recorded in the temporary cadastre system and after 01 January 2013 – in
the State Land Cadastre (in the National Cadastre System, NCS). More than 0.5 million
GosActs for these 0.7 million parcels have been delivered free of charge to the rightful
claimants. For the remaining 0.2 million parcels State deeds were prepared but not
delivered as “variations” in the titling contract quantities due to absence or decease of the
owners and pending inheritance litigation.

      The aerial survey of the territory of all oblasts is completed (600 sq. km targeted,
       Ukraine’s territory is 603.6 sq. km); – achieved and exceeded, including
             o Orthophoto (base) maps for 602.8 sq. km in 1:10,000 plus additional
                    57.2 sq. km in 1:5,000 and 23.8 sq. km in 1:2,000

                                                68 
 
        o Index cadastre maps completed for all oblasts (target 24 oblasts)

All intermediate performance indicators for the mapping works have been fully achieved
and exceeded. More than that, the target 600,000 sq. km of modern digital mapping has
been delivered under the Project, covering practically 100% of the territory of Ukraine.
Mapping works under the Project were carried out in 24 oblasts, the Autonomous Region
(AR) of Crimea and the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol thus fully equipping Ukraine with
base mapping of uniform quality for the first time after independence (in fact, even
earlier – since 1986): up-to-date aerial photography, an up-to date digital orthophoto map
in appropriate large scales, as well as a digital Cadastral Index Map (CIM) recording and
making visible in their spatial context all the privatized and surveyed land parcels
(around 13 million “active”25 rural and settlement ones) with their assigned unique parcel
identifiers.

   Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (cf. ICR, page 25)

        o Integration of spatial data in the National Cadastre System (NCS)

The titling and mapping products under the Project – which are essentially digital
(spatial) data sets, – have been successfully loaded nationwide in the NCS by 31
December 2012. The spatial data have been transformed in bulk by the SLCC, – the
system administrator of NCS – into the single national coordinate system, fully
integrated in the NCS, and stored together with the other (archive and operational)
spatial, alpha numeric and image data26, in the NCS database. SLCC has completed the
population of NCS with spatial data on state borders and boundaries of administrative
territorial units in Ukraine, and the “active” exchange files from individual parcel
surveys.

A short- and mid-term data quality improvement concept and implementation plan are
being implemented by SLCC. Batch corrections, mostly of spatially misplaced parcels
were implemented in early 2013 with in-house developed software modules as a result of
the comprehensive error analysis which was carried out after the launch of the Public
Cadastre Map on 01 January 2013, and the participatory, formalized feedback.27 This
level of public commitment in data quality improvement corresponds to the best global
practices.

                                                       
25
             “active” parcels’ exchange files show the survey of the parcel at the time of the 
last registered transaction; in addition to the “active” parcels, NCS database stores also 
approx. 5 million “archive” parcels’ exchange files  
26
             including State deeds with their alpha‐numeric and graphical parts, individual 
parcel exchange files, orthophoto maps, Cadastral Index Maps, topographic maps 
(including relief), soil maps, statutory land valuation maps, lower level administrative 
subdivision schemes, etc.  
27
             around 10.9 thousand e‐applications via feedback by 15 Feb 2013, 75% 
addressed and mass slip‐ups handled 
                                              69 
 
         o Good service delivery practices in compliance with the VGGT

Several of the land governance practices in Ukraine in the area of cadastre, especially
service delivery ones, which were established with project support, can successfully
showcase Ukraine’s compliance with relevant good practices recommended by the
internationally endorsed Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure
of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (FAO, 2012).

         o Valuable by-products with far reaching positive impacts for improved land
           governance:
–   A comprehensive inventory of all existing archive mapping source materials was
    carried out throughout the country in all the relevant central, oblast and rayon
    authorities, which held archive mapping and land-related documentation. This
    inventory and source materials informed the establishment of the CIMs, and enabled
    the planning of archive map digitizing works.
–   A complete redesign, reconfiguration and re-survey of the Geodetic Reference
    Infrastructure of Ukraine was carried out, digital mapping data produced and
    uploaded into the NCS, thus launched an efficient and smooth transition to a modern
    (GNSS28) geodetic reference network and coordinate system (USK’2000) in all the
    sectors of Ukrainian economy which use spatial data.
–   The integration of mapping data in the unified data base allowed the identification of
    existing spatial data issues, and the development of spatial data quality improvement
    concept and implementation plan.
–   A complete record (database and standard spatial identification) of existing
    administrative territorial units (state, oblast, autonomous region, cities, rayon,
    villages, settlement areas, spatial planning zones, etc.) has been established and
    settlement of territorial boundary disputes between various level jurisdictions has
    been initiated.

I. GENERAL COMMENTS:

Comment 1. ICR, point 1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key
Indicators
The ICR has to reflect the original PAD Objective of Component E. Cadastre
System Development: Three phases of implementation are described in the design of the
original Component E:
“Phase 1. Interim System. The development of this interim system is essential to ensure
that a system is in place for electronic recording of the large number o f State Deeds for
Land to be issued in rural areas under Component D of project.- achieved.
Phase 2. Cadastre System Development and Rural Office Network - achieved.
Phase 3. Registry Module Upgrade and Urban Office Network. ...Until the law is passed,
there is the risk that the institutional responsibility for registration of urban properties
may be assigned to a different agency from the CC, which would make any investment in
CC urban registry offices redundant...This would require that the cadastre system
design has additional flexibility to allow alternative institutional arrangements for the
registry, and that the registry system module of the cadastre system would need to be
upgraded after the law is passed.
...a "second best" solution would need to be sought. This would require that the
cadastre system design has additional flexibility to allow alternative institutional
arrangements for the registry, and that the registry system module o f the cadastre
system would need to be upgraded after the law is passed.”- PAD, May 30, 2003 – the
second best option has been implemented.
The objectives under the original Cadastre system design have been achieved (second
best solution is implemented, allowing alternative institutional arrangements). Various
additional modules have been developed, which has not been planed:
Exceeded parts include:
a) Business processes reengineering to simplify the procedures and to minimize the
opportunities for corrupt practices,
b) Digital signature implementation for all the cadastre operators to introduce personal
responsibility for the actions taken, online staff and offices performance is implemented,
c) Digital archive for all the old and incoming documents is in operation (the funds for
this activity has been canceled on June 24, 2010 – “cancellation relating to works under
component D specifically, archival data input through scanning due to lack of time to
implement”),
d) Unified cadastre map has been created and data from about 1460 local coordinate
systems have been transformed in a single coordinate system, called USK’2000,
achieving absolute accuracies of GRN stations in USK’2000 (compliant with the EU
TR89) within the 2-3 cm range, which is a remarkable result for a country with the size of
Ukraine, public cadastre map online is operational and notary access to both systems is
guaranteed.

Comment 2. ICR, point 1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving
authority) and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
With the project restructuring in 2008 the reference to the title registry system has been
deleted due to legal and institutional obstacles. The revised outcome enables such a
cadastre and registry system to be established for rural land and only for the titles issued
under the project, by the main beneficiary agency.
The objectives under the restructured Cadastre system design has been achieved and even
exceeded.
Exceeded parts include:
a) Various additional modules have been developed, described above under point 1.;
b) The system includes both agricultural land and construction land;
c) nation-wide land parcels data have been digitalised and downloaded in the system – all
GosActs have been scanned, indexed, data entry completed and verified and downloaded
in the system, not just rural land and digitalisation of documents issued under the project,
all cadastre index maps and all orthophoto, covering the entire territory are downloaded
in the system.
Comment 3. Achievements under the project. The Component D2 indicator
“Developed unified national cadastre system” has thus been fully achieved – both as per
the restructuring paper and as it has been originally planned. The results achieved
exceeded the expectations in the original PAD and in the restructuring. System
sustainability in a long term has been achieved.
The National Cadastre System has been put in operation nationwide since January 1, 
2013 and covers central level (central and reserve data centers), oblast level (all 25 
oblasts plus 2 towns with a status of oblast) and rayon level (592 locations). The secrecy 
of the Coordinate System in Ukraine has been abolished in 2012, which allows public 
access to digital cadastre maps and orthophoto maps, an electronic signature has been 
implemented and several additional sub‐systems have been implemented: 1) Online 
exchange of information with the State Registration Service and Notaries; 2) Geo‐portal 
(Public cadastre map) with an e‐service for citizen to report errors identified; 3) Online 
applications tracking system; 4) Digital archive for both historical and incoming 
documents (State deeds (16.8 million State deeds, scanned, indexed, data entered,
verified and uploaded into secure central database, all cadastre index maps vectorised and
uploaded into the system, scanning of incoming documents introduced nation-wide).
End users documentation and e-learning courses have been developed and are available
as part of the NCS on-line help. A series of training and methodological materials to
ensure unification of applied procedures have been developed, as well as system
administration instructions. The Help Desk is fully operational and includes both
telephone lines and electronic mailing system. The response time of the Help Desk is
good and responses are provided in most of the cases at the same day.
The implemented National Cadastre system covers both agricultural and construction
land, includes all titles issued nationwide and the interoperability with the title
registration system, managed by the State Registration Service is ensured
(information for all changes in the cadastre and in the title registration are automatically

                                            72 
 
shared and a module for notaries is implemented, which provides on-line information
from both systems). The institutional capacity developed for keep the system running and
to develop additional modules is highly satisfactory. Strong team of IT experts, cadastre
and legal experts are involved in the system further development, maintenance and
capacity building. There is a full ownership over the system, which is proved by the
results achieved after the official launch of the system in January 2013 till September 30,
2013, when the FAO expert visited Kiev to assess the system sustainability.
Comment 4. Progress since January 2013. During the first nine months of the system
operation (January 1-September 30, 2013) 803 077 new land parcels have been registered
and 623 586 extracts has been issued. The Public Cadastre Map Web site has been visited
by 2 514 011 people and 21 362 errors have been reported on-line during the first 9
months. The average processing time for registering new parcel in the cadastre is 21 min
nationwide, in case all documents are submitted as per the law requirements. The work
on data quality improvement is in the main focus of the SALRU and errors correction is
continuing as planned. More than 2 million errors have already been corrected.
The cooperation with the State Registration Service is improving and the joint technical
working group continues to meet to discuss further cooperation and possible
improvements, based on the experience so far. The information sharing is done
automatically during the night. By September 30, 2013, the State Registration Service
(SRS) sent information for 1 210 967 changes, and the SALRU has provided information
for 803 077 registered new parcels. During the first 9 months the system has registered 94
696 requests for information by notaries.
Comment 5. National Cadastre System Sustainability.
Several important milestones have been achieved after the project closure:
a) The National Cadastre System and the Public Cadastre Map are fully documented and
the system has been audited by the independent quality assurance contractor;
b) The electricity power supply for the main data centre has been certified and is in
operation; communication channels between the two data centres have been ensured by
the SCC and are in operation and the two data centres (main and disaster recovery) are
ready for production;
c) The number of IT staff has been increased after the project closure. Currently 74
employees from the central level are involved in the National Cadastre System
maintenance, data quality improvement, system further develop, technical support and
training and more than 700 staff at the oblast level provides methodological support to
the users at the rayon level;
d) A detailed training programme is developed and the training is ongoing: 571
employees from all regional offices have been trained as regional system administrators
between July, 1, 2013 till August, 9, 2013 and 20 employees will be trained on the
system and database administration and management at the end of the October 2013;
Comment 6. National Cadastre System Further Development.
Several statistical reports have been developed and integrated into the system; Several
new services have been implemented and several more are in the pipeline; Digitalization

                                            73 
 
of relief and soil maps is ongoing as planed and almost 50% of work has been completed;
National Spatial Data Infrastructure – pilot project in Fastov District, Kyiv Region has
been successfully completed. Various statistical data has been integrated with the maps,
the urban plans have been digitized and included as a separate layer, 3D Model has been
developed to demonstrate the possible use of the NSDI for climate change monitoring,
early warning system for flooding, fast data production in case of natural disasters.
SALRU is planning an official presentation to the Government of Ukraine in October
2013. The achieved results are very promising and are in line with the European Union
INSPIRE Directive and the Public Sector Information Directive.
II. SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON THE ICR
Comment 1. ICR, point 1.5 Original Components (as approved), point E.

The definition of the cadastre system does not comply with the original text of the PAD.
Component E of PAD envisages that “Once developed and in use, the cadastre would
have multiple purposes. The most critical of these for Ukraine in the next few years is
that it would be the basis for a title registry system, which records the legal rights to
ownership, transfers of ownership, mortgages and restrictions on the property.”

 The PAD is further describing the “ideal scenario” and a ”second best option”:
“cadastre system design has additional flexibility to allow alternative institutional
arrangements for the registry, and that the registry system module o f the cadastre
system would need to be upgraded after the law is passed.” – see PAD, Annex 2, pages
47(last par.))-48 (first par). This second best option has been achieved.

Comment 2. ICR, point 1.7 Other significant changes, fourth and fifth bullet points

Forth bullet:” Cancellation of $11.85 million on June 24, 2010 relating to works under
component D specifically, archival data input through scanning due to lack of time to
implement the activities and costs of registration of state deeds due to the work having
been paid for through other means. The country director approved the cancellation”. –
Comment: By the time of project completion the work has been completed with
alternative sources of financing. This has to be clarified in the ICR.

Fifth Bullet: “Under a Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL), which was prepared in
parallel with the project and coordinated with it, the government was obliged to adopt
the legal basis for implementing a unified title registry. Although the government failed to
do so, the funds under the PAL were nonetheless released to the government”. - The
implemented National Cadastre System is compliant with the “second best option”,
described in the original PAD with the achieved interoperability (legal and technical)
with the title registration system.

Comment 3. ICR, point 2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The PAD describes the “ideal scenario” and a ”second best option”: “cadastre system
design has additional flexibility to allow alternative institutional arrangements for the
registry, and that the registry system module o f the cadastre system would need to be
                                            74 
 
upgraded after the law is passed.” – see PAD, Annex 2, pages 47(last par.))-48 (first
par). This has to be added at the end of the point 2.1.

Comment 4. ICR, point 2.2 Implementation
In addition to the political support the efficient management capacity of the head of the
State Agency for Land Resources of Ukraine, the excellent technical and management
capacity of the head of the State Cadastre Centre and the established Task Force with the
clear mandate to manage the system development and to take decisions were critical for
the success.
The text at the end of the first paragraph “Ultimately, while the country did not adopt a
unified title registration system under a single agency as envisioned in Component E”
does not comply with the described “second best solution” in the original PAD – see
comment 1 above. The implemented system and the ensured interoperability with the title
registration system can technically support any kind of institutional arrangements and
one-stop-shop, in case the necessary legal changes are implemented.

Comment 5. ICR, point 2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase, par. 2

The assumptions made at the second par. has to consider the following facts:

“Nevertheless, it is important to note that the while the development of the new IT system
can be viewed as a substantial step, there is still much to be done with regard to
operations.”

“First, a long-term strategy for updating, maintenance and sustainability of the vital
spatial data assets developed by the Project (i.e. the digital orthophoto map and the
cadastral index map) is still needed.” – The long term strategy and action plan have been
developed and the process is ongoing with government financing: tender for supply of
aerial camera with the software complex to ensure fast processing of images and
orthophoto production (1 hour flight will require 24 hours processing time) has been
announced at the beginning of October 2013 and the plan is to renew the orthophoto on a
5 years base (average the orthophoto maps of five Oblasts will be produced per) year.
The work will start early 2014. Digitalisation of soil maps and relief maps is ongoing
with own resources and will be completed by the end of 2013. The training of IT staff at
local, oblast and regional level is ongoing after the project closure and the system is
stable with efficient Help Desk on place. No system interruption has been registered the
first 9 months of operation.

“Second, the current cadastral index maps only reflect the parcels of land which have
been registered. Thus, the records are incomplete and a plan is needed to include all
private and public land parcels in the country, as well as registration of buildings.” – A
plan for inventory is developed and the land inventory is ongoing - statistical reports are
available for the work completed. The buildings are not included in the cadastre law, but
this is highly needed in the future. Pilot project for buildings cadastre registration has
been completed after the project closure.


                                            75 
 
“ Third, further institutional cooperation between the MOJ and SALRU is needed to
facilitate completion of a linked cadastre-legal registry system.”. The cooperation
between the SALRU and the SRS is continuing after the project closure at the political
and technical level. The technical working group is reviewing the results of information
sharing during the past 9 months and is preparing proposals for further simplification of
procedures. It has to be mentioned that both systems (cadastre and titling are very new
and require some time, before taking next steps. As both systems are centralized, the
introduction of one-stop-shop is technically possible within a period of less than a month,
after the agreement between the institution is reached and legal changes implemented.
The notary module is in fact one-stop-shop, as it provides data from both cadastre and
registration system to the notaries. The SALRU plan is from the beginning of 2014
digitally signed extracts to be issued on-line without clients to visit the cadastre office,
subject of adopted legal changes.

Comment 6. ICR, point 3. Assessment of Outcomes, 3.2 Achievement of Project
Development Objectives

Second par. does not reflect the original PAD text: “Under the original PDO and design
the project should be considered unsatisfactory. As noted previously, the original PDO
reflects an overly ambitious project design that included the creation of a unified title
registration and cadastre system which had to be abandoned due to institutional rivalry
between the MOJ and SALRU.” – see comment 1. The original PAD envisages “ideal
scenario” and “second best option”. The second best option has been achieved.

Comment 7. ICR, point 3. Assessment of Outcomes, 3.2 Achievement of Project
Development Objectives

Last par. does not reflect the reality. “While the achievements with the cadastral system
are significant and exceeded targets and expectations, an issue of efficiency arose over
the contract dispute with the IT system contract which delayed system development and
required significant supervision and input from the Bank side. Thus, the rating of
satisfactory rather than highly satisfactory is assigned.” – The cadastre IT system has
been developed and successfully piloted before the project extension. Additional time
was needed to roll out the system nationwide and the extension of nine months has been
granted. During the extension time the Cadastre Law has been changed and the contractor
rejected to introduce the new legal changes, after the pilot has been accepted, which lead
to the contract closure on mutual agreement.
The SALRU has react very quickly in this extraordinary situation and managed to further
develop the system in-house in compliance with the new law, which introduced sharing
of information with SRS and implementation of Public Cadastre Map. The system
upgrading has been completed and rolled out as planed as part of the extension time. The
contract dispute did not lead to further delays. The new law came into force on January 1,
2013, which is the date of the launch of the National Cadastre System. The system could
not be put in operation prior to that as it was redesigned to comply with the new law. The
contract with the independent quality assurance contractor, supervising the initial
software development contract has been amended to cover the quality assurance and
                                            76 
 
quality control of the in-house development.
III. CONCLUSIONS:
The original PAD objective of Component E, Cadastre System Development – the
described "second best" solution has been implemented, allowing alternative
institutional arrangements for the registry...after the law has been passed.” The
National Cadastre System exceeded the requirements from both the original PAD
and the restructuring. The exceeded parts include: business processes reengineering to
simplify the procedures and to minimize the opportunities for corrupt practices, digital
signature implementation for all the cadastre operators to introduce personal
responsibility for the actions taken, online staff and offices performance is implemented,
digital archive for all the old and incoming documents is in operation (the funds for this
activity has been cancelled on June 24, 2010 – “cancellation relating to works under
component D specifically, archival data input through scanning due to lack of time to
implement”), unified cadastre map has been created and data from about 1460 local
coordinate systems have been transformed in a single coordinate system, called
USK’2000, achieving absolute accuracies of GRN stations in USK’2000 (compliant with
the EU TR89) within the 2-3 cm range, which is a remarkable result for a country with
the size of Ukraine, public cadastre map online is operational and notary access to both
systems is guaranteed. Both agricultural and construction land parcels are included in the
system. All issued documents nation-wide have been scanned, indexed and uploaded in
the system, not just the ones issued under the project, as planed in the restructuring of the
project.
Government financing is ensured after the project closure to maintain and further develop
the system. The cooperation between the SALRU and the SRS (under the MoJ) continues
after the project closure at political and technical level.
IV. LESSONS LEARNED:
    1. Step-by-Step approach proved to be a key for the successful completion of the
       IT system development and implementation. The original PAD describes three
       phases of IT system implementation, starting with simple data base to keep the
       ownership documents, issued under the project in digital form, then development
       of cadastre system at oblasts level to support the day-to-day operation and after
       that development of nation-wide system with designed two options, based on
       different scenarios for the institutional and legal arrangements. The benefits of
       that were local capacity building from the beginning of the project to work with
       digital records, to develop and maintain the IT system.
    2. High level political support is critical for the success of the Land Administration
       IT systems. In case of Ukraine the new laws on cadastre and registration has been
       adopted, introducing obligatory information sharing between the cadastre and
       registration, public access to cadastre information, the secrecy of the coordinate
       system has been abolished, additional funds have been allocated to extend the
       activities under the project.
    3. Establishment of clear management and reporting mechanism with delegated
       level of authority to the technical experts to take decisions is a key for the success.
       The efficient management capacity of the head of the State Agency for Land

                                             77 
 
        Resources of Ukraine, the excellent technical and management capacity of the
        head of the State Cadastre Centre and the established Task Force with a clear
        mandate to manage the system development and to take decisions were critical for
        the success.
    4. Introducing of independent quality assurance and quality control is a good
       international practice. The role of the independent quality assurance and quality
       control contractor was extremely important to ensure that the system is fully
       documented, to guide the local team to introduce international standards for
       version control, testing and system maintenance.
    5. Data quality improvement is a long process and has to be considered as priority
       during the entire project duration. In Ukraine lots of preliminary work has been
       done to analyse the alphanumeric and legal data, to classify the errors, to
       implement number of pilot projects for data quality improvements and to design
       online module for citizens to report errors (crowdsourcing).
    6. System sustainability is of key importance to guarantee the IT system
       maintenance and further development. In case of Ukraine a strong team of IT and
       business experts has been established and kept after the project closure. The
       number of IT staff after the project closure has been increased, the training
       continue after the project and new modules have been implemented.
    7. Future development is important. Long term plan has been developed and a
       pilot project has been implemented during the first 6 months after the project,
       which integrates various statistical data with the road, gas, electricity, water
       supply maps, urban plans and a 3D Model has been developed to demonstrate the
       benefits of building National Spatial Data Infrastructure for climate change
       monitoring, early warning system for flooding, fast data production in case of
       natural disasters. The achieved results are very promising and are in line with the
       European Union INSPIRE Directive and the Public Sector Information Directive.
