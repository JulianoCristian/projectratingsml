The project included a part that was\n            supposed to establish a unified registration system covering\n            both urban and rural areas and it included funding for the\n            transformation of the State Land Cadastre Center (SLCC) to\n            implement this activity. The SLCC have been unable to\n            undertake this work because of resistance from the Ministry\n            of Justice and it has now been agreed that resolution of the\n            differences between the institutions is highly unlikely and\n            that the project outcomes relating to this part can not be\n            met. The project also included a part on farm restructuring\n            that has seen little progress and is no longer required.\n            Other parts of the project are progressing satisfactorily.\n            The project restructuring is necessary in order to amend the\n            project development objective, revise the project outcomes\n            and reallocate resources to ensure that land titling and\n            cadastre systems in rural areas function effectively. This\n            also entails cancellation of the sub-loan agreement between\n            the government and the SLCC and cancellation of the project\n            agreement between Industrial Bank for Reconstruction and\n            Development (IBRD) and the SLCC."}, "docdt": "2008-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
