                         Implementation Status Overview
                           Substantial progress has been made on the electrification of the initial 320 towns targeted under the project. Progress is estimated at 65% and the rest is expected to be finalized by
                         July 2011. At present it is estimated that about 70% of both the 33kV and LV lines have been completed. The work on 9 new substations is nearing completion. EEPCo expects that
                         the erection work will be expedited to enable all substations to be energized by July 2011. The number of towns to be electrified has increased from 320 to 382 towns. A procurement
                         plan has been detailed and approved by the Bank. A new cycle of procurement had to be carried out, which entailed a longer implementation time. EEPCo is preparing revised

                         Those are to be sold at a discount to households and other customers in Ethiopia. The project has also supported the replacement of inefficient street lighting, installation of efficient
