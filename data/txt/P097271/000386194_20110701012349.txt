       ETHIOPIA ACCELERATED ELECTRICITY ACCESS
                  (RURAL) EXPANSION
                                     CREDIT 4200-ET (P097271)
                                       Restructuring Paper

 1.    The closing date for the Ethiopia Accelerated Electricity Access (Rural)
 Expansion I Project, Credit 4200-ET, Project ID P097271, will be extended from June
 30, 2011 until December 31, 2012. The credit is for 92.8 million SDR, from which 52.2
 million SDRs have been disbursed.

 2.    The project is recovering now from a slow start caused by procurement problems
 and a moratorium on connections, which was lifted in September 2010. Good progress
 has been made with 204 towns of 380 having been connected; 5 million Compact
 Fluorescent Lamps distributed under the Energy Efficiency component, and much of the
 technical assistance has been rendered.

 3.     The proposed extension is necessary to allow sufficient time for completion of
 project activities which were delayed due to procurement problems and the connection
 moratorium declared as a result of the drought-induced power crisis. The Borrower has
 an action plan in place to ensure timely completion of all outstanding activities under the
 project (see below). The balance of towns will be electrified as per this plan. A
 reallocation will be submitted at a later date.

                                          July-Dec 2011   Jan-June 2012   July-Dec 2012   Total
No. of towns/villages to be electrified        138              45              60        243

 4.     With respect to the non-compliance of covenant PA, Schedule, Section II, B para
 3(a), net revenues in the last year were negative, reflecting an increase in operating
 costs, and a decrease in revenue due to a serious power crisis. The situation will change
 over the coming years, as EEPCo will start exporting 150MW of firm energy to Sudan
 and Djibouti in 2011, as well as already increasing its domestic sales, supported by
 about 1200 MW of hydroplants just commissioned. Regarding FA, Schedule 2, Section
 5, A., EEPCo, with support from the World Bank, has been preparing an integrated
 electrification plan (Prospectus).aligned with the revised goal of providing access to
 75% of towns and villages in a 5-year timeframe. Regarding PA, Schedule, Section 1.2,
 EEPCo has been supervising the project satisfactorily. Audit reports, which were
 overdue, have been submitted, reviewed and found satisfactory by the Bank. The team
 confirms that requirements of OP/BP 13.30 (Closing Dates) have been met.
 Specifically, (i) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii) the performance of
 the borrower and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; (iii) there are no
 outstanding financial audit reports. The DPO and IP were both rated MS in the last ISR
 dated March 29, 2011, and S in the penultimate sequence (June 28, 2010).

5.    This will be the second extension of the project. A first extension for 18 months
was granted as part of a restructuring on December 13, 2009, which moved the original
closing date from December 31, 2009, to the current closing date of June 30, 2011.
