                                   RESTRUCTURING PAPER


SUMMARY

1.       The proposed changes consist of (i) reallocation of proceeds to compensate for over-
expenditures in two categories and to provide adequate funding for expanded activities; (ii)
design changes in Component 3 of the project to respond to Client demand and improve
implementation performance; and (iii) modification of the Results Monitoring table to improve
the outcome orientation of the indicators and to reflect the increase in target values as a result of
restructuring.


PROJECT STATUS

2.     The project has three components: (1) Access Expansion- Rural Town Electrification; (2)
Capacity Building; and (3) Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management.

3.      Key achievements to-date include:

     • Electrification of the initial 382 towns targeted under the project has made significant
       progress. All materials needed for connecting these 382 towns to the grid have been
       procured and the construction works are under way. So far, about 244 towns and
       villages have been electrified and about 24,000 new consumers (households, businesses
       and others) have been connected to the grid in these areas.
     • Construction of the 33kv network for the remainder of the target areas is scheduled for
       completion by end March, 2012, and those for additional 70 towns and villages will be
       completed by end November, 2012. All materials for the 17 planned new or rehabilitated
       substations have been secured, civil and rehabilitation works scheduled for completion
       by November 2012.
     • Significant capacity building accomplished within Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation
       (EEPCo) in the area of Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management.
     • About 6 million Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) have been installed and consumer
       acceptance has been positive. About 3.6 million additional CFLs will be distributed by
       the project.

4.      The current ratings for the achievement of development objectives and the
implementation progress are Moderately Satisfactory. EEPCo has shared its revised
implementation plan with the Bank, which has been discussed and agreed with. As the project
improves its implementation pace, according to this revised implementation plan, the rating will
be upgraded to Satisfactory.

5.      There are no outstanding audit reports, and the next audit report is due in January 2012.




                                                  4
PROPOSED CHANGES

6.       The proposed changes are: (i) reallocation of proceeds to compensate for over-
expenditures in two categories and to provide adequate funding for expanded project activities;
(ii) design changes in Component 3 to respond to Client demand and improve implementation
performance; and (ii) modification of the Results Monitoring table to improve the outcome
orientation of the indicators and to reflect the increase in target values as a result of restructuring.

Reallocations and Design Changes

7.      The original project design included the distribution of about 200,000 compact
fluorescent lamps (CFLs) under Component One of the project. Due to the very successful
implementation of this activity and the growing demand for introduction of energy efficiency and
demand side management activities, the project was restructured in December 2009 to introduce a
new component: Component 3 - Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management.

8.      The project components and activities are therefore as follows:

        Part 1. Supporting Rural Town and Village Electrification (Essentially completed;
        Remaining work underway; No design changes proposed.)

             (a) Connection of 382 rural towns and villages (with about 1,000,000 inhabitants) to
                 the interconnected EEPCo grid, including: (i) upgrading about 17 grid
                 substations; (ii) drawing sufficient power lines to electrify the towns; and (iii)
                 installation of distribution networks in the towns and villages;

             (b) Connection of at least 150,000 household and other customers in the rural towns
                 and villages electrified under paragraph (a) above;

             (c) Installation of efficient public street lighting in about 300 of the rural towns and
                 villages electrified under paragraph (a) above; and

             (d) Distribution of about 200,000 compact fluorescent lamps to customers in
                 electrified rural areas.

        Part 2. Capacity Building (Essentially completed; Remaining work underway; No design
        changes proposed.)

             (a) Provision of logistical support to the UEAP office through the acquisition of,
                 inter alia, office equipment and vehicles to strengthen capacity in areas of
                 inspection, monitoring, client support and other operational activities for
                 electrified rural towns.

             (b) Carrying out studies and provision of technical assistance, including consultancy
                 services and training

        Part 3. Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management.
        This component promotes long-term energy conservation through




                                                   5
            (a) Acquisition and distribution of about 4.6 million compact fluorescent lamps to
                customers in electrified rural areas (Proposed to increase total number of CFLs to
                about 9.6 million).

                Part 3(a) has been successfully completed. However, the corresponding
                withdrawals were made under Component one of the project rather than under
                Component 3. This resulted in an overdrawing of the proceeds for Goods under
                Component One, while the relevant allocations for Goods under Component 3
                remained unused. The proposed reallocation of funds among Goods categories
                will address this issue along with the increase in total number of CFLs.

            (b) Installation of energy efficient lamps and fixtures in about 16,000 points of street
                light systems in select urban areas. (Substantially completed, with 9000 street
                lights already purchased, and an additional 6000 to be supplied to EEPCo shortly.
                No additional fixtures needed. Therefore, target is adjusted to 15,000 in the
                Results Framework);

            (c) Installation of capacitors with total capacity of about 20 Mega Volt Ampere
                Reactive to correct system power factor (EEPCo has used its own resources to
                install capacitors at various critical load locations to correct system power factor,
                and has therefore requested that this activity be dropped from the list of IDA-
                financed project activities);

            (d) The carrying out of technical and feasibility studies (as well as pilot projects
                based on these studies) to provide more effective demand side management for
                some critical loads with a very high coincidence factor with system’s peak
                demand (This activity was subsumed under EEPCo’s installation of capacitors
                for critical loads. Therefore, EEPCo has requested that this activity be dropped
                from the list of IDA-financed project activities).

            (e) Acquisition of about 20 pre-recycling facilities for proper processing and
                disposal of mercury-containing lamps (EEPCo has requested the reformulation of
                this activity as follows: Technical support to EEPCo for the environmentally safe
                disposal of the collected incandescent lamps and/or any non-functional CFLs that
                may be collected over time.

9.      This restructuring paper is therefore requesting the approval of the Country Director for
Ethiopia to revise the targets of parts 3(a) and 3 (b), drop parts 3(c) and 3(d), and to use the
earmarked resources for strengthening of part 3(e) of the project for developing a practical and an
environmentally sound recycling operation for incandescent lamps and non-functional CFLs.

10.     The revised Results Framework is provided in Annex 1.

11.      The original budget allocations by Part and by Category, as well as the proposed re-
allocations per Category are shown in Table 1 below.
