The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from June 30, 2011 until December 31, 2012. The credit is\n            for 92.8 million SDR, from which 52.2 million SDRs have been\n            disbursed. The project is recovering now from a slow start\n            caused by procurement problems and a moratorium on\n            connections, which was lifted in September 2010. Good\n            progress has been made with 204 towns of 380 having been\n            connected; 5 million compact fluorescent lamps distributed\n            under the energy efficiency component, and much of the\n            technical assistance has been rendered. The extension is\n            necessary to allow sufficient time for completion of project\n            activities which were delayed due to procurement problems\n            and the connection moratorium declared as a result of the\n            drought-induced power crisis. The borrower has an action\n            plan in place to ensure timely completion of all outstanding\n            activities under the project. The balance of towns will be\n            electrified as per this plan."}, "docdt": "2011-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
