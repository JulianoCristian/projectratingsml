development\n            outcome was substantial; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            identification of all risks and mitigation measures is\n            critical. If the project had considered the risk of delays\n            in construction of these power plants, the Bank and the\n            Government of Ethiopia (GoE) could have discussed and agreed\n            on mitigation measures at the outset. A stalemate can be\n            resolved through a win-win solution. While the GoE imposed a\n            moratorium on new connections and did not agree to\n            restructure the project to change its Project Development\n            Objective (PDO), the Bank task team and Ethiopian Electric\n            Power Corporation (EEPCo) identified a solution that worked\n            for all. Quick growth creates capacity constraints. To meet\n            the GoE's growth vision, EEPCo grew fast, from 800,000\n            consumers in 2006 to 2 million consumers in 2009. Projects\n            must anchor ownership of technical assistance and Monitoring\n            and Evaluation (M&E) components solidly with the client.\n            EEPCo did not extend the contract of the internationally\n            recruited supervising engineer when it expired and argued\n            that all required supervision could be done by in-house staff."}, "docdt": "2013-08-28T00:00:00Z"}
