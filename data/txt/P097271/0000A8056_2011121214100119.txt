                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's development objective is to establish a sustainable program for expanding access to electricity in rural communities, thus supporting broad-based
                         economic development and helping alleviate poverty. The objective of the UEAP is to significantly expand access to electricity in rural towns and villages.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Electrification of the initial 382 towns targeted under the project has made significant progress. All materials needed for connecting these 382 towns to the grid have been procured
                         and the construction works are under way. Contracts for procurement of materials for electrification of an additional 70 towns have been signed and the materials are expected to be
                         delivered by December 31, 2011. As of this ISR, about 244 towns and villages have been electrified and about 24,000 new consumers (households, businesses and others) have
                         been connected to the grid in these areas. Construction of the 33kv network for the remainder of the target areas is scheduled for completion by end March, 2012, and those for the
                         additional 70 towns and villages are planned to be completed by end November, 2012. All materials for the 17 planned substation reinforcements/constructions were secured. All 17
