                         The project's development objective is to establish a sustainable program for expanding access to electricity in rural communities, thus supporting broad-based
                         economic development and helping alleviate poverty. The objective of the UEAP is to significantly expand access to electricity in rural towns and villages.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Electrification of the initial 382 towns targeted under the project has made significant progress. All materials needed for connecting these 382 towns to the grid have been procured
                         and the construction works are under way. The project targeted to reinforce/construct 17 substations and all materials to complete this activity has been secured. All 17 substations
                         will be commissioned before the credit closing date of December 31, 2012.

                         The project completed all the above activities well below the estimated budget and to utilize the project savings, GOE requested to extend the credit closing date to electrify an

                         specified period. Under this project, EEPCO has so far electrified about 244 towns and villages with about 24,000 new consumers (households, businesses and others) connected to
                         the grid. Construction of the 33kv network for the remainder of the target areas is progressing well.
