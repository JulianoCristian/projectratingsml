I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.     Ethiopia is one of the most populous countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and also
one of the poorest. When this project was being prepared, Ethiopia’s per capita gross
national income (GNI) was at US$160, significantly less than the Sub-Saharan Africa
average of $765.31. Although the country had abundant resources and good potential
for development, poverty was pandemic and often linked to environmental and natural
resource degradation. Approximately 44 percent of the population fell below the basic
needs poverty line in the comprehensive national survey (1999/00).

2.      During the decade preceding the project, the Government of Ethiopia (GoE)
was implementing a reform program aimed at poverty reduction through rapid
economic growth and macroeconomic stability. The program was making good
progress in poverty reduction in the 1990s, but was interrupted by the conflict with
Eritrea. The GoE resumed its efforts following the conclusion of the conflict by
developing the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP) in
2002. Despite exogenous shocks, such as the drought in 2002-2003, implementation
of the SDPRP resulted in important gains, especially on human development
indicators, transport, the investment climate, small town development, and food
security. Pro-poor spending as a share of the budget rose from 28 percent in
1999/2000 to 57 percent in 2004/05. The World Bank Country Economic
Memorandum 2006 (CEM) on Growth and Governance found that important progress
had been achieved, largely driven by improved institutions, including at regional and
local levels, which were able to deliver required services and infrastructure.

3.      In 2006, the GoE launched an ambitious new poverty reduction strategy,
called the Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty
(PASDEP). This five-year program addressed eight priorities: (i) commercialization
of agriculture and more rapid non-farm private sector growth; (ii) geographical
differentiation; (iii) population; (iv) gender; (v) infrastructure, especially roads,
energy, and irrigation; (vi) risk management and vulnerability; (vii) scaling up service
delivery to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); and (viii) employment.
Cutting across these priority areas was an emphasis on good governance, with plans to
strengthen the civil service, accelerate local empowerment, and increase transparency
and accountability.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

4.      At the time of project preparation (2005), the percentage of the population
with a connection to the electricity supply was extremely low, about 6 percent. Only
about 15 percent of the population lived in electrified areas (i.e., areas with some form
of electricity supply for residences and businesses). All electricity consumers were—
and still are—supplied by the Government-owned Ethiopian Electric Power

Corporation (EEPCo), the national vertically integrated power utility. Electricity sales
were about 1.8 terawatt-hours (TWh), which for a country of about 70 million people,
resulted in modest per capita consumption of about 25 kilowatt-hours per year
(kWh/year). EEPCo served approximately 800,000 customers, one third of whom
were located in Addis Ababa, with an electricity connection rate of about 33 percent.
In other urban areas, the electricity connection rate was 20 to 30 percent. However, 85
percent of the population lived in rural areas, mostly in towns and villages, where
electricity access rates were below two percent.

5.      The low level of access to electricity was a major barrier to economic
development and to the provision of social services in rural towns and villages.
EEPCo took significant steps to increase electricity access. For example, in the years
preceding the project, EEPCo increased the number of annual connections from about
40,000 to over 150,000. These efforts were supported by the World Bank Energy
Access Project (Credit 3712-ET). EEPCo had also been working to reduce the cost of
connections, which was identified as a barrier to entry; it successfully introduced a
credit scheme to increase access rates, notably in recently electrified rural towns.
Furthermore, efforts were being undertaken (including under the Energy Access
project) to improve the quality of service, addressing issues such as low voltage levels,
voltage fluctuations, and delays in restoring supply after breakdowns.

6.      The GoE developed an ambitious plan to expand generation to support the
expected high demand growth and to extend electricity access to the rural population
at a very accelerated pace. At the beginning of the project, total installed generation
capacity was about 760 MW, mostly hydropower based. To meet the growing demand
for electricity, at the time of preparing this project, EEPCo was constructing three
hydro-power plants with its own funds: Tekeze, with installed capacity of 300
megawatts (MW) and 980 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of firm energy; Gibe II, with
installed capacity of 420 MW and 1,500 GWh of firm energy; and Beles with
installed capacity of 460 MW. These projects were scheduled for commissioning in
2007 and 2008, respectively.

7.       The expansion of the power sector contemplated by the GoE and EEPCo at
appraisal involved approximately 43 billion Ethiopian Birr (ETB) (about US$4.5
billion) in investment over the period 2006–2011. About one quarter of this amount
was assigned to scaling up energy access in rural areas. The expansion plan put
forward by EEPCo represented the largest investment program ever undertaken by the
utility. The plan established that the GoE would make significant equity contributions
to support investments in generation, transmission, distribution, and rural
electrification that would relieve financial pressure on the utility.

8.      To sustain the increased pace of connecting new electricity consumers in rural
areas (see paragraph 5); the GoE developed the Universal Electricity Access Program
(UEAP) as a separate department within EEPCo. Establishment of this department
unlocked support from development partners, and EEPCo began raising funds to
finance its electricity access expansion programs.

9.     In 2004–2005, EEPCo enjoyed a sound financial standing. As part of the
dialogue with the GoE during the preparation of the project, the Bank stressed the
importance of cost reflective tariffs, which would further strengthen EEPCo’s


                                          -2-
financial condition to carry out needed investments. Based on the cost of supply
studies, the long-term marginal cost of EEPCo service was found to be equivalent to
US$0.06/kWh. Accordingly, the EEPCo tariff was revised in 2006, with an average
tariff of ETB 5/kWh, equivalent to US$0.06/kWh at the 2006 exchange rate.
Universal Electricity Access Program (UEAP)

10.      The UEAP program was established within EEPCo with a mandate to electrify
rural towns and villages through extension of the grid. The UEAP Office began
operations in 2005. The initial objective of the UEAP was to electrify approximately
50 percent of rural towns within five years, with a long-term goal of connecting
virtually all towns and villages to the grid within 10 years. The rural villages and
towns range in size from about 300 to 15,000 inhabitants. The estimated budget for
the first five-year period starting in 2005 was ETB 8.8 billion (about US$1.0 billion).
The joint GoE and EEPCo financing plan declared that 80 percent would be
contributed by the GoE and the remaining by EEPCo. The GoE successfully raised
funds from other development partners to finance its rural electricity access expansion
program through UEAP. Some of the prominent financiers included the African
Development Bank (AfDB), the Saudi Fund, the OPEC Fund for International
Development (OFID), the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), and the Kuwait Fund.

11.     Beneficiaries of the program included residential, commercial (shops, market
places, restaurants, hotels, etc.), and industrial customers (flour mills, irrigation
centers, water pumping, telecommunications, etc.). According to the projections,
residential customers would represent about 40 to 45 percent of the load in those rural
towns. However, the introduction of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) was expected
to lower the residential share to about 25 to 30 percent over time.

12.     Historical data from EEPCo indicated that approximately 40 percent of
potential customers in a newly electrified town would be connected in the first year.
Thereafter, the number of connections was expected to expand at 10 percent per year,
stabilizing at about 70 to 75 percent.
Rationale for Bank involvement

13.     Provision of modern energy, notably access to electricity, was viewed by the
GoE as a prerequisite to fostering economic development and social equity in both
rural and urban areas. Similarly, under the Bank Interim Country Assistance Strategy
(ICAS)2 for Ethiopia (submitted to the World Bank Board in FY06), electricity access
expansion was an important objective.

14.       The rationale for Bank involvement in this project was fivefold:

         The World Bank would provide critical financial support needed to enable
          EEPCo to effectively implement the electrification of about 400 rural towns
          over the following three-year period, particularly given the increased balance
          of payment constraints faced by the GoE;

                                                     -3-
      The Bank’s engagement provided a vehicle to support EEPCo and the GoE in
       designing and implementing the UEAP to enhance the efficiency and
       effectiveness of rural electrification activities through improved design and
       implementation modalities and policies. This support was to be provided
       through the capacity building component of the project and also through
       project preparation activities that emphasized the need for a stronger analytical
       framework, including detailed economic and financial analyses to select towns
       and improved technical standards for construction activities;
      The project provided a vehicle for a continued dialogue between the Bank and
       the GoE on key institutional, regulatory, and energy policy issues;
      Bank involvement was viewed as potentially catalytic to attract other donors.
       Several donors had expressed interest in the area of rural electrification and
       were likely to support the program, provided that the UEAP could demonstrate
       the analytical rigor and results consistent with Bank requirements including its
       safeguard policies; and
      Bank involvement in the ambitious UEAP provided a vehicle for the Bank to
       assist the GoE and EEPCo in rationalizing the scope and pace of
       implementation of the overall program, given income levels, economic
       prospects in unelectrified areas, budgetary resources and priorities, and
       balance-of-payments constraints.
Higher-level objectives to which the project contributes

15.     The original higher-level objectives of the project were as follows: “The
project will bring electricity to rural towns and villages with about 1,000,000
inhabitants who currently live in areas without any significant supply of electricity; it
will enable more than 182,000 households to have access to electricity in their homes,
and will provide businesses (including shops, artisans, flour mills) with access to
reliable and affordable electricity. This will provide enhanced income-generating
opportunities for these 1,000,000 inhabitants, support strengthened health care,
improve agricultural productivity (e.g., through improved irrigation points and more
efficient localized livestock vaccination services), and support improved education
services. Better and cleaner lighting will have a positive impact on the number of
hours available for children to study at night. Public street lighting will also improve
the quality of life and safety of the population living in these communities. Improving
the quantity and quality of electricity and other infrastructure services in rural areas is
consistent with the proposed Ethiopia ICAS, and has been an important pillar of past
country assistance strategies.”

16.     In addition, EEPCo would benefit from capacity building, logistical support,
studies, and training support from the project.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

17.     In the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) 3 the project’s development
objective (PDO) is to “establish a sustainable program for expanding access to
electricity in rural communities, thus supporting broad-based economic development
and helping alleviate poverty.”

18.     In the Financing Agreement (August 7, 2006) the phrasing is modified: “The
objective of the project is to support the Recipient’s efforts towards the sustainable
expansion of access to electricity in rural towns and villages.”

19.      The PDO, as stated in the PAD, included references to supporting broad-based
economic development and helping alleviate poverty. However, it would be difficult
to attribute results on these higher-level objectives to the project. The version of the
PDO in the Financing Agreement was focused on development objectives that the
project could be expected to influence. Therefore, this Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) is based on the PDO in the Financing Agreement.

20.      The key indicators for the project were listed on page 8 of the PAD as follows:

         (i)       Number of rural towns (including villages) electrified under the project,
                   and their aggregate population;
         (ii)      Level of consumption in these electrified rural towns;
         (iii)     Number of households connected to electricity in these electrified rural
                   towns and their aggregate consumption;
         (iv)      Number of households connected by substation;
         (v)       Number of total households that connect to the grid indirectly through
                   other customers;
         (vi)      Percentage of households using electricity for more than just lighting;
         (vii)     Number of commercial and industrial customers in these electrified
                   rural towns and their consumption;
         (viii)    Revenues to EEPCo from these electrified towns; and
         (ix)      Number of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) distributed to rural
                   households.

21.     There are significant differences between the list above (found on page 8 in
the PAD) and the tables on pages 41 and 42 of the PAD. This ICR uses the indicators
of the table on page 42 (see paragraphs 22 and 23) because it contains the targets for
results monitoring.

22.      Project Outcome Indicators:

         (i)       Total number of households connected (metered and indirect
                   connections)

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators and Reasons/Justification

24.     The PDO was not changed during the project. However, the project went
through three Level 2 restructurings, and key indicators were revised as part of the
restructurings (see paragraphs 38 and 39 below).

25.     Based on EEPCo’s performance from 2004 to 2005, having connected more
than 150,000 new consumers to the grid, this project was designed to connect about
182,000 new consumers in 382 villages and rural towns over a three-year period. At
appraisal, the risk associated with this project was considered low. The project
became effective in January 2007 and started the process of procuring construction
materials to connect the selected villages and towns to the grid network.
Commissioning of the Tekeze (300 MW) power plant, expected in 2007, was delayed.
Subsequently, impounding of the Tekeze reservoir was not completed in 2008 due to
drought. As EEPCo was implementing other projects financed by the GoE, other
donors, and the World Bank, 4 the total number of consumers increased to about 2
million in 2009, without an increase in electricity generation, and EEPCo started to
experience demand-supply imbalances and had to resort to load shedding. In order to
control electricity demand increases, the GoE imposed a moratorium on new
connections in 2009. While this decision stopped all implementation work under this
Electricity Access for Rural Expansion (EAREP) project, it helped the GoE rein in the
pace of growth in electricity demand until the new power plants came into operation.

26.     The Bank discussed project restructuring options, but the GoE was not willing
to change the PDO as it maintained that the moratorium was temporary and would be
lifted soon as the power plants under construction were expected to come into
operation within a short period. The Bank suggested including a new component to
reduce electricity demand, but the GoE wanted to wait to verify the results of the
200,000 CFL installation scheme under the EAREP before agreeing to any
restructuring. As the project closing date of December 31, 2009 approached, the GoE
asked the Bank to restructure the project by introducing a new component on Energy
Efficiency and Demand-Side Management to reduce peak electricity demand. The
Bank extended the project by 18 months to compensate for delays in implementation
caused by the moratorium, which was still in place. The first restructuring was
approved on December 15, 2009.

                                               -6-
27.     The Tekeze (300 MW) power plant came into operation in late 2009. Gibe II
(420 MW) and Beles (460 MW) were commissioned in 2010. EEPCo started to
receive electricity from the new power plants on a reliable basis and was able to meet
the current electricity demand, leading the GoE to lift the moratorium on new
connections in late 2010. While this allowed EEPCo to restart the construction of
distribution lines, the time remaining for the project was not adequate to complete the
project activities. In an attempt to rectify this, a second restructuring further extended
the closing date from June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2012. This restructuring offered
more time to complete the electrification of the intended number of villages and rural
towns.

28.     The project demonstrated significant results during this period. It installed
about 9.6 million CFL lamps, replacing an equal number of incandescent lamps. After
the implementation of about 4 million CFL lamps, EEPCo reported peak demand
reduction of 80 MW.5 Furthermore, the project supported the installation of about
15,000 energy efficient street lamps. Due to the reduction in material costs on the
international market and efficiently managed procurement, EEPCo was able to
connect about 452 villages and rural towns with grid electricity, exceeding their goal
of 382 villages and rural towns by approximately 18 percent. At the same time,
EEPCo completed the construction of 15 of 17 planned substations.

29.      In December 8, 2011, a third restructuring (i) reallocated funds to compensate
for over-expenditures in two categories and provide adequate funding for expanded
activities; (ii) changed Component 3 of the project to respond to client demand and
improve implementation performance; and (iii) modified the results monitoring table
to better reflect the outcome orientation of the indicators and the increase in target
values as a result of restructuring. Given the pace at which implementation was
progressing, it was expected that the project would achieve all targeted outcomes
within the remaining project life.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

30.     The main beneficiaries of the project were the people of the electrified villages.
In addition, EEPCo staff received capacity building assistance.

1.5 Original Components

31.    The project was originally designed with two components: (a) expansion of
access to power through the electrification of rural towns, and (b) capacity building
for more effective delivery of these electricity expansion services.

32.    Component 1: Expansion of Access - Rural Town Electrification
(US$148.23 million): The first component, expansion of access to electricity, entailed
extending the grid to connect customers in unelectrified rural towns and villages, and
had the following four subcomponents:

                                                     -7-
      a)      Connecting about 400 rural towns and villages (US$134.16 million) with
              about 1,000,000 inhabitants to the interconnected EEPCo grid, including
              upgrading 17 grid substations dispersed around the country in five
              administrative regions (the Amhara, Gambela, Tigray, Oromiya, and
              Southern regions), drawing sub-transmission lines to electrify the towns
              and erecting distribution networks in the towns (including transformer and
              LV lines).
      b)      Connecting about 150,000 household and other customers to the
              distribution systems (US$11.25 million) in the towns electrified under
              subcomponent 1(a) above, including installing meters and drop down
              wires to homes.
      c)      Installing efficient public street lighting (US$1.75 million) in the towns
              and villages electrified under subcomponent 1(a) above.
      d)      Distributing 200,000 CFLs (US$1.07 million) to customers in rural towns
              and villages electrified under subcomponent 1(a) above, as well as under
              other electrification activities.
33.   Component 2: Capacity Building (US$4 million). The objective of this
component was to create a dynamic learning environment that would enable EEPCo’s
UEAP Office to:

      a) Improve the effectiveness of electrification activities, building on the lessons
         learned; and
      b) Ensure that the benefits of electricity access were maximized for the affected
         population, particularly the poor.

34.        This component was divided into six areas of activity:
      a) Logistical Support (US$1.20 million) to the UEAP Office and EEPCo,
         including office equipment and vehicles to support inspection, monitoring,
         client support, and other operational activities for electrified rural towns.
      b) Studies and Training (aggregating US$2.8 million) for strengthened
         planning, design, and execution of grid extension to rural towns (US$, 1.80
         million), including acquisition of software and related training; development
         of a program to enhance income-generating opportunities from electrification;
         enhanced engineering supervision; and better incorporation of lessons learned.
      c) Assessment of the Barriers to Connection for Poorer Customers, and
         Evaluation of Options to Improve the Targeting of Tariff Subsidies
         (US$0.3 million) in the form of a study to determine to what extent EEPCo’s
         connection fees were a barrier and to explore mechanisms to reduce the
         financial impact on customers, thus increasing the pace of direct connections.
      d) Economic and Financial Analyses of UEAP’s Programs (US$0.15 million)
         to enhance UEAP’s economic and financial evaluations of prospective
         electrification activities.
      e) Strengthened CFL Delivery Mechanisms (US$0.25 million) to be carried
         out in coordination with subcomponent 1(d) of the project. This included a
         study to analyze modalities for the distribution of CFLs, including evaluating



                                             -8-
          the initial delivery mechanism employed under subcomponent 1(d) of the
          project.
      f) Monitoring and Evaluation Program (US$0.3 million) to conduct an impact
         evaluation of the project that served as a fiscal accountability tool that
         estimated the overall impact of the project activities, and a management tool
         that tested features of the program and provided recommendations for
         improving the design during implementation.

1.6 Revised Components

35.   After the restructuring in December 2009, the project had the following three
components:

      a) Expansion of access to electricity in rural towns;
      b) Strengthened capacity for more effective delivery of these electricity
         expansion services; and
      c) Energy efficiency and demand-side management.

36.     The new component, Energy Efficiency and Demand-Side Management, was
allocated a budget of approximately US$10 million as detailed in Annex 1 and was
funded from the unallocated category of the original project. This component had the
following five subcomponents:

      a) Acquisition and distribution of about 4.6 million CFLs to customers in
         electrified rural areas;
      b) Installation of energy efficient lamps and fixtures in about 16,000 points of
         street light systems in select urban areas;
      c) Installation of capacitors with a total capacity of about 20 megavolt amperes
         reactive (MVAR) to correct the system’s power factor;
      d) Carrying out of technical and feasibility studies (as well as pilot projects based
         on these studies) to provide more effective demand-side management for some
         critical loads with a very high coincidence factor with the system’s peak
         demand; and
      e) Acquisition of about 20 pre-recycling facilities for proper processing and
         disposal of mercury-containing lamps.

37.       The Project Outcome Indicators were revised as follows:
         Indicator One (access): Number of electricity household connections (grid
          connection) provided under the project;
         Indicator Two (access): Electricity consumption in target towns and villages

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Soundness of background analysis

39.     The project was derived from the PASDEP, the GoE’s new poverty reduction
strategy, and the ICAS, the Bank’s interim country assistance strategy. In order to
develop the Ethiopia power sector, the GoE financed investments in generation from
its own funds, raised bilateral funds to develop the transmission sector, and, in
addition to its own financing, raised funds from the World Bank and other multilateral
development partners to expand rural electrification.

40.     The UEAP Office under EEPCo was considered to be the most suitable
implementing agency given its track record over the past several years to expand rural
grid electricity in Ethiopia. From an average connection rate of 50,000 consumers,
EEPCo increased the connection rate to about 150,000 new consumers per year.
Additionally, the UEAP office was staffed with personnel with some capacity for
managing the fiduciary aspects of a project such as accounts, procurement, safeguards.
Assessment of design

41.    The project design was simple and effective. The project initially had only two
components: (a) expansion of access to power through the electrification of rural
towns, and (b) capacity building for more effective delivery of these electricity
expansion services.


                                        -10-
42.    The project planned to connect about 182,000 new consumers in 382 villages
and rural towns, within a three-year period (June 2006 to December 2009). Given
EEPCo’s average consumer connection rate of about 150,000 per year and the
advanced procurement preparation of UEAP, achieving this project target was
considered feasible.

43.    The technical assistance and capacity building component was designed to
ensure that adequate training and capacity building support would be provided to
UEAP to ensure that this program operated on a strong footing. To strengthen the
UEAP office in financial management, Bank required that the project office be staffed
with one additional accountant before the project became effective, and during project
implementation, a supervisory consultant engineering firm was hired to support
design and construction activities.

44.     Economic and financial analysis of the project showed robust results. To
ensure financial returns of the project and to ensure EEPCo operated with satisfactory
financial performance, the Bank helped EEPCo carry out a cost-of-supply study
during the preparation of the project. The GoE revised EEPCo’s tariff to the level
suggested by the study and agreed to review the EEPCo tariff annually to ensure
EEPCo’s satisfactory financial performance.
Adequacy of government commitment

45.     The GoE helped EEPCo establish the UEAP office while this project was
under preparation and contributed 80 percent of capital financing from its own budget
for rural electrification. The PASDEP, which identified infrastructure—and energy in
particular—as a priority for the Government’s poverty reduction strategy, was
approved during the same period. It was envisioned that the project would help the
GoE achieve a portion of the PASDEP targets. The GoE demonstrated its
commitment to developing the Ethiopia power sector by financing the construction of
three large hydropower plants and raising funds from bilateral sources to develop the
transmission network.

46.     Additionally, the GoE revised the EEPCo tariff to ETB 5/kWh (US$0.06/kWh
equivalent) in 2006 as recommended by the cost-of-supply study. This action
confirmed the GoE’s commitment to maintaining EEPCo’s financial viability. In
addition, the GoE agreed to ensure continued financial viability through an annual
review of its finances and revising the tariff as required. In the Bank’s view, these
actions demonstrated the GoE’s strong commitment to the energy sector and the
project.

Assessment of risk

47.     At appraisal, the overall project risk was considered low. EEPCo’s ability to
implement the accelerated pace of electrification was rated “low” even though the
PAD noted that in the years preceding the project, Ethiopia had suffered from
“unfavorable and volatile hydrologic conditions.” However, this risk was not reflected
in the risk table and was not taken into account in determining the overall risk rating.
The risk of a delay in commissioning the new hydropower plants was not taken into
account, nor was the risk related to the demand-supply gap experienced by EEPCo,


                                         -11-
which resulted from the accelerated pace of electrification and the delay in power
plant commissioning.

48.     The risks related to the financial sustainability of the utility and the financial
returns of the project were supposed to be mitigated by tariff increases that were
under consideration by the government at the time of appraisal and factored into the
project design. However, other than the tariff increase introduced in 2006, further
tariff adjustments were not introduced during the project implementation period. In
US dollar terms, due to the depreciation of the ETB, EEPCo’s tariffs were steadily
eroded and EEPCo’s financial situation deteriorated over the course of the project.

49.     The planned financial restructuring of EEPCo’s debt did not take place, which
kept EEPCo’s financing costs high. During the project, the financial covenants related
to debt ratios were revised to give EEPCo greater flexibility, in recognition of the fact
that a utility with an ambitious investment program and in an expansion phase needed
to leverage resources.

Conclusion

50.      The project was prepared based on sound analytical work and the design
responded well to the conditions on the ground in view of the GoE’s expressed
priorities. At appraisal, the GoE’s actions clearly demonstrated its commitment to
expanding rural electricity access in a financially sustainable manner and with an
appropriate institutional arrangement. Critical risks and relevant mitigation actions
were identified. However, the risk of a demand-supply gap stemming from the
accelerated pace of electrification and delay in power plant commissioning was not
anticipated at appraisal. The risk related to the financial sustainability of the utility
and financial returns of the project were contemplated, but the planned mitigation
measures were not taken by the GoE. Considering the above, Quality at Entry is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

2.2    Implementation

51.     The World Bank Board approved the project in June 2006, and it became
effective in January 2007 There was a delay in declaration of effectiveness due to
extra time required for ratification on the side of GoE. Project implementation
progressed well in 2007 and 2008.

52.     In 2008, EEPCo conducted a review to improve its rural network design and
construction method, with guidance from its supervision consultant and the Bank’s
Supervision Task Team. The supervision consultants suggested that EEPCo increase
the MV and LV line spans; erect the distribution line poles without a 4ft x 4ft concrete
foundation; and under-design the pole specifications. EEPCo carried out several tests
with the help of its consultants. Based on the test results, EEPCo realized that its
existing MV and LV line and construction method was significantly over-designed.
EEPCo decided to increase its line span and eliminate the use of a concrete foundation
for poles in most soil types, except black clay soils. EEPCo also optimized its pole
specification based on the test results. All these design and construction
improvements reduced UAEP’s line construction cost by about 30 percent on average.



                                          -12-
53.     By 2009, EEPCo had connected about 2 million consumers to the grid, which
increased the electricity demand significantly. As mentioned above, the two-year
delay in commissioning the three planned power plants created a supply deficit, and
EEPCo was unable to meet the growing electricity demand. This led to power
rationing and EEPCo had to rent emergency power of about 80 MW at a high cost to
meet the supply shortage during the years 2009–2010. EEPCo rationed supply to
industries and introduced scheduled load shedding to all consumers for about 18 hours
every other day. To slow down the growth of demand for electricity, the GoE imposed
a moratorium on new connections and stopped project procurement and line
construction work including under the Bank funded project.

54.     The project was then restructured to include a new component on Energy
Efficiency and Demand-Side Management in 2009 and extend the project until June
30, 2011. EEPCo replaced incandescent lamps with about 9.6 million CFL lamps and
installed about 15,000 energy efficient street lamps, which reduced about 180 MW of
peak electricity load, assuming each CFL reduced 38Wp of demand.

55.     The moratorium on new connections lasted from 2009 into 2010. As the new
hydropower plants started to generate electricity and added reliable electricity in the
grid, the GoE lifted the moratorium on new connections, and EEPCo restarted project
implementation near the end of 2010, although project closing was scheduled for June
2011. The GoE therefore requested an extension of the credit closing date, seeking
adequate time for EEPCo to implement the project components. The Bank granted the
project an extension until December 31, 2012.

56.     During the 2010–2012 period, EEPCo connected about 452 villages to the grid
network, exceeding the initial target of 382 villages. The implementing agency took
advantage of savings realized in the first round of procurement to significantly expand
beyond the target the number of rural towns and villages to be electrified. The funding
for expansion of the number rural towns and villages in the main came from lower-
than-expected prices for goods procured using international competitive bidding and
lower metal prices due to the global recession. The depreciation of the ETB and the
strengthening of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency exchange rate contributed
to substantial savings under the project.

57.    When EEPCo was preparing to start connecting consumers under the project,
the GoE instructed EEPCo to use local materials for its projects to support
development of local industries. It required that EEPCo procure electric meters from
the recently established public enterprise, Metals and Engineering Corporation
(MetEC);6 however, when MetEC failed to begin production of meters, EEPCo again
experienced implementation delays. The Bank requested that the GoE allow EEPCo
to source meters from other qualified manufacturers, and in late 2012, the GoE
allowed EEPCo to purchase from other sources and EEPCo began connecting
consumers under the project. In December 2012, the GoE requested that the Bank
extend the project closing date to allow EEPCo to complete the project components,
but given the challenges and the overall energy sector portfolio performance issues,


6
    Reported in the mid-term (portfolio) review (March 5–23 and April 17–20, 2012).




                                                       -13-
including EEPCo’s institutional capacity, finances, and policies, the Bank decided to
allow the project to close on its scheduled date. Even though the dialogue with the
Government on these issues was progressing reasonably well, it was unlikely that the
project would have achieved the development objective in the short term.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and
Utilization

58.     The PAD sets out a comprehensive M&E framework that complied with Bank
requirements, and an early aide memoire (August 4, 2006) has a very substantial
outline and discussion of EEPCo’s M&E activities as part of the project. The results
matrix was streamlined, and new intermediate outcome indicators were introduced
through project restructurings to ensure better measurement of project outcomes.

59.     The PAD described how the UEAP office would coordinate with other EEPCo
departments to collate indicators semiannually. However, the UEAP was not
successful in establishing a system for the adequate and timely collection of
information from the Sale and Construction Department. During the supervision
phase, the quarterly progress reports were not submitted by UEAP office on time and
lacked adequate information.

60.     While the GoE appreciated the value of M&E across all projects, regardless of
financer or sector, it initially questioned the value of deploying scarce resources for
M&E activities in the manner envisioned by the Bank and other donors. The Bank
Task Team often discussed with EEPCo and the GoE the value of M&E activities and
impact assessments. In 2011, EEPCo informed the Bank of its interest in conducting a
study to assess the socioeconomic impact evaluation of rural electrification. The Bank
Task Team helped EEPCo finalize the terms of reference and conduct a budget
estimate. EEPCo obtained the GoE’s approval on the estimated budget in late 2012
and requested that the Bank review its draft Request for Proposal to select a suitable
consulting firm to carry out the assignment. As the remaining time for the project was
not sufficient to select consultants and complete the study, the Bank and the GoE
agreed to support this study under the Electricity Network Reinforcement and
Expansion Project (ENREP) (P119893).

61.     The Bank carried out an impact evaluation of CFL bulb distribution in
Ethiopia, in coordination with EEPCo. EEPCo supported the study by providing the
detailed consumption pattern of the selected consumers, both before and after
installation of the CFL. The working paper measured the impact of introducing CFLs
by replacing incandescent lamps in Ethiopia.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

62.    The project triggered two safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment
(OP/BP/GP 4.01); and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). EEPCo developed and
publicly disclosed a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) in accordance with World
Bank requirements.



                                         -14-
63.     EEPCo implemented the project in accordance with the disclosed
Environment and Social Management Framework and the Resettlement Policy
Framework. Rural lines were constructed within the existing right-of-way of rural
roadsides. When electric lines cross houses or private land, EEPCo followed the
required minimum clearance above ground and from buildings. The project planned to
upgrade 17 substations, 15 of which were renovated within the existing area of the
substations. Two substations were required to be expanded beyond their physical
boundary, triggering the RPF. The Bank Task Team is assisting EEPCo with
developing a framework and establishing an operation for the recycling of
incandescent lamp and CFLs following international standards. The Task Team
introduced an intervention to address the potential hazards arising from broken,
discarded, and worn-out CFL bulbs (which contain mercury). Work on this is being
carried out through a separate grant from the Energy Sector Management Assistance
Program (ESMAP).

Fiduciary Compliance

64.     Procurement Management: EEPCo is a major procuring entity in Ethiopia,
but the procurement legal framework and procurement institutional arrangements
remained a challenge in EEPCo. Sustaining procurement capacity was challenging,
mainly due to the high staff turnover. Procurement activity is less mainstreamed in
EEPCo than other institutions, such as the Ethiopian Roads Authority. Decisions on
procurement are centralized and most procurement packages in the EAREP were
approved by the EEPCo Board. There were delays in forming tender committees for
specific assignments and, as mentioned below, difficulties were encountered with
reporting procurement decisions to the Bank. Quick and fair resolution of
procurement complaints was challenging and usually resulted in delays. While there
were no cases of mismanagement, internal administrative and governance issues
caused persistent delays of up to six months. EEPCo expressed dissatisfaction on
occasion with the speed of clearances given by the Bank.

65.     As EEPCo’s operations involve procurement and administration of very large
contracts, EEPCo’s institutional arrangements need to consider procurement a major
strategic and professional activity and mainstream procurement activities accordingly.
EEPCo has recently benefitted from appointing an internationally experienced
Procurement Advisor to ensure the quality of procurement documents and provide on-
the-job training to EEPCo project staff. This consultant also helped EEPCo adopt a
procurement manual to streamline procurement activities. The cost of this advisor is
financed by the EAREP II.

66.    EEPCo has requested that the Bank consider the following activities to build
the procurement capacity of the borrower and implementing agency counterparts:

       (i)    Share a selected portion of the Bank’s intranet with the client to allow
              the client to review how the Bank reviews other procurement cases.
              Such arrangements could be restricted to the regional or country level
              and may help clients understand the Bank’s procurement procedures.




                                        -15-
       (ii)    The Bank may provide a Web page for clients to post questions related
               to procurement and view responses to frequently asked questions
               (FAQ).
       (iii)   Client Connection should allow clients to review the status of Special
               Commitments application.
67.     Financial Management: EEPCo’s financial management system had been in
distress for a long time. In 2006, EEPCo introduced a computerized accounting and
billing system, but all consumer data was not imported properly into the system
database. As a result, EEPCo had been unable to match its accounts and ledger and
had to manually close accounts. EEPCo’s audit was consistently submitted after the
due date and with qualification from auditors. The same qualifications were repeated
in subsequent audit reports without EEPCo having rectified the issues. EEPCo’s
project planning and budgeting were consistently weak. The quality of Interim
Financial Reports (IFRs) varied from quarter to quarter. The accounting system
functioned adequately at the project level, but at the corporate level demonstrated
significant problems, especially in interfacing with the billing system.

68.     In early 2012, as part of identifying the major issues within EEPCo ’s financial
management system and chronic governance issues, the Bank initiated a timely
assessment of EEPCo’s financial management status and governance procedures. This
study identified several issues, including the interface problem between EEPCo’s
billing and accounting systems. As a result of this study and continuous dialogue by
the Bank Task Team with EEPCo management, EEPCo restructured its financial
management and accounting team and agreed on a time-bound action plan, which the
Bank monitored biweekly. As a result of these efforts, the quality rating of the IFRs
had improved by project closing. EEPCo has also agreed to install an enterprise
resource package (ERP), consisting of 12 independent modules, that will integrate
data within EEPCo’s accounting, billing, procurement, human resources, store
management, operations management systems Installation of ERP and associated
training will be financed by the ENREP (P119893).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

69.    The project connected 452 villages (18 percent above target), but it connected
far fewer than the targeted number of consumers due to constraints affecting the
supply of meters. As EEPCo started to secure meters from local manufacturers, the
pace of connection increased. EEPCo is financing the cost of meters from its own
resources and can easily continue to buy locally as per the Ethiopia Federal
Procurement Act. It is therefore likely that the project will connect its targeted
consumers, albeit with some delay.

70.      The Bank has adopted a programmatic development approach to rural
electrification and access expansion in Ethiopia. In 2002, the Bank approved the
Energy Access Project (P049395) that closed on June 30, 2013. Then in 2006, the
Bank supported the first Electricity Access for Rural Expansion Project (EAREP)
(P097172), which closed on December 31, 2012. EAREP II (P101556) was approved
in 2007 and will close on November 30, 2013. The most recent project to support
access expansion in Ethiopia was approved in 2012—the Electricity Network
Reinforcement and Expansion Project (ENREP) (P119893)—which became effective


                                         -16-
in January 2013. Routine supervision of these existing projects will ensure the Bank’s
follow-up and verification of the number of connections that will eventually be made
under the EAREP villages and towns.

71.     In the past, EEPCo was reluctant to acknowledge and accept support from the
Bank to improve its operations and management capacity, despite the fact that a lack
of capacity seriously impairs the ability of the utility to maximize results under the
project. This has been a key focus of the Bank’s dialogue with the utility. In recent
years, there has been significant movement on improving operations and management
of the utility. Under the EAREP II, EEPCo appointed a Procurement Advisor who
helped EEPCo staff manage procurement activities, provided on-the-job training, and
communicated with EEPCo’s corporate level executives to discuss the governance
challenges facing procurement. This has significantly improved EEPCo’s
procurement performance on current projects. EEPCo supported the Bank to carry out
“Just-in-Time” study on EEPCo’s fiduciary accountability system and corporate
governance, which identified existing bottlenecks and offered recommendations for
removing them. The ENREP is implementing those recommendations and financing
technical assistance to enhance EEPCo’s management capacity. A Generation and
Transmission Master Plan is also financed under EAREP II and will improve
investment planning and prioritize actions to strengthen the sustainability of
electricity delivery in areas electrified under the project and beyond. Finally, sector
work is planned for fiscal year 2014/15 to further support policy dialogue with the
GoE on the energy access strategy and improvement of utility operation and
management in a context of rapid growth. The Bank’s next phase of engagement with
the GoE in the electricity sector is under way.
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

72.      Project objectives were and are still highly relevant. The project’s PDO is
consistent with the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for fiscal years 2013–
2016 and Ethiopia’s Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) for fiscal years 2010–
2015. Electrification of rural Ethiopia continues to be a priority of the GoE and well
within the Bank’s priorities for its cooperation with Ethiopia. Many more towns and
villages remain to be electrified and the majority of Ethiopians are still not living in
electrified areas.

73.     The project design was simple and effective. The project focused on
increasing electricity connections by expanding the grid network to rural villages.
Expansion was very successful; however, connections to consumers were not carried
out as planned because of factors outside the control of the Bank and EEPCo, in
particular insufficient power generation capacity, increased demand for electricity,
and government policies. As a result, the project lost its momentum and did not
achieve its intended outcomes.

74.   The Bank and EEPCo restructured the project to introduce and expand a
component on Energy Efficiency and Demand-Side Management. Through this
component, the Bank financed installation of about 9.6 million CFLs and about




                                         -17-
15,000 energy saving streetlamps. This component alone has helped Ethiopia reduce
its peak load demand by about 180 MW.

75.     The technical assistance component was well designed, but EEPCo did not
take full advantage of it because the GoE was concerned about the cost of training and
capacity-building activities and undervalued the benefits significantly. EEPCo would
still benefit from accessing training and capacity building and ought to adopt M&E
systems to improve its practices.

3.2         Achievement of Project Development Objectives

76.     The analysis reveals overall Moderately Unsatisfactory achievement of project
development objectives. This reflects a disconnect with the Moderately Satisfactory
rating of the progress toward development objectives in the final ISR dated July 2012.
Given EEPCo’s demonstrated capacity to connect 150,000 consumers annually, the
Bank Task Team and EEPCo were hopeful that the pace of connections would
substantially increase as the GoE had relaxed its decision regarding sole sourcing of
meters. However, this did not happen.

77.     The main performance indicator of the project was to expand electricity access
to 182,000 consumers. The project only reached 17,371 consumers, but it expanded
electricity to 452 villages, exceeding its target of 382 villages by 18 percent. As
EEPCo continues to connect consumers through its UEAP program and is supported
by other rural electrification projects financed by the World Bank, it is expected that
eventually, the PDO to electrify rural towns and villages with a total of 1,000,000
inhabitants will be reached, and the expected number of 182,000 consumers will be
connected within the villages.

78.      The technical assistance component was important to enhance EEPCo’s ability
to better design and implement its rural electrification program. The GoE, in all
projects across sectors was concerned about the cost of training and capacity building
activities and undervalued the benefits significantly. EEPCo and the Ministry of
Energy only accessed around 25 percent of the available funding for training,
technical assistance and capacity building despite many opportunities to engage.
However, with growth of the power sector came new challenges, and the GoE has
now realized the cost of not improving the capacity of the implementing agencies. It
has therefore requested adequate technical assistance support under the new ENREP
(P119893).

79.     The CFL component, which was expanded (from 200,000 to 9.6 million), was
a significant success, with a substantial impact on the power system of the country. It
was the subject of a publication7 from the World Bank that analyzed the intervention
on the basis of the deployment of 350,000 CFL bulbs, which, according to the
methodology applied, resulted in a reduction of the peak load of 7.2 MW and the
assessed effect of expanding to 9.6 million CFLs results in a 180 MW reduction.
EEPCo also conducted their own analysis and produced results similar to those of the

World Bank. However, this success did not contribute directly to achieving the PDO
because these were not revised.

3.3      Efficiency

80.     The economic and financial analyses of the project are detailed in Annex 3.
The table below summarizes the results of the economic and financial analysis of the
project with and without the impact of the CFL component. The calculations assume
10 hours of CFL use per day, based on the results of the survey conducted on CFL
users in EEPCo. In Annex 3, the sensitivity analysis is performed for: (i) less use of
bulbs per day, (ii) reduced savings per bulb (from 38 watts to 20 watts), and (iii) the
case of both reduced use per day and less savings per bulb. Table 3 in the Annex also
tests the impact of the growth rate in connections being reduced by 50 percent.

81.      Given these results, the overall efficiency for the project (substantial economic
efficiency and low financial efficiency) is rated “moderate”: (i) the economic and
financial rates of return of the project exceed those originally forecast in the PAD
with the CFL component; (ii) the efficiency results with the CFL component are
sensitive to the usage of the CFLs, yielding robust economic rates of return even at
lower usages, but negative financial returns; and (iii) the financial returns of the
project are negative without significant CFL savings (this is mainly due to the low
tariffs that prevailed during the project period compared to the assumptions in the
PAD).

82.     The benefits are based on the number of consumers connected by the project
and the associated consumption levels. As noted in previous paragraphs, the project
overachieved on the number of villages/towns to be electrified during the project
period. The analyses incorporate the connections that are realizable given the
infrastructure already established in the 452 villages/towns electrified by the project.
The projections on the number of connections are based on EEPCo’s actual planning
data and calculated annual growth rates. The actual consumption levels observed were
much higher than originally estimated for both residential and industrial consumers
(for example: 74 kWh/month 8 vs. 27 kWh/month for residential and 3,100
kWh/month9 vs. 800 kWh/month for industrial in the base year) and partially mitigate
the effect of lower number of connections realized.



8 The estimate in the PAD is 27 kWh and 74kWh is the actual number observed by EEPCo for the base year 2007.
9 The estimate in the PAD is 800 KWh and 3,100 kWh is the actual number observed by EEPCo for the base year
2007.




                                                   -19-
83.     The restructuring of the project to include the Energy Efficiency and Demand-
Side Management component as a response to the supply shortages and involving the
distribution of the 9.6 million CFLs significantly enhanced the economic as well as
the financial rates of return of the project. Each CFL bulb is estimated10 to result in a
savings of 38W leading to an accumulated generation cost savings (economic) of
about US$ 401 million (financial cost savings are about US$ 226 million at current
low tariff) over eight years. The analysis accounts for the rebound effect which
estimates that after 18 months, 20 percent of the initial savings dissipate.

84.     The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project over a 30-year
period is 52 percent, reflecting the large generation cost savings of the CFL program,
which distributed 9.6 million CFLs compared to the 350,000 CFLs planned at the
project start. The EIRR of the project at design was 14.9 percent. With sensitivity
analysis, reducing the usage of the bulbs from ten to four hours a day (average
number used in an EEPCo study), the EIRR is still robust but lower at 23 percent.
Without the CFLs, the EIRR of the project at 14 percent is comparable to the original
estimated EIRR of 14.3 percent (also without CFLs).

85.      Sensitivity analysis was undertaken for the project, including scenarios with
reduced CFL usage and savings benefits as well as a reduced growth rate for the
connections. Tables 2 and 3 in Annex 3 present the detailed sensitivity analysis.
Reducing the use of CFL bulbs to two hours per day still results in an EIRR of 15
percent and a net present value (NPV) of US$104.10 million. Reducing the savings
per bulb from 38 watts to 20 watts reduces the EIRR and the NPV, but these figures
are still better than the base case in the PAD. With half the growth rate projected in
EEPCo planning scenarios, the EIRR stays robust at 51 percent and the corresponding
NPV value is US$216.09 million.

86.     The methodology for the financial analysis is similar to the economic analysis
and differs in the following ways. The financial analysis (i) incorporates the taxes
associated with the investment costs; (ii) is based on the tariff structure in place over
the project life; (iii) includes the cost recovery from CFL consumers; (iv) includes the
recovery from consumers on connection expenditures; and (iv) uses the financial cost
of energy supply.

87.     The financial rate of return (FIRR) of the project is 12 percent, largely owing
to benefits from the demand-side management component involving CFL distribution.
The original FIRR forecasted was 13.1 percent. With the sensitivity analysis for the
CFL component, reducing usage to four hours a day from the base case of 10 hours a
day, the project yields a negative NPV of US$74.1 million. The NPV calculated for
the project without incorporating the CFL benefits is negative US$121.24 million
(compared to the original NPV forecasted of US$10 million, also without the CFL
benefits).

88.   Sensitivity analysis, as shown in Tables 2 and 3 in Annex 3, illustrates that if
the number of hours of use of CFLs is reduced, the NPV of the project worsens.

                                                   -20-
Interestingly, a reduction in the growth rate actually improves the FIRR and the NPV
for the project, suggesting a negative effect of lower tariffs on the project.

89.     The negative financial NPV of the project without CFLs is due to the
significantly lower tariffs that prevailed during the project period. The tariff increases
estimated at the time of project design did not materialize as projected. For further
analysis, the FIRR without CFLs was reproduced with the original tariff assumptions
and is significantly higher at 25 percent, owing to higher consumption levels. Tariff
revisions are expected to take place in the future and are not factored into the current
analyses. As these revisions take place, the FIRR of the project is expected to improve.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

90.     The combination of high relevance, moderately unsatisfactory achievement of
PDOs, and moderate efficiency leads to an overall outcome rating of Moderately
Unsatisfactory. The core outcome indicator of the project was to connect about
182,000 new customers in 382 villages, consuming about 54GWh per year. The
project was extended for three years and at closure had connected 17,37111 consumers
in 452 villages, consuming about 19GWh per year. EEPCo and the Ministry of
Energy did not take full advantage of planned technical assistance activities. These
shortcomings were hard to overcome even in the face of the impressive results of the
CFL component.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

91.     Due to the low number of consumers currently connected, it is still too early to
measure any major poverty reduction, gender equity, or social development impacts
as a result of the project.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

92.     During the implementation of this project, EEPCo went through a cycle of
transformation. Even though needed technical assistance activities were included in
Component 2 of the project from the start of project implementation, EEPCo and the
Ministry of Energy questioned the value of engaging in capacity-building activities
such as M&E, impact evaluation, procurement system strengthening, financial
management strengthening, and safeguards management strengthening. By the end of
the project, EEPCo had realized the value of these capacity-building activities and
requested that the Bank support a socioeconomic impact assessment study, a
Procurement Advisor and a series of procurement trainings, and a study of EEPCo’s
financial management status and governance procedures. As EEPCo was unable to
implement these activities under the EAREP, it is using the other projects supporting
the Ethiopia energy sector to carry out these activities. It is expected that once these

     21,173 connections at the time of ICR mission in May, 2013.




                                                       -21-
capacity-building activities are properly concluded, EEPCo will become a stronger
institution. However, as a result of its initial weak commitment, EEPCo and the
Ministry of Energy only accessed around 25 percent of the available funding for
training, technical assistance, and capacity building.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

94.         None.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

95.     Assessing the risk to the development outcome entails gauging the risk
associated with (i) sustaining the infrastructure in place and (ii) achieving the targeted
number of household connections. The project delivered tangible infrastructure
investments in Ethiopia. Distribution lines have a long useful technical life when
properly maintained. EEPCo needs to have access to funds for the upkeep of the
newly constructed lines and associated infrastructure and to commit resources for
manpower, equipment, staff, and spare parts. The Bank’s support improved the
capacity of operations and maintenance teams; however, EEPCo must have adequate
financial resources to sustain the operational cost of rural grid-based electrification. In
essence, this means that the tariff system in the country should take into account the
increasing number of rural customers that EEPCo will service. At present it is unclear
whether, both through tariff adjustments or by other means, the GoE will address
EEPCo’s needs for funds to maintain rural grids and to connect consumers to the new
lines built under the project.

96.     The second risk relates to whether the expected outcome of 182,000 household
connections will be realized. EEPCo was unable to achieve the project target outcome
for household connections due to the moratorium and meter procurement restrictions
previously mentioned. As the GoE has now permitted EEPCo to procure meters from
other qualified local manufacturers, EEPCo should be able to connect consumers in
the electrified villages. The ICR mission in May 2013 found that the total number of
consumers within the project villages had increased to about 21,173 from the 17,37112
noted at project completion. It is therefore possible that the project will achieve the
outcomes after project completion.

97.    A further consideration is that there are significant delays in energizing lines
and connecting consumers. The ICR mission discussed with UEAP whether such
delays may lead to vandalism and theft and was informed that this problem is rare in
the country.

98.    Given the problems encountered during project implementation, combined
with the concerns related to non-cost reflective tariffs since 2006, leading EEPCo

12
     An increase of 4,802 connections between December 31, 2012 and May 2013.




                                                     -22-
toward a precarious financial situation, the risk to development outcomes is assessed
to be “significant.”
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

99.    The project design was simple and easy to execute. In 2009, the Demand-Side
Management (DSM) subcomponent was expanded to respond to urgent sector
challenges regarding a shortage of power.

100. A comprehensive economic and financial analysis was conducted and
technical alternatives explored. The design adequately considered social development
needs, poverty alleviation, and environmental and social aspects and included
arrangements for monitoring and evaluation, implementation support, and risk
mitigation.

101. The quality of the analysis and the relevance of proposed activities would have
merited a Satisfactory rating. However, the risk that the hydropower plants under
construction may not come in operation as scheduled was not considered and other
possible delays were also not identified. The analysis had assumed that tariff
adjustments and financial restructuring of EEPCo would take place. Although
fiduciary risks were identified (paragraph 71), interventions to address those risks
were agreed with the GoE only in 2012. This causes the rating to fall to Moderately
Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

102. The Bank took a programmatic approach to developing electricity access in
Ethiopia. During the lifetime of this project, EEPCo was also implementing five other
projects funded by IDA, GEF, and GPOBA. All these projects were managed by the
same Bank Task Team, and to ensure consistency, projects were supervised through
combined missions and combined supervision documents. This approach helped the
Government to understand how EEPCo was implementing the overall Bank portfolio
and how one decision could affect the overall implementation pace.

103. The combined missions, as reported in aide memoires, focused on
procurement issues and delays in disbursements. In EEPCo’s project completion
report, it partially attributed some of the procurement delays to slow responses from
the Bank. While there were delays in clearing procurement packages by the Bank,
inadequate quality of documents submitted by EEPCo, contributed to the delays in
receiving no-objections.

104. When project implementation stopped due to the moratorium on new
connections, the Bank Task Team convinced the GoE to restructure the project to


                                        -23-
include the Energy Efficiency and Demand-Side Management component. However,
given the GoE’s determination to keep the consumer connection targets as originally
designed, the team could not restructure the project development objectives and its
core performance indicator.

105. When the GoE instructed EEPCo to only procure meters from MetEC, project
implementation stopped once again and the Bank Team discussed reversal of this
decision with different units within the GoE. The team successfully reversed the
decision, but it was too late to capture the benefit under the project. However, even
after the closing of the credit, EEPCo continues to procure meters from different local
manufacturers and continues to connect new consumers within the project villages. It
is expected that EEPCo will achieve the 182,000 consumers in the project villages
unless other unexpected challenges emerge.

106. Considering the achievements and initiatives above, the quality of Bank
Supervision is considered Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

107. Because of its moderately satisfactory performance in ensuring quality at entry
and during supervision, the Bank’s overall performance is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

108. At the outset, the GoE strongly supported the project and made counterpart
resources available to the UEAP as agreed. The GoE, however, introduced a number
of uncertainties that greatly constrained EEPCo and project implementation.

109. To mitigate the demand-supply crisis caused by the delayed commissioning of
three large hydropower plants, the Government imposed a moratorium on new
connections that stopped the project procurement process. Through the Bank Task
Team’s continued interventions, EEPCo agreed to continue with project procurement
and backbone line constructions, without connecting end consumers and energizing
the distribution lines. As a result of this decision, EEPCo was able to connect more
villages than originally planned.

110. Unfortunately, when the moratorium was lifted and EEPCo was preparing to
complete its consumer connection drive, the GoE enforced a policy of supporting
domestic industries and advised EEPCo to procure all electric meters from the newly
established public enterprise, MetEC. During subsequent supervision missions, the
Bank underscored the risk to the project outcomes in terms of the quality, reliability,
and timely delivery of the meters needed to make the connections to households.
Despite the GoE’s assurances, MetEC was unable to manufacture meters for EEPCo


                                         -24-
within the promised timeline. As a result, EEPCo was unable to connect the targeted
number of consumers under the project. Discussion between the GoE and the Bank
led to the GoE agreeing to allow EEPCo to procure meters from other local
manufacturers, and EEPCo started to receive meters and restarted consumer
connections. In the first four months after the project closed, EEPCo connected about
4,802 new consumers.

111. If the GoE had been flexible in allowing EEPCo to procure meters using
project funds, EEPCo would have been able to utilize the full credit amount. It would
have also been able to connect the targeted number of 182,000 consumers instead of
only 17,371, resulting in benefits to EEPCo from revenue from connections and
consumers connected to the electricity grid. This would have taken the GoE a step
closer to its Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) targets.

112. Furthermore, since 2006, the GoE has denied EEPCo a tariff revision. As of
now, EEPCo’s average tariff remains ETB 5/kWh (equivalent to about US$0.03/kWh
as of the 2013 exchange rate). As this tariff is far below EEPCo’s cost of supply,
EEPCo is unable to meet its operating and financing costs from its revenue, placing
the utility in a precarious financial situation.

113. While the GoE gave full support to the project development objectives, the
restriction it imposed on project implementation resulted in the project performance
indicators not being achieved and cancellation of a significant amount of project funds.
Hence, borrower performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

114. Notwithstanding the delays resulting from the decision to procure meters from
MetEC and the two-year moratorium on new connections, EEPCo performed
reasonably well overall. EEPCo is committed to an ambitious electrification program
for Ethiopia. Its project implementation unit, UEAP, assured continuity, although the
project coordinator for this project changed several times. EEPCo and the Bank Task
Team responded swiftly to the need for the demand-side management component.

115. An M&E system was never implemented and reporting of M&E data during
the project was ad hoc at best. The ICR suffered from the scarcity of data.

116. The project ran into no reported issues concerning safeguards, but reporting
was fairly erratic. Procurement issues were a constant factor during implementation
and appear to be a systemic issue for the entire portfolio of projects that the World
Bank has with the GoE. Since December 2012, high-level discussions with EEPCo
and the GoE involving senior management of the Bank are ongoing to resolve
impediments to progress in the implementation of the portfolio.

117. A Procurement Advisor financed under EAREP II is currently helping EEPCo
to streamline its procedures, but high-level governance issues related to the speed of
implementation have not been addressed with the urgency that the World Bank
suggests that the issues deserve.



                                         -25-
118. It was consistently very difficult to have EEPCo release staff for training,
causing EEPCo to miss opportunities to access training offered through the project.
Significant training programs on topics ranging from the intricacies of the Bank’s
fiduciary systems to procurement could have been accessed.

119. EEPCo has electrified 18 percent more villages and rural towns than planned.
Moreover, EEPCo successfully implemented the demand-side management response
with the Bank Task Team and thus the rating for the implementing agency is
Moderately Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

120. While acknowledging that the project is likely to eventually facilitate more
connections than planned, it is clear that the project suffered from significant
problems as reflected in the outcome rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory (see Section
3.4). Furthermore, since Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory
and Implementing Agency Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, overall
borrower performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.13

6. Lessons Learned

121. Identification of all risks and mitigation measures is critical. The PAD
highlighted that the large hydropower plants under construction will ensure sufficient
supply to support sustainability of the GoE’s electricity access program. If the project
had considered the risk of delays in construction of these power plants, the Bank and
the GoE could have discussed and agreed on mitigation measures at the outset. As it
was, time was lost during project implementation devising a strategy for continuing
project implementation under the constraints.

122. A stalemate can be resolved through a win-win solution. While the GoE
imposed a moratorium on new connections and did not agree to restructure the project
to change its PDO, the Bank Task Team and EEPCo identified a solution that worked
for all. Through restructuring the project, a new component on Energy Efficiency and
Demand-Side Management was introduced, allowing EEPCo to install about 10
million CFLs and 15,000 energy efficient street lamps. As a result of this, EEPCo
reduced its peak load demand by about 180 MW.

123. Quick growth creates capacity constraints. To meet the GoE’s growth
vision, EEPCo grew fast, from 800,000 consumers in 2006 to 2 million consumers in
2009. However, it was challenging for EEPCo to adapt its organization accordingly,
in particular to establish the level of capacity to manage this increased business. As a

   Implementation Completion and Results Report Guidelines. OPCS, August 2006 (Last Updated on 10/05/2011):
“When the rating for one dimension is in the satisfactory range while the rating for the other dimension is in the
unsatisfactory range, the rating of overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory if Outcome is
rated in the unsatisfactory range.”




                                                      -26-
result, EEPCo failed to close its accounts on time, kept the system loss at a standard
level, and maintained inefficiency in billing and collection from rural consumers.

124. Projects must anchor ownership of technical assistance and M&E
components solidly with the client. The project failed to implement the technical
assistance and M&E component as EEPCo lacked ownership of these components.
This significantly jeopardized the sustainability of gains in a low-capacity
environment.

125. External supervision adds value. EEPCo did not extend the contract of the
internationally recruited supervising engineer when it expired and argued that all
required supervision could be done by in-house staff. Given the expansion of
EEPCo’s overall portfolio, this resulted in gaps in supervision of work and inadequate
M&E documentation. For future projects in Ethiopia, the Bank needs to stress the
value of maintaining independent supervision.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

126. The comments of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development
(MOFED) on the ICR are found in Annex 7. The main observation is to put the policy
decisions in the context of Ethiopia’s rapid growth and reconsider the rating of the
Government’s performance. The ICR acknowledges the constraints and points raised,
but maintain the rating to be consistent with the criteria defined in the ICR guidelines.

127. EEPCo requested access to other Bank procurement cases and their outcomes
to gain knowledge of procurement to further develop its internal procurement capacity.
The Bank welcomes this interest and urges EEPCo to take full advantage of the
Procurement Advisor appointed under EARAP II and send staff to procurement
training arranged by the Ethiopia Country Office. It should also be noted that sharing
internal deliberative exchanges on ongoing procurement processes is not in line with
the provisions of the World Bank Policy on Access to Information.

                            Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       Economic analysis: The economic benefits, as analyzed below, are based on
the number of consumers connected by the project and the associated consumption
levels. The analysis incorporates the planned connections that are expected to be
realized over the subsequent years (up to 2030) after the project closing date in the
452 villages/towns electrified during the project lifetime. The projections for number
of consumers to be connected are based on the planning data provided by EEPCo for
electrification of new villages/towns nationally in the next 25 years. The projections
for the first 5 years were used for a realistic estimate of the annual growth rate and
also to account for the fact that in the project villages that are already electrified the
intensification results in higher connection rates.

2.      The analysis is based on metered consumption as consumption of indirect
customers is captured through the direct customers from whom they purchase
electricity. The actual consumption levels were much higher than originally estimated
for both residential and institutional consumers (for example: 74 vs. 27 kWh/month
for residential and 3100 vs. 800 kWh/month for industrial in the base year) and
partially mitigate the effect of lower number of connections realized in the early years.

3.      In addition to the connections, the economic analysis incorporates the benefits
of the CFL distribution undertaken as part of the demand-side management
component introduced in the restructuring of the project as a response to the shortage
of supply. These benefits are accrued from the energy savings resulting from the
replacement of incandescent light bulbs with CFLs. The benefit analysis of the CFL
distribution is based on the recent impact evaluation of the pilot program undertaken
by the World Bank. 14 The benefits in energy savings from the distribution of the
350,000 lamps as planned in the original project is extrapolated to analyze the benefits
of the distribution of about 9.6 million lamps successfully completed by the project to
date.

4.      For the analysis, costs include the actual project costs for investments for grid
extension, street lighting, and connections as well as the costs of the CFL distribution
program. Cost of energy supply comprises additional costs and included the long-run
marginal cost of generation and O&M for transmission and distribution. Benefits are
evaluated at the residential, commercial, and industrial Willingness-to-Pay estimated
at the project design for comparable analysis. As noted, the benefit analysis for the
CFL distribution is drawn from the assumptions and evaluation presented in the
referred impact evaluation study. Each CFL bulb is estimated to result in a savings of
38 watts leading to an accumulated generation cost savings of about US$ 401 million
over 8 years, including technical losses and assuming a 5 year lifetime for the bulbs.
The analysis accounts for the rebound effect which estimates that after 18 months, 20
percent of the initial savings dissipate.

5.      The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project over a 30 year
period is 52 percent reflecting the immense generation cost savings of the CFL
program which distributed 9.6 million CFLs compared to the planned 350,000 CFLs
at the time of project start. The EIRR of the project at design was 14.9 percent. The
sensitivity analysis for the CFL component, wherein the usage of the CFL bulbs is
reduced to 4 hours per day (from 10 hrs./day – assumption in the referred evaluation
paper), results in a significantly lower EIRR of 23 percent and generating savings of
US$ 160.5 million. As illustrated further in Tables 2 and 3 in this Annex, reducing the
use per day lowers both EIRR and NPV values, but at no point do they become lower
than the figures given in the PAD. Moreover, reducing the savings per bulb from 38
watts to 20 watts is also not sufficient to bring the numbers below the base case in the
PAD. Halving the growth rate in new connections has a marginal impact on the EIRR.

6.      Without the CFLs, the EIRR of the project at 14 percent is comparable to the
original estimated EIRR which was 14.3 percent in the PAD.

7.      Financial analysis of the project. The methodology for the financial analysis
is similar to the economic analysis and differs in the following estimations: The
financial analysis (i) incorporates the taxes associated with the investment costs; (ii) is
based on the tariff structure in place over the project life period; (iii) includes the cost
recovery from CFL consumers; (iv) includes the recovery from consumers on
connection expenditures; and (iv) uses financial cost of energy supply.

8.      The financial rate of return (FIRR) of the project is 12 percent, again largely
owing to benefits from the demand-side management component involving the CFL
distribution. The original forecasted FIRR was 13.1 percent. With the sensitivity
analysis for the CFL component, reducing usage to 4 hours a day from the base case
of 10 hours a day, the project yields a negative NPV of US$ 74.1 million with US$ 90
million in generation cost savings. As expected lower usage of bulbs reduces the NPV.
Reducing the growth rate in connections improves the FIRR and the NPV, reflecting
the burden on EEPCo of new connections when tariffs are low. Please refer to the
results and sensitivity analysis in paragraph 12.

9.     The NPV calculated for the project without incorporating the CFL benefits is
negative US$ 121.24 million (compared to the original forecasted NPV of US$ 10
million, also without the CFL benefits).

10.     For the financial analysis, the negative NPV of the project, in general, is due
to the significantly lower tariffs that prevailed during the project period. The tariff
increases estimated at the time of project design did not materialize as projected. For
further analysis, the FIRR without CFLs was reproduced with the original tariff
assumptions and is significantly higher at 25 percent, owing to higher consumption
levels. Tariff revisions are expected to take place in the future years and are not
factored in the current analyses. As these revisions take place, the FIRR of the project
is expected to improve.

       Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

    Comment on draft ICR by Ministry of Finance and Economic Development
     (MoFED) on draft ICR of the Electricity Access Rural Expansion Project

Ethiopia is on a path of transformation unparalleled in its recent history. The underlying
sustained and rapid economic growth coupled with the expansion of social services
created various challenges and opportunities for the country to further speed up the
development process. Such transformative processes come up with rapid changes on the
situations on the ground thereby requiring adjustments in every aspect of the
development program.

The issues evaluated under the Borrower Performance in the draft ICR, in particular the
assessment of the Government's Performance, should have been seen in light of the
changing dynamics exhibited in the country. The fact that government promoted
industrialization or measures which support local private business development should
not be seen as 'introducing uncertainties by the government. Similarly, the introduction of
moratorium on new connections was necessary given the increasing demand for
connections while investment on generation capacity was expected to soon fill the gap. It
will be eye opening to ask what if EEPCo continued with expansion with new connection
at the time.

Similarly, when a country emerges from a situation of a huge cement shortage to a stance
of many-fold increase in the capacity of the cement production potential, it is rational
government policy to encourage domestic manufacturing to benefit from the supply of
concrete poles from local sources. The same reasoning goes for the issue of producing
meters.

It is also important to highlight that due to unforeseen circumstances, some delays or
disruptions have pushed back the time frame set for completing certain activities of the
project. However, given the overall purposeful development policy the government has
continued to follow and the broad-based positive achievements the country witnessed in
the energy sector and beyond, it appears very narrow perspective to rate government
performance as moderately unsatisfactory, based on a short-term consequence of a
visionary approach to development of the sector and the country at large.

    The Government of Ethiopia (GoE) and the World Bank (IDA) signed on 14 August
    2006, the loan agreement for the implementation of the Electricity Access Rural
    Expansion project I
   As per the project appraisal document, the project comprises the following two
    components: (a) Access Expansion – Rural Town Electrification (b) Capacity Building
    for more effective delivery of these Electricity Expansion Services. The Access
    Expansion – Rural Town Electrification components includes the following
    subcomponents’: Connecting about 382 rural towns (and villages) Connecting about
    150,000 house hold and other customers to the distribution systems, installation of
    efficient public Street lighting, including installation of meters and drop down wires to
    homes, Distribution of 200,000 compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) to customers. The
    Objective of the capacity Building component is to create a dynamic learning
    environment that will enable the UEAP office to:(i) improve the effectiveness of
    activities, building the lesson learned; and (ii) ensure that the benefits of electricity access
    are maximized to the affected population, particularly the poor. Generally the capacity
    building effort includes the following: (a) Logistical Support (2) Studies and training.

    The overall project activities were designed to be implemented under the following two
    categories’:

    A, Procurement of materials and equipment for construction of distribution network and
    upgrading of 17 substations.
    This procurement is supply only and was being carried out with International
    Competitive Bidding procedure (ICB).

    B, Construction of distribution network for 382 rural towns/villages and upgrading of 17
    substations, which are dispersed in the different regions of the country, these include:
    Amhara, Oromiya, Tigray, SNNP, and Gambela.
    The works part was being carried out by local electromechanical contractors and
    EEPCo’s own task team respectively.



                                                 -44-
With the loan amount that was left over after procuring distribution items required for the
electrification of three hundred eighty two towns, procurement was conducted for the
electrification additional seventy towns; this brings the total towns to be electrified under
the project to four hundred fifty two (452).

Project supervising consultant, Hifab Oy (Finland), commenced his work by mid of
march 2008.Amongest the many activities that were undertaken by the consultant the
major ones include the following: Preparation of bidding documents, Planning and
integrating all the project activities, Supervision of construction works, approval of
contractors’ drawing and documents, quality control, Factory testing and inspections,
Certifying payments, On job training of EEPCo’s counterpart staff and reporting. The
Consultant’s Resident Engineer stayed in Ethiopia continuously almost until the end of
his assignment Dec 30, 2010.

In the course of project implementation two large sum Substation supply contracts were
signed for the upgrading works of the seventeen substations under two lots. The shipment
of most of the items for the two contracts was done within the delivery schedule except
minor delays on few of the items. There is no as such any construction delay that was
caused due to delay in shipments.

Furthermore twenty two contracts were signed for the supply of distribution items. Out of
these total contracts a substantial delay is observed on four contracts as a result a
liquidated damage was levied on these contracts amounting to 0.8MUS$. The liquidated
damage amount on each of these two contracts is mentioned under the procurement
section of these reports.

Apart from the above contracts, two concrete pole supply contracts, one impregnated
wooden pole supply contract, two vehicles contracts, one supply of printers and
photocopiers were signed with different suppliers. A significant delay in shipment was
observed on two vehicle contracts, due to this the own force construction activities were
severely affected, this led EEPCo to levy a liquidated damage on both of the vehicles
contract. The liquidated damage amount that was applied on each of these contracts has
been included in the procurement section of this report.

Two contracts were signed for extension works on the seventy substations, with EEPCo’s
own task team on August 2010.The supervision of both Civil and electromechanical
works was attend by two civil and one electromechanical supervisors of Electricity
Access Rural Expansion project I after the completion of HiFAb Oy consultancy’s
service. In this connection it is worth mentioning that HIFAB was not much involved in
the supervision of the constructions works as the commencement in the construction
work is very close to completion date of the consultancy service.
Up until this time with the exception of the two substations: Melkawakena and Hormat,
the expansion work on the fifteen substations were commissioned on the dates specified
against the respective substations as shown in the table below.




                                            -45-
The very fact that the seventy substations are widely dispersed over the different regions
of the country has largely contributed towards the observed delay in the commissioning
activities of the substations. Further to this the very centralized establishment of EEPCo’s
own task team and none availability of EEPCo’s own task office in each of the regions,
where the seventeen substations were being constructed has exacerbated the delay.

The status of the seventeen substations under Electricity Access Rural Expansion project
I is shown under Annex 10

The construction of MV and LV network for the four hundred fifty two towns was being
under taken by UEAP’s own task team, Seventeen local Electro Mechanical contractors,
who were selected and awarded contracts based on a given sets of prequalification
criteria. In the same vein the fact that the UEAP’s own task team is centralized and not
having an office nearby each of the rural towns might have contributed to the delay.
Added on to this the fact that flat rate prices’ are not revised over a certain interval of
time might be another probable reasons for the observed delay.

To date on average close to 400 house hold were connected to the distribution systems.
The root cause for the lesser number of connections might be tied up with one or more of
the following reasons: Firstly EEPCo has stopped the procurement of energy meter over
the last two or more years. Secondly EEPCo’s Sales capacity is not going at equal pace
with the pace of rural electrification.

The total project budget was 97Million SDR (1 SDR = 1.47 US$ = 12.83 ETB) (May
2006, Appraisal Report 2006).
