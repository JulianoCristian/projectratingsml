Notes:
1) The International Children’s Digital Library is the largest international collection of children’s books in the world that is freely available
online. The digital library software is a proprietary one from University of Maryland, USA.
2) Association of Mongolian Publishers is the only entity identified that is qualified to prepare the catalogues and carry out the book fairs.
3) The Education Evaluation Center (EEC) is a legal entity with 100% state ownership under the management of the Ministry of Education,
Culture and Science (MECS) and the only institution in the country that is mandated to carry out education evaluation. Its participation is
essential and critical to the successful implementation of the project. Therefore, although EEC is a dependent agency of MECS,
exceptionally it will be hired on SSS basis to provide consulting services for the project.
