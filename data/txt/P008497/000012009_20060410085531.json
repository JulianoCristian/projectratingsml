Notwithstanding this amendment to the loan\n            agreement is intended to allow the use of project cost\n            savings, and of unallocated funds under the Loan, to finance\n            the development of nutrient removal facilities at the North\n            Budapest wastewater treatment plant. The proposed activity\n            is fully consistent with the Project Development Objective\n            of the Loan, which therefore remains unchanged. During the\n            successful implementation of the original components, cost\n            savings of EUR 3.3 million, or 12 percent of the total Loan\n            amount, were realized because competition resulted in lower\n            unit prices than estimated at appraisal. Efficient\n            procurement management and contract supervision by the\n            Project unit of the Municipality of Budapest contributed to\n            these positive results. The cost savings are not the result\n            of contract cancellation. In addition to these savings, the\n            unallocated funds (EUR 2.6 million or 9.4 percent of the\n            total Loan amount) were not used. To this end, and given\n            satisfaction that the proposed amendment complies with the\n            Articles of Agreement of the Bank, it is recommended the\n            Loan Agreement be amended accordingly."}, "docdt": "2006-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
