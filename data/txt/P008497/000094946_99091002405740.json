Wastewater Project for\n            Hungary aims to reduce the pollution in the Danube River\n            Basin; strengthen the Borrower's compliance with\n            Hungarian and EU environmental standards; and improve\n            wastewater operations in the water and wastewater utilities\n            of the Borrowers. This project comprises a component for the\n            Municipality of Budapest and one for the Municipality of\n            Dunaujvaros. The first-named component expands and upgrades\n            two wastewater treatment plants and constructs a trunk main\n            system in an unsewered area of Budapest. One of the\n            wastewater treatment plants upgrades will include added\n            nitrogen and phosphorous removal and biogas recovery. Upon\n            project completion it will meet European Union effluent\n            standards for sensitive waters. The technical assistance\n            provided will carry out a study of industrial tariffs, solve\n            an odor problem, and prepare a study on the regulation of\n            industrial wastes and the enforcement of standards. The\n            second component comprises a new primary and secondary WWTP\n            with sludge stabilization and biogas recovery designed to\n            meet EU standards. Stormwater overflow facilities in the\n            collection system and pumping station upgrading. Technical\n            assistance is included to study alternatives for operating\n            completed facilities and the feasibility of using sludge to\n            reclaim slag deposits."}, "docdt": "1999-08-18T00:00:00Z"}
