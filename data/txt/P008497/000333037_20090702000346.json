Some lessons\n            learned included:  the mid-term review carried out in\n            January 2003 identified substantial savings under the Loan\n            to the Municipality of Budapest. The Bank agreed to the use\n            the savings for additional project-related investments,\n            including the upgrade of the North Budapest Wastewater\n            Treatment Plant (WWTP). However, the feasibility studies,\n            designs and procurement processes for these new investments\n            were time consuming requiring extension of the project\n            closing date in order to complete implementation. Bank\n            approval for the use of savings towards new investments\n            within a project under implementation should not only cover\n            the technical and other Bank eligibility criteria but also\n            include a comprehensive assessment of the implementation\n            period from design to commissioning for the investments. The\n            contract for the tertiary treatment upgrade of the North\n            Budapest WWTP included the schedule of payments to the\n            contractor. This contract was submitted to the Bank for\n            review and no-objection to the award of the contract was\n            given. However, just prior to the project closing, the last\n            withdrawal application for payment to the contractor was\n            rejected on the basis that the works were not executed and\n            the goods not delivered prior to the project closing date.\n            It is therefore imperative that during the contract approval\n            processes, procurement and disbursement aspects are properly\n            coordinated to prevent similar recurrences."}, "docdt": "2009-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
