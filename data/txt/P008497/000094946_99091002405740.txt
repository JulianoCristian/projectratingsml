A: Project Development Objectives
1. Project development objectives and key performance indicators (See Annex 1):
The development objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) reduce the pollution load in the Danube River
Basin; (b) strengthen the Borrowers' compliance with Hungarian and EU environmental standards; and (c)
improve wastewater operations in the water and wastewater utilities of the Borrowers.
Key performance indicators for measuring the project's success in meeting their development objectives are: (i)
increase in volume of wastewater treated; (ii) reduction in contaminants discharged on average and during peak
flow periods; and (iii) financial indicators for the OCs responsible for operation of the completed services.
Implementation progress will be measured primarily by Bank Loan disbursements. The Project Implementation
Plan includes benchmarks for these indicators.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goals supported by the project (See Annex 1):
CAS document number: 17257-HU. Date of latest CAS discussion: January, 1998.
The project is consistent with Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy. The primary objectives of the Strategy
are to help Hungary sustain its recent economic recovery and to support the country's efforts to join the EU -
Hungary's driving political, economic and social objective for 1998-2000. As one of the requirements for its
accession into the EU, Hungary will have to progressively put into place and enforce environmental standards
that are consistent with those of the EU. The costs of installing and operating the additional facilities needed for
compliance with EU environmental directives are substantial, with annual costs ranging from 1.7% to 4.5% of
Hungary's 1997 GDP'. To help the Government converge with EU environmental standards in a scenario of
greater fiscal discipline and constrained resources, the Bank plans to support the development of a phased, least-
cost approach to meeting EU environmental directives.
Investment in additional wastewater facilities, particularly treatmnent facilities, is by far the largest aspect of
compliance with the EU environmental directives for Hungary. The Bank recommends a least-cost compliance
strategy that concentrates on improving service in the larger urban areas, and is linked with reform of local
government finance and administration. Infrastructure investments to be supported by the Bank, including in the
water and wastewater sector, would be linked to EU accession-related programs with policy linkages or
municipal/regional development programs that are supported with sub-sovereign lending mechanisms.
The Government of Hungary, in dialogue with the EU and others including the Bank, has guided resources
towards investments that are local and/or national priorities (in the case of this project, the improvement of water
quality in the Danube Basin) and which also help Hungary move towards EU environmental compliance. The
Government's use of EU grant co-financing, and the choice of settlements with adequate economies of scale in
sewage collection and treatment, ensure that the project is part of the least-cost strategy for meeting the EU's
Urban Wastewater Treatment (UWWT) directive. Finally, the govermnent's requirement that local governments
initiate and partially fund such projects is consistent with the objective of restructuring public finance and
strengthening local government.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Water supply in Hungary generally functions well. Water service levels are high, ownership and management in
the sector has been decentralized to the local governments, and most tariffs reflect the cost of service. The
principal government objectives in the sector are: (i) to close the gap between water supply coverage, and
wastewater collection and treatment; (ii) keep water and wastewater services affordable; and, (iii) to comply with
EU standards in order to meet the EU requirement for accession. The issues the Government faces in meeting
these objectives are:
Excluding industrial pollution control costs. These estimates, from a draft background paper for the forthcoming CEM, assume
investment costs spread evenly over 20 years, and a real discount rate of 7%.



Page 3
Availability of Financing: In the past, investment in new construction was a Government responsibility. Some
targeted grants still are available, but these sources are diminishing, consistent with the Government objective of
local government financial self-sufficiency for provision of urban services.
Effluent Standards: Effluent standards are currently set without regard to cost. Municipalities unable to
comply with the standards have difficulty in obtaining construction permits for partial measures, e.g., the
construction of a primary treatment plant as a first step when secondary treatment is required to meet the
standard. Standards encouraging prioritized and phased investments are needed so that scarce resources can be
allocated to maximize benefits.
Private Sector Participation (PSP): Experience with PSP in Hungary has been limited. While there have been
six interventions by private sector operators, a major difficulty has been the inexperience of the local
governments in designing and contracting PSP. Without established guidelines or precedents, negotiations
between local governments and private firms have consumed inordinate time and effort, and risked ad-hoc
contracts that may not adequately reflect the interests of all parties - local governments, private investors,
employees, and most critically, water and wastewater service consumers. Regulatory capacity also needs to be
developed.
Operating Subsidies: The Government continues to provide price support subsidies to communities with high
operating costs. Although not large in terms of the total cost to the government budget (US$2 million equivalent
in 1999) or the number of beneficiaries (150,000 or 1.6% of the population), the subsidy design does not provide
appropriate incentives for OCs to be accountable to rate-payers or to control costs. Instead of reimbursing OCs
for the excess of their operating costs over a national tariff ceiling, a less distortionary subsidy would be a direct
targeted payment by the Government to low income consumers in the affected areas.
Fragmentation: The number of water supply and wastewater OCs in Hungary increased from 33 (28 county
and 5 regional) in 1992 to over 200 currently, as municipalities opted to establish their own OCs. The
Govemment is appropriately concerned that this fragmentation is resulting in inefficiencies which increases the
cost of service.
Regional Water Companies: There are five regional water companies in Hungary owned by the Government.
Initially, these companies were established as suppliers of bulk water to supplement sources of local water
companies owned by the municipalities. The local water companies have maximized the use of local resources
and draw on the regional systems only to meet peak demands. Because the tariff systems of the regional
companies do not include a demand charge, their revenues have dropped and they are no longer profitable.
Options for the future of these companies will have to be identified and a policy established.
Industrial Wastewater Tariff Structures: The typical tariff structure for industrial wastewater in Hungary is
based on volume. No consideration is given to the contaminant load and the fact that the cost of wastewater
treatment is more dependent on the concentration of the contaminants than the volume being treated. In order to
more equitably distribute the cost of wastewater treatment among the beneficiaries of wastewater collection and
treatment, utilities will need to implement new industrial tariff structures based on contaminant levels.
Governament Strategy: The Government's strategies for meeting its objectives have been to: (i) transfer
responsibility for investment in urban infrastructure, including water and wastewater, from the central
govemment to the local govemments; (ii) encourage investment in wastewater collection and treatment by small
targeted grants and provide its guarantee for long term financing; (iii) make more grant resources available for
investment by gradually phasing out operating subsidies; and (iv) encourage private sector participation (PSP).
Because the benefits of wastewater treatrnent do not all accrue to the population that is directly affected, some
assistance from the central budget can be justified. Without the targeted grants, construction of wastewater
treatment plants would most likely be delayed for many years.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project supports the Government's objectives of closing the gap between water supply coverage and
wastewater collection and treatment, and by moving towards compliance with EU environmental standards by
supporting the Government's 23 Cities Program. The project has assisted the Government in mobilizing grant



Page 4
resources from the EU which will co-finance the project through its Large Scale Infrastructure Facility (LSIF) in
the case of Budapest, and the Copenhagen Initiative in the case of Dunaujvaros. The LSIF requires the presence
of an international financial institution (IFI). Without the Bank's participation, EU Phare grant financing would
not have been available. The EU Phare Grant for Dunafijvaros was not contingent on World Bank participation;
however, the Bank's presence was helpful in getting Government support to assign the EU Phare grant for the
Municipality. By complementing the available local resources and those contributed by EU Phare, the project
would fill the long term financing gap for undertaking environmental improvement investments in the sensitive
Danube Basin, consistent with the goal of reducing the gap between availability of piped water and wastewater
services. The only important policy issue to be addressed by the project is the industrial tariff issue through
technical assistance to the Municipality of Budapest. A similar study was considered for Dunauijvaros but
determined not to be necessary on the basis that there are no industrial wastes being discharged into the sewerage
collection system stronger than the domestic waste. The implementation of contaminant-based tariffs in
Budapest, if successful, could be replicated where relevant in other Hungarian Water and Sewerage Companies.
Originally, the Bank proposed a national component that would address the issues of effluent standards, PSP,
operating subsidies, fragmentation and the future of the regional water companies by providing technical
assistance for the preparation of a series of policy papers on each. The recommendations would then serve as the
basis for a follow-up project. A policy paper was produced on the effluent standards issue during project
preparation under terms of reference prepared by the Bank and financed with a grant from the EU Post Dobris
Fund.2 However, at appraisal, the national component was dropped at the request of the Government.
C: Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2for a detailed description and Annex 3for a detailed cost breakdown):
The project comprises two components: one for the Municipality of Budapest and one for the Municipality of
Dunauijvaros. The two components will be financed by separate loans to each Municipality. The project
investments comprise only a part of each participating municipality's water supply and wastewater investment
program. In each case the Bank evaluated the entire program to ensure it was balanced, and financially and
technically feasible. A summary of project costs and Bank financing by Component is in Table 1.
Budapest Component: This component comprises expansion and upgrading of two wastewater treatment
plants (WWTPs) and the construction of a trunk main system in an unsewered area of Budapest. The WWTPs
are the North Budapest WWTP and the South Pest WWTP. The South Pest WWTP upgrading will include
additional nitrogen and phosphorous removal and biogas recovery. Upon project completion, it will meet EU
effluent standards for sensitive waters. The North Budapest WWTP expansion is an interim phase of a master
plan for complying with EU standards within the next 10 years. The trunk main system is in North Buda and
will make it possible for an existing population of 19,000 now on septic tanks to be connected to the system.
Technical assistance is included to carry out a study of industrial tariffs, solve an odor problem at the North
Budapest WWTP, and prepare a study on the regulation of industrial wastes and the enforcement of standards.
Budapest has agreed to carry out the tariff study not later than June 30, 2001, review the results with the Bank
not later than September 30, 2001, and implement the findings and recommendations agreed with the Bank
beginning January 1, 2003.
Dunaujvaros Component: This component comprises a new primary and secondary WWTP with sludge
stabilization and biogas recovery designed to meet EU standards. Also included is reconstruction of stormwater
overflow facilities in the collection system and pumping station upgrading.
Technical assistance is included for studies of (i) alternatives for operating the completed facilities, and (ii) the
feasibility of the use of sludge from the new WWTP to reclaim slag deposits at the Dunai Vasmiu steel plant and
a closed land fill site.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
Tlhe project will support environmental improvement that is consistent with the Government's policy of
decentralizing responsibility for the provision of water and wastewater services to local governments. It will
encourage them to undertake the necessary investments to expand wastewater collection, treatment and disposal
in order to reduce the gap between the provision of water supply and wastewater services, with due regard for
environmental standards. The project will help Hungary in its move towards accession into the EU by
supporting a least-cost compliance strategy emphasizing prioritization and phasing of environmental investments
by local governments.
3. Benefits and target population:
Benefits: The overriding importance of the project investments stems from their contribution to the EU
accession program. The project will move Hungary closer to compliance with EU standards, and demonstrate
the government's commitment to EU accession. The environmental benefits of the project include a significant
reduction in discharges of untreated sewage to the mainstream Danube. While immediate improvement of
downstream water quality will not be substantial because of the magnitude of the Danube flow and pollution
from other sources, treating wastewater from large urban areas is an essential part of the Environmental
Management Program for the Danube River Basin. More immediate environmental benefits will accrue from (a)
the expansion of the South Pest plant, which will remove the largest source of pollution in the sensitive Rackeve-
Soroksar-Danube Branch (RSDB), an important recreational area for Budapest; and (b) the protection of a
valuable groundwater source in North Buda.
Target Population: Beneficiaries of the wastewater collection and treatment improvements under the project
would be the Hungarian population at large, through eventual membership in the EU, and improved water
quality in the Danube Basin. Residents in the Budapest area will be beneficiaries of the improved quality of the
RSDB for recreational purposes. They will also benefit from the increased protection of groundwater in North
Buda. Technical assistance under the project would finance two studies related to the collection and treatment of
industrial wastewater in Budapest. One would be a tariff study to determine new structures that equitably assign
costs between domestic and industrial consumers, and the other study would propose alternatives for improving
the regulation of industrial wastes and the enforcement of effluent standards. Both studies would benefit
domestic consumers in the Budapest metropolitan area by ensuring that that they are not subsidizing the cost of
treating industrial wastes under the current tariff structure and that industrial consumers are not harming the
environment under existing industrial waste regulation and enforcement procedures.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation Period: January 1998 to June 2006
Executing Agencies: The Budapest and Dunauijvaros components will be implemented by the respective
Municipalities through their Development Departments. Both municipalities have established Project
Implementation Units (PIUs) with full-time directors.
a. Budapest Component. During the construction phase, the Municipality of Budapest will work in
close collaboration with the Budapest Metropolitan Sewerage Company (BMSC), which will manage the assets
upon commissioning. The Municipality's PIU has overall responsibility for the Project and will manage the
financing, including disbursement of the Bank loan and reporting to the Bank. The PIU has contracted with
BMSC to be the construction manager for the project and to be responsible for physical implementation. The
BMSC technical staff will act as managers. The field supervision and technical control will be carried out by the
consultants who prepared the designs.
b. Dunauijvaros Component. The Municipality of Dunauijvaros will be responsible for the project during
the construction phase, through its Development Department and the PIU. Options for the operation of the new
plant are under consideration, and funds for a study of these options are included in the project. The
Municipality currently owns a joint-stock holding company, Dunaqua-Therm Company (DTC), with four limited
liability subsidiaries, one of which, the Dunauijvaros Water Supply and Sewerage Company (DWSSC), operates
and maintains the Municipality-owned water supply and sewerage systems. In regard to operation of the new
WWTP to be constructed under the project, the Municipality will determine whether the operator should be
DWSSC or a new company to be established for the purpose, on the basis of a study to be prepared under terms
of reference satisfactory to the Bank, not later than June 30, 2000. The PIU will handle all aspects of the project
with its own technical staff and the engineering consultant staff who prepared the designs and bidding
documents.
Project Financial Management Systems (FMS): The FMSs in place in the two Municipalities utilize a legal
and standard chart of accounts; the budgeting and planning systems are regulated by law; and the books are
maintained by external accounting finns. The key actions needed to complete the systems are expected to be in
place prior to loan effectiveness and include: (i) finalization and adoption of the chart of accounts, and issuing of
an accounting manual of procedures and internal control guidelines; (ii) appointment of auditors whose
qualifications and experience are acceptable to the Bank; (iii) reinforcement of the PIU human resources; and
(iv) improvement of analytical systems, including the testing of the Project Management Report (PMR).
Disbursements from the Bank's loans would initially be made according to the traditional system
(reimbursements with full documentation and against Statements of Expenditure [SOEs], and direct payments)
and would be converted to the new procedures (based on PMRs) after the assessment of the financial
management systems, and certification that the new PMR systems are operatiaig satisfactorily. The target dates
for this conversion are December 1, 1999 for Budapest and June 30, 2000 for Dunauijvaros.
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements: After conversion to the new project FMS, quarterly PMRs to be
prepared by the municipalities will describe: (a) project progress, including variances between actual and
forecast physical and financial progress; (b) financial statements including sources and uses of funds and updated
six-month cash forecasts, Special Account reconciliation statements, and cash withdrawal statements; (c)
procurement status and contract commitments; and (d) the latest values of the project monitoring indicators.
Both Borrowers have agreed to monitoring indicators which are included in Supplemental Letters to the legal
documents and in the Project Implementation Plans (PIPs) for both projects. The Borrowers will also prepare
Mid-Term reports for review with the Bank in 2002 and Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) for
submission to the Bank within six months of Loan Closing.
Project Implementation Plans (PIPs): PIPs have been prepared by the municipalities with Bank assistance.
The target project completion dates are June 30, 2004 for the Dunauijvaros component and June 30, 2005 for the
Budapest Component. To allow a contingency for unexpected delays, the project completion date for both
components has been established in the Loan Agreements as June 30, 2006. The loan closing date proposed for
both loans is December 31, 2006. Because of the advanced state of preparation, the commitment of the



Page 7
Borrowers and the experience of the implementing agencies and the availability of counterpart funds, both
components are expected to be completed by the target completion dates. To further ensure smooth
implementation, it has been agreed that the Bank would carry out a Mid-Term Review of the Project in
cooperation with the Borrowers by December 31, 2002. The Borrowers have agreed to submit a report to the
Bank integrating the results of the monitoring and evaluation activities, and the progress achieved in carrying out
the Project prior to the Mid-Term Review.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Project Scope and Lending Arrangements: During the long period of preparation (1994 to present), several
project alternatives were considered and rejected. Unchanged through the whole process was the concept that
the project should support the GOH's program to achieve full treatment of wastewater discharges from
Hungary's 23 county level cities and Budapest. What did change were the project objectives, the lending
arrangements and the participating municipalities.
An original objective of the project was the identification of actions for eliminating constraints to sector
development and fostering sustainability in the areas of financing, regulation and organization. To meet this
objective, the project included a national component that would have addressed all of the sector issues described
in Section B: 2 - availability of financing, effluent standards, private sector participation, operating subsidies,
fragmentation and the viability of the government-owned regional water companies. The Ministry of Transport,
communication and Water Management (MTCWM), the responsible ministry, was, however, unwilling to
assume responsibility for the studies and the GOH was unwilling to borrow for them. Based on this lack of
support, the national component was dropped from the projects and the objectives revised accordingly.
However, one of the studies, addressing the effluent standards issue, was implemented during preparation. The
Bank prepared the terms of reference and was instrumental in obtaining EU financing, and the Ministry of
Environmental Protection and Regional Policy carried out the study. The objective of the study was to develop
new legislation and water quality standards that would allow investments in water quality improvement to be
undertaken on a priority basis. World Bank sector work on EU accession and the environment in 1997-98 also
addressed this issue. The recommendations of both studies are now undergoing debate in the Government.
The original concept for Bank lending to the sector and the project was to create an investmnent fund financed by
the Bank and managed by the MTCWM. Interested qualified municipalities could apply for both a loan from the
fund and a grant from the Government. The Bank would have financed both the loans and the grants. This
alternative was rejected by GOH because it did not want to be the borrower. In the end it was agreed that the
Bank would lend directly to the interested municipalities with a govermment guarantee. Once this was decided,
the Bank proposed lending to the water and sewerage OCs; however, GOH insisted that the municipalities be the
borrowers because they were the owners of the systems being improved, and they alone had assets suitable for
providing a counter guarantee.
The potential number of participating municipalities were 16 of the 23 county-level cities and Budapest which
were in need of sewage treatment capacity. Based on an evaluation of the degree of interest shown and the
extent of preparation already carried out, EU Phare made funds available to six municipalities (Debrecen,
Dunau1jvaros, Szeged, Szekesfehervar, Bekeshaba and Szolnok) for the carrying out of feasibility studies to
assess the viability of the operating companies (OCs) and their projects. The Bank obtained a Japanese PHRD
grant for a seventh municipality, Eger. The project was initially envisaged to cover all seven municipalities,
with Budapest (with relatively larger investments) to follow separately. During project preparation, all except
Dunaujvaros decided to proceed with alternative arrangements. Szeged was able to obtain private financing as a
result of its concession agreement with Generale des Eaux, a French investor and operator of water companies.
Debrecen, Szekesfehervar, Szolnok and Eger decided to take advantage of a European Investment Bank (EIB)
credit line available at a lower cost than the Bank loans but with a shorter term. Bekeshaba only needed a plant
upgrade; but decided that it could not afford any new investment. Meanwhile, the Municipality of Budapest
decided to go ahead with the upgrading of two of its sewage treatment plants and asked to join the project. The
Bank agreed.



Page 8
Project Implementation Arrangements: Originally, the Bank proposed that the projects be implemented by
the OCs. However, as both municipalities have units with experience in project implementation; and both
municipalities will be the owner of the assets, they elected to implement the projects rather than give the
responsibility to their OCs. Both OCs will have a role in project implementation. In Budapest, the OC will
manage the physical implementation and the Municipality will be responsible for the financial management. In
Dunauijvaros, the Municipality will be responsible for both physical implementation and financial management;
however, their OC has been consulted on the design and will be consulted on the construction.
Engineering Alternatives: The Budapest component has undergone intensive study over the last decade.
Budapest has had a master plan for twenty years, which it has updated every two to five years. This plan deals
mainly with the configuration of the collection system and the number, location and phasing of the sewage
treatment plants. The proposed project is consistent with the current and earlier master plans which included the
expansion and upgrading of the two existing wastewater treatment plants in the project-the North Budapest
WWTP and the South Pest WWTP. Feasibility studies were undertaken during project preparation that
compared various technical alternatives for meeting the effluent requirements. In the case of the South Pest
plant, not only were alternative processes compared but alternative discharge locations were also considered.
The existing discharge is to the RSDB, an enclosed body of water that is subject to eutrophication. The cost of
moving the discharge point to the mainstream Danube was compared with the cost of a higher level of treatment
at the existing discharge point. The results showed the higher level of treatment was the least-cost solution.
The alternatives for the Dunauijvaros component were more limited. The configuration of the collection system,
land availability, and the results of the environmental impact assessment fixed the location of the plant. In order
to select the most cost-effective process design, the Municipality opted for a turn-key approach with a two-stage
bidding process. Process designs were submitted in the first stage bidding, and those found acceptable after a
technical review by the Municipality's consultant were allowed to participate in the second stage price
competition.
2. Major related projectsfinanced by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing and
planned):
This is the first Bank-supported project in the water and wastewater sector in Hungary. EIB is financing ongoing
sewerage projects in Debrecen, Szolnok and Sz6kesfehervir through a credit line available through local
commercial banks. The credit line is available for all types of municipal infrastructure projects, including water
and wastewater. The credit line is attractive because it is denominated in HUF, conditionality is minimal, and
the procurement requirements are less stringent than the Bank's. So far, these projects have been successful in
meeting their objectives.
3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The proposed loans will be the first Bank operation in the sector in Hungary. Bank sector experience in other
countries has been that most projects were successful in meeting physical objectives and achieving least-cost
solutions. In the relatively few cases where physical objectives were not met, cost overruns required project
components to be dropped; overruns were more the result of unanticipated inflation and delays in construction
rather than inadequate estimation of base costs. However, success in achieving strong and financially viable
institutions has been limited, and projects have often fallen short of meeting institutional, financial, and technical
efficiency objectives. A contributory factor has been the lack of commitment of local governments.
For this project, no major problems are expected in fulfilling the physical objectives as the main contracts have
already been signed and construction progress has been good. The adequacy of design has been assured through
the engagement of qualified consultants; and avoidance of construction delays will be assured through the use of
qualified contractors, effective project monitoring and supervision by the PIUs, and the Bank's proactive
supervision. On the institutional side, lending to the sector in Hungary was initiated after the decentralization of
responsibility from the central Government; and local government commitment is not anticipated to be a
problem for the project (see Section D.4 below). Under the project, institutional strength and financial viability
are expected to be provided through the existing (in the case of Budapest) and the potential (in the case of
Dunaiujvaros) involvement of an experienced private sector investor in the OCs.

4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
GOH is committed to the EU accession process, and is very much aware of the pre-eminence of municipal
wastewater treatment within the accession requirements. Its commitment to EU accession is evident in the large
body of collaborative work related to environmental compliance that GOH has already carried out, in
cooperation with the EU and other donors (see references in Annex 8). GOH's commitment to helping local
governments solve their municipal wastewater problems is also evidenced by its program of grant support for
environmentally sound solutions. GOH support for this project in particular is further demonstrated by its
willingness to provide sovereign guarantees for the two borrowing municipalities. The municipalities'
commitment is demonstrated by the decisions taken by their respective assemblies to carry out the project
investments, to borrow for them and to undertake, and to initiate the procurement.
Both Borrowers have taken advantage of the Bank's advance contracting and retroactive financing procedures.
In October 1997, Budapest awarded a US$18 million equivalent contract following Bank procurement guidelines
for expansion of the South Pest WWTP. Implementation of the contract began in January 1998. Dunauijvaros
awarded a US$9 million equivalent contract in December 1998 for their WWTP. Both Borrowers have arranged
for short term loans to cover the Bank's share of the project financing which they intend to repay from the Bank
loans when they become effective.
The use of limited liability companies for sewerage and water operations, and in particular the partial
privatization of the BMSC, indicates local government commitment to the principal of efficient corporate
management of public services.
S. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank has maintained a dialogue with the Government since the first water and wastewater sector mission in
1992. The dialogue included an early Bank-MTCWM seminar for over 200 sector officials and managers of
water companies, as well as support through a Japanese PHRD grant funded study. The Bank, in cooperation
with several other international agencies and organizations, has also assisted Hungary in its environment sector.
For this project in particular, Bank support was crucial in helping Hungary obtain EU Phare grant co-financing.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 10)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
[ ] Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$ million; ERR= %
[ ] Cost Effectiveness Analysis
[X] Other (Specify)
Project benefits accrue from progress towards EU membership through compliance with its environmental
directives, and from the environmental improvements associated with compliance. Justification is based on
achieving these benefits in a least-cost manner.
The project will reduce pollution in the Danube River Basin. The discharge of largely untreated sewage will be
decreased by about 15%, and some 3,000 tons of BOD5 per year will be removed. The South Pest plant, which
discharges into the RSDB, will meet EU effluent standards for sensitive waters. The sewerage investments will
reduce pollution of a valuable groundwater source in north-west Budapest, and ensure treatment of the
wastewater generated in the area.
Of particular relevance, however, is the importance of the project in terms of Hungary's progress towards EU
accession. The project, by addressing the wastewater management problems of two cities, moves Hungary
towards compliance with the EU's UWWT directive, an EU accession condition. Moreover, Budapest as the
largest urban area in Hungary, and Dunauijvaros, with a population of around 60,000, are both situated on the
Danube and are therefore high priorities for urban wastewater management. The EU Phare co-financing
confirms the EU's concurrence with the priority afforded to the project by the Government.
The sewerage investments and sewage treatment facilities proposed in the project represent the least-cost
solution to the pollution problems they address. The additional sewage treatment capacity in Budapest takes



Page 10
advantage of the existing land, administrative buildings and operations and maintenance capacity, and lowers the
unit cost of sewage treatment. The treatment plant sites in Budapest readily accommodate the additional
facilities, making the impact on the land environment lower than that of two new sites. In Dunaujvaros, the
facilities represent the least-cost solution (see Section D. 1)
2. Financial (see Annex S):
Budapest component: NPV=US$17.6 million; FRR= 27% (see project files for calculation)
Dunaujviros component: NPV=US$3.0 million; FRR=15% (see project files for calculation)
Borrowers:
a. Municipality of Budapest (Loan amount EUR 27.6 million). The Municipality of Budapest is a
borrower under the ongoing Bank Loan No. 3903-HU for the Budapest Urban Transport Project, approved in
June 1995. As the capital city and the largest local government body in Hungary, Budapest has a special status
under local government legislation introduced since 1990, notably the Act on Local Governments and the Act on
Local Government Financing. In keeping with its size and status, Budapest has been at the forefront of
introducing changes in local government financial planning and management. While the revised legislation has
led to greater decentralization of powers to the local governments, it has also implied a progressive reduction in
the share of funds transferred from the central budget. Local governments have therefore have had increasingly
to depend on raising funds from their own sources, and to give greater attention to expenditure control to be able
to balance their budgets. Thus, while Budapest's total revenues increased from HUF 112 billion in 1995 to HUF
193 billion in 1998, the share of central transfers declined from 53% to 36%, and the share of own-financing
increased from 47% to 64%. Budapest has generally followed a prudent fiscal and financial policy as reflected
in the doubling of the ratio of the operational surplus (operating revenues less operating expenses) to operating
revenues from eight percent in 1995 to 16% in 1998, while the ratio of debt service to operating revenues was
halved from seven percent to three percent during the same period. Budapest has also followed an active policy
of divestiture of assets through privatization with the revenues from these sales being directed largely to
developmental, including infrastructure, investments.
For the period 1998 to 2005, Budapest, with technical assistance from Credit Locale International Conseil (a
French consulting firm), has prepared a forward-looking Financial Plan that includes detailed financial
projections. The Plan recognizes the need for continued investment in infrastructure renewal and expansion in
the face of reduced dependence on central budget sources and the declining possibilities of sales of assets. Key
objectives of the plan are to maintain an operational surplus ratio of at least 20%, continue to create reserves
where possible through privatization asset sales, and follow a prudent borrowing policy, geared towards
financing of a defined investment program with annual targets of investment. The bulk of this investment will
be financed from the proceeds of a DM150 million bond issue made in 1998. The financial projections under the
Financing Plan confirm that the debt service, even taking into account the large bond issue, will remain
affordable over the project implementation period, rising to a peak of 90% of the available operational surplus in
the year 2003 when the bonds mature. As a safeguard in regard to debt service levels, Budapest has agreed to
consult with the Bank prior to any further incurrence of debt such that the ratio of Budapest's projected operating
surplus to its debt service obligations would fall below 1.5 for one of any two successive fiscal years or below
1.1 for any given fiscal year.
b. Municipality of Dunauijvaros (Loan amount EUR 2.0 million). The financial situation of the
Municipality of Dunauijvaros reflects the changes consequent to the revised legislation pertaining to local
governments. Total revenues have increased from HUF 4.8 billion in 1995 to HUF 8.0 billion in 1998 with the
share of own revenues rising from 31% to 56% while that of central transfers declined from 69% to 44%.
Operational surpluses have generally averaged around 10% of operational revenues in recent years. These levels
were not adequate to finance the backlog of infrastructure renewal and necessary expansion. Starting in 1996
therefore, Dunauijvaros moved to a policy of careful borrowing, averaging about HUF 780 million (US$4.5
million equivalent) per year to finance infrastructure investments. Nevertheless, its debt capacity has remained
within the levels defined by applicable law, which requires that local governments cannot incur new debt unless
they can meet the stipulated requirements of such debt not exceeding 70% of own revenues in any year. With



Page 11
the investments already undertaken, Dunauijvaros does not envisage any other major investments until 2003 other
than the proposed investment under the project. Projections of its revenues and expenditures in the period to
2003 confirm that its debt service levels will remain acceptable in relation to its projected operating surpluses
before debt service. Dunaiijvaros has agreed to consult with the Bank prior to the incurrence of any new debt
such that the ratio of Dunaujvaros' projected operating surplus to its debt service obligations would fall below
1.5 in any given fiscal year.
Operating Companies (OCs):
a. Budapest Municipal Sewerage Company (BMSC). Until November 1997, the BMSC was a joint
stock company wholly owned by Budapest. In November 1997, Budapest entered into an agreement with a
consortium of two foreign water utility operators, Generale des Eaux (France) and Berlin Wasser (Germany),
under which Budapest transferred 25% of the ownership in the form of preferred shares to the foreign private
investors. The contract between Budapest and the private investors also provides that the latter will be
responsible for the management of the company. The guiding principles accepted under the contract by the
private investors-managers are:
* undisturbed maintenance of sewerage services with improvement in standards;
* reduction in environmental pollution;
* improvement of the company's cost efficiency with a view to moderating prices of services;
* continuous technical development of the system;
* extensive expansion of the capacity;
* accumulation of funds for system development as agreed;
* continuous improvement in collections of receivables, and recovery of unpaid receivables;
* improvement and strengthening of the company's liquidity and financial situation; and
* improvement of the operational and cost accounting information systems to enable efficient financial
management
Tariffs are proposed by the company by October 31 of each year for the following year, and are subject to the
approval of the municipal assembly. The contract provides a detailed formula as the basis on which the tariffs
are to be calculated. Under the formula, the total tariff is broken down into three main parts: the first covering
the company's operational cash needs, including operating expenses and maintenance expenditures of a routine
nature; the second, a contribution to an investment fund for undertaking more substantial investments; and the
third for a rental fee to the municipality to cover debt service arising from any borrowings undertaken by the
municipality for such investments. Prior to the contract, the average tariff for wastewater services was
HUF59.40 per m3 in 1997. In 1998, it was increased to HUF71.20 per mi3, of which HUTF58.80 per m3was to
cover BMSC's operational expenses, and HUF12.40 per m3 for the contribution to the development fund and the
rental fee. For 1999, the average tariff further increased to HUF83.10 per m3, with HUF69. 10 per m3 for
operational expenses and HUF 14 per m3 for the development fund and the rental fee.
Remuneration to the shareholders, both Budapest and the private investor, is to be paid out of a dividend fund
that remains as a residual after providing for the agreed coverage of operational and development expenditures.
As preferred shareholders, the private investors-managers have first claim on the available amount to be
distributed up to an agreed 18% of the nominal values of the shares. The balance remaining is to be distributed
to Budapest as ordinary shareholder.
The principal governing contracts, the Share Purchase Agreement and the Shareholder's Agreement between
Budapest and the private investors, and the Public Utility Service Contract between Budapest and BMSC, have
been reviewed and found to be satisfactory. To ensure the adequacy and timely contribution of the local
counterpart funding for the project, including that through internal generation by BMSC, Budapest has agreed to
take all necessary steps, including: (a) approving the appropriate levels of tariffs; (b) reviewing with the Bank,
not later than January 31 of each year, the revenue and expenditure forecasts for that year; and (c) taking prompt
remedial actions, or to the extent legally and practically possible, to cause BMSC to take remedial actions, to
make up any funding shortfalls, if identified on the basis of the review.

b. Dunauijvaros Water Supply and Sewerage Company (DWSSC). Sewerage collection and disposal
services in Dunauijvaros are currently provided by DWSSC. The latter forms a part of the holding Dunaqua-
Therm Company which also owns the district heating company and the solid waste management company. The
wastewater treatment plant included under the project is to be constructed by the Development Department of
the Municipality. Dunauijvaros has not yet decided whether, upon commissioning, the plant will be turned over
for operation to DWSSC or if a new company will be set up for the purpose. Dunaiijvaros has agreed that this
will be determined on the basis of a study, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, to be carried out not
later than June 30, 2000, and implemented not later than December 31, 2000. Local funding for the project,
estimated at US$3.7 million equivalent, will be provided by Dunafujvaros through its budgetary sources.
DWSSC is not expected to contribute to project financing, but loan repayment could be reflected in the rent it
pays to the Municipality under its operating agreement. The rent is set to cover depreciation on system assets,
debt service on outstanding loans and an allowance for new investment and is passed on the consumers as a part
of the tariff. Financial projections for DWSSC include the costs included in the rent.
Average tariffs for water supply and sewerage services provided by DWSSC are currently around HUF 120 per
m3 of water sold, consisting of HUF80 per m3 for water supply and HUF40 per m3 for sewerage. At these levels,
the combined tariffs are significantly below the national average. The projections indicate that the combined
water and wastewater tariff will need to be raised to about HUF250 per m of water sold by 2003, consisting of
about HUF125 per m3 each for water supply and sewerage. Despite.the large percentage increase, which starts
from a base below the national average, these tariffs are estimated to remain affordable.
3. Technical:
The technical solutions being implemented in both projects have undergone extensive feasibility studies and
evaluation before reaching the final design and tendering stage. They have all been implemented in other
projects and time tested; no untried solutions are being implemented. In the case of the Budapest component,
because the investments are extensions of existing plants, solutions were determined at the feasibility stage and
detailed designs were prepared and bid. In the case of Dunaiijvaros, preliminary designs based on a textbook
approach were prepared for planning purposes, estimating costs and obtaining government approvals. However,
the bidding documents were performance based and did not specify any particular solution. A two-stage bidding
process was followed and the technical solutions proposed were evaluated by Dunauijvaros' local consultant and
EU consultants financed by EU Phare, the co-financiers.
4. Institutional.(see Annex 6)
Executing Agency and Project Management - Budapest Component: The Budapest Municipality is the
borrower and implementing agency for its project component. The responsible unit is the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) in the Mayor's office. This unit has been in existence for about 10 years and is
responsible for all capital projects undertaken by the Municipality with funding from foreign sources (IFIs, EU
Phare and foreign bonds). For example, the unit is responsible for the IBRD and EBRD financed Urban
Transport Project. It has a staff of eight of which four are engineers, and the rest are finance and accounting
experts. The Director has a finance background and has held his position since the inception of the unit. The
unit has a good track record of completing projects on time and within budget. Technical support is provided by
the responsible agency of the Municipality. In the case of the wastewater project, the PIU has contracted
technical support, engineering design and day-to-day supervision to BMSC, who will eventually be responsible
for operating and maintaining the completed works. Both the PIU and the BMSC have small staffs relative to
their activities, so they rely heavily on consultants. In the case of the PIU, a financial consultant advises on all
financing matters; and in the case of the BMSC, most of the detailed engineering and construction supervision is
done by consultants. Financial transactions are handled by the Municipality's Accounting and Finance
Department.
The main contact for the Bank will be the PIU, which will be responsible for all monitoring and reporting and
management of the project funds including the Special Account.
Executing Agency and Project Management - Dunaujvaros Component: The Development Department of
the Municipality of Dunauijvaros will be the executing agency for its component. The Department is responsible



Page 13
for all infrastructure investment for the Municipality. Department staff number six, of which three are engineers.
The rest are finance and accounting experts. The Department is headed by an experienced engineer who has
carried out many successful projects for the Municipality. The Development Department will set up a PIU
within the Department to manage the Project. The Department Director will also be the Director of the PIU.
Project accounts will be kept by the unit; however, financial transactions will be carried out through the
Municipality's Finance Department. The PIU will be assisted by consultants who have carried out all the
engineering for the Project. Monitoring and reporting and maintenance of the Special Account will be the
responsibility of the PIU.
DWSSC, the water and sewerage subsidiary of DTC which maintains and operates the existing collection
system, will have a limited role in the implementation of the Project. It was consulted during the preparation
stage but will play no role for the time being in the implementation. The Municipality has not yet decided who
will operate and maintain the completed plant, pending the completion of the operational study to be carried out
under the project. The Bank will closely follow progress in this regard during supervision to ensure that the new
arrangements are in place not later than December 31, 2000.
5. Social:
In Hungary, the decision to invest in sewage treatment facilities is initiated by local communities (see Section
E.7. on participation), and supported by the Government, both institutionally and financially, because of the
larger benefits of such investment. The willingness of the people of Budapest and Dunaujvaros to contribute,
through higher tariffs, to the wastewater treatment facilities to be financed under this project demonstrates the
consistency of support for Hungary's environmental protection and EU membership objectives. Most of the
people in these communities have already contributed to, and benefited more directly from, prior sewerage
investments.
The benefits of the investments accrue to much larger populations than those physically connected, and there are
thus minimum (if any) adverse distributional effects attributable to the project.
6. Environmental assessment:
Environmental Category:    [] A  [X] B [] C
The project will have significant positive environmental benefits associated with reducing pollution in the
Danube Basin. Any negative impacts tend to be minor, and most are associated with the construction phase of
the project. Treatment plants will be constructed on existing sites (Budapest), or on land already owned by the
borrower and zoned for the purpose (Dunaiujvaros). No resettlement is or was involved in the project.
Environmental assessments have been carried out as required by Hungarian law; construction permits have been
granted by the local environmental inspectorates; and environmental reviews have been carried out as a part of
the EU Phare funded feasibility studies. The Hungarian environmental assessments, including public
participation, as well as the EU Phare reviews, indicate the seriousness with which the Government is addressing
Hungary's environmental concerns.
The Hungarian authorities are working closely with the EU towards compliance with the EU's UWWT directive.
As applicable to the project, the directive differentiates between "normal" and "sensitive" receiving waters - the
latter classification applies to a freshwater lake or stream found to be eutrophic or in danger of becoming
eutrophic in the near future if protective action is not taken. Discharges into sensitive waters must receive
additional treatment to reduce the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous. Receiving waters for the
DunauijvAros and North Budapest plants are "normal"; but the RSDB, which receives the discharges from the
South Pest plant, is considered sensitive. The limits for pollutants in treated effluents under current Hungarian
law vary depending on the quality of the receiving water. The licensing authorities (the Regional Environmental
Directorates) may set more rigorous (or sometimes less rigorous) requirements. The Hungarian standards are
currently under review as part of the ongoing EU accession dialogue. With the consent of its regional licensing
authority, Budapest has adopted a phased approach to full compliance with EU and Hungarian standards,
comprising the construction of two more wastewater treatment plants as well as the extension and upgrading of
the two existing plants. Dunauijvaros will comply with both standards on completion of the project.



Page 14
Treated effluent parameters according to EU requirements and the design discharge requirements for the three
plants in the project are shown in Table 1. The "accepted values" listed in the last three columns take both the
Hungarian limits and the EU legislation into account. In some cases (South Pest) more stringent limits were
agreed, and in others (North Budapest), they were less stringent. The requirements for North Budapest plant are
interim standards. Upon completion of the next phase of expansion and upgrading scheduled to take place over
ten years, it will be required to meet more stringent standards for ammonia, nitrogen and phosphorus. This is
consistent with the least-cost, phased approach to compliance with the EU directives, as supported by the Bank.

a. For the North Budapest plant, the Hungarian authorities and the EU have agreed on temporary limits for the
project extension, given agreement on more stringent limits for the future extension.
b. The South Pest plant discharges to a sensitive water (the RSD Branch), for which nutrient limits are lower.
c. Only for sensitive waters.
It may seem that there is an inconsistency in the discharge requirements in Table 2. The requirements for the
Dunauijvaros WWTP are less stringent than the requirements for the North Budapest WWTP even though both
discharge to the main stream Danube. This is because Dunauljvaros is located at the 1,580 river km of the
Danube. This stretch of the Danube is in Category V-"stressed reach of Danube and Tisza rivers". On the
other hand, the stretch of Danube near the area of the North Budapest WWTP is in Category II, "Drinking water
resource, holiday areas," and therefore has more stringent requirements.
Discharge quality parameters are project monitoring indicators. Target values agreed with the Borrowers are
listed in supplemental letters to the loan agreements and in the PIPs.
Sludge produced in Budapest will be stabilized and recycled for agricultural use when possible. Landfill
capacity is available for disposal when slucge cannot be used for agriculture. In Dunaiujjvaros, a plan for
stabilizing and disposing of sludge at a steel works slag deposit and a solid waste landfill site as part of a
reclamation scheme, has been approved in principal by the District Environmental Directorate. Further
investigation of this plan is needed, and funds for such a study have been included in the project.
Both municipalities have implemented the national sewer use regulations controlling the quality and quantity of
discharges to their systems, and pretreatment is provided by some industries. No major problems have been
observed so far related to the effects of industrial discharge on the functioning of sewage treatment in Budapest.
However, contrary to common practice in Western Europe and North America, tariffs reflect only the quantity,
and not the quality, of industrial wastewater discharges. A study of industrial wastewater tariffs is included in
the project; and review of the study results, including implementation plans, is covenanted under the loan
agreement.
Agreement has been reached with the Borrowers on environmental management plans and their implementation.
The plans, which are included in the PIPs for both projects, would cover mitigation measures to limit the
negative impacts of construction, the implementation of studies in the project related to the environment (odor
study, industrial tariff study and the sludge reclamation study) and environmental monitoring.



Page 15
7. Participatory approach:
As required by Hungarian law, project preparation involved public hearings for each of the wastewater treatment
plants. The minutes of the hearing are required before a permit can be obtained, and they become part of the
environmental assessment documentation requirement under Hungarian law. The investments were also subject
to intensive review in the municipal assemblies, having been discussed initially as part of each Municipality's
annual investment plan, and then again when each municipal assembly voted to apply for a World Bank Loan.
A Social Assessment was carried out in Szegece, to measure public support for the project, determine a
maximum affordable tariff and measure the willingness of the public to pay for investments in water pollution
control. The assessment confirmed that the tariff levels necessary for full recovery of the cost of sewage
treatment in Szeged was affordable, and that there was widespread public support for environmental projects.
8. Compliance with OD 4.30, Involuntary Resettlement, and Section 9.09 of the General Conditions, Land
Acquisition:
The project is in full compliance with OD 4.30 of June 1990 and Section 9.09 of the General Conditions. All
land and right of ways required for the project are already under the ownership of the two Borrowers and are
zoned according to local zoning plans and master development plans for the intended use. No person will be
required to relocate as a result of the project and no private land is required.
9. Compliance with OP 7.50 - Projects on International Waterways:
Because the project involves activities affecting an international waterway, the Danube River, it falls under the
requirements of OP 7.50 of October 1994. The Danube River basin is the heartland of Central Europe. The
main river is 2,857 km long and drains 817,000 sq. km including all of Hungary; most parts of Romania, Austria,
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Slovakia; and significant parts of Bulgaria, Germany, the Czech
Republic, Moldova, Ukraine, and Yugoslavia. Small parts of Italy, Switzerland, Albania and Poland are also
included in the basin. The Danube River discharges into the Black Sea through a delta which is the second
largest natural wetland area in Europe.
Notification of the other riparians, a requirement of OP 7.50 when potentially adverse impacts could occur, was
not made in the case of this Project. The basis for this decision was the fact that the Project is an ongoing
scheme involving changes that: (i) do not adversely change the quality or quantity of water flows to the other
riparians; and (ii) do not adversely affect other riparians' possible water use.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
There is general support in Hungary for projects that contribute to EU accession. This supportive environment is
expected to continue and to help maintain the good physical progress that has already been observed. The
institutional arrangements chosen by the Municipality of Budapest are fully expected to result in efficient
operation and maintenance of the sewage treatment facilities provided under the project, through commercial
contracts, with sufficient cost recovery. For DunauijvAros, the conditions for sustainability are less developed
because the Municipality is much smaller, it has fewer resources at its disposal, and wastewater treatment
facilities are being built for the first time., The arrangements for future operation of the treatment plant are the
subject of a study of alternatives included in the Project. An important part of the Bank's supervision will be to
work closely with the Municipality in carrying out this study to insure that the recommendations are sound and
the Municipality acts on the agreed recommendations.
Covenanted under the Loan Agreements are requirements for the sound operation and financial management of
the OCs to promote sustainability. These are summarized in Section G below.
3Szeged (population 180,000), the third largest town in Hungary, was an early candidate for participation in the project and was
considered typical of the other candidate municipalities.



Page 16
To promote future sustainability of the results of the project, not later than six months after the closing date of
each loan, the Borrowers and the Bank would prepare jointly a plan for the future operation of the facilities
constructed under the Project. This plan would be included in the ICR.

3. Possible controversial aspects:
The project is a relatively straight forward investment project. The project investments are integral parts of the
municipalities' long-term plans for collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater, and public hearings have
already been held on each of the treatment plants. With the participatory process complete, construction of the
treatment facilities in full progress, and widespread sunport for the environmental and EU accession objectives
supported by the project, there is little risk of controversy arising over the project investments. However, should
the Bank consider wastewater tariffs to be insufficient in Budapest, the Municipality is likely to resent Bank
involvement in this matter.

H. Readiness for Implementation
[X] The engineering design documents for the first year's activities are complete and ready for the start of
project implementation.
[X] The procurement documents for the first year's activities are complete and ready for the start of project
implementation.
[X] The Project Implementation Plan has been appraised and found to be realistic and of satisfactory quality.
[ ] The following items are lacking and are discussed under loan conditions (Section G).
I. Compliance with Bank Policies
This project complies with all applicable Bank policies. The proposed Loan for Budapest would allow
retroactive financing up to 30 percent of the proposed loan amount of EUR 27.6 million. Budapest, following
the Bank's procurement guidelines and after receiving the Bank's no objection, awarded and signed an US$18
million equivalent contract for the upgrading of the South Pest WWTP in October 1997. Budapest made its first
payment under this contract in January 1998. Contract implementation is now ahead of schedule, and by the
expected date of loan signing (September 1999), Budapest projects that it will have paid the contractor the full
amount of the contract. ECA Regional Management has approved the waiver of the normal limit (not to exceed
10 percent) given Budapest's particularly good implementation progress.

Detailed Project Description - Budapest Component
The Budapest component (US$79.5 million equivalent) consists of the following:
(a)  North Budapest Wastewater Treatment Plant (US$31.0 million equivalent): The principal investment
is the upgrading of the plant to 220,000 m3/day capacity. The selected technology uses four high-rate primary
sedimentation tanks, with coagulator-flocculator reactors and integrated tube settler-clarifiers. Existing
integrated primary sedimentation and activated sludge tanks will be transformed into high-rate aeration activated
sludge tanks. To handle the increased sludge, secondary sedimentation tanks will be upgraded, a new filter press
installed, and a new sludge disposal site established. Nitrogen and phosphorous removal, which are required for
ultimate compliance with EU directives, will be implemented in the future when it becomes necessary to
increase the capacity to 300,000 m3/day. This will be accomplished by the addition of two more high-rate
primary sedimentation tanks and the addition of fixed bed filters directly after the primary sedimentation tanks.
Chemical dosing will be used for phosphorus removal.
(b)  South Pest Wastewater Treatment Plant (US$27.3 million equivalent): The plant will be expanded
from its present 72,000 m3/day capacity to 120,000 m3/day, and upgraded to provide nitrogen and phosphorous
removal. Stormwater sedimentation tanks will be installed to handle excess flows. In the expanded plant, the
present anaerobic stage will be eliminated. Wastewater will be transferred to an aeration tank where organic
carbon decomposition will occur. Six fixed bed upflow filter units will provide for nitrification, denitrification
and effluent polishing. Phosphorous will be removed by chemical addition. Sludge will be dewatered by
centrifugation after anaerobic digestion with biogas production.
(c)  North Buda Wastewater and Rainwater Pumping and Primary Collection System (US$20.8 million
equivalent): The collection system includes the Pok Street Pump Station, pressure mains, primary gravity trunk
sewers and a cross-Danube pressure main at Pok Street. (The pump station will be financed from the
Municipality's own resources).
(d)  Technical assistance (US$100,000 equivalent) will be provided for the following:
*  a study to recommend regulatory and technical measures to strengthen monitoring of industrial wastes
discharge into the sewer system;
*  a study of the technical, financial and legal aspects of industrial wastewater tariffs charged by BMSC to
users of the wastewater system with the objective of implementing charges based on contaminants as well as
quantity;
*  a study to determine the source of uncommon odors at the North Budapest Wastewater Treatment Plant and
to recommend corrective measures.

Hungary: Municipal Wastewater Project
Economic Assessment Summary
The project sewage treatment facilities are an essential part of the overall environmental plan for the
Danube basin. The Danube is the most important water resource of the region, and the main source of water
supply for Budapest. Both project cities discharge their largely untreaLted sewage into the Danube. The
additional capacity provided by the project will substantially reduce this discharge, and remove on the order of
3,000 tons of BOD5 per year from the Danube basin. The South Pest plant discharges into the Rackeve-
Soroksar-Danube Branch (RSDB), which is an important recreational area for the Budapest metropolitan area.
The project will have a particularly beneficial impact as the RSDB is considered a 'sensitive' receiving water
because of its hypertrophic condition. While the magnitude of the Danube flow at the two project municipalities,
together with the remaining pollution from other sources, preclude immediate substantial improvement in the
mainstream Danube, the additional treatment capacity is an essential element in the overall environmental
program for the Danube River Basin. The sewage collectors and pumping station will, together with a local
collection network to be provided as a result of local initiative, reduce pollution of a valuable groundwater
source in a section of north-west Budapest and ensure that the wastewater generated in the area receives
treatment.
Of particular relevance, however, is the project's importance in terms of Hungary's progress towards EU
accession. Preparing for integration into the European Union (EU) is Hungary's driving political, economic and
social aim for 1998-2000. Environmental protection has an extremely high priority for the EU, and is now a
"guiding objective" - a special status not accorded to other objectives. There are some seventy EU
environmental directives, supplemented with "daughter" directives and regulations. The Government, in
dialogue with the EU and others including the Bank, has already made considerable progress on the institutional
side, working towards aligning its environmental laws and institutions with the EU. However, the costs of
installing and operating all the additional facilities needed for compliance are substantial, with annual costs
ranging from 1.7 to 4.5% of Hungary's 1997 GDP4. The Government is guiding the resources available from
various funding sources towards investments that are local and/or national priorities and help Hungary move
towards EU enviromnental compliance.
Investment in additional wastewater management facilities is by far the largest outstanding aspect of
compliance. The EU's UWWT directive calls for all settlements with populations of more than 2,000 to be
connected to a sewerage system and to treat their wastewater to specific levels, depending on the characteristics
of the receiving water. The costs of building and operating the additional sewage treatment facilities are
estimated to be in the range of 0.8 to 1.4% of Hungary's 1997 GDP. While it is understood that an extended
transition period will be necessary, and that Hungary would eventually make the required enviromnental
investments on its own initiative, EU accession accelerates the process and reduces the scope for policy
flexibility. In the short term, investments undertaken in order to implement the environmental acquis are, to a
large extent, part of the price of joining the Union.
EU requirements include, as a first stage, the biological treatment of wastewater in towns of over 15,000
population.5 Budapest and the county capitals fall into this category. With this in mind, the Government's 1994
program identified Budapest, Dunaujjvaros, Sz6kesfehervar Szeged and Szolnok as the first tasks because of the
4Excluding industrial pollution control costs. These estimates, from a draft background paper for the forthcoming CEM, assume
investment costs spread evenly over 20 years, and a real discount rate of 7%.
5 Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste water treatment. This was to be accomplished by the end of
2000, with treatment in towns with populations between 2,000 and 15,000 being completed by 2005.

volume of untreated sewage. (Szekesfehervar Szeged and Szolnok are planning or already undertaking
investments outside of this project).
The Budapest metropolitan area is the highest priority. A study carried out in connection with the
development of an Environmental Management Program for the Danube River Basin6 emphasized that Budapest
is one of the greatest polluters of the central section of the Danube. It is by far the largest urban area in Hungary,
accounting for about 20% of the country's population and about 30-40% of the industrial potential. Currently
only some 20% of the capital area's wastewater is receiving secondary treatment prior to being discharged into
the river. In the Budapest area, the expansion of the North Budapest and the South Pest Wastewater Treatment
Plants under the project will more than double the ratio of receiving sewage secondary treatment, increasing the
proportion from 20% to about 45-50%. Longer term plans include the construction of two new sewage treatment
plants which together with the two existing plants will provide treatment for 100% of Budapest's wastewater and
improved treatment and disposal of sewage sludge.
The expansion of the South Pest plant is critical to the health of the RSD Branch. Although the RSDB
serves irrigation and excess water draining purposes, and plays a vital role in supplying water the for the region's
industrial and agricultural activity, its primary importance is as a recreational area for the capital, a use which is
increasingly endangered by the deteriorating water quality. The RSD Branch has accumulated a large amount of
organic bottom silt; it is closed at both ends; it has low, or no, flow during the summer - a critical period for
eutrophication. The entire length of the RSDB is now rated as Class IV from a bacteriological point of view, i.e.,
unsuitable for bathing. More than half of the point source pollution in the RSD Branch is from the South Pest
plant. The project will drastically reduce NH4 (to 2 mg/l from levels of 30-35 mg/l observed during 1993-1995)
and phosphorus loads (to a limit of 1 mg/l for total phosphorous, from 2.5 to 4). Total nitrogen limit will be 10
mg/l. COD will be reduced by 20-25% to 50 mg/l; and BOD5 will be reduced by about 60%, to a level of 10
mg/l. The limits comply with the EU requirements, and in particular, with the standards for sensitive waters.
Effluent from the expanded North Budapest plant discharged to the mainstream Danube, with limits of 27
mg/l for N-NH4 and 4 mg/l for Total P, will not satisfy the EU requirements. The nitrogen and phosphorous
removal required for compliance will be implemented in the future, when it becomes necessary to increase the
capacity to 300,000 m3/day. This is expected to happen by 2010.
The treatment plant at Dunaujvaros has planned removal efficiencies of 90-95% for both BOD5 and
suspended solids. The quality standards to be met are 125 mg/l and 25 mg/l for COD and BOD5, respectively,
10 mg/l for nitrogen, and 2 mg/I for phosphorous. The actual abatement amounts, based on these standards and
taking into account the increasing pollution concentration due to declining water levels, are likely to be about: 12
tons/day COD; 5 tons/day BOD5; 0.3-0.45 tons/day for NH3-NH4/N; and 0.14-0.16 tons/day for phosphorous.
In the part of north-west of Budapest which is still not connected to the sewerage network, sewage is
seeping into valuable groundwater sources. The local governments are initiating plans for a local collection
network which will effectively stop this pollution. The sewage collectors and pumping station to be provided
under the project will ensure that the collected wastewater receives treatment, rather than being discharged into
the Danube. The system proposed is the least-cost solution having been selected from three alternative
preliminary designs.
The wastewater situation in Hungary is such that the project investments, although necessary for
compliance with the UWWT directive, and a cost of EU accession, do not fulfill the EU accession requirements.
6 Representatives of 8 Danube countries, UNDP, UNEP, EEC, USAID, the Bank, and others discussed the program, sponsored by the
Global Environmental Facility (GEF) of UTNDP, UNEP, and the World Bank, in Sofia, Bulgaria in 1991. USAID funded a wastewater
emissions study of the Danube basin in several countries, including Hungary (US AID Europe Bureau, "Point Source Pollution in the
Danube Basin (1992), Water and Sanitation for Health (WASH) Project).

Nevertheless, the project represents a substantial step towards compliance and demonstrates the Government's
commitment to the accession objective. The EU Phare co-financing confirms the EU's concurrence as to the
project's priority within the accession compliance program.

Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
Government's decision regarding EU accession means that it has accepted the EU's UWWT directive.
The Project is part of GOH's efforts towards achieving the required levels of treatment at maximum
effectiveness and least-cost. Maximum effectiveness is achieved by focusing (i) on the larger settlements, and
(ii) on the most important environmental problems (the Danube basin and particularly, the RSDB).
The sewerage investments and sewage treatment facilities proposed in the project represent the least-cost
solution to the pollution problems they address. In the case of Budapest wastewater treatment, the least-cost
solution is the expansion of existing sewage treatment facilities. The additional sewage treatment capacity in
Budapest takes advantage of the existing land, administrative buildings and O&M capacity, and lowers the unit
cost of sewage treatment. The treatment plant sites in Budapest will accommodate the additional facilities, with
a lower impact on the land environment than would be the case if new sites were required.
In Dunaujvaros, the facilities represent the least-cost solution as a result of the bidding process. Two sites
were available for the plant. The final selection was based on a least-cost analysis that compared pumping and
sewer connection costs for the two sites. The final design of the plant was selected as a result of the bidding
process that requested alternative designs to meet discharge quality performance requirements. The two-stage
procedure was used which allowed alternative designs to be submitted and reviewed for suitability. Designs and
processes considered suitable following an evaluation by local and international consultants were then priced in
the second stage bid.

Hungary: Municipal Wastewater Project
Institutional Analysis - Budapest Component
The Borrower and Implementing Agency - Municipality of Budapest
Legal Framework: Hungary's system of government comprises the State, 19 county governments plus
Budapest, and 3,148 independent local units organized as villages or towns. Budapest is further structured into
23 independent districts, each district having its own mayor, city council and staff. Of the independent local
units, 42 (including the Budapest districts) have a population of 50,000 or more.
Key pieces of legislation govern Hungarian local government spending and revenue powers: the 1990
Law on Local Governments (Act No. LXV); the Law on Local Taxes (Act C of 1990), last modified at the end of
1995; and the 1996 Act on Municipal Debt Adjustment (Law XXV of 1996), providing procedures for formal
debt work out and bankruptcy reorganization for municipalities.
Organization and Administration: The 1990 Law on Local Government contains a chapter on
Budapest's governmental structure, recognizing its "special role and position" vis-a-vis central government and
other local governments. According to the law, Budapest has a municipal government where each of the city's
23 districts has one seat on a General Assembly (city council), and the remaining 65 council seats are elected at-
large. The Budapest municipal government is headed by a Lord Mayor, elected directly every four years, with
the next election in 1998. Deputy mayors are appointed by the Lord Mayor subject to General Assembly
approval.
The Local Government law directs the Municipality to perform functions affecting the whole of the city,
including maintaining major roads and providing public transportation, police protection, water and wastewater
treatment, wastewater collection, wastewater disposal and drainage. District government is responsible for
primary and secondary education and social programs including day/elder care, and birth and death registry.
Revenues: Budapest has two general revenue sources: funds from the central State budget and "own
source" local revenues. Revenues received from the State fall into three major categories: intergovernmental
transfers, shared taxes and fees, and social security support.
Intergovernmental Transfers. The four categories of budget transfer from State to local government are:
normative grants, targeted matching grants, addressed grants and other relatively minor transfers.
Normative (unconditional) Grant. The normative grant is an unconditional transfer composed of two
elements: (i) a HUF 2 million lump sum, provided to all local governments and (ii) an amount based on "norms"
and need indices. The norms are a function of standard per capita services, a small matching grant (each HUF of
tourism tax is supplemented by two from the State) and 18 expenditure related weights designed to estimate the
demand and cost for municipal services. From the grant, cost recovery for services is just below 60% for most
operations of the Municipality and the real value of normative grants has declined at almost the pace of inflation
during 1994-1996.
Targeted (matching) Grants. Matching grants are provided for specific capital construction projects
determined by annual state priorities. The central funds are matched by a local contribution, with the state
generally providing 40% of project costs. Most wastewater projects (except for Budapest and the largest cities) are
funded by matching grants.



Page 37
Addressed Grants. Certain infrastructure projects for Hungary's larger cities, including the current
wastewater project for Budapest, are funded by addressed grants (special appropriations). Each year legislation is
passed earmarking the funds to specific projects.
Shared Taxes and Fees. Local governments receive a share of personal income taxes collected by the
state. The local share ranges from 25 to 36%, according to a formula incorporating per capita income and
population. In 1996 Budapest will receive about 27% of the personal incometax collected on its territory in
1994 and 1995--the lag between collection and redistribution causes significant reduction in real terms.
Budapest's share of personal income taxes is divided between the Municipality and the districts in a 60:40 ratio.
Other Centrally Earmarked Transfers. There are two other state transfers to the Budapest budget: (i) a
social security contribution of pass-through funds to cover the cost of health institutions and (ii) special "ad hoc"
grants.
Revenues under Municipality control can be divided into two major categories: (i) those from current
operations and (ii) from portfolio income and the sale of municipal assets.
Current Revenues. Municipal revenue from current operations consists primarily of local taxes, together
with relatively minor fees, fines and other income. The Law on Local Taxes grants local government authority
to levy five types of "own-source" taxes, up to maximum rates defined by the law. In Budapest, the
Municipality levies two of these taxes, and the balance are reserved for the district governments. The taxes are:
Local Industrial Tax (general business turnover tax). This is a tax levied by the Municipality on all
businesses operating within its limits. The tax is 1.2% of gross sales revenue net of VAT, cost of goods sold and
the value of subcontractor services. Revenue from the general business tax is shared with district government and
in 1995 districts received 65% of collections. Budapest's rate is the maximum allowed under the law.
Tourism Tax. The Municipality raised its tourism tax rate from 2% to 3% as of January 1, 1996. The
maximum rate is 4%, or 300 HUF per person per night. In its current version, the tax applies to every night's stay
at commercial lodgings; previously, the first night was exempted, resulting in large losses due to shortaverage
stays by business people. The tax is collected and administered by the Municipality and shared with the local
districts. The Municipality retains 60%, which is allocated equally to a tourism infrastructure fund and a general
fund.
Property Taxes. Two types of property taxes may be levied by district governments: on unimproved
private and public land, and on improvements (private buildings, both commercial and residential). The maximum
rate on unimproved property is 200 HUF per square meter, or 3% of "corrected value" (defined as 50% of observed
market value). The percentage calculation is rarely used because of low turnover and unreliable price data. The
maximum rate on commercial and residential buildings is 900 HUF per square meter, or 3% of corrected value.
Communal Taxes. Communal taxes are charged at a flat rate per employee or per unit of housing. The
maximum rate is 12,000 HUF per housing unit or 2,000 HUF per employee. This tax is available only to district
governments.
Portfolio Income and Sale of Assets. Municipality of Budapest generates revenue from sales of equity
stakes in enterprises, securities transactions, sales of land and other assets, privatization of housing, interest
income, rental income, and profits from entrepreneurial activities. The Municipality has significant holdings of
shares in recently privatized utilities (Budapest Gas Works, Budapest Electrical Works, the national grid), as
well as compensation coupons and securities, and plans to sell several unimproved lots and other real estate.

Borrowing Capacity: A limit on municipal borrowing is included in legislation for Hungary's 1996
budget (1995/CXXI Act). Municipal debt service is limited to 70% of "corrected" own revenues, defined as
local taxes, administrative fees, interest income, environmental fees and other specific revenue of local
governments less debt service. This definition excludes "current" revenue of municipal institutions having
discretion over their own income, and "capital" revenue other than dividends and interest. Budapest's debt
backed by sovereign guarantee is not included in the debt service limitation, but even without this exclusion, the
Municipality is well within limits. Municipality utilized 34% of its debt service capacity in 1998 and planned
37% utilization for 1999, assuming all municipal debt is subject to the limit. A debt service limitation also is
included in the 1995 World Bank loan for Budapest's transit company (BKV). Here debt service is limited to
15% of Municipality "cash income" and debt service financed by other agencies is not included in the limitation.
Even disregarding this exclusion, debt service as a percentage of total municipal revenues is only 5% in 1998. In
summary, according to the either the State debt limitation or the World Bank's, Budapest has significant scope to
service additional debt. Debt service can more than double and still remain within limits calculated above.
The Operating and Technical Suipport Agency - Budapest Metropolitan Sewerage Company (BMSC)
Sewer construction was begun in the inner city of Budapest at the end of 18th century. Wastewater collection
nationwide, including Budapest, was a central government responsibility until 1946, when an independent company
under the control of the local council was established. The company has been known as Budapest Fovarosi
Csatorndzdsi Mzuvekor the Budapest Metropolitan Sewerage Company (BMSC) since 1950. In 1993 it was
transformed into a public limited liability company. Water supply is the responsibility of a separate company, the
Budapest Metropolitan Water Supply Company.
Ownership and Governance: BMSC is an OC. Its assets comprise buildings, real-estate and operating
equipment only. Prior to 1997, the BMSC was 100% owned by the Municipality. In 1996, it was corporatized
and the newly corporatized company concluded a public utility service agreement with the Municipality. The
agreement specifies service requirements and a formula for the annual adjustment of tariffs. In 1997, the
Municipality sold a 25% share of the BMSC through an international competition to a private investor, a joint
venture of Generale des Eaux and Berlin Wasser. The shares owned by the investor are preferred shares which
entitle the investor to a dividend equal to 18% of the par value of their shares. The dividend is calculated from
the after tax profit. Any profits remaining after payment of the private investor's preferred shares dividend then
go to the Municipality. The shareholder's agreement gives the investor the right to manage the BMSC for a
period of 25 years. The investor's management rights include a majority position on the Board of Directors and
the right to appoint the General Manager.
The tariffs are adjusted each year with the new tariff going into effect on January 1St. There are three parts
to the tariff: (i) the depreciation of the sewerage system; (ii) an investment fee for the construction of new
facilities and the repayment of debt service on loans taken out by the Municipality for new investments, e.g., the
proposed Bank loan; and (iii) the operating fee. The investment fee is decided by the Municipality and is used
only for replacement of or improvements to the system. The operating fee is proposed by the BMSC based on
the formula in the utility services agreement and is subject to negotiation of the assumptions. For the 1998 ,ariff,
the BMSC proposed a 60% increase over 1997. The final tariff approved by the Municipality was only a 16%
increase. The formula contains no allowance for a management fee or a fixed profit. The profit, if any, results
from the savings realized by the investor over the year in operation of the system. In the first full year of
operation, the BMSC made a profit, mainly through significant staff reductions.
Organization and Management: The company is organized into two management centers--technical
and financial--with clear lines of hierarchical authority. Each center is headed by a deputy general manager.
There are roughly six management levels, each employee reports to no more than one manager, and



Page 39
responsibility is delegated (within expenditure thresholds) so that senior management involvement is not
required in lower level decisions.
The technical center is divided into three sections: network, operations and investments. The network
section is responsible for the sewer system, pump stations and associated equipment, including repair,
maintenance and reconstruction of sewers, surface drainage, river bank outlets and hydraulic structures. The
network section also operates a sludge disposal plant on Csepel Island and maintains the technical designs
inventory. The operations group is responsible for wastewater treatment, including laboratory analysis of
samples, control of industrial discharges and scheduled maintenance programs for wastewater treatment plants.
The investments department plans the company's capital improvements and manages their implementation.
Institutional Assessment: BMSC is a strong institution that has been successful in delivering
dependable sewerage and drainage services to the Municipality. The expectation is that it should improve even
more in the future through the efforts of the Municipality's private sector partner.
Management. There are no significant problems in the management of the company. Efforts currently
are underway to bring BMSC management systems and practices closer to Western European accepted norms
and standards. In this context, company management is conscious of the need to continue to upgrade the
company's operational, financial and commercial management functions through improvements in equipment,
facilities and personnel skills. Areas for particular attention are enhancement of operational efficiency through
improved maintenance and replacement programs; financial planning and control through improved information
systems (a new local area network currently is being implemented); improved financial and cost accounting to
provide a better basis for internal decision-making; and improved commercial practices, including customer
relations.
Operations. BMSC's operational staff are competent but constrained by inadequate and obsolete
inspection and control equipment and facilities, and a relative emphasis on corrective rather than preventive
maintenance. Company management intends to address these constraints by defining specific and achievable
targets and standards. Areas to be addressed include customer service obligations, system reliability, including
improved inspection and monitoring programs; timely preventive and routine maintenance; and reductions in
obstructions and breaks in pipe networks.
Employment and Staffing. The company employs a total of 1,305 persons, down from 1,717 in 1997
when the new management took over. This represents an employees per connection ration of 1.8 which the
management recognizes is relatively low in comparison to similar sized utilities in Western European countries.
Currently BMSC encourages the education and training of its employees through company sponsored university
education. Skilled worker and driver training is provided, as are short courses for software/hardware
applications. Management intends to give priority to improvement of staff productivity through enhanced
training and other steps to increase productivity.
Commercial Activities. For most customers, wastewater charges are a function of water purchased. A
computerized bill is prepared by the water company on behalf of BMSC. The bills either are sent by the water
company with automatic debiting of the customer's bank account, or are transmitted to a private collection
company (Dijbeszedo Rt), which prints the bills, and collects and remits the fees. Dijbeszed6 Rt also has
contracts for the billing and collections of other city services (water, gas, solid waste, district heating and
insurance premiums. With automatic billing, information on a customer's account is available at any time. The
collection agency reports remittances and non-collected debts monthly. In both cases, sales revenue is recorded
monthly and bank transactions entered daily. Wastewater customers with their own water supply are billed by
BMSC on the basis of self-declarations. BMSC has a two year collection contract with the Dijbeszed6 Rt. The
contract stipulates a minimum 95.2% collection effectiveness ratio. Dijbeszed6 Rt transfers the total fee



Page 40
collected less any retention allowed under the contract to the BMSC. BMSC keeps the operations part and
transfers the investment and rent parts to the Municipality
Financial Management. The company has an experienced financial management team aware of the
value of timely and accurate information for decision-making. Steps have been taken to improve the content and
quality of internal reporting and analysis, but are constrained by limitations in the current information systems,
including equipment and practices.
Accounting and Internal Control. Company accounts are kept in formats required under current
regulations. In common with most Hungarian utilities, the focus in accounting is more on the production of
financial statements and reports for regulatory, tax and control purposes rather than as an aid to management
decision-making. Cost accounting, as a management tool, can be improved. There is inadequate linkage at
present among the different financial, accounting and commercial subsystems to enable management to take an
integrated and fully informed view. The new managers recognizing the need for further improvements in this
area.
Wastewater Tariffs. The company utilizes one tariff structure for all customers (domestic, industrial,
commercial) and does not take into account differential costs of service. Company management wishes to
ensure tariffs are cost reflective and will undertake a study of improved tariff structure and schedules, including
charges related to wastewater strength as well as quantity under the project.

Institutional Analysis - Dunauijvairos Component
The Borrower and Implementing Agency - Municipality of Dunauijvaros
The legal framework and revenue sources for the Municipality of Dunauijvaros are the same as for
Budapest (see Annex 6.1)
Organization: The city General Assembly is the highest decision-making body. The Assembly has
delegated to eleven committees the powers to prepare decisions, give opinions, make proposals and monitor
activities in line with city organizational and operational regulations. Committees closely connected with city
economic and financial matters are the Economic, Finance and City Management Committees. The committees
have, on average, about seven to ten members. Top level coordination is provided through two deputy mayors, in
charge of economic/financial matters, and administration and municipal services.
The committees are supported by administrative departments. The three key departments in regard to
economic and financial matters are the Economic, Finance and Development departments. The Economic
department is responsible for developing and monitoring economic and fiscal strategy. The Development
department is responsible for overseeing city infrastructure investments and construction work and has primary
responsibility for the Project. It also is involved in long term planning and enterprise development. The Finance
department's main responsibility is budget preparation and revenue collection. It coordinates fiscal planning, and
monitors auditing of municipal budgetary institutions.
Finance: Budget preparation is the responsibility of the Finance department under general oversight of the
Finance Committee. Budgets are prepared on an annual basis, with the final budget subject to General Assembly
approval. Finance also is responsible for monitoring revenue collection and expenditure under the budget. Review
meetings take place quarterly. If needed, supplemental budgets can be introduced during the year.
In common with other Hungarian municipalities, the budgetary process does not include a separate capital
expenditure and revenue budget. Commitments for capital expenditure are made annually based on funds available.
Municipal authorities recognize the need for capital budgeting and its advantages; however, changes first are
required in the governing national laws and regulations. The Government of Hungary is aware of the importance of
introducing municipal capital budgeting and plans its inclusion in a Public Sector Adjustment program, supported by
a World Bank loan currently under implementation.
Borrowing Capacity: Under regulations introduced in July 1995, a municipality cannot incur
additional debt if its total debt service exceeds 70% of "collected" own revenues, defmed as local taxes,
administrative fees, interest income, environmental fees and other specific revenue of local governments less
debt service. This definition excludes current revenue of municipal institutions having discretion over their own
income, and capital revenue other than dividends and interest. Dunaijvaros currency has utilized 27% of debt
service capacity according to this definition and the Municipality projects no debt service for the near term
except for the World Bank Loan.

The Operating Company - Dunaqua-Therm (DTC)
Until key 1990 and 1992 legislation promoting local government reforms, the water, wastewater and central
heating operating company serving the Municipality of Dunauijvaros and neighboring smaller municipalities were
owned and controlled by the central government along with the systems they operated. In 1993, DTC and the
systems they operated were transferred to Dunauijvaros and the neighboring municipalities. It became a joint stock
company in 1994. DTC is structured as a holding company with four limited liability subsidiaries, one which
operates and maintains the water supply and sewerage systems that are owned by the Municipality. In 1997,
Dunauijvaros bought the shares of DTC from the neighboring municipalities so that now it is the sole owner.
The company is governed by a Board of Directors and overseen by a Supervisory Committee. There are five
Board members. Three members represent the Municipality, and the remaining two are the company's general
manager and finance manager. The Supervisory Committee monitors utility performance, including internal controls
and accounts.
Management: There are no significant problems in the management of the company. Efforts currently are
underway to bring management systems and practices closer to Western European accepted norms and standards. In
this context, company management is conscious of the need to continue to upgrade the companys operational,
financial and commercial management functions through improvements in equipment, facilities and personnel skills.
Specific targets will be included in the annual business plan which the Bank will review before it is finalized.
Operations: Company operational staff are competent but constrained by inadequate and obsolete
inspection and control equipment and facilities, and a relative emphasis on corrective rather than preventive
maintenance. Company management intends to address these constraints by defining specific and achievable targets
and standards in its annual business plan. Areas to be addressed include customer service obligations; system
reliability, including improved inspection and monitoring programs; timely preventive and routine maintenance; and
reductions in breaks in pipe networks.
Employment and Staffing: The company employs a total of 250 persons in its water and wastewater
operations. This represents a staff to 1,000 connections of 12.5 which management recognizes is high in comparison
to similar sized utilities in Western Europe and the US. During the annual review of DTC's business plan the Bank
would comment on the number of staff and the need for efforts to reduce O&M costs, in part by staff reductions.
Commercial Activities: The company has been making efforts to improve its customer billing and
collection systems, including updating the customer register; upgrading computerized systems to provide more
timely information to trigger required actions; and increased use of individual metering. Management also is
aware of the need to improve customer orientation, respond better to the needs of lower income segments of the
population, reduce the incidence of customer complaints and improve response times to address complaints.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement of goods and works for Bank financed components would be carried out in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised January
1996, August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999). For consultants' services, the procurement would
follow the Bank's guidelines Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, (January
1997, revised September 1997). Project components not financed by the Bank would be procured in accordance
with the guidelines of the European Union, the project's co-financier.
Planning. Project procurement plans detailing the packaging and estimated schedule of the major
procurement actions are presented in Table A. 1 for the Budapest Component and Table A.2 for the Dunaujvaros
Component. The project cost by procurement arrangements is in Table B. All other procurement information,
including the capability of the implementing agency, the date of publication of the General Procurement Notice
and the Banks review process, is presented in Table C. The total value of Bank financed goods and works
procurement is estimated at US$65,000,000. All of this amount would be awarded using ICB and the Supply and
Install (S&I) bidding procedure. Consultants for engineering services valued at US$1,340,000 would be selected
competitively using the QCBS (Quality and Cost Based Selection) method. Consultants for technical assistance
valued at US$200,000 would be selected competitively using the Quality Based Selection method. All
procurement would be subject to prior review.
Grouping of Procurement. To the extent practical, items to be procured have been grouped into major
packages to encourage competitive bidding and to ensure standardization.
Implementation. Both Municipalities have established PIUs to manage implementation of their projects,
including procurement. For the Budapest Component, the PIU has given the Budapest Metropolitan Sewerage
Works the responsibility of carrying out procurement. They, in turn, have engaged consultants satisfactory to the
Bank to prepare the bidding documents under their supervision. The PIU for the Dunauijvaros Component
comprises staff from the Municipality's Development Department. The engineering staff of the Development
Department will undertake procurement with the assistance of consultants satisfactory to the Bank who will
prepare the bidding documents. Progress on procurement would be reported to the Bank in the quarterly Project
Management Reports (PMR) prepared by the Borrowers.
Disbursement
The Bank Loans would be disbursed over seven years. The closing dates would be December 31, 2006.
It is expected that this period would be sufficient to implement the Projects and to complete disbursements,
given the nature and size of the Projects and the Bank's experience with similar infrastructure projects
Allocation of Loan Proceeds. Tables D. I and D.2 show the allocation of loan proceeds by category and
the disbursement percentages in each category for the two loans.
Documentation. A financial management assessment of the Borrowers found that neither Borrower had
in place a project financial management system that would allow the Bank to disburse based on the submission
of Financial Management Reports (PMR). Therefore, disbursements from the Loan would be made by the Bank
initially on receipt of full documentation for all the supply and install contracts and consulting contracts valued
at US$100,000 equivalent or more. Disbursements for consulting contracts in amounts below this threshold
would be made against SOEs. Each Borrower has agreed to carry out an action plan that if completed
satisfactorily, would qualify them to make withdrawals from their loan accounts on the basis of PMRs submitted



Page 44
quarterly. The action plans are included in each Borrower's Project Implementation Plan. For withdrawals from
the loan accounts based on SOEs and PMRs, full supporting documentation would be retained by the PIUs. This
documentation would be made available to the Bank on request.
Special Accounts. Each Borrower would establish Special Accounts for their Loans at a commercial
bank acceptable to the Bank and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Until the Bank agrees to
disburse on the basis of PMRs, the Bank would make authorized allocations of US$2,000,000 equivalent for
Budapest's Special Account and US$150,000 equivalent for Dunafijvaros' Special Account. Initially for
Budapest, the allocation would be limited to US$1,000,000 equivalent until disbursements have reached
US$3,000,000, then the full authorized allocation could be disbursed. Initially for Dunaujvaros, the allocation
would be limited to US$75,000 equivalent until disbursements have reached US$200,000 before the full
authorized allocation could be disbursed. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account not made on the
basis of the PMR would be submitted monthly or when 20% of the initial deposit has been utilized, whichever
occurs earlier. Each replenishment application not made on the basis of a PMR would be supported by the
necessary documentation, a bank statement of the Special Account and a reconciliation statement of the Special
Account against Bank records. Once the Borrowers complete their action plans and receive their financial
management certifications, then the Bank would make deposits to their Special Accounts based on PMRs
submitted quarterly. The amount of each withdrawal would be based on a projection of eligible expenditures for
the next six months from the date of the PMR except that the balance in the special account would not exceed
US$3,000,000 equivalent for Budapest and US$300,000 equivalent for Dunauijvaros.
Retroactive Financing Both Borrowers had expected loan negotiations to take place in mid-1997 and
planned their procurement accordingly. The Bank expecting early negotiations also approved advance
contracting for both Borrowers (a US$9 million equivalent contract for Duna(ujvarosand a US$18 million
equivalent contract for Budapest). Budapest made the first payment on their contract in January 1, 1998.
Dunauijvaros is expected to make its first payment in September 1999. Budapest has requested retroactive
financing in the amount of EUR 9.3 million for eligible expenditures from January 1, 1998. Dunauijvaroshas
requested retroactive financing in the amount of EUR 200,000 for expenditures after January 1, 1999.
Budapest's request represents 30% of their Loan amount for expenditures 18 months from the proposed date of
loan signing and requires a waiver which has been approved by the RVP. The retroactive financing for
Dunafijvaros does not exceed the normal limits and does not require a waiver.

Section 2: Capacity of the Implementing Agency in Procurement and Technical Assistance Requirements
Municipality of Budapest. The BMSC Engineering Department under the PIU will have primary responsibility for procurement.
They will be assisted by consultants who will prepare the bidding documents and supervise the technical implementation of the
contracts. The BMSC Department includes six engineers with experience in implementing large infrastructure projects and carrying
out the related procurement. The Departrnent Director recently transferred from the Municipality's Utilities Departnent where he
had primary responsibility for the World Bank funded Urban Transport Project and as a result became familiar with World Bank
procurement guidelines. Contract awards are made by one-time evaluation committees comprising representatives of the
Municipality, the BMSC and the responsible government ministry. The committees are advised by the consultants who prepared the
bidding documents. The S&I contract has already been successfully awarded for the South Pest WWTP Liquid Phase following the
World Bank procurement guidelines and advance contracting requirements.
Municipality of Dunaujvaros. The Municipality's Development Department whose director will is also the director of the PIU
will be responsible for all procurement. The Development Department has a permanent staff of six professionals, three of whom are
engineers. All are experienced in procurement associated with implementing municipal investments. Engineering designs and
bidding documents have been prepared by local consultants and reviewed by international consultants under contract to EU Phare.
Contract awards are made by one-time committees similar to Budapest evaluation committees. The S&I and Goods contracts for the
WWTP have already been successfully awarded-the S&I contract according the World Bank procurement guidelines and advance
contracting procedures and the equipment supply contract according to EC guidelines. The only procurement remaining is for the
consultancies for construction supervision and the studies.
Country Procurement Assessment Report: March 1997.      Status of bidding documents for procurement actions as a
percentage of project cost: contracts signed andl.or awarded -
30%; bid documents ready - 35%; bid documents still under
I preparation - 35%.

Explain briefly the Procurement Monitor System: The ECSIN procurement monitoring system will be used to ensure that the ECA
service standards are meet for all procurement. All incoming procurement is logged and then sent to the responsible Procurement
Proficient Staff (PPS) for action. If the responsible PPS is out of the office, the Program Team Assistant is responsible for ensuring
that an alternate takes the necessary action.
Co-financing: The Project is being co-financed by EU Phare. The each project has been divided into contracts that can be parallel
financed so that there will be no conflict between procurement guidelines.
Section 4: Procurement Staffing
The Procurement Staff as part of the team is: Takao Ikegami (ECSIN); Gyorgy Novotry (ECSHD)
Review of all advance procurement has been carried out under the close scrutiny and review of a PPS at World Bank headquarters.
The remaining procurement and implementation will be monitored by a PPS at the Resident Mission in Budapest. Given that there
are only eight contracts subject to prior review and two have already been awarded successfully, the procurement review requirements
can be easily accommodated with the current staff at headquarters and at the Budapest Resident Mission.

Hungary: Municipal Wastewater Project
Development of Project Financial Management System
The Financial Management System already in place uses rational internal control concepts,
including separation of duties and authorization as well as three levels of independent control in the
disbursement process. A legal and standard chart of accounts is used, the legal books are maintained by
an external accountant finn, and the budgeting and planning system is regulated by law, including the
submission of reports to the auditor for an opinion on the projected data before their submission to the
Council. The maintenance of an analytical accounting system for all departments is mandatory.
Although auditors (who are members of the Hungarian Chamber of Auditors) are appointed, their
opinions are not expressed according to international standards on auditing. A manual of procedures has
been issued by the Municipality of Dunaujvaros with the assistance of an external consultant and
according to the ISO 9001 requirements. However some key elements of a complete FMS are still in
process, including: (i) finalization and adoption of the chart of accounts, issuance of a manual of
accounting procedures and internal control guidelines, and computerization of the FMS, etc.; (ii)
appointment of a firm of Chartered Accountants as auditors whose qualifications are acceptable to the
Bank; (iii) strengthening of the Project Management Unit's (PMU) human resources; and (iv)
improvement of the analytical system, including the testing of the Project Management Report (PMR).
These are expected to be in place by March 31, 1999.
The target date for the conversion to new procedures based on Project Management Reports
(PMRs), following the assessment of the financial management system and the certification of the
satisfactory operation of the system, is December 1, 1999
Disbursements
Assessment of Financial Management System: The accounting and financial management
systems in place in the two municipalities have similar elements:
*  The budgeting and planning system is regulated by law. Budget-related reports are subject to the
auditors' control at the projection stage, and again before the actual data are presented to the board.
The format and contents of the reports are defined by the same regulation.
*  The financial management system in place includes three levels of control before disbursements are
made. The first is the responsibility of the budget unit, the second is at the level at the commercial
bank in charge of executing payment, and the last is the auditor. In the case of grant financing, a
supplementary control is exercised by the National Treasury.
*  According to the local regulation, an auditor member of the Hungarian Chambers of Auditors has to
be appointed. Auditors are selected through national competitive tendering
*  The staffing seems to be adequate in terms of number and capability, however there is no official
training program covering all staff; each department manages its own needs.
Municipality of Budapest
* The accounting system is based on the outline of the budget component, and is on a cash basis. An
external accountant firm maintains the records in accordance with the legal chart of accounts and
related principals. The general ledger is transmitted on a monthly basis. Accounting outputs are
submitted to the departments for double checking and reconciliation with the support documents.
Because of the cash basis system, a parallel analytical accounting system is mandatory for all the
departments for following up their own activities. However, because bookkeeping is out sourced, the



Page 54
analytical system cannot be integrated through a computerized interface. It should be noted that the
figures are subject to control and reconciliation via the analytical system, even if auditors express
their opinions based on legal records.
* The internal control system is based on the separation of duties, however this aspect has not yet been
fully developed. A manual of procedures outlining each department's job description and
responsibilities, the internal control procedures, and banking and cash procedures, is needed.
*  The Project Management structure, consisting of six full time highly qualified staff, is adequate in
terms of project implementation and management. Many projects with international financing are
being managed, and the staff is familiar with the World Bank requirements, guidelines and way of
working. However because the accounting system is maintained on a cash basis, an adequate
reporting system should be developed in order to produce meaningful, relevant and timely accounting
information.
Municipality of Dunaujviros
*  The accounting system in Dunailjvaros is also based on the outline of the budget component, and is on
a cash basis. An intemal accountant, assisted by six people in charge of data preparation, control, and
reconciliation, maintains the records in the finance department. The accounting system is maintained
on a daily basis, with an official printout of the general ledger at the end of each month. The system
is computerized and protected in terms of access and handling; however back-up of the accounting
data is done on a monthly basis and there is no specific arrangement for data protection. As in
Budapest, there is a mandatory parallel analytical accounting system for all departments, but no direct
computer link between the two systems.
- The internal control system was developed recently with the assistance of a consultant (Chartered
Accountant). The manual of procedures reflecting the job description and responsibilities as well as
the transaction flows has been issued according to ISO 9001, and meets the total quality requirements.
The final set up of this new system is planned during the fiscal year 1999.
*  A computerized management information system is planned, however the resources needed for this
project are not yet allocated.
*  Project management is the responsibility of the City Development Department. This department has
12 full time staff, most of whom are engineers in charge of physical project implementation. A
financial specialist with accountant skills is responsible for the project's financial management. The
department's level of activity requires reinforcement of its human resources by appointment of
additional staff or hiring of short-term consultants.
Completion of the Financial Management System
Although most elements of the current financial management systems in the two municipalities
are, on the whole, satisfactory, some elements are still in process and some need strengthening, and there
is therefore scope for improvement, including: (i) creation of a chart of accounts specific to the project,
and issuance of an accounting manual of procedures to ensure that financial information is provided in
clear, simple, user-friendly and consistent form; (ii) organization of the Project Management Unit and
strengthening in terms of human resources; (iii) issuance of the guidelines for internal control procedures;
(iv) implementation of the Project Management Report sample; (v) imprevement of the analytical
reporting system, and (vi) identification of an extemal auditor.
There is also a need for: (i) timely preparation and audit of financial statements to enhance their
credibility; (ii) use of financial reporting/financial statements as a project management tool (i.e., active
use of financial information in decision-making) to improve accountability; (iii) enhanced transparency



Page 55
and consistency of activities and expenditures charged as project expenditure by the two implementing
agencies; and (iv) ensuring that all project-related activities are reflected in the project accounts and
financial statements.
Financial and Accounting Policies: Financial and accounting policies for the project -- crucial
for ensuring transparency, providing clarity to the various stakeholders and finance staff, ensuring
uniformity, and enforcing accountability - need to be developed. These policies should cover, inter alia:
(i) the classification of project expenditures; (ii) expenditures eligible for reimbursement from the Bank
Credit; and (iii) project accounting policies. They would be gradually expanded and refined to include
aspects such as efficient management and deployment of funds, internal control policies, etc. The two
Municipalities would comply with the financial and accounting policies of the project indicated in the
Manual.
Project Accounting System: Each Municipality would be responsible for overall project
financial management and accounting, including maintaining project accounts, preparing and
disseminating financial statements and financial management reports, and ensuring timely audit of
financial statements.
The overall principles for project accounting include:
(i) Books of project accounts would be maintained on cash bookkeeping principles. Project
accounts would be maintained using the existing computerized accounting system; and the system would
be completed by maintaining the analytical and reporting financial system to reflect all the transaction
flows.
(ii) Project accounting would cover all sources (including beneficiary contributions), and all
uses by all implementing agencies of project funds. All project-related transactions, whether involving
cash or not, would be taken into account in the analytical system. Disbursements by the World Bank and
from the Special Accounts would also be included in the project accounting system. Funds received from
different sources would be identified separately and reflected in the project accounts.
(iii) Project-related transactions and activities would be distinguished from other activities of
each Municipality. This distinction would be effected at the data-capture stage. An identifiable Trial
Balance for the project, capturing all project receipts, expenditures, and other payments under the project,
would be prepared. A Chart of Accounts for the project, conforming to the classification of expenditures
and sources of funds indicated in the project documents (Project Implementation Plan, Project Appraisal
Document, and COSTAB model) needs to be prepared. The Chart of Accounts enables data to be
captured in a manner that will facilitate financial reporting of project expenditures by: (a) project
component; (b) expenditure category; and (iii) disbursement category.
(iv) A system of reconciliation between the Project Financial Statements /financial reports and
the legal books of accounts would be clearly defined.
(v) Physical information on key performance indicators which can be readily linked to financial
costs would be maintained as part of the project financial management system. Initially this would be
maintained for some high cost items which account for a significant portion of project cost, and for which
data on physical activities can be easily captured. These items have been identified and indicated in the
Internal Control Guidelines. This list would be gradually expanded during implementation.
Information Flow for Accounting Purposes
(i) Each Municipality would generate and maintain vouchers and supporting documentation for
expenditures on activities it directly manages;
(ii) Expenditures incurred by all implementing agencies would be audited by the project auditors
(Chartered Accountants); and



Page 56
(iii) This system would be reviewed in the light of implementation experience, and modified as
necessary.
Internal Controls
The project financial management system includes the following internal control mechanisms:
(i) operation of a budgeting system, and regular monitoring of actual financial performance
with budgets and targets;
(ii) adoption and operation of simple, clear and transparent financial and accounting policies
which would govern financial management of, and accounting for, the project (as described earlier).
These policies and procedures are included in the Financial Management Manual;
(iii) at the transaction level, establishment and operation of policies, procedures and systems for
ensuring standard internal controls such as checking of expenditures, appropriate documentation, levels of
authorization, segregation of duties, periodic reconciliation, physical verification, etc. These policies and
procedures would be reviewed and updated periodically; and
(iv) establishment and operation of a comprehensive audit mechanism, including concurrent
audit (as described below).
Financial Management Reports
Quarterly financial management reports for the project would be generated from the
computerized financial management system. These reports would be management-oriented (i.e.,
summaries rather than transactional details) and would be used for project management by each
Municipality. The reports would include: (i) a comparison of budgeted and actual expenditure and
analysis of major variances, including variances in sources and application of funds (by components, and
expenditure categories), and in physical parameters and unit rates for selected key items; (ii) expenditures
by disbursement categories; and (iii) forecasts for the next 2 quarters. Formats of the reports should be
part of the Financial Management Manual.
Annual Audited Project Financial Statements (PFS) would be submitted to the Bank. PFS
would include: (i) a statement of sources and utilization of funds or Balance Sheet, indicating funds
received from various sources, project expenditures, and assets and liabilities of the project; and including
appropriate schedules classifying project expenditures by components, expenditure categories, and
implementing agencies; (ii) a Special Account Reconciliation Statement; and (iii) a Statement of
Withdrawals from the Bank loan made on the basis of SOEs. Audited PFS would be submitted to the
Bank not later than 6 months after the end of the Fiscal Year.
Auditing Arrangements
For each Municipality, the accounts and financial statements of the Municipality and of the
project would be audited by a firm of Chartered Accountants, who would be the Project Auditor. The
annual audited financial statements would be submitted to the Bank within 6 months of the close of the
Municipality's fiscal year. The Terrns of Reference (TOR) and qualifications of the Project Auditor are
included in the Financial Management Manual and require approval by the Bank. The cost of the audit by
the firm of Chartered Accountants would be eligible for financing by the Bank, and the Bank's Guidelines
for selection of consultants would apply.
For each Municipality, the audit by the Project Auditor would cover all aspects of the project (i.e.,
all sources and utilization of funds, and expenditures incurred); and would be carried out in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing. The TORs for the Project Auditor includes audit of financial
transactions, and assessment of the operation of the financial management system, including review of
internal control mechanisms. Each Municipality would provide the Project Auditor with access to



Page 57
project-related documents and records, and other information required for the audit. The Project Auditor
would carry out a concurrent audit during the fiscal year, to bring any outstanding issues to management's
attention. This would strengthen internal controls, and facilitate early completion of the annual audit.
Readiness for Implementation and Next Steps
Financial Management System: The design of the Financial Management System is
substantially advanced. A Financial Management Manual documenting the financial management system
has to be prepared; and will be finalized shortly after review by the Bank and incorporation of
suggestions.
Appointment of Auditors: Draft TORs for financial audit of the project have been prepared;
and recruitment of a firm of Chartered Accountants as project auditors for the first year is expected by
March 31, 1999.
Recruitment of Key Staff: The recruitment and the official designation of the additional key
staff as part of the Project Management Unit has been agreed and the appointment is expected by
April 30, 1999.
Risks
There are two main risks relating to financial management aspects: (i) that the municipalities fail
to maintain the books as required and (ii) that the municipalities experience delays in preparation of
project management reports, or that the reports will be of unsatisfactory quality. These risks are
considered manageable because of the mitigation measures outlined below. These aspects will be
monitored closely as part of project supervision.
The risk that accounts are not appropriately maintained is mitigated by: (i) maintenance of project
accounts by each Municipality, and establishment of financial policies and procedures which would
govern project expenditures; and (ii) audit of expenditure, including concurrent audit, by the Project
Auditor (Chartered Accountants). The risk of delays or unsatisfactory quality in project management
reports are mitigated by the substantial up front actions which have been taken, or are being taken, on: (i)
design of a comprehensive financial management system; (ii) computerization of the Project Management
Report; and (iii) recruitment of key staff to reinforce management capabilities. Pending the appointment
of the qualified professional staff, disbursements from the Bank Credit will not be made on the basis of
Project Management Reports (PMRs), but will rather be made on the traditional reimbursement basis.
Disbursements will be converted to the PMR-based method, after the financial management system is
satisfactorily operational.
