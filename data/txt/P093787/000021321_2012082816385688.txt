Amendment of the Loan Agreement
Excellency:
We refer to the Loan Agreement entered into between the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the State of Bahia (the Borrower) dated
December 9, 2010 (the Loan Agreement) for the above-captioned Project. Capitalized terms used
in this letter (Amendment Letter) and not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the
Loan Agreement.
We are pleased to inform you that pursuant to COFIEX's communication to the Bank
dated April 11, 2012 and our recent discussions, the Bank hereby agrees to amend the Loan
Agreement so as to reallocate funds from Category 6 to Category 2 and to include "goods" as an
expenditure to be financed by the Bank under Category 2. Consequently, the Loan Agreement is
amended to read as follows:
1.     The table set forth in Section IV A.2 of Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement is replaced to
read in its entirety as set forth in the Attachment to this Amendment Letter.
All other provisions of the Loan Agreement, except as amended herein, shall remain in
full force and effect.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating all the
originals of this Amendment Letter in the space provided below, and returning one fully signed
original to us. This Amendment Letter shall become effective as of the date of its
countersignature upon receipt by the Bank of one duly executed original.
