                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project would increase social and economic opportunities for the rural poor in Bahia by improving their access to basic socioeconomic infrastructure, thus
                         contributing to the Borrower's objective of increasing the HDI. While building on the CDD approach proven successful under the first phase of Produzir, the second
                         phase would improve on this experience by: (a) integrating with and/or complementing activities of other Bank loans for the State (under the Bahia State Program),
                         particularly the PGRH and Viver Melhor Urbano II; (b) strengthening the cross-sectoral integration and providing significantly more emphasis on education, health,
                         culture, natural resources management and environmental sustainability; and (c) scaling up the impact on poverty by using the skills, social capital and experience of
                         the Municipal Councils and community associations to improve the relevance, efficiency, sustainability, targeting and outcomes of non-project State and Federal
                         investments in rural Bahia.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Bahia State Integrated Project: Rural Poverty completed its first phase on July 31, 2010. At the close of this first phase, the project had benefited some 168,000 families (98% of
                         Project Development Objective Indicator) with 1,835 small-scale community investments totaling US$104 million across 392 targeted municipalities statewide. The Additional
                         Financing (AF) loan of US$30.0 million, which became Effective on January 24, 2011, financed the project's second phase and is totally disbursed prior its closing date on January
                         31, 2014. The second phase has financed a total of 1,038 community investments that are extending project benefits, principally in water, sanitation and productive inclusion (e.g.,
                         agricultural mechanization) directly, to 112,258 rural poor families in the project area. The project has been able to leverage additional project resources from Federal and State
                         programs in an amount equivalent to US$ 220 million.
