It is expected that with the actions to be\n            implemented by the Sustainable Rural Development Project,\n            the State of Bahia can more rapidly improve the quality of\n            life of the poorest municipalities and, consequently the\n            state. The proposed project interventions will be\n            small-scale, demand-driven investments (i.e., subprojects).\n            These subprojects will not cause significant adverse\n            environmental impacts, related mainly to infrastructure\n            development (i.e., water, sanitation and rural roads), new\n            agricultural practices (i.e., product diversification,\n            conservation agriculture, promotion of value added products,\n            and product certification). The project will also provide\n            guidance on: (i) identifying the potential social,\n            environmental and distributive impacts associated with the\n            typology of project investments; (ii) minimizing potential\n            impacts for productive and infrastructure subprojects; (iii)\n            specifying procedures to be used in assessing environmental\n            and social impacts during the subproject design stage; and\n            (iv) addressing identified impacts during subproject implementation."}, "docdt": "2014-03-01T08:35:03Z"}
