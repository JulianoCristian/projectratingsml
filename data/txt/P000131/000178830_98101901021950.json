The\n            project achieved some of its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was significant, sustainability is\n            likely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Two main lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, in order to encourage the creation of\n            entrepreneurship and employment in Botswana, the BDC could\n            have worked out a scheme with the Government whereby the\n            latter would subsidize or underwrite a portion of the risks\n            on assisting projects which BDC considered\n            \"sub-commercial\". Second, since the BDC has yet to\n            go a long way in training the local staff to assume higher\n            responsibilities in the future, the need for operations and\n            accounting manuals cannot be overemphasized."}, "docdt": "1983-03-16T00:00:00Z"}
