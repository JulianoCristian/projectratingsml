INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO
SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES LIMITED
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF PAKISTAN

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES IIMATED
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$8 million to
Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNCPL).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        On July 2, 1968 Executive Directors considered my Report P-617
which recommended a Bank loan to, and an IFC investment in, Dawood Hercules
Chemicals Limited, to construct a fertilizer plant outside Lahore which
would supply urea fertilizer to the surrounding agricultural area.   At that
time it was mentioned that the operation of the Dawood Hercules Plant, and
a similar plant to be built in the same area by a company sponsored by the
Adamiee group and American Cyanamid Company (Adamjee-Cyanamid), would re-
quire considerable quantities of natural gas from the Sui fields in Central
West Pakistan for use as feedstock. I also indicated that Bank financing
was under consideration for the proposed Adamjee-Cyanamid plant as well as
for the necessary expansion of SNGPL's transmission facilities. The SNGPL
Project had in fact been appraised in February 1968 on the assumption that
SNGPL would supply natural gas for both fertilizer projects, and negotiations
for a loan of $12 million for this purpose were held in July 1968.
3.        Since then the Government of Pakistan has decided that the
authorization for a second urea plant in West Pakistan should go to another
group (Hyesons-Kaiser) whose plans for construction were further advanced
than Adamjee-Cyanamid and who proposed to construct their plant near, and
draw their supplies from the neighboring Mari gas fields. In view of this,
Adamjee-Cyanamid, who shared the Bank Group's view that the market prospects
for nitrogenous fertilizer in West Pakistan did not warrant early conetruc-
tion of additional urea plant in the area, withdrew their request for Bank
financing. Meanwhile SNGPL had been advised to prepare a mcdified project
against such a contingency. This revised project was appraised in December
1968 and forms the basis of the loan which is proposed in this report.
4.        The large gas field at Sui was discovered in the desert of Central
West Pakistan in 1952 by Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL). PPL sells raw
gas to SNCPL and to Sui Gas Transmission Company (SGTC). The gas purifica-
tion facilities at Sui are owned and operated by SGTC which purifies gas
for its own transmission system as well as for SNGPL. A Tripartite
Agreement of 1964 between PPL, SGTC and SNGPL fixes the quantity and price
of raw gas to be delivered by PPL to SGTC to cover the needs of SGTC and
SNGPL, and the quantity and price of purified ?as to be delivered by SGTC to
SNGPL. This Agreement is currently being renegotiated.

5.        The Bank has made two previous loans for natural gas transmission
projects in West Pakistan. The first loan (99-PAK) for $14 million -was
to SGTC in 1954 to help finance the construction of a pipeline from Sui
to Karachi.  The second (377-PAK) was a $15 million loan to SNGPL in 1964
to help finance the extension of the Sui-Multan line north-ward. Both
projects were successfully executed and the loans have been fully disbursed.
6.        The Government of Pakistan was represented in the negotiations
which took place between July 11 and July 17 last year by Mr. A.R. Bashir,
Economic Minister of the Embassy of Pakistan. Representing SNGPL were Mr.
S.M. Nasim, Member of Board of SNGPL and Director of West Pakistan
Industrial Development Corporation (WPIDC), Mr. D.C. Floyer, Member of Board
of SNGPL and Chief Representative of Burmab Oil Company in Pakistan (BOC)
and Mr. M.A.K. Alizai, General Manager of SNGPL. There were no formal nego-
tiations for the loan proposed for the revised project, but the concurrence
of the Borrower and the Guarantor have been obtained for the necessary
changes in the loan documents.
7.        As at March 31, 1969 the Bank had made 28 loans to Pakistan,
totalling about $592 million, of which 17 are fully disbursed. The
Association had made 26 credits, totalling about $3h8.5 million, of which
six are fully disbursed. The following is a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits to Pakistan as at March 31, 1969:

8.        I have mentioned from time to time in previous reports the
difficulties experienced in some of our projects in Pakistan. I have
nothing further to report at this time. The present political uncertainty,
if continued, could adversely affect the implementation of some projects.
The situation is being watched carefully.
9.        IFC has made eleven commitments in Pakistan totalling $28 million.
The outstanding commitment net of repayments, cancellation and sales of
loans, is about $22 million. IFC is presently considering applications for
investment in engineering and chemical industries. The IFC operations in
Pakistan are proceeding satisfactorily.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
10.       Borrower:                Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited
(SNGPL).
Guarantor:               Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Amount:                  $8.0 million in various currencies.
Purpose:                 To finance most of the foreign exchange
costs of expanding the capacity of
SNGPL's transmission system to meet the
natural gas requirements of a new ferti-
lizer plant in Lahore, and of providing
additional disbribution facilities in
various urban areas in West Pakistan.
Amortization:            In 20 years including a 3 year period
of grace through semi-annual installments

PART III - THE PROJECT
i.        The project is more fully described in the attached Appraisal
Report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Project,"
(TO-657b) dated March 21, 1969.   It is designed to increase the capacity
of SNGPL's pipeline system from 172 to 207 million cubic feet (NNcf) per
day to enable the company to carry out its contractual obligation to deliver
supplies of gas up to 35 NMcf daily to the fertilizer plant being constructed
by Da-wood-Hercules Chemicals Ltd. Provision has also been made in the pro-
ject for completing the automation of the pipeline system and for a modest
expansion of the existing distribution system to serve small industry and
household requirements in certain areas.
12.       SNGPL, which  as incorporated in Pakistan in 1963 to take over,
extend and operate gas pipelines previously owned by the Government of
Pakistan and Attock Oil Company, has an authorized share capital of PRs.
400 million. It has a paid-in capital of PRs. 100 million held in equal
proportions by BOC, an international oil company registered in the United
Kingdom, WPIDC, a government financed and controlled investment corporation,
and the general public of Pakistan. Most of SNGPL's sales are to major
industrial consumers and to the West Pakistan Water and Power Development
Authority for the generation of electricity. The financial condition of
the Borrowjer is sound.
13.       The total cost of the project is estimated at PRs. 85.72 million
(US$18 million) with a foreign exchange component of PRs. 44.05 million
(US$9.25 million). The proposed $8 million Bank Loan will cover foreign
exchange expenditures equivalent to PRs. 38.05 million. BOC will provide
the balance of foreign exchange required (PRs. 6 million) through its
participation in an offering by the Borrower of ordinary shares amounting
to PRs. 18 million. IWPIDC wil1 subscribe PRs. 6 million to this issue
and the remaining PRs. 6 million will be offered to the Pakistan public.
SNGPL will finance the balance of local currency expenditures and any
cost overruns through its own resources and by raising local loans. The
conclusion of satisfactory arrangements for the provision of this financing
is a condition of effectiveness of the loan (Section 7.01(a)(b) and (c)).
1h.       The proposed Bank loan would help finance the foreign exchange
cost of the procurement and installation of high pressure transmission
pipelines and compressor units, the construction of a new compressor
station and additional low pressure distribution facilities in certain
urban areas. In addition provision has been made in the loan to finance
the foreign exchange costs of detailed engineering and the preparation of
contract documents, assistance in evaluation of bids, and supervision of
the construction and operation of the expanded system. These services will
be provided by Burmah Oil Company (Pakistan Trading), a subsidiary of BOC,
under an agreement the execution of which in a form satisfactory to the
Bank is a condition of effectiveness of the loan (Section 7.01(e)).



- 7 -
15.       The Bank has been informed by SGTC of the financial and technical
arrangements it is making to purify the increased quantities of gas required
by SNGPL. These arrangements are satisfactory. 'Negotiations are underway,
however, for a revision of the Tripartite Agreement of 1964 to reflect the
increased needs of SNGPL and to take into account also an increase in SGTC's
charges for purification which came into effect on August 1, 1968. The
execution of the amending agreement in a form satisfactory to the Bank is
a condition of effectiveness of the loan (Section 7.01(d)) and is expected
to be completed by Nay 1969.
16.       Projected cash generation is adequate to ensure servicing of the
total long-term debt. To help assure adequate debt service coverage, the
Loan Agreement places conditions upon SNGPL's right to declare dividends
(Section 5.11), incur debt (Section 5.13), and make capital expenditures
outside the project (Section 5.10).  To ensure further that SNGPL will be
able to generate cash sufficient to meet its financial obligations, the Loan
Agreement provides that SNGPL will establish and maintain tariffs for the
supply of gas which will be sufficient to produce an annual return (before
interest and taxes) on the value of the net fixed assets in operation of
not less than 10 percent for each fiscal year through July 31, 1973 and of
not less than 12 percent thereafter (Section 5.12). The Guarantee Agreement
obligates the Government to grant gas tariffs to SNGPL needed to comply
with this rate covenant (Section 3.06).
17.       The Government of Pakistan will guarantee the loan and has
informed the Bank that it intends to charge the Borrower a guarantee fee
at a rate which would increase the cost to the Borrower, including the
interest charged by the Bank, to 71 percent.
18.       Construction is due to begin in March 1970 and the project is
expected to be completed by September 30, 1971. The schedule for con-
struction provides for increase in pipeline capacity in phase with the
scheduled completion of the new fertilizer plant. The project is techni-
cally feasible and financially viable. Work on the Dawood Hercules
Fertilizer Project has begun and so far is proceeding according to schedule.
19.       Fertilizer production is an important element in the Government's
efforts to increase agricultural output and in particular to maintain
self-sufficiency in foodgrains. The project will thus contribute materially
to the economy of Pakistan. As pointed out in paragraph 7.08 of the
Appraisal Report, various analyses were undertaken to compare the total
costs of manufacturing the fertilizer in Pakistan with that of fertilizer
imports. The rates of return for the whole complex ranged between 15
percent and 29 percent, with 20 percent being considered as the most
likely return.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
20.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and SNGPL, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the pro-
posed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
21.       The draft Loan Agreement generally follows the pattern of
agreements for loans to private companies in Pakistan and of the agreement
for the previous loan to SNGPL. The Borrower would modify the trust deed
securing the previous Bank loan to SNGPL in order to secure this loan also
by the first specific mortgage upon the Borrower's immovable and other
properties and the first floating charge upon the Borrower's assets and
undertaking constituted by the trust deed. (Section 5.04). IWithdrawals
from the Loan Account would be, unless the Bank otherwise agrees, limited
to $2,000,000 until the required deeds and other instruments have been
executed and registered. (Section 2.02(b)). The Bank would be entitled
to suspend the loan in the event of suspension or cancellation of the Bank
loan for the Dawood-Hercules Fertilizer Project which provides the justifi-
cation for the SNGPL Project. (Section 6.03(b)).
22.       The draft Guarantee Agreement is in the usual form.  As in the
past, the execution of the Guarantee Agreement on behalf of the Guarantor,
will be authorized by the President of Pakistan in the exercise of the
powers vested in him by the 1962 Constitution.  Following the resignation
of President Ayub Khan on March 25, 1969, martial law was proclaimed in
Pakistan by General Yahya Khan and the 1962 Constitution was abrogated, but
provision was made for the continued application of the provisions of said
Constitution relating to the office of the President and that office was
assumed by General Yahya Khan.
23.       A cement company has brought suit against SNGPL seeking substantial
damages for allegedly wrongful delay on the part of SNGPL in providing gas
to the cement company and challenging as illegal certain SNGPL rates estab-
lished in an agreement between SNGPL and the cement company and approved by
the Government. The suit is presently in its preliminary stages. The Bank
has been advised by trial counsel for SNGPL that in their opinion the suit
is without merit. The Legal Department has examined this opinion, which
has been given by a well-known and experienced law firm in Pakistan, and
believes that the opinion is a reasonable one.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
24.       The economic mission returned from Pakistan last February.  Its
report on the economic position and prospects of Pakistan will be distributed
during the next few days.

PART VI - COITLIA_ICE IJITH ARTICLES OF AGRTEAMINT
25.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOTIETDATION
26.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
