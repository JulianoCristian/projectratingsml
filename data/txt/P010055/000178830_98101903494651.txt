APFRAISAL OF THE SECOTD
SUI NORTHERN rAS PTIDELINES PROJECT
SUNMARY
i.        The Bank has been asked to assist in financing a oroject to expand
the capacity of a natural gas pineline system in the northern nart of West
Pakistan. The nroposed loan of US$8 million equivalent would be to Sui
Northern las Pipelines Ltd. (SNGPL), a gas transmission company to which the
Bank made a loan of US$15 million equivalent in 1964. The Bank loan would
cover 85 nercent of the foreign exchange cost of the project.
ii.       The Project is designed to increase the capacity of the pipeline
system from 172 to 207 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day to meet the demand
for natural gas of a new fertilizer olant in the Lahore area for which the
Bank has made a loan in July 1968. Also included in the project is the
expansion of low pressure distribution facilities.
iii.      SNGPL is a limited liability company in which the Government holds
a one-third interest. It transmits natural gas from the Sui field in
Central West Pakistan to the Lahore and Rawaloindi areas in the north.  Most
of its sales are to industrial customers, such as cement, textile and
fertilizer ulants, and to the West Pakistan Water and Power Development
Authority (WAPDA) for the generation of electricity. The financial condition
of the Company is sound.
iv.       The exnansion project involves a capital expenditure of US$18
million equivalent of which 52 percent or US$9.3 equivalent is in foreign
exchange. The foreign exchange component in excess of the proposed $8
million Bank loan, and the local currency component, will be financed by
an increase in equity and by local loans, in accordance with a satisfactory
financing plan.
v.        The project is technically and economically sound, and it is
expected that the financial condition of the Company after the proposed
expansion project will continue to be sound, allowing the ComDany to pay a
dividend of 10 percent per year and to increase its reserves.
vi.       The loan of US$15 million equivalent made in 1964 to SNGPL has
been fully disbursed. Another loan of US$14 million equivalent to the
Sui Gas Transmission Company, which delivers gas to Karachi, was made in
1954. The performance of both borrowers has been satisfactory.
vii.      With the agreements reached during loan negotiations with SNGPL
and the Government, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$8 million
equivalent to be made to SNGPL. A term of 20 years, including a grace
period of three year is appropriate.



PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND
SUI NORTHERN GA.S PIPELINES PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Bank has been asked by Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. (SNGPL)
for a Bank loan of US$8 million to help finance most of the foreign exchange
cost of a US$18 million expansion program, to meet the demand for natural gas
of a proposed fertilizer plant in the Lahore area and to expand low pressure
distribution facilities. The Government of Pakistan has agreed to guarantee
the Bank loan.
1.02      The Bank has previously made two loans for construction of gas
pipelines in Pakistan, the first one to the Sui Gas Transmission Company (9GTC)
in 1954 and the second one to SNGPL in 1964.  Both projects were successfully
executed and the loans have been fully disbursed. Both companies derive
their gas from a large gas field, discovered at Sui in the desert of central
West Pakistan in 1952. The discovery was made by Pakistan Petroleum Limited,
a subsidiary of Burmah Oil Company (Pakistan Trading), which is itself a
subsidiary of Burmah Oil Company Ltd. (BOC). The shortage of other fuels
in the country prompted the Government, in co-operation with private industry,
to seek the rapid development of this important source of energy.
1.03      SGTC had delivered gas to Karachi since 1955, and SNGPL to the
Lahore and Rawalpindi areas since 1965. Both are limited liability companies
in which the Government participates, holding a one-fourth interest in SGTC
and a one-third interest in SNGPL.
1.04     Trhe construction of a fertilizer plant in the Lahore area, for which
a Bank loan was signed on July 10, 1968 and in which IFC is making an equity
investment, requires large quantities of gas as a raw material. This makes
an increase in the capacity of SNGPL's pipeline system necessary.
1.05      The production of fertilizer is an important element in the Govern-
ment's efforts to increase agricultural output and in particular to attain
self-sufficiency in food grains. Agricultural development has been accorded
a high priority in the Third Five-Year Plan (1965-1970).
1.06      This report is an appraisal of the pipeline expansion project pro-
posed by SNGPL. It is the result of pre-appraisal missions in November 1967,
an appraisal mission in February 1968, and a follow-up mission in April 1968
to assist the Borrower in preparing financial statements. After negotiations
in July 1968, the project was modified because of a reduction in the number
of new fertilizer plants to be served by the pipeline system from twxo to one.
A re-appraisal of the modified project was made in December 1968. Messrs.
D. C. Elliott, financial analyst, and S. M. L. van der Meer, engineer,
participated in the missions and contributed to the writing of the report.
A consultant retained by the Bank, Mr. K. J. Sonney, of Stone & Webster
Service Corporation, participated in the appraisal mission, and Mr. G. J.
Roth, economist, in a pre-appraisal mission.



2. BACKGROUND
Mineral Fuel Resources
2.01      Natural gas reserves constitute by far the most significant known
mineral fuel reserves of West Pakistan. Coal and oil reserves are second
and third, respectively.
2.02      Estimates!/ indicate that West Pakistan has known mineral fuel
resources with an estimated thermal value of about 16,000 x 1012 Btu. A
summary of these estimates is shown below:
Current Estimates of Mineral
Fuel Reserves
(1012 Btu)
Natural Gas                       11,An(Y
Coal                               6,000
Oil                                  200
1o,000
These figures must be carefully interpreted since the estimates for the
different minerals are based on different concepts. For instance, reserve
estimates for gas and oil generally include only deposits which are believed
recoverable with present technology and at a price that might make recovery
economic within the foreseeable future. By contrast, reserve estimates for
coal generally cover all known deposits irrespective of the cost that may
be involved in recovery. Nevertheless, the above figures bring out clear-
ly the dcminant position of natural gas and, if figures were available on
the coal reserves which are likely to be economic to recover, this conclu-
sion would stand out even more clearly.
2.03      The figure for gas reserves needs qualification, since it includes
various fields (see Table 1) with reserve figures of a different degree of
reliability. For instance, the estimate for the Mari field includes proven)
probable and possible reserves, while the estimate for Sui represents
proven reserves. The total also includes such fields as Uch, where gas
quality may preclude other than local use.
Energy Consumption
2.04      The growth of West Pakistan's commercial energy consumption from
1949 to 1964 and the various sources of energy supply are shown in the
following tabulation.
1/ A detailed discussion of WIest Pakistan's energy reserve estimates, on
which the following statement is based, is contained in a 1967 Bank
Study of the Water & Power Resources of West Pakistan, Volume IV,

* Including products refined in the Karachi Refinery from imported
crude.
2.05      The table brings out the great importance of natural gas among
West Pakistan's sources of energy; in 10 years it grew from a negligible
amount to nearly one-quarter of the total commercial energy supplies. By
1967, it had further increased to nearly 30%.
2.06      West Pakistan trade statistics indicate that foreign exchange
expenditure on fuels in 1964 was about PRs 120 million (US$25 million) con-
sisting of PRs 15 million for coal and coke and about PRs 105 million for
petroleum and petroleum products. Most of the petroleum imports were imports
of crude oil to the refineries. Fuel imports made up about 3% of West
Pakistan's total foreign imports, and this proportion appears to have remained
about the same in subsequent years although petroleum has come to assume a
larger role in total energy imports.
Development of Natural Gas Resources
2.07      Since the discovery of natural gas in considerable quantities in
the early 1950's, two gas fields have been developed. One is a relatively
small wet field (i.e. gas along with oil) at Dhulian, in the Rawalpindi
area, and the other a large dry field at Sui, in central West Pakistan.   A
347-mile, 16-inch pipeline was laid from Sui to Karachi in 1955 by SGTC.
In 1958, a 217-mile, 16-inch line was laid from Sui to Multan by the Govern-
ment.  In 1963, a new private company, SiGPL was formed, which bought the
Sui-Multan line and extended it northward to Lyallpur, Lahore and the



Rawalpindi area. In 1967, the Sui system was linked with the small Dhulian
system previously acquired by SNGPL. The location of the existing pipeline
systems is shown on Map I.
2.08      The Dhulian field is operated by the Attock Oil Company (AOC) and
the Sui field by Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. (PPL). At the Dhulian field no
purification of gas is necessary. Purification of all gas at the Sui field
is done by SGTC. A large field at Mari, across the Indus river from Sui,
is now being developed and will come into operation shortly. Esso Standard
(Eastern) has ccmstractad a fertilizer plant close to the field.  There are
a number of other known gas fields in West Pakistan, but their usefulness is
likely to be limited by their small size or low quality of reserves. The
small fields might be linked with existing pipelines, if quality is adequate.
Transmission of low quality gas is not likely to be economically justified.
Previous Loans
2.09      The Bank has made two previous loans for natural gas transmission
projects in West Pakistan. The first one, 99-PAK, was a $14.0 million
equivalent loan to SGTC in 1955, to help finance the construction of the
Sui-Karachi line. The second, 377-PAK, was a $15 million loan to SNGPL in
1964, to help finance the extension of the Sui-Multan line northward. Both
loans are fully disbursed and both borrowers have complied with the require-
ments of the Loan Agreement in a satisfactory manner.
2.10      The U.S. Agency for International Development has also made loans
to SGTC to a total amount of $4.7 million to help finance additional com-
pression and purification facilities. These facilities are now nearing
completion.
3. THE COKPANY
Corporate Structure
3.01      Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. (SNGPL) is a limited liability
company incorporated in Pakistan in 1963 with its registered office and
headquarters in Lahore. It wxas formed in 1963 to take over, extend and
operate gas pipelines previously owned by the Government of Pakistan and
Attock Oil Company. Approximately 300 miles of existing pipeline were taken
over and a further 400 subsequently constructed.
3.02      SNGPL has a contract with the Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. (PPL) for
the supply of natural gas from the Sui field, and with the Sui Gas Transmis-
sion Company (SGTC) for the purification of this gas. The majority of the
shares in all three companies are held by the Government of Pakistan and
the Burmah Oil Company (BOC) although in different proportions in each
company. SNGPL buys gas, arranges for it to be purified, transports it and
sells it to its users.



3.03      The Company has an authorized share capital of PRs 400 million,
of which PRs 100 million have so far been issued. The shares are held in
equal proportions by BOC, West Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation
(ITPIDC), and the general public in Pakistan.
3.04      BOC is an international oil company incorporated in Scotland
with extensive interests in exploration refining and marketing in Asia,
Australia, and North and South America.  Its assets exceed i 250 million
(US$600 million).
3.05      WPIDC is a corporation controlled and financed by the Government
of Pakistan. It has two main activities: setting up and managing industries
unable to attract private capital and investing in private industries which
the Government wishes to encourage. Its total investments amount to over
PRs 670 million including PRs 42 million in the natural gas industry. The
shares of SNGPL were issued in denominations of PRs 10 and are quoted on the
Pakistan stock exchange. Their value has fluctuated from a low of PRs 10.42
in 1965 to a high of PRs 13.75 in September 1967. The average price for
December 1968 was PRs 13.00 giving a yield of 7.7 percent and has remained
reasonably constant since. In connection with the present project, it is
proposed to make a rights issue of a further one million eight hundred
thousand shares of PRs 10 each to be issued at par.
3.06      SNGPL has a Board of Directors composed of nine members including
the Chairman. The Chairman and two other Directors are nominated by WPIDC.
Three Directors are nominated by BOC and three by the general public. The
Board meets at least once a month, and more often if necessary, to make
decisions on policy matters. The day-to-day control of the Company is
exercised by the General Manager.
Organization and Management
3.07      The present company organization is shown in Annex 4. All the
main departments are headed by Pakistani nationals with the exception of
the Engineering Department which is headed by an expatriate from the UK on
secondment from BOC under a technical services agreement between the two
companies. The total number of employees of the Company, other than those
engaged on project construction, was cut from 1,743 in July 1967 to 1,337
in July 1968 and 1,194 in November 1968. This is still high for a pipeline
of this size which has a considerable degree of automation and efforts are
being made to cut down the quantity further and improve the quality as
automation is extended. Labor relations are good and there have been no
strikes.
3.08      Mr. M. A. K. Alizai was appointed General Manager of SNGPL on
June 1, 1968. Mr. Alizai, who had served previously as Joint General
Manager, is a competent Pakistani, well-trained in the oil industry.



- 6 -
3.09      The performance of the accounting department is deficient in
various respects. Trial balances are produced four months late. The year
end accounts of July 1967 were only published on the 6th January 1968. The
original financial projections prepared for submission to the Government
and Bank had many deficiencies. Foreign currency requirements were under-
estimated.   S1\!GPL has made suitable- staff arrangements to improve the
performance of the accounting department.
3.10      In the past SNGPL has relied heavily on BOC to provide experienced
technical personnel in key positions and has operated its highly automated
gas transmission system efficiently. The number of expatriate personnel
has gradually been reduced as the volume of design and construction work
diminished and local personnel were trained in the day-to-day operation of
the system. After completion of the proposed exoansion project, the system
jill be fully automated. Such automation, which uses a large amount of
sophisticated equipment, is entirely dependent on the control and com-
munications system for effective operation. The communications, operating
and control systems must be properly maintained which requires a fairly high
level of technical competence. To maintain a thin wall, high strength steel
pipe in a corrosive environment, adequate protection from corrosion is
essential. There is no margin for poor operating and maintenance practices.
Tn view of this, the Bank has insisted that BOC1s Services Agreement should
be extended until December 31, 1974 (see para. 6.17).
Facilities
3.11      The present facilities of SNGPL consist of a pipeline system
extending northward from the Sui Gas fields to the Rawalpindi area and are
w-ell maintained. The principal elements of the system are a 700-mile,
high pressure, transmission line from the Sui fields to Sultan, Lyallpur,
Lahore, Dandot and Wah, four compression stations, 18 repeater stations and
300 miles of low pressure distribution lines. Except for the Sui-PIultan
portion of the line, the transmission system is completely automated and
operated from a control center at Lyallpur.
3.12      The 16-inch diameter Sui-Mlultan line was completed in 1958.  In
1965 the system was extended by a 16-inch line to Lyallpur and continued to
Dandot by a 12-inch line. At the same time a 10-inch spur from Lyallpur to
Lahore was constructed. In 1967 the Rawalpindi area, which previously had
been dependent for its supply of gas on the nearby Dhulian oil field, was
also connected to the Sui system when the trunk line was extended from
Dandot to Galli Jagir. The nresent system is able to deliver a maximum of
172 IvIcf per day, 160 of w-jhich is supolied by the Sui field and 12 by the
Dhulian field. A more detailed description of the existing facilities is

4. THE MARKET
Sales Projections
4.01      A detailed statement of SNGPL's past and projected maximum-day and
average-day sales, by area and by industry, is given in Table 2. Maximum-
day offtakes of 207 S4cf per day, equal to the capacity of the system after
completion of the proposed expansion project, are expected to be reached by
1971. Demand for gas is expected to continue to grow after this date which
may make further expansion of the system economically feasible. However,
for the purposes of the financial forecasts, the assumption is made that no
further expansion of the system would take place. Average-day offtakes are
expected to increase gradually from the 1967 level of 83 Micf per day to 151
M4cf per day in 1974. Thereafter average-day offtakes are projected to
decrease somewhat to a level of 140 Mvcf per day because of expected lower
offtakes by the Multan power plant, once the full 220 kilovolt interconnected
system is in operation. This level is projected to be maintained over the
ensuing years.
4.02      SNGPL's single largest present consumer is the West Pakistan Water
and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) which operates gas-fired steam and
gas turbine electric power units at its power stations at Multan, Lyallpur
and Lahore. The primary function of these plants will be to supplement the
base load hydro-electric plants at times of peak demand and at times when
low water levels or other circumstances prevent the hydro-electric plants
from operating at full capacity. The gas-fired plants are therefore subject
to large seasonal as well as daily fluctuations in demand.
4.03      SNGPL and WAPDA signed an agreement on September 20, 1963 by which
WAPDA's maximum daily offtakes for the three power plants as well as certain
fixed charges and commodity charges were defined. The pertinent stipulations
of this agreement are presented in Annex 2. At the same time WAPDA made an
estimate of its annual gas consumption for the ten-year period from 1964
to 1973 inclusive.
4.0h      Because of a number of factors such as technical difficulties at
the Multan plant and delays in commissioning the Lyallpur plant, actual gas
consumption has fallen short of the projections by a significant margin.
WAPDA has made new projections of gas consumption which are presented in
Annex 3. The projected sales to WAPDA for the 1969-1974 period constitute
about 28 percent of SNGPL's total sales.  Taking 1974, when the fertilizer
plant at Lahore is projected to be in full operation, as a representative
year, WAPDA's total offtakes would amount to about 25 percent of total sales.
4.05      The fertilizer plant at Lahore is projected to achieve full-capacity
operation by 1974 and have an average-day consumption of 29 MMcf per day from
1974 onward, amounting to about 20 percent of SNGPL's projected total sales.



- 8 -
4.06      Other existing major industrial consumers and their projected
average-day offtakes for 1974 are listed below:
Projected
Industry                           Average-day offtakes (Mlcf)
IIultan Fertilizer                           10.0
Multan Electric Supply                         4.9
Gharibwal Cement                              9.6
Khewra Soda                                   2.8
Dandot Cement                                 1.6
Wah Cement                                     8.0
Hattar Cement                                 6.4
Crescent Paper                                2.8
Taxila Foundry                                 2.1
4.07      The projected sales to these consumers constitute about 32 per-
cent of total sales. The remaining 23 percent of SNGPL's projected 1974
sales is to small consumers in the Multan, Lyallpur, Lahore and Rawalpindi
areas, including sales to households.
Basis for Sales Projections
4.08      The foregoing sales projections are based on an analysis of the
future requirements of WAPDA and each of the major industrial consumers.
Sales to general industry (classified as "others" in Table 2) in the dif-
ferent areas have been projected to grow by 10 percent annually from 1969
to 1971. The 1969 figures have been conservatively estimated, using actual
sales figures for 1968 and taking into account recent connections and
progress made on construction of distribution lines.
h.09      An updated forecast of gas consumption for the Multan and Lyallpur
plants through 1974 was prepared by WAPDA's power consultant, Harza Engineering,
in December 1967. The forecast, based on the estimated total power demand
and the knoAwn generating capacity of all power plants in the WAPDA grid,
including the recently-commissioned hydro-electric plant at Mangla, is pre-
sented in Annex 3.
4.lo      These revised estimates are substantially higher than those made
in 1963.  Over the five-year period, 1969-1973, they would result in an
increase of gas sales to WAPDA of 60 percent over the estimates made in
1963. They are also substantially higher than the estimates made by a
Bank Staff Group which studied the Water and Power Resources of West Pakistan
during 1966/67. The Bank Group's "main" estimate amounts to only 34 percent
of WAPDA's revised estimates over the 1969-1973 period. The "high" estimate
of the Bank Group would result in sales amounting to 62 percent of those in
WAPDA's revised forecast.
4.11      The principal differences between the Bank Group estimates and
those made by Harza Engineering for WAPDA are (a) that Harza's estimates
take into account the fact that the Multan and Lyallpur plants were not



- 9 -
designed to serve as peaking plants and that, to prevent technical dif-
ficulties, WAPDA intends to run the plants at a minimum of 30 percent of
full load on days of peak demand, and (b) that interconnection of the WAPDA
power stations is not proceeding as rapidly as envisaged in the Bank Group's
estimates.  Harza's gas offtake estimates have been used in the financial
projections for SNGPL as reflecting this delay in interconnection and
WAPDA's intentions with respect to the use of the thermal plants.
4.12      To protect itself against the uncertainties inherent in these off-
take estimates, SNGPL has a two-part tariff agreement with WAPDA. The fixed
charges of this two-part tariff considerably lessen the financial impact of
any short-fall of sales. The financial consequences to SNGPL of sales not
materializing according to Harza's forecast are discussed in Para. 8.20.
4.13      The existing fertilizer factory at Multan is being expanded with
the addition of a 60-ton per day ammonia unit. This is expected to increase
the plant's average daily requirements to 10 MMcf per day. Agreement on a
revised fixed charge has been reached between the plant and SNGPL to reflect
the increased supply commitment. Gas supplies to the Gharibwal cement plant
commenced in May 1966. After initial start-up problems, the gas consumption
has become steady since the last half of 1967. The recent installation of
a third kiln is expected to increase the average daily requirements to 9.6
MMcf per day by 1970. The soda plant at Khewra is in the process of
doubling its capacity, which is expected to result in average daily sales
of 2.8 MMcf per day starting in 1969.   The Wah cement plant is installing
a new kiln which will increase its average daily requirements to 8.0 MMcf
per day by 1974   The Hattar cement plant has only recently started
operating. The gas sales of 6.4 MMcf per day projected for this plant are
based on the requirements of the existing facilities.
4.14      Projections of sales to the proposed fertilizer plant in the
Lahore area are based on a contract signed between SNGPL and the fertilizer
company, Dawood-Hercules Chemicals, Ltd.   The contract contains take-or-
pay and fixed charge provisions which guarantee SNGPL a minimum income and
a commitment by SNGPL to provide capacity to deliver a specific maximum-
day gas supply. The projected average-day offtakes for the plant is 29 MMcf
by 1974 with a maximum-day commitment of 35 MMcf.
5. CONSIDERATIONS IN PLANNING TO MEET PROJECTED DEMAND
5.01      In order to be able to deliver the quantities of gas projected in
the sales forecast of the previous chapter, SNGPL has to make sure that
sufficient quantities of purified gas will be available and that its pipe-
line system will have the capacity to deliver the gas in the quantities and
at the locations required by its customers.



- 10 -
Gas Reserves
5.02      SNGPL at present obtains over 90 percent of its gas from the Sui
gas field. The remainder is obtained from the Dhulian oil field, which has
a capacity to deliver only 12 million cu ft per day.
5.03      The recoverable reserves of the Sui field as of the beginning of
1968 are estimated to be 5 million million cu ft. SNGPL has so far been
allocated 2 miillion million cu ft by PPL, the producer at the Sui field.
SGTC, which delivers gas to Karachi, has been allocated 1.2 million million
cu ft, the only other allocation. PPL obtained a 30-year production conces-
sion in 1954 which is renewable at the option of the Company.
5.o4      Present projections indicate a combined average requirement of
SGTC and SNGPL of 0.1 million million cu ft per year which would place the
life of the 5 million million cu ft of reserves at 50 years.
Purification
5.05      Sui gas consists of approximately 89 percent methane, 7 percent
carbon-dioxide, 2 percent nitrogen and 2 percent other hydrocarbons. Carbon-
dioxide and various impurities such as sulphur and liquid hydrocarbons are
removed in a purification installation at the field.
5.06      The purification facilities at Sui are owned and operated by SGTC.
There are at present five units with a capacity of 55 N1tcf per day per unit.
One unit is used as a stand-by. The firm capacity of the facilities is
thus 220 IEMcf per day which is not sufficient to cope with the projected
combined maximum-day demand of SNGPL and SGTC. This demand is projected to
rise to 207 I1Mcf per day by 1971 for SNGPL (including 8 MMcf per day for
increased compression) and remain at 140 MMcf per day for SGTC for a total
of 347 MMcf per day. Three additional purification banks would therefore
be needed resulting in eight banks, one of which would be a stand-by unit.
SGTC is studying the possibility of increasing the capacity of the existing
purification units and thereby reducing the requirement for additional
banks to two.
5.07      The fee for purification payable by SNGPL to SGTC was raised from
PRs 0.20 per thousand cu ft (Mcf), to PRs 0.25 per Mcf on August 1, 1968.
A tripartite agreement of 1964 between PPL, SGTC and SNGPL fixes the quantity
and price of raw gas to be delivered by PPL to SGTC to cover the needs of
SGTC and SNGPL and the quantity and price of purified gas to be delivered
by SGTC to SNGPL. This agreement is being revised to reflect the increased
quantities needed by SNGPL and the above-mentioned increase in the
purification fee. The terms of the revised agreement will be submitted to
the Bank for review and approval as a condition of effectiveness of the
Loan. SGTC has informed the Bank of the financial and technical arrangements
it is making to purify the increased quantities of gas. These arrangements
are satisfactory.



Transraission Capacity
5.08      SNGPL's gas transmission system has a capacity to deliver 172 MMcf
per day. Of this total, 160 MMcf per day originates at the Sui field and
12 MMcf at the Dhulian field.
5.09      Up to the end of 1968, SNGPL had no uncommitted capacity in its
system. One of the reasons was that it was committed to meet peak-day
demands from WAPDA's power plants to the extent of 69 MMcf per day at the
?tultan power station and 27 Ni4cf per day at the Lyallpur power station.
Beginning in 1969, these commitments were reduced to 40 MMcf per day at
Multan and 12 MMcf per day at Lyallpur (see Annex 2). At the beginning of
1969, the system thus was able to absorb 44 MMcf per day of additional load.
By 1971, this uncommitted capacity will, however, be fully absorbed by the
growth of the maximum-day requirements of SNGPL's present industrial market.
5.10      To meet the maximum-day requirements of the proposed fertilizer
plant in the Lahore area, an expansion of the system capacity by 35 MMcf
per day, from 172 MMcf per day to 207 MMcf per day, will thus be necessary.
5.11      The peak-day gas requirements of the WAPDA thermal power stations
at Multan, Lyallpur and Lahore were considered in a 1966/67 study of the
Water and Power Resources of West Pakistan by a Bank Staff Group. The
study indicated that, without interconnection of the power system, the com-
bined peak-day requirements for these three stations would go as high as
120 MMcf per day. With interconnection the combined peak-day requirements
would not exceed 70 IAMcf per day. The Bank Group's study concluded that
interconnection of the power system is desirable and that there are
technical and economic advantages in having it earlier (early 1970's)
rather than later (late 1970's). It raised doubts about the wisdom of
expanding the capacity of the gas pipeline from Sui to Multan and Lyallpur
in order to provide fuel for thermal power generation.
5.12      SNGPL's allocation of pipeline capacity to meet the combined
peaking requirements of the three WAPDA plants of 57 MMcf per day is in
conformance with these views, being well below the figure of 70 MMcf per
day projected in the Bank Group's study.
5.13      The capacity provisions for major industrial consumers such as
the fertilizer, soda and cement plants are all based on a relation between
average-day and maximum-day offtakes of 80 percent. For the smaller
consumers in the Multan, Lyallpur, Lahore and Rawalpindi area, a factor of
70 percent has been used. These percentages are based on SNGPL's experience
with these consumers in the past.

6. THE PROJECT
Description of the Project
6.01      The project consists of providing the necessary facilities to
expand the capacity of SNGPL's gas transmission system from 172 MMcf per
day to 207 MMcf per day, to serve a fertilizer plant in the Lahore area to
be constructed by Dawood-Hercules Chemicals Ltd. with financial assistance
of the Bank and IFC. It also provides for expansion of low pressure
distribution facilities.
6.02      The Project includes:
1.   The procurement and installation of 92.9 miles of 18-inch
diameter high pressure steel pipe, paralleling sections of
the existing pipeline between Sui and Multan, including
cathodic protection.
2.   Six compressor units, with a capacity of 1,100 hp each, to
be installed at four existing compressor stations along
the line.
3.   The construction of a new compressor station and procure-
ment of three 1,100 hp compressor units for this station.
4.   Procurement of materials for,and installation of, additional
low pressure distribution facilities at Rahimyar Khan and
in the Multan, Lyallpur, Lahore and Rawalpindi areas.
5.   Procurement and installation of telecommunication and
automation equipment at five compressor stations at which
new compressor units will be installed.
6.   Procurement and installation of telecommunication and
automation equipment at five repeater stations between
Sui and Multan.
6.03      The locations of the proposed parallel line sections (loops) and
the proposed compressor units are shown on Map II.
6.04      The only major river to be crossed in the construction of new
loop lines is the Indus river between Sui and Multan. The crossing takes
advantage of the Guddu Barrage bridge and does not present a problem. The
existing right-of-way where new construction will take place is generally
flat sandy soil which is ideally suited for ditching machines.
6.05      The project provides for completing the automation of the pipeline
system.   The system is controlled from a central control station at
Lyallpur by a radio telecommunication system. The control center monitors



- 13 -
data on gas flow, temperature, pressure, etc., which are automatically
recorded at repeater and compressor stations and automatically transmitted
to the center. On the basis of the data received, the control center
regulates the flow of gas through the line by remote control of the
compressor stations.
6.o6      A modest expansion of the distribution system, at places where a
distribution network nowr exists, is included in the project. This expansion
program is designed to take care of the requirements of small industrial
consumers and provide for additional house connections in the distribution
areas of Rahinyar Khan, Multan, Lyallpur, Lahore and Rawalpindi up to the
end of 1971.
6.07      It is expected that further expansion of the transmission and
distribution network will continue after 1971. The present Loan Agreement
with SNGPL requires that Bank approval be obtained for investments exceeding
US$1.5 million equivalent (PRs 7.14 million) in any fiscal year.
Design of the Project
6.08      The project was designed by Gulf Interstate Engineering Company,
consultants to SNGPL, in co-operation with SNGPL's staff and its technical
advisers BOC. Appropriate arrangements for detailed engineering, the
preparation of contract documents, the evaluation of bids and the super-
vision of construction will be made as discussed in para. 6.17.
6.og      The increase of the capacity of a pipeline system to meet specific
offtakes at specific points can be achieved by a combination of compressors,
which increase gas pressure at a point down the line where it has fallen
substantially below the maximum allowable pressure, and parallel lines
(loops) which increase the effective cross-section of line sections where
the gas has reached the maximum allowable pressure. A large number of
combinations of loops and compressors is possible to meet the pre-determined
offtake requirements of a system.  The objective of the designer is to de-
termine that combination of loops and compressors that results in delivery
of gas at the least cost. Independent calculations by the Bank confirm that
SNGPL's design is the least cost solution.
Construction Cost Estimates
6.10      A statement of estimated construction costs is presented in
Table 3. The total cost of the project is estimated at PRs 85.7 million
(US$18.0 million equivalent) of which 52 percent (US$9.3 million equivalent)
is foreign exchange.
6.11      A summary statement of cost estimates for the project follows:

6.12      Purchase and installation of compressors and pipe for transmission
loops constitute about 70 percent of the cost of the project. Cost estimates
for pipe are based on previous purchases, adjusted for escalation; they
have been confirmed by recent quotations from the UK and Japan. Pipe laying
cost estimates are based on SNGPL's recent experience on the construction
of the Multan-Lyallpur-Lahore extension.
6.13      Estimates for the local distribution facilities consisting of low
pressure piping and metering equipment are based on current plans and ex-
perience in each distribution area and are considered to be adequate. Cost
of compression equipment, telecommunications, cathodic protection, valves
and fittings are based on recent experience and manufacturers' price
quotations. The estimates include adequate allowances for spare parts,
price escalation, engineering services, import duties and capitalized
interest during construction.
6.14      Contingency provisions of one percent on the quoted price of
pipe, three percent on the cost of compressors and ten percent of all other
items have been made in the cost estimates. Contingency provisions on
the purchase price of pipe and compressors can be accepted at such low
figures because of the recent extensive experience of SNGPL with procure-
ment of these items. In addition, the competitive market situation for
line pipe tends to result in bids significantly below the quoted prices
which have been used in the estimates.
6.15      An independent estimate by the Bank of the major items of cost
confirms that the cost estimates of SNGPL are reasonable.
Procurement
6.16      Procurement of pipe and compression equipment will be on the
basis of international competitive bidding. Contracts for supply of
materials and construction will be awarded to the bidder submitting the
lowest evaluated bid, in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines on Procure-
ment".



Design and Consulting Services
6.17      SNGPL has a comprehensive Services Agreement with BOC which pro-
vides for the secondment of experienced personnel and the provision of
technical advice to SNGPL. This agreement was entered into on August 20,
1963 and covered the initial construction and an operating period of five
years after commissioning of the pipeline. The agreement will be amended
to cover the detailed engineering and preparation of contract documents for
the project and provide for assistance in evaluating bids, supervision of
construction and operation of the enlarged system up to December 31, 1974.
The amended agreement will be submitted to the Bank for review and approval
as a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
6.18      Under the existing agreement BOC may recommend to SNGPL such spe-
cialist consultants as may be required for direct engagement by SNGPL.
Under this arrangement, Gulf Interstate Engineering Company has been acting
as SNGPL's consultant for the design of the project.
6.19      The Bank has reviewed the design and considers that the system is
properly designed to meet the projected demand. The design is such that
future expansion of the system is technically feasible and can be achieved
in an economical manner.
Engineering and Construction Schedule
6.20      Detailed engineering and preparation of contract documents for
the project are scheduled to commence in March 1969. Construction of loop
lines is scheduled to commence in March 1970 and to be completed by
February 1971. Supply and installation of compressors is scheduled to
start in November 1969 and to be completed by February 1971. Telecom-
munication facilities are scheduled to be completed by September 1971. This
schedule provides for increase in line capacity in phase with the scheduled
completion of the new fertilizer factory to be built at Lahore. Previous
experience indicates that there should be no problem in meeting this
schedule.
6.21      Disbursement of loan funds will be on the basis of actual foreign
exchange payments made by SNGPL for the items included in the Allocation of
Loan Proceeds viz. line pipe and compressors, materials and equipment for
distribution facilities and engineering. Disbursements are expected to
take place over a 3-year period from July 1, 1969 to June 30, 1972.
7. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
7.01      The increase of West Pakistan's agricultural production is a
basic goal of the Government's development plans and the use of West
Pakistan's large natural gas resources for the production of fertilizers
is an important element of these plans. A fertilizer plant at Multan,



- 16 -
based on Sui gas, has been in operation for the last 10 years and another
plant, based on Mari gas, has recently been completed near the IMari field. The
Government has decided and the Bank has agreed that, to meet the projected
increased need for fertilizers, an additional plant based on Sui gas should
be constructed in the Lahore area. Given this decision, the objective of
the project is to deliver the required quantities of gas to the plant at
least cost. The following paragraphs briefly outline the importance of the
agricultural sector, the need for fertilizer and the role of the project
in meeting this need.
7.02      Some 35 million people or roughly 70 percent of the total popula-
tion of West Pakistan depend on agriculture for their livelihood.
Agriculture contributed about 42 percent to the Gross Provincial Product
in 1965 and agricultural products and derivatives accounted for nearly
three-fourths of all exports from West Pakistan in that year.
7.03      The total land area of West Pakistan is about 200 million acres of
which some 40 million acres or about 20 percent are under cultivation; in
addition, there are a further 30 million acres which are potentially arable.
Of the total cultivated acreage, one-fourth is estimated to lie within 100
miles of Lahore and half within 200 miles. Agriculture in West Pakistan is
sustained by one of the world's largest irrigation systems and at present
about 27 million acres are irrigated.
7.04      Wheat is the main staple diet in West Pakistan and is cultivated
on about one-third of the arable land. Other major crops are rice, coarse
grains, gram and oil seeds; non-food crops are cultivated on one-fourth of
the available area. Although the land in the plains is inherently fertile,
repeated cropping has depleted the plant nutrients in the soil.
7.05      Agricultural development has been accorded a high priority in the
Third Five-Year Plan (1965-1970) and the production of fertilizers is an
important element of this plan. The Government expects yearly nitrogen
consumption, which is now at about 120,000 tons, to be well in excess of
600,000 tons by the end of the Fourth Plan (1975).
7.06      The Dawood-Hercules fertilizer plant, now under construction
near Lahore with financial assistance from the Bank and IFC, will use gas
from the Sui field as raw material for the production of urea. The
capacity of the plant is 340,000 tons of urea per year.
7.07      SNGPL's present pipeline system delivers gas to the Lahore area,
but the capacity of the system has to be increased to deliver the additional
quantity (35 1Ncf per day) required by the new fertilizer plant.   The
pipeline expansion project has been designed to deliver this quantity to
the fertilizer plant at least cost, by an optimum combination of loops and
compressors as discussed in para. 6.09, resulting in a system with no
excess capacity.



- 17 -
7.08      The economic merits of delivering gas for the production of
fertilizer from the Sui field to Lahore depend on how much cheaper it is
for Pakistan to produce the fertilizer itself than to import it. Accordingly,
a comparison has to be made of the total costs of manufacturing the fertilizer
in Pakistan (including the incremental costs of supplying the gas) and the
cost of importing the same volume of fertilizer, including the cost of trans-
portation to the Lahore area. Various analyses were undertaken on the basis
of the exizting official exchange rate, a "shadow" rate of exchange and
constant or falling prices for fertilizer imports. The rates of return obtained
range between 15 percent and 29 percent, with 20 percent being considered as
the most likely return on the project.
8. FINANCES
Introduction
8.01      As mentioned in para. 3.01, SNGPL is a Pakistan public limited
liability company with an authorized capital of PRs 400 million of which
PRs 100 million have so far been issued. The shares are held, one-third
each, by BOC, WPIDC, and the Pakistan public. In connection with the present
project, it is proposed to make a rights issue of a further PRs 18 million to
be subscribed in the same proportions.
8.02      SNGPL's accounts are kept in accordance with Section 130 of the
1913 Companies Act of Pakistan. The law requires the accounts to be audited
by independent chartered accountants annually. The Company's joint auditors
are Messrs. Ferguson and Co. and Rahim Jan and Co., both Pakistani firms.
Copies of their audit reports from inception of the Company to July 1967
have been reviewed by the Bank and are acceptable.
8.03      Depreciation is applied by SNGPL on a straight line basis at rates
comparable with similar industries elsewhere in the world. The tax allowance
for depreciation is higher in the earlier years and lower in the later years,
and consequently provision for deferred taxation is made in SNGPL's accounts.
Taxable profits are subject to income tax at a rate of 50 percent at all
levels of income. It is SNGPL's practice, and one of its aims, as stated in
its prospectus, to pay a dividend of an average of 10 percent each year on
the issued share capital.
8.o4      SNGPL carries adequate liability and property insurance on its
present facilities consistent with sound industrial and business practice.
Financial Structure of the Company
8.05      Fixed assets account for 90 percent of the total assets of the
Company and this is in line with international practice in the pipeline
industry. As at July 31, 1968, fixed assets (at cost) amounted to PRs 330.7
million.

8.06      These assets have been financed from the following sources:
PRs Millions
Equity                                      100.0
Loans:
Local    110.2
IBRD      57.9                       168.1
Internal Resources                            62.6
330.7
Internal resources include depreciation and deferred taxation reserves and
retained earnings.
8.07      Loans have accounted for just over 50 percent of the financial
structure in line with a condition of the Bank's previous loan to SNGPL
that the debt/equity ratio be limited to 60:40 except during the construction
period.
Financing the Project
8.08      The proposed project is estimated to cost PRs 85.72 million with
a foreign exchange component of PRs 44.05 million, equivalent to US$9.25
million. It is proposed to finance this expenditure from equity and loans
and internal resources as follows:
(PRs Millions)
Foreign         Local         Total
Additional equity           6.oo          12.00          18.00
New IBRD loan              38.05             -           38.05
New local loans              -            19.34          19.34
Internal resources           -            10.33          10.33
Total        44.05          41.67          85.72
Equivalent US$        9.25           8.75          18.00
(Million)
8.09      The Government has confirmed its agreement to this proposal and
BOC has agreed to provide its share of the equity - PRs 6 million in foreign
exchange. It is a condition of effectiveness of the loan that the share
issue to the Pakistan public is underwritten and that SNGPL has made
satisfactory arrangements to obtain the new local loans amounting to PRs 19.34
million.  SNGPL has undertaken to finance any project cost overrun.
Tariff Rates
8.10      Tariffs are set by SNGPL but are subject to Government approval.
There are four rates of tariff presently charged by the Company. These
tariffs are negotiated and are not directly related either to the distance
the gas is transported or to the actual costs incurred for each customer.

8.11      The current rates and categories are shown in Annex 5 and sum-
marized below:
WAPDA                              PRs 2.15 to 2.35 per Mcf
Fertilizer factories (existing)                2.15
Cement factories                              2.70
Other customers                                2.90
New fertilizer factory                         1.77
The weighted average price in 1968 was PRs 2.70 per Mcf.
8.12      The Natural Gas Panel set up by the Government has recently
completed drafting legislation, which incorporates principles on which rate
structures are to be based. The draft legislation provides for a reasonable
rate of return on total investment in each company in the gas production and
distribution industry.
Earnings
8.13      Details of earnings from inception of the Company in 1964 to July
1968, together with the projections contained in the original appraisal report
are shown in Table 4 and summarized below in PRs millions.

8.14      Due to the accelerated depreciation allowance for tax purposes, no
tax has been payable during the period. Actual sales have not increased at
the speed originally foreseen, due to WAPDA's failure to take the quantities
envisaged in their original projections (see para. 4.04). Nevertheless,
operating ratios have been held at a reasonable level and the return on net
fixed assets has improved from 9.4 percent to 14.0 percent.



- 20 -
8.15      Projected future earnings for the years 1969-1980 are shoim in
Table 6. Revenue is based on traffic forecasts and present contract terms
for sale of gas. Expenditure is based on present contract terms for
purchase of gas and on agreed purification rates. Other operating
expenditure is projected to increase by 7 percent per annum in line with
general increases in prices over the past few years.
8.16      Although sales are estimated to increase by 82 percent between
1968 and 1974, the peak year, revenue will increase only by 48 percent
from PRs 85.64 million to PRs 126.42 million, due to the increase of the
proportion of sales to lower paying customers. Combined with increasing
unit operating costs, this results in a modest increase in net operating
surplus from PRs 37.15 million to PRs 46.56 million in the same period and
an increase in net income (after providing for current and deferred taxation)
from PRs 10.09 million to PRs 18.10 million.
8.17      The projections for the five years, 1976 to 1980, show sales and
revenue at a constant level, with increasing operating expenditure, due to
rising cost of labor and materials, partly offset by decreasing interest
on loans. Net operating surplus decreases from the PRs 46.56 million of
1974 to PRs 32.30 million in 1980 and respective net income, from PRs 18.10
million to PRs 15.74 million.
8.18      The net income so produced is sufficient to support dividends on
shares of 10 percent in each year. This is in line with the agreement
between SNGPL and the Government. In addition, the net income allows
reserves to build up by approximately PRs 53 million.
8.19      The largest single factor of uncertainty in the projections is
VWAPDA's consumption of gas which in the past has been lower than their
estimates. SNGPL is protected to some extent since there is a two-part
tariff and it can be renegotiated after 1973.
8.20      Should.meantime,WdAPDA's consumption fall significantly below its
estimates, prices to other customers, which can be changed at 30 days
notice, might have to be raised. The maximum increase in price that might
be necessary would be 6 percent and since fuel accounts for no more than 20
percent of manufacturers costs, the net effect on their costs would be
about one percent.
8.21      Any price increase would be subject to approval by the Govern-
ment, which has agreed to approve price increases in the circumstances
outlined above.

8.23      In accordance with the construction schedule, the funds for the
proposed project will start to be drawn down in 1969. Capital expenditure
for the period after construction is shown as PRs 7 million a year for one
year and PRs 5 million a year thereafter or just over one percent per
annum of the capital cost of the system. It is not intended to cover any
further expansion of the system. Since the majority of the system is of
recent construction, this provision should be adequate to deal with normal
capital expenditure over the period (other than maintenance which is
included in operating expenditure). Should, however, there be unforeseen
circumstances such as a line washout, further protective works for river
crossings or unforeseen corrosion on any substantial part of the line, the
provision of PRs 5 million a year might not be sufficient, but cash genera-
tion over the period is adequate to cover such needs.
8. 24     Dividends of 10 percent per annum on the issued share capital
are provided for.
Balance Sheet
8.25        The balance sheets as at July 31 for the years 1964 through 1968
are shown in Table 5 and are summarized as follows:

8.26      Investments in fixed assets have increased between 1964 and
1968 from PRs 122.75 million to PRs 330.74 million due to the expansion
financed by the previous Bank loan.
8.27      Long term debt has been drawn down only to the extent necessary to
pay construction costs and maintain an adequate liquid position. One of the
terms of the previous Loan Agreement was that no dividend could be declared
unless on the date of such declaration current assets exceeded current lia-
bilities (including the dividend declared) in a ratio of 1.5:1. This condi-
tion has been complied with, but during interim periods the current assets/
current liabilities ratio has been allowed to slip to the minimum considered
safe by the Company. This has been made possible by the flexibility in the
WPIDC and IDBP loans both with regard to drawdown and repayment of principal.
8.28        As at July 31, 1967 the cumulative sum provided for over the past
years for deferred taxation was PRs 30.7 million against a theoretical
liability of PRs 33.1 million. The deficiency has been made up in 1968, and
proper provision will be made in the future.
8.29      The projected balance sheets for the years 1969 to 1980 illustrate
the soundness of the projected financial position of the Company and are
shown in Table 7 and summarized as follows:

8.30      Gross fixed assets increase from PRs 349 million to PRs 490 million;
adequate depreciation reserves are built up; proper provision is made for
deferred taxation; long term debts are cut from PRs 166 million to PRs 41
million and surplus which at the beginning of the period is equal to 8 per-
cent of the share capital builds up to 49 percent by the end of the period.
Financial Ratios
8.31      Three ratios are laid down in the loan documents:
(a) a debt/equity ratio;
b) a current assets/current liabilities ratio; and
(c) a return on net fixed assets ratio.
8.32      The debt/equity ratio of 60:40, except during construction period,
incorporated in the previous loan agreement is considered a proper measure.
It is lower on the debt side than that encountered in more developed
countries where loan funds are more easily available.
8.33      The current assets/current liabilities ratio is one of the condi-
tions which determines whether dividends may be declared. A ratio of 1.5:1
provides adequate protection.
8.34      A rate of return on net fixed assets of an average of 12 percent
is appropriate in this case. In order to achieve this, the following rates
were agreed on and are a condition of the proposed loan:-



- 24 -
Up to 1973       - Not less than 10 percent.
1974 onwards        Not less than 12 percent.
8.35      Debt service is adequately covered throughout the period, the
cover never falling below one-and-a-half times the liability.
9.   RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations the following principal points were discussed and
agreed with the Borrower and the Government.
1. A revised tri-partite agreement reflecting the increased
quantities of gas needed by SNGPL will be submitted to the
Bank for review and approval. The execution of a
satisfactory agreement will be a condition of effectiveness
of the loan (5.07).
2. The services agreement between the Borrower and BOC will be
amended to cover the detailed engineering and preparation
of contract documents for the project and provide for
assistance in evaluating bids, supervision of construction
and operation of the enlarged system up to December 31, 1974.
The amended agreement will be submitted to the Bank for
review and approval. The execution of a satisfactory
agreement will be a condition of effectiveness of the loan
(6.17).
3. The underwriting of the share issue to the Pakistan Public
and satisfactory arrangements by SNGPL to obtain new local
loans will be conditions of effectiveness of the loan (8.09).
4. BOC has committed itself to provide its share of the equity,
PRs 6 million, in foreign exchange (8.09).
5. The Borrower undertook to finance any cost overrun.
6. The Borrower and the Government agreed to adequate operating
ratios and rates of return on net fixed assets.
7. The signing of an acceptable gas sales contract between the
Borrower and Dawood-Hercules will be a condition of effective-
ness of the loan.
9.02      The project has been designed with the aid of competent consultants
and provides the required additional gas transmission capacity necessary to
meet the projected demand in a technically sound and economical manner.



9.03      The borrower, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. (SNGPL), which has
been operating since 1964, and has received a previous Bank loan, is finan-
cially sound and will continue to be so after the expansion project.
9.04      The project is economically justified as the least-cost solution
to supplying natural gas as a raw material to a new fertilizer plant in
the Lahore area for which a Bank loan has been made.
9.05      In view of the above, it is recommended that a Bank loan of US$8.0
million equivalent be made to SNGPL. A term of 20 years including a grace
period of 3 years is appropriate.

At Lyallpur the supply of 12 Million Cubic Feet per day will be
sufficient for operation of one 66 MW? unit at 65 percent load factor and
generation at Lyallpur will normally be required for operational reasons
such as system stability, frequency conto)l and local protection so we
think the monthly quota of 360 lillion cubic feet will usually be consumed
each month.

ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR FINANCIAL FORECASTS
1.        Interest and other charges on the Bank loan are capitalized
during construction.
2.        The sale price of gas has been calculated on the basis of SNGPL's
current gas tariff, signed contract with WAPDA, and contracts with the
fertilizer companies. Details are given in paragraph 12.
3.        The purchase price of gas is based on the present contract price
of PRs .bh per Mcf for gas ex Sui and PRs .60 per Mcf for gas ex Dhulian.
h.        The cost of purification is based on the present rate of PRs .25
per Mcf. In addition, SNGPL pay to S9TC approximately h percent of their
offtake as their share of the gas used in the purification plant boilers.
5.        Transmission and distribution costs are based on Sui Northern's
actual experience for the year ended July 31, 1967 and on the budgeted
figures for the financial year 1967/68. In respect of the latter, the
budgeted figure amounts to PRs 14.5 million inclusive of compression.
The total operating costs have been allocated to transmission, distribu-
tion and compression as follows:
Transmission                  PRs 8.5 million
Distribution                      4.O million
Compression                       2.0 million
PRs 1T.-5 million
It should be noted that budgeted compression costs were not used but have
been reduced for the study in initial years due to the lower WAPDA offtake.
Transmission and distribution operating costs are escalated at
7 percent per annum throughout the study period in both cases in line with
increases in prices over the past few years.
In respect of transmission loop lines, the operating costs are
calculated at PRs 3,500 per mile/year escalating at 7 percent per annum
with 1967 as base year.



Annex 5
Page 2
6.        The following compression operating costs have been used:
a)  Labor and overheads:  To be taken as PRs 100,000 per
station in 1967 with a 5 percent escalation per year
thereafter.
b)  Maintenance, Spares, Lub Oil, Etc.:  The cost of main-
tenance, spares and lubricating oil for compressors is
to be taken as PRs hO per BHP per year and calculated
on installed HP.
c)  Fuel Cost:   Fuel costs to be based on PRs 0.70 per
Mcf. Gas consumption for a centrifugal station is to
be taken as 350 cu. ft. per HP day.
* Cost of gas per year   = PRs 0.350 x 300 x 0.70 x HP
= PRs 73.5 x HP
7.        Interest is calculated on the following assumptions:
i) Foreign loans will incur an interest rate of 7½
percent (including the Government guarantee fee)
on the reducing balance. The loan will be repayable
in 35 equal semi-yearly installments commencing in
1972.
ii)  Local rupee loans will carry an interest rate of &i
percent on the reducing balance but will be repayable in
8 years.
iii)  Existing loans/debentures carry interest rates in
accordance with their terms.
8.        Depreciation is calculated at the rates approved by the Board of
SNGPL and accepted by the Government. Different rates apply for tax
purposes.
9.        Tax has been calculated at the existing rate of 50 percent less
super tax rebates on dividends to the extent admissible.
10.       A dividend of 10 percent per annum has been assumed.
11.       In the cash flow projections, an element of normal annual expend-
iture has been included for each of the 12 years study period to cover the
Distribution Development Programme and other normal capital expenditure by
the Company. The details are as follows:



Annex 5
Page 3
PRs h million per annum from 1969 through 1980. For the
years 1969, 1970, and 1971, an additional PRs 5 million
per year is included in respect of Distribution Develop-
ment. Of the PRs 5 million expenditure on Distribution
Development, PRs 2 million is estimated in foreign ex-
change and has been assumed to be met out of the future
foreign loans/equity. For the years 1972 through 1980
Distribution Development is assumed at a rate of PRs 1
million, which is generated from internal cash.
12.       After allowing for an increase of PRs 0.05 per Mcf in Sui Northern's
current selling prices and a further PRs 0.05 per Mcf on account of the pro-
posed increase in purification charge, Sui Northern's gas tariff with effect
from August 1, 1968, is as follows:
A. WAPDA Power Stations
(i) Multan Station:
Fixed charge                       PRs 380,000 per month

/ Reserves converted into standard cubic feet of 1,000 Btu/cu ft.
b/ An additional 0.3 trillion cu ft of reserves was discovered at Sui between 1960
and 1965, but consumption in the period was also about 0.3 trillion cu ft.
c/ As estimated in July 1967.
d/ Sari Sing field, some 40 miles northesst of Karachi, is still under investigation and it is still
unclear what the reserves may turn out to be. The figure used here seems a reasonable guess at
this stage of knowledge.
