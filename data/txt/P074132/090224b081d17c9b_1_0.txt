                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Development Objective of the Project (PDO) is for the Nigerian federal post-basic education and research sub-sector to produce more and better qualified science
                         and technology (S&T) graduates, and higher quality and more relevant research.

                          The proposed project will also build capacity within the participating federal Post-Basic Education Institutions to manage, monitor and evaluate merit-based S&T
                         funding according to international best practices. The project would be a first phase (of a longer-term program) of making it possible for Nigeria to produce an
                         increasing number of university graduates with relevant skills and qualifications in S&T areas relevant for sustained economic growth in Nigeria.

                         The Project is reaching closure at the end of June 2013. The following are the key achievements: (i) 587 students (of whom 30 percent females) benefited from the Innovators of
                         Tomorrow program; (ii) about 720 grants (against an appraisal target of up to 600) were awarded for quality of learning and research; (iii) Eleven emerging Centers of Excellence are
                         completing implementation of their approved grants (amounting to about US$55 million equivalent in commitments); (iv) establishment of S&T teacher standards, technical and
                         vocational education framework, and revision of Science and Technology policy; and (v) planned studies are completed.

                         Early signs of project impact indicate positive results: (i) increased enrollment in S&T at all levels (33% at secondary school level to 19% at university level in two years); (ii) increased
                         interest in S&T research of direct relevance to the Nigerian economy; (iii) increased co-operation and extensive partnership among institutions; (iv) availability of well-equipped S&T
                         laboratories in post-basic educational institutions; (v) increased use of ICT (including Internet interconnectivity, networking, e-learning and multimedia facilities) among post-basic
                         educational institutions; an unintended outcome relates to host communities of PBEIs being able to access Internet through their ICT facilities; (vi) fruitful collaboration with the New
                         Economy Skills for Africa Program on provision of business process outsourcing and microwork training geared towards employment in the ICT-enabled services sector; (vii) huge
                         potential for some institutions to commercialize developments under their grant projects – more than hundred projects; (vii) framework and standards for teachers at the National
                         Colleges of Education; (viii) framework on National Vocational Qualifications for the recognition of skills and competence acquired on the job, based on nationally-validated
                         assessment and certification system; and (ix) greater transparency in public funding and procurement.
