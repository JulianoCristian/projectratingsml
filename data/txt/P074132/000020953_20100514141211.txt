                                    Proposed Changes

a. What are the proposed changes, as applicable, in the project's development
   objectives, outcomes, design, and/or scope?

No change is proposed in the project development objectives.

A level two project restructuring is proposed to facilitate: (a) streamlining/ refinement of
development outcome indicators and intermediate outcomes and indicators to better
match the project design and improve monitoring; (b) enhancement of scope of
subcomponent 1A (Window A) to facilitate FGN's program of strengthening science
teaching and learning in federal secondary schools for getting better prepared students
joining S&T programs at tertiary level; (c) support to specific studies and IT connectivity
to institutions for systemic reforms and improved collaboration for research and learning;
(d) reallocation of the Credit between subcomponents/ unallocated funds and Categories
of expenditure for better utilization; and (e) extension of the Closing date from
September 30, 2011 to June 30, 2013 (21 months) to permit time for implementation of
some critical activities.

The Proposed changes are based on the extensive discussions held with GON during the
Mid Term Review (February 12-25, 2010) of the Project and a request dated August 31,
2009 for reallocation from GON. After a delay of about 1 year, the project is now on
track. As of MTR, about 37.8% of funds are disbursed. Another 25% are committed -
mainly for establishment of nine Centers of Excellence in critical S&T areas for Nigeria-
chosen from 93 proposals. The MTR rated the project to be moderately satisfactory with
a potential of upgrading to Satisfactory soon after release of the grants awarded to COEx
(Component 2) and commencement of planned studies for systemic reforms (Component
3). Component 1 covering about 200 institutions is progressing well. Project
management, FM, procurement, M&E are rated moderately satisfactory. Counterpart
funding, safeguards compliance are rated Satisfactory. There is no audit overdue. The
project is in general compliance of all Legal covenants.

Scope and Outcomes: To meet the project objective of producing more and better
qualified S&T graduates, FME has found it necessary to improve teaching and learning in
science and technology at all 105 Federal Unity Schools (which serve as models to other
secondary schools in the country) by improving science laboratories, S&T teacher
training, and revision of science curricula. The grants averaging about $ 250,000 are
provided to all schools under Component 1A Window A­ which was originally designed
to support S&T research and capacity building and grants were to be provided on a
competitive basis only. The scope of component 1A therefore in enlarged to include
capacity development in teaching and learning also.

Sub Component 1B, under which no grants have been disbursed so far due to the high
ceiling (US$ 3 million) and limited number of institutions (9-12), would continue to

                                             5
provide competitive grants for improving S&T teaching and learning development, but
with the ceiling lowered to US$ 1.5 million to support relevant activities in a larger
number of eligible institutions/ groups of institutions.

Under Component 3, it is proposed to (a) define the outcome to be more specific; (b)
specify the studies to be undertaken to assist National S&T Education Policy and
Planning, and (c) support institutional networking for resource sharing using the new ICT
connectivity that has recently become available in Nigeria.

The Project description in the Financing Agreement (FA) is flexible enough to
accommodate these changes and that no amendment is required.

 Development Indicators: The PDO indicators are refined to indicate improvement in
percentage terms instead of numbers. This is done due to the nature of funding where a
significant number of new institutions and grants are added at each cycle of competition.
For intermediate outcomes, the changes proposed for refinement are: (a) reduce the
number of indicators to track 2-4 for each component by dropping the less critical ones
(e.g. repetition rate) or those which are covered at a higher level ( e.g. publications); (b)
specify outcomes linked to the national strategies in S&T education; and online services
­ under Component 3. The details are provided in Annex 4 (Results framework and
monitoring) ­ which compares the current indicators with the proposed changes.

Performance indicators will be taken out from the FA and will be integrated in the Project
Implementation Manuel (PIM) with reference to this in the FA.

Reallocation of the Credit and extension of the Closing date requested are discussed in
the next section.

b. What are the other complementary changes, as applicable:

Institutional arrangements                                    ___Yes     __X_No
If, yes, please explain:

The proposed changes in Component 1A and 1B will be reflected in the PIM and Grant
Proposal Processing Guide (GPPG). No change in institutional arrangement is required.

Financing mechanism/Conduit                                   ___Yes     __X_No
If, yes, please explain:


Outputs                                                      _X__Yes ___No
If, yes, please explain:
Major additional outputs expected as a result of restructuring are: (a) strengthening of
S&T Teaching and Learning under subcomponent 1A at over 150 institutions (including
all Federal Unity Schools), significantly increasing the number of beneficiary institutions
and students; and (b) electronic linkage of universities to national and international
resources for learning and research.

                                              6
Project Costs and financing plan (include summary tables) __X_Yes ___No
If, yes, please explain:
Overall costs and financing plan remain unchanged. However, it is proposed to
reallocate funds between project components/ subcomponents (indicated in PAD) and
between categories of expenditure (indicated in the PAD and Financial Agreement) based
on the projected needs. The main change is reallocation of about US$ 8 million from
Subcomponent 1B to Subcomponent 1A mainly to support science education at school
level to get better prepared students enrolled in S&T at tertiary level. It is also proposed
to reallocate US$ 9 million from unallocated to Component 3 to further support national
S&T education policy and planning, and institutional strengthening through studies and
electronic networking of institution and support the project management for the extended
duration. A significant part of this would be used to (partially) support networking of
federal universities with national and international resources ­ leveraging funding from
other possible sources.

Under Categories of Expenditure, allocation for Grants is to be increased by $ 15 million
(11.1%) from unallocated funds and from Category 1 (works, goods, etc.). A sum of $ 9
million is retained unallocated to meet any future needs.

From the Project Preparation Advance of US$ 3 million, only US$ 0.5 million was
utilized and refinanced from the Credit. It is proposed to reallocate the balance to other
categories of expenditure.

A summary table of proposed reallocations in USD and SDR is attached.

Financial management                                          ___Yes     __X_No
If, yes, please explain:

Disbursement arrangements                                     ___Yes     __X_No
If, yes, please explain:

Procurement                                                   ___Yes     _ X_No
If, yes, please explain:

Closing date                                                    __X_Yes ___No
If, yes, please explain:
During the MTR, the FME requested an extension of the project Closing Date by two
years to allow satisfactory implementation of all project components. The task team
supports extension of 21 months (from September 30, 2011 to June 30, 2013) in view of
the following: (a) the project design involves competitive funding and wide-ranging
systemic reform and it is too ambitious to be completed in the originally planned period
of four years; (b) the project requires extensive capacity building for a range of activities
at institutions at different levels (from schools to research laboratories) spread
throughout Nigeria; (c) Effectiveness was delayed by ten months due to National
Elections in 2007; (d) Component 2 ­ Centers of Excellence needed identification of
national priorities in S&T followed by revision in grant proposal guidelines before grants
could be disbursed; and (e) most activities have commenced during late 2009 ­ leaving
less than 24 months for completion. At least three more years are required from now for
                                              7
the impact of the project (in terms of better quality graduates and research output) to be
noticeable. Also some time will be required for the PBEIs and the FGN to develop
strategies to ensure sustainability of the expected project gains.

Implementation schedule                                    __X_Yes ___No
If, yes, please explain:
Implementation of Components 2 and 3 is just commencing. These are proposed to be
completed by March 2013. Activities under the third and final cycle of competitive
funding in 2010 will also be completed in two years. Two more annual in-depth reviews
are planned for the first quarter in 2011 and 2012.
