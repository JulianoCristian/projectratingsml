F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Development Objective of the Project (PDO) was for the Nigerian federal post-basic
education and research sub-sector to produce more and better qualified science and
technology (S&T) graduates, and higher quality and more relevant research.

The proposed project also intended to build capacity within the participating federal Post-
Basic Education Institutions (PBEIs) to manage, monitor and evaluate merit-based S&T
funding according to international best practices. The project would be a first phase (of a
longer-term program) of making it possible for Nigeria to produce an increasing number
of university graduates with relevant skills and qualifications in S&T areas relevant for
sustained economic growth in Nigeria.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was unchanged during the project.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Nigeria is Africa’s most populous countries (population estimated around 140 million at the time
of appraisal) with a decentralized government structure. There are 36 states and the Federal Capital
Territory (FCT) and 774 Local Government Areas. Despite being the world’s sixth largest exporter of oil
and recent economic growth, it is one of the poorest countries in the world with a per capita income of
less than US$500. Approximately 55% of the total population was estimated to be poor at the time of
appraisal (World Bank, 2007).

2.      The Government’s National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (2004) strongly
emphasized the development of science and technology for contributing towards economic growth
through skill development for job creation and poverty reduction, to enable Nigeria to grow and compete
globally. Nigeria’s emphasized the twin pillars of science and technology and education as instrumental
to Nigeria’s economic growth. A National Science and Technology Coordinating Council chaired by the
President provided leadership in the development of Science & Technology (S&T) in the country, and a
national strategy was developed. In alignment with the Government’s objectives, the Bank’s 2005-2009
Country Partnership Strategy had one of its four priorities as support to national initiatives for human
development and supporting the knowledge economy. The Bank had strong involvement in the sector
and was selected under the Country Partnership Strategy to be the lead agency in education working
closely with other development partners. The Science and Technology Education Post-Basic Project
(STEP-B) was also aligned to the Africa Action Plan (2005), which included objectives for accelerating
growth and building skills for competitiveness.

3.       While some advances had been made, Nigeria was falling behind in terms of competitiveness
globally. It was ranked as one of the least competitive countries, 93 out of 104, on the global
competitiveness index in 2004/051. Six analytical preparation studies undertaken in 2006 which lead to
the design of this project, provided evidence of an overwhelming demand for more and better quality
education and training, especially for S&T related areas. Particular issues which needed to be addressed
included: (i) apparent mismatch between supply and demand of S&T graduates, both in terms of numbers
and relevant skills matched to industry; (ii) a serious decline in the quality of higher education institutions
in the 1980s and 1990s and low levels of funding which also led to low levels of courses/graduates in the
sciences and technology; (iii) poor coordination between federal post-basic education policies, strategies
and funding priorities; (iv) overloaded, outdated and under-resourced S&T curricula and programs which
did not produce the graduates demanded by the labor market; and (v) the lack of a National Vocational
Qualifications Framework to cater for rapidly changing labor market demands and to allow the private
training institutions and workers to capitalize on their practical knowledge and professional
skills/experience. While the private sector and States were establishing some universities and/or
polytechnics, the federal post-basic education system2 remained the most significant for supply in middle
and higher level staff for S&T related growth areas.

  Post-Basic Education Institutions (PBEIs) include Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Education, Research Institutes, and
Secondary Schools. Around 200 PBEIs were involved with this project. The Federal Government maintains school and
institutions at the secondary and tertiary level. Only about 35% of age cohort is currently enrolled in Junior Secondary Education
(JSE; a 3 year cycle), which includes compulsory science and mathematics. Those students continuing to senior secondary
schools receive either a traditional academic program or a technical and vocational program.


                                                              -1-
4.       The STEP-B project was designed to address the above sector issues, especially to cater for non-
oil economic growth. There was particular support to increase production of more and better quality
medium and higher-level skilled workers in Nigeria and to strengthen the capacity of post-basic S&T
institutions to carry out the tasks. Through a merit-based competitive approach, the project sought to
pilot a new demand-driven approach to finance S&T education and training to improve teaching and
research substantially, and to also strengthen links with the demand side regarding research and skills. In
addressing these issues, the Government also sought to develop indigenous capacity in S&T which would
in turn lead to locals addressing better various economic social, health and environmental needs; and
develop Research and Development (R&D) that would become a resource for generating wealth,
accelerate growth and reduce poverty.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

5.       The Project Development Objective (PDO) was for the Nigerian federal post-basic education and
research sub-sector to produce more and better qualified S&T graduates, and higher quality and more
relevant research. The project also intended to build capacity within the participating federal Post-Basic
Education Institutions to manage, monitor and evaluate merit-based S&T funding according to
international best practices. The project was to be a first phase of a longer-term program to make it
possible for Nigeria to produce an increasing number of university graduates with relevant skills and
qualifications in S&T areas relevant for sustained economic growth in Nigeria.

6.      According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) progress towards achievement of the PDO
was to be measured by:
    Increase in the number of master degree graduates in S&T related disciplines in Federal Post-
        Basic Educational Institutions (PBEIs);
    Increase in the number of students obtaining grades B and above in S&T disciplines in federal
        PBEIs;
    Increase in number of S&T publications from PBEIs in peer reviewed journals;
    Number of new collaborations (partnerships and institutional links) by federal PBEIs with
        international institutes; and
    Percentage of fully accredited S&T programs in federal PBEIs.

7.       Increased amount of human resources trained, were to be measured by: (i) increased numbers of
programs, enrolment and graduates in science and technology, and (ii) labor market utilization of these
skills in the short and medium term. Improved quality would be measured by: (i) growth in total number
of S&T related publications, and (ii) increased collaboration with regional and international research
public and private partners in S&T areas. Improved teaching and learning would be measured by: (i)
assessments of knowledge and skills; and (ii) increased percentage of grade B and above graduates in
S&T examinations. Improved relevance would be measured by: (i) increased partnerships with the private
sector; (ii) capacity built in S&T within the participating federal PBEIs and federal S&T agencies to
manage, monitor and evaluate merit-based S&T funding according to international best practices.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

8.      The PDO was unchanged during the project period.

9.       Indicators: At the project restructuring in May 2010, the PDO indicators were refined to make
the outcomes more realistic, measurable and specific. Four of the five core PDO indicators were changed
to show improvement in terms of percentages instead of only numbers. This was done because a
significant number of new institutions and grants were being added at each cycle of competition. For

                                                   -2-
intermediate indicators, the changes were: (i) reduction in the number of indicators to track two to four for
each component by dropping the less critical ones (e.g. repetition rate) or those which were covered at a
higher level (e.g. publications); and (ii) outcomes linked to the national strategies in S&T education were
to be specified along with the online services under Component 3 (see Annex 2 with full list of original
and revised indicators).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.      According to the PAD, the main beneficiaries of the project were: (i) Teachers and Students: to
benefit from a more practical, enjoyable and rewarding approach to learning that better positioned
students to attain employment at the completion of their studies. The use of ICT was also introduced as a
means of reaching more students through e-learning opportunities, especially female students. (ii)
Universities: through expanding research and training opportunities: (a) strengthen capacity to perform
research and improve the quality, relevance and access to science and technology training; (b) generate
revenue for the universities (though patents, technology licensing, firm creation, etc); (c) increase
relevance to industry needs; (d) enhance particular areas of S&T; (e) develop skill to screen grant
applications and implementation. (iii) Firms: As more and better S&T graduates were produced, costs for
retraining and recruitment decreased. Firms also stood to benefit from increases in employees’ exposure
to research over the course of their training. (iv) Government was to benefit with: (a) enhanced strategic
vision and priority setting capacity aligning S&T policy to development goals; (b) private sector
contributions to R&D were to increase as national S&T capacity improved; (c) development of S&T
indicators to attract multinational companies looking to establish offshore facilities. (v) Innovation
Clusters: Where several institutions and initiatives were in a specific geographic location together (i.e. a
potential innovation cluster), it was expected that there would be a stronger impact within that cluster to
promote S&T; and (vi) Poor people: Generating new knowledge, products and processes under the
project would be useful to solve a number of challenges in sectors including health, agriculture, energy,
transportation etc specific to the Nigerian context.

1.5 Original Components

11.   The project was structured around three main components and several subcomponents which are
summarized below.

(i) Component 1: Competitive Fund for Quality Enhancement and Innovation (US$81 million: 45%
     of total Credit): supported a facility to provide peer-reviewed and competitively awarded quality
     improvement grants to federal PBEIs and other federal S&T agencies, with particular attention to
     increased female participation. There were two sub-components: Sub-component 1a) competitive
     grants supporting research and development in S&T (US$54 million, 30% of total credit) through
     three windows - A:Institutional grants; B:Partnership grants; and C:Innovator grants ; and Sub-
     component 1b) competitive grants supporting teaching and learning (US$27million, 15% of total
     Credit).

(ii) Component 2: Support for the emergence of Centers of Excellence in post-basic S&T (US$54
     million, 30% of total Credit). The objective was to provide a small number (7-9) of promising
     STEP-B tertiary education institutions over the life of the project with the resources necessary for
     them to emerge into Centers of Excellence, raising national competence of Nigeria in specific S&T
     areas, and increasing the economic benefits derived from that S&T area.

(iii) Component 3: Support for strengthening strategic planning, management and M&E in post-basic
     S&T education (US$27 million, 15% of total Credit). This component supported complementary

                                                    -3-
     project implementation and management initiatives. It consisted of two sub-components: Sub-
     component 3a) to help improve data collection and analysis shortcoming; and Sub-component 3b) to
     support project implementation, management and M&E at the central level as well as among the
     PBEIs.

1.6 Revised Components

12.     During the project restructuring in May 2010, some small changes were made to Components 1
and 3 as per the following. Under Component 1, the change was an expansion of a successful pilot of 13
Unity Schools for improved science laboratories, S&T teacher training, and revision of science curricula
to 105 Federal Unity Schools. These schools serve as role models to other secondary schools in the
country. Schools were awarded grants based on an approved school improvement plan. This was initiated
by the Federal Ministry of Education (FME). The grants averaging about US$250,000 were provided to
all schools under Component 1a) Window A. The scope of the focus of Component 1a) was therefore
enlarged to include capacity development in teaching and learning also.

13.     Under Sub-component 1b), the change was to lower the ceiling for grants for improving S&T
teaching and learning development from US$3 million to US$1.5 million. This encouraged a larger
number of eligible institutions/groups of institutions to compete. This component was initially slow
disbursing mainly due to the high ceiling (US$3 million).

14.     Under Component 3, the main changes were to: (i) specify the studies to be undertaken to assist
National S&T Education Policy and Planning; (ii) support institutional networking for resource sharing
using the new ICT; and (iii) define the outcome to be more specific. The original outcome was “National
policy, planning inputs and educational services for post-basic S&T education, research and technology
developed and strengthened”. This was revised to: “Key building blocks for a National Framework and
Standards for S&T education and training in place, and a framework for National Research and Education
Network established.”

1.7 Other Significant Changes

15.      Project Extension: In May 2010, the project was extended from September 30, 2011 to June 28,
2013. This 21 month extension from four years to five years and 11 months was justified to allow for: (i)
sufficient time to manage the competitive funding mechanisms and wide ranging system reform which
were deemed too ambitious to be completed in the originally planned period of 4 years; (ii) the project
required extensive capacity building for a range of activities in institutions at different levels (schools to
research laboratories); (iii) effectiveness was delayed 10 months due to National elections in 2007; (iv)
Component 2 – Centers of Excellence – needed identification of national priorities followed by revision
in grant proposal guidelines; (v) most activities commenced only in late 2009 – leaving less than 24
months for completion; and (vi) PBEIs and the Federal Government of Nigeria needed time to develop
strategies to ensure sustainability of the expected project gains.

16.      Project Restructurings: There were two restructurings during the life of the project. The first
restructuring was in May 2010 and addressed the need for: (i) a reallocation of funds; and (ii)
modification of indicators. The second restructuring was in June 2013 to cancel an estimated US$20
million of what would be unutilized funds and recommit these to a new emerging project with similar
goals. Further details are provided in Section 2.2 - Implementation.

17.     Reallocation of Funds: While overall costs and the financing plan remain largely unchanged
during the project, a reallocation of funds was undertaken during the project restructuring in May 2010 to:


                                                    -4-
(i) transfer US$23 million from Sub-component 1b) to 1a), and (ii) to allocate half of currently
unallocated funds to Component 3. This change of funds from a research to teaching emphasis
(especially to support increased science education at school level to get better prepared students enrolled
in S&T at tertiary level) did not affect project outcomes adversely as the two activities were
interdependent and the project still provided 47% of total funds directly to research through Components
1 and 2. Under Component 3, this reallocation partially supported the networking of federal universities
with national and international resources to leverage funding from other possible sources.

18.      Cancellation and Recommitment of Funds: As the project progressed, it was expected that the
project might not fully disburse. This was due to a number of circumstances including: (i) the optimistic
appraisal forecasts on the level of competitive grants expected to be awarded, especially under Sub-
component 1(b), based on the misguided assumption of rapid utilization of grants by post-basic education
institutions, which was untested since the project was the first of its kind in Nigeria; (ii) substantial
project savings in some areas mainly under disbursement categories 1 and 2 related mostly to goods,
services, training and grant; (iii) the staggered timing of take-off of activities; and (iv) the new
competitive, demand-driven and transparent funding approach, which effectively raised the bar after each
round of call for proposals. This entailed full use of competitively allocated funds in the given time frame
with stricter compliance to project criteria progressed, including performance by the latter rounds. The
emphasis on developing partnerships and inter-institution collaboration while producing better outcomes,
also slowed down the ability of some individual institutions to move more quickly with their proposals
and activities. Upon request by the Federal Ministry of Finance on May 3, 2013, unutilized funds were
recommitted to the Nigeria portion of the new Regional Centers of Excellence Project (P126974). A Level
Two restructuring was thus effected on June 27, 2013 to cancel the estimated US$20 million equivalent
(SDR13.3 million) of unutilized funds on time to recommit such funds under IDA-16 to the new project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.      Soundness of background analysis: Prior to designing the project, six comprehensive analytical
studies3 were undertaken to rigorously understand the context, needs and working environment. Wide
stakeholder consultations were also undertaken. Lessons from other country experience (in similar
context to Nigeria) in S&T were also determined so that international good practice was utilized. These
were clearly articulated in project documentation and ideas brought into the design of STEP-B. It was
expected that STEP-B would be the first project in a larger phased program to adequately build sufficient
capacity and outcomes. The Bank was the lead partner in education with the Federal Government of
Nigeria and brought much experience in this field of science and technology in secondary and tertiary
education.

20.    Assessment of the project design: The design of the implementation structure and institutional
arrangements was sound, with a focus on S&T PBEIs, supported by national regulatory agencies and a


3
  The six preparation studies covered the followed S&T areas: (i) policies and strategies in S&T innovation related to federal
post-basic education and training; (ii) financing and expenditure trends in federal post-basic education and training with a focus
on S&T; (iii) teaching and learning, curricula and assessment practices in S&T post-basic education and training at the federal
level; (iv) the impact of information and communication technologies on teaching and learning, e-learning and open learning
arrangements; (v) labor and employment issues related to federal S&T post-basic education and training; and (vi) backbone
connectivity readiness and the needs of selected federal universities.




                                                              -5-
National Project Secretariat (NPS), under the guidance of an inter-ministerial National Project Steering
Committee. While the large number of implementing agencies within this project made this project a
management challenge, (these included 18 Universities, 12 Polytechnics, 7 Colleges of Education, 104
Unity Schools, 6 Research Institutes, 5 Regulatory Agencies out of a total of almost 200 PBEIs), the
focus on national coverage of the interventions was appropriate given the priority of the Government and
availability of S&T post-basic education institutions across the country. The use of competitive grant
funding arrangements was suitably transparent and sound as a mechanism to stimulate motivation and
innovation. The development of such a mechanism for allocating funding to scientific research and
innovation was in itself an important project outcome. The team also realistically acknowledged that this
was a new innovative design and that some adjustments and extra support might be needed along the way.
The project restructurings and reallocation of funds were responsive to these needed adjustments.

21.      Adequacy of Government’s commitment: Government’s commitment was strong. The Federal
Ministry of Education responsible for implementation established early the National Project Steering
Committee and its coordinating unit the National Project Secretariat. This clear, strong ownership by the
Nigerian stakeholders was demonstrated by the fact that the National Project Secretariat was established
and functional by the time of appraisal and that there were a large number of grant proposals prepared
prior to this milestone also.

22.      Assessment of risks: While the preparation studies helped the team to make a sound assessment
of risks, institutional capacity and level of readiness before project effectiveness as best it could be based
on available data, the reality was this project was the first of its kind in Nigeria and the implementing
federal post-basic institutions and the Federal Ministry of Education had no experience implementing
competitive funds and using World Bank procurement procedures for the development of S&T capacity.
At preparation the Bank team anticipated well the need for providing extra support for implementation
and monitoring. Zonal consultants were hired to provide added support to PBEIs in M&E, procurement
and financial management when this became necessary.

23.     Quality at Entry Assessments: A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was undertaken in
January 2007, followed by a Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Quality at Entry review in April 2008, two
                                     4
months after project effectiveness. Both the QER review and the TTL responses to the QAG review
acknowledged the sound preparation by the team. Much discussion was also raised over the realism and
ambitiousness of key performance indicators, and the challenge of balancing: (i) innovative designs with
risks, and (ii) country ownership versus capacity constraints and tight Bank preparation schedules.
Originally less ambitious key performance indicators were articulated but after many discussions during
appraisal and negotiations, regional quality control advice had indicated that these be replaced by
indicators which were less “input-oriented.” By the time of the QAG review, it can be inferred that the
QAG team’s view was that the key performance indicators had then become overly ambitious and these
needed to be modified to make them more feasible for monitoring within the given time frame.
Difficulties were also encountered in formulating realistic and monitorable indicators relating to S&T in
Nigeria, particularly those relating to outcome indicators. Also, while the Federal Government of Nigeria
wanted to put all the project funds into the research aspects of Components 1 and 2, the project team
insisted on bringing in post-basic teaching and learning activities which were not high on the

stakeholder’s agenda at the time, but which were essential to strengthen the project design. The team was
able to persuade the stakeholder and encourage ownership, based on the solid analytical studies
undertaken as part of project preparation.

2.2 Implementation

24.      Established Arrangements: A well-organized set of implementation arrangements were put in
place. The Federal Ministry of Education was the main project implementing agency with the Federal
Ministry of Science and Technology. The Federal Ministry of Education had overall responsibility for
project coordination and implementation, while the role of Federal Ministry of Science and Technology,
apart from being a core member of the Steering Committee, was the regulatory agency responsible for
policy formulation and implementation of the S&T strategy, and for coordination of the research and
development institutions under its purview, including project-related activities. The S&T faculties and
departments at the Federal Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges and the federal institutions that supported
S&T activities at the post-basic level (National Universities Commission - NUC, National Board for
Technical Education - NBTE, National Commission for Colleges of Education - NCCE, and
existing/emerging Centers of Excellence) implemented grants within their own local environment under
the responsibility of the National Project Secretariat. The Secretariat was responsible for day-to-day
implementation of the project at the Federal Ministry of Education. Detailed project implementation
arrangements were specified through various documents including the: (i) Project Implementation
Manual; (ii) Grants Proposal Preparation Guide; (iii) Project Procurement Manual; and (iv) Project
Financial Management Manual. A website was also developed for greater transparency and easy access
to information and data. A Technical Review Committee (comprised of about 12 S&T experts who had
recognized international stature) was responsible for reviewing all grant proposals under the project. An
International Advisory Board assisted the Technical Review Committee in its grant evaluation process,
especially regarding development of Centers of Excellence. However, success of implementation falls
largely to the capability and behavior of participants to act on those arrangements. As indicated earlier,
extra assistance was needed to assist with implementation. This is perfectly understandable given all the
new procedures to understand and follow, including World Bank procurement processes. It takes
extended periods of time for such changes to be firmly rooted in changed thinking and practice.

25.       Project Leadership: While it was recognized that there was some risk at the start of the project
that counterparts could change following the 2007 elections, it was detrimental to the project start-up to
replace an excellent National Project Coordinator by the Federal Ministry of Education in the out-going
government. The replacement was someone without any previous STEP-B preparation history. The
grounds for replacement and the timing were not communicated to the Bank. The Bank team kept the
dialogue going and urged the authorities to focus on implementation from the outset. However, the
transition to normalcy took some time, leading to implementation delays, and diminishing interests by
many key stakeholders. Regulatory agencies such as NUC, NCCE, NBTE showed less co-operation than
initially, and only came back to support the project fully after several months of intensive discussions
with the Bank team. This replacement was a serious blow to the STEP-B startup, which proved more
challenging than usual.

26.      Project Restructurings: In May 2010, a Level Two project restructuring was proposed to
facilitate: (i) streamlining/ refinement of development outcome indicators and intermediate outcomes and
indicators to better match the project design and improve monitoring; (ii) enhancement of scope of
subcomponent 1A (Window A) to facilitate the Federal Government of Nigeria’s program of
strengthening science teaching and learning in federal secondary schools for getting better prepared
students joining S&T programs at tertiary level; (iii) support to specific studies and IT connectivity to
institutions for systemic reforms and improved collaboration for research and learning; (iv) reallocation of
the Credit between subcomponents/ unallocated funds and Categories of expenditure for better utilization;

                                                   -7-
and (v) extension of the Closing date from September 30, 2011 to June 28, 2013 (21 months) to permit
time for implementation of some critical activities.(see Annex 2 for indicator changes).

27.     A second Level Two restructuring was completed on June 27, 2013 to cancel the estimated US$20
million equivalent (SDR13.3 million) of unutilized funds and recommit these accordingly to the new
regional Africa Centers of Excellence project (as discussed in Section 1.7 under Cancellation of Funds).

28.      Other important actions: Based on observations during site visits, project implementation was
mixed across various institutions. Some key re-occurring issues were: (i) capacity to adequately address
procurement and financial management at PBEIs; (ii) poor data collection and data analysis; and (iii) the
sheer spread of post-basic educational institutions across the country made it very challenging to monitor
fully the compliance of these institutions with the guidelines under the Environmental and Social
Management Framework, though each institution had a person attached to this responsibility. A key
factor to improve these issues was the appointment of zonal consultants to directly assist institutions with
procurement, financial management and M&E reporting, and to organize intermittent regional workshops
focused on emerging issues. This, coupled with more intense supervision by the team, was instrumental
in assisting with moving implementation forward.

29.      By 2010, the blueprint policy document for the establishment of Centers of Excellence under the
STEP-B project was finally in place to define areas of national priority in science and technology as well
the strategy for the administration of funds. Approval needed to be provided by the National Assembly
and it took time for discussions and approval at this highest level to be obtained. Once in place, this
component was able to move forward.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

30.      M&E Design: An adequate results framework was established, with suitable activities designed
to attain objectives (see causal links in the results framework in Annex 2b). Key performance indicators
were provided to monitor the progress towards the project development objectives under the parameters
of the project. Some adjustments were made at the Mid-Term Review to make these more realistic within
the project timeframe and measurable. An adequate broader and comprehensive monitoring and
evaluation framework for measuring progress towards objectives, and to process milestones and
deliverables was put in place and described in the project implementation manual. Several types of data
collection methods were utilized to adequately determine progress including: (i) data collected for PDO
indicators (ii) regular annual work plans and institutional progress reports (including fiduciary and
procurement data) and (iii) institutional DVD’s produced to record achievements. The team was aware at
the design phase of the fragmentation of the Nigerian tertiary institutions and the “fledgling" inter-
institutional communication which hampered data collection and related decisions. This is one of the
reasons why greater internet connectivity and partnerships were encouraged.

31.      M&E Implementation: M&E reporting remained a challenge for a good part of the project due
to the complexity of the project and capacity of staff. By early 2011, only 40% of institutions had fully
developed their M&E system and Education Management Information Systems to full capacity. By the
close of the project, it is estimated that 80% of the implementing institutions were providing reports to the
National Project Secretariat. Actions which were taken which helped to improve the process included: (i)
the Bank hired a consultant to work with the Bank’s M&E specialist to train M&E officers in the
Regulatory Agencies so that they could work as focal points for data collection in institutions under their
purview; and (ii) the National Project Secretariat engaged six M&E zonal consultants who worked
directly with STEP-B M&E officers for each of the six zones. Soon after this, some institutions started
submitting better data in the agreed format. The teams were regularly in the field to check on progress
and verify progress.

                                                    -8-
32.      To help make the M&E of grant proposals transparent, high quality and meeting international
practice, a Technical Review Committee of around 12 S&T experts (half Nigerian nationals) managed the
review of grant proposals, recommended winning proposals for grant awards, facilitated networking with
international and national institutions to develop a database of competent reviewers in various fields, and
coordinated activities with the International Advisory Board. The International Advisory Board,
consisting of around 10 S&T experts with recognized international expertise in the respective scientific
areas assisted the Technical Review Committee in its grant evaluation process and was particularly
responsible for submissions for Centers of Excellence (under Component 2).

33.      M&E utilization: Initially the delay in developing the system for data collection and analysis
resulted in limited meaningful use. However, by project closure, utilization of collected data for policy
formulation, informing decision-making and resource allocation had begun, although this will need
further attention to be fully successful. Additional assessments undertaken during the life of the project
and used for project improvement included: (i) detailed assessment of past Innovator of Tomorrow
awards with a view to determining the extent to which award funding was utilized effectively, and its
preliminary impact on fostering innovations in science and technology; (ii) technical audit undertaken of
all grant recipients under Round 1 and 3 of the Call for Proposals to assess progress in achieving project
objectives (value for money spent), including unintended impact, completed by the Mid-Term Review;
and (iii) a rapid beneficiary survey. In addition, in support of National Development strategies for S&T,
five studies were completed: (a) review of national secondary education S&T curricula; (b) draft national
vocational qualification framework, (c) draft National Performance Standards for S&T Teacher
education; (d) draft S&T Laboratory standards; and (e) conceptual framework for Labor Market
Observatory. These have been institutionalized within the respective regulatory agencies.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.     Safeguard Compliance: This is rated satisfactory. Overall safeguards adherence was in order,
although environmental safeguard clauses for minor civil works were not consistently inserted in
contracts and also site-specific Environmental Management Programs were not prepared by the
contractors. Changes were made to ensure compliance. The National Project Secretariat also procured a
consultant on a retainer basis to support proposal evaluation with respect to safeguards and to provide
implementation support to institutions implementing agreed safeguards to ensure compliance.

35.      Fiduciary Compliance: Overall fiduciary compliance is rated as moderately satisfactory. Given
the complexity with the large number of costs centers at PBEI level, there is a continuing need for close
financial monitoring of expenditures and reporting at education institution level. As various other issues
arose (e.g. some Unity schools transferred their accounts to Banks without branches within the school’s
vicinity; and some Banks were applying charges), these were taken up with appropriate authorities by the
task team.

36.     Some improvement in financial reporting, internal control arrangements and financial compliance
(e.g. unretired advances, inventory and stock control, payment to service providers) was evident by
project closure, although stricter adherence to work plans and attention to assessing fund utilization is
needed.

37.     Disbursements: Of the original Credit of US$180 million equivalent (SDR 120 million), after
cancellation of US$20.3 million equivalent (SDR13.3 million), the amount of $161.4 million equivalent
(SDR104.6 million) was disbursed (98% of the revised Credit). US$3.2 million (SDR 2.1 million)
remained undisbursed.


                                                   -9-
38.      Procurement: Overall procurement performance is satisfactory. While most procurement
activities were completed by the close of the project, there were some lingering contract management
issues still pending e.g. equipment had been supplied but was not yet installed and/or training for staff not
yet undertaken, and there was some delayed payments to suppliers. These have now been resolved.
Throughout the project, issues needing attention included: (i) understanding of and adherence to World
Bank procurement rules; (ii) poor procurement planning and contract packaging; and (iii) poor capacity of
many Project Procurement Officers. Regular support was needed, as built into the project later through
zonal consultants to strengthen these areas by project closure.

39.     Overall efforts to improve the procurement performance were increasingly showing benefits,
particularly with International Competitive Bidding activities undertaken at decentralized levels. This has
continued for packages of equipment with the new Centers of Excellence under the new Regional Centers
of Excellence Project (P126974). To sustain the gains under the project, the National Project Secretariat is
encouraged to report weekly on the status of contracting management for both International Competitive
Bidding and National Competitive Bidding, identify emerging issues regularly and provide appropriate
solutions.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase/Sustainability

40.      Sustainability in the context of this project is focused more on changing behaviors with regard to
collaboration and partnership, and the ability of PBEIs to generate knowledge sharing and funding on
their own, and not only about ensuring that specific project activities would be maintained over the long-
term. Under STEP-B, a large number of PBEIs have been able to enhance their S&T development
through equipment acquisitions, building of trained core management teams, and developing stronger
interconnectivity for leveraging knowledge and collaboration. This has led to greater potential than
before towards self-financing, private sector collaborations, and product commercialization in addition to
tapping research and development funding (see Section 3.2 Achievement of PDOs for examples and more
details). To a great extent, institutions have already developed viable sustainability plans to bring in
further funding to maintain and expand their activities.

41.     The Government has also shown its commitment to sustain the project investments. Recurrent
costs have been fully funded by Government to strengthen extensive institutional capacity throughout the
country. Also, a number of the STEP-B’s operational activities and systems have been mainstreamed into
the Regulatory Agencies, the Federal Ministry of Education and the Federal Ministry of Science and
Technology. Moreover, S&T is a key pillar of Federal Government of Nigeria’s four-year education
strategy for education, in support of the Government’s Transformation Agenda. This is reflected in the
increase in the allocation of the overall federal budget for the education sector of about 6.9% in 2013
from the 2011 level (Naira 421 billion).

42.      The STEP-B project also developed a scientific method of competitive grant funding that laid the
foundation and capacities of institutions in Nigeria to undertake competitive funding successfully. For
example, out of about seventy proposals which were submitted for Centers of Excellence, nine out of the
total fifteen for all countries were selected based on sequential evaluation by the Technical Review
Committee and the International Advisory Board as potential Centers of Excellence under the project.
These funds benefited over 100 institutions, which has led to some of these institutions securing funding
under the new regional higher education World Bank assisted Africa Centers of Excellence Project
(P126974) which will follow on from the STEP-B project. Out of fifty-two proposals submitted from
Nigeria, seven out of the total fifteen from all countries were selected by the International Advisory Board
and Technical Committee as potential Centers at least six of these institutions benefited from some form
of competitive grant support through STEP-B. The lessons learned under STEP-B will be important to
inform this next phase.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

43.     Relevance of Objectives: The project’s objectives remain highly relevant to Nigeria today. As
designed and implemented, they addressed key development priorities as contained in the Government’s
Transformation Agenda towards its Vision 2020 puts strong emphasis on the development of science and
technology for contributing to skill development needed for job creation and poverty reduction, which is
essential to enable Nigeria to grow and compete globally. To increase the number of graduates with
higher learning levels required an emphasis on improving teaching/learning, on enhanced research and
development and partnerships and collaboration among higher level education institutions. Developing
management capacity and the regulatory framework were equally important to support and sustain the
change process. Having better trained S&T graduates was also highly relevant to industry and private
sector as it meant that the need for extra training was minimized, and partnerships were being developed.
Moreover, key results were produced under the project with respect to fostering entrepreneurship among
young people, especially under the Innovators of Tomorrow program. Thus the relevance of project
objectives is rated high.

44.      Relevance of Design and Implementation: The project’s design and implementation remain
relevant for both public and private sectors. The activities were closely linked to the above objectives and
provided a sound and realistic plan for implementation, especially in addressing issues of education
quality and access in S&T, with a particular focus on increasing girls’ participation (see causal links in the
results framework in Annex 2b). Project preparation took into account many lessons learned from
previous projects and international good practice in the sector, the emerging labor market needs of the
developing economy and the priority for human resource development. The design of the implementation
structure and institutional arrangements was appropriate, with a focus on S&T PBEIs, supported by
national regulatory agencies and a National Project Secretariat, under the guidance of an inter-ministerial
National Project Steering Committee. The focus on national coverage of the interventions was
appropriate given the availability of S&T post-basic education institutions across the country. Research
partnerships were developed both nationally and internationally with various public and private
institutions to respond to industry demands. The use of competitive grant funding arrangements was
suitably transparent and sound as a mechanism to stimulate motivation and innovation. The project
restructurings reflected the team’s responsiveness to adjustments needed under the project as it progressed
to maintain this relevance.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

45.      Based on the achievement, and significant surpassing of targets of all five core outcome
indicators, the project has achieved fully its project development objectives i.e. there has been a
significant increase in both: (i) more and better qualified S&T graduates; and (ii) higher quality and more
relevant research being produced, especially in areas of increased S&T relevance for Nigeria for its
development. Qualitatively, the S&T subsector today has been strengthened substantially with the project,
particularly from interventions supporting young graduate innovators, and nine centers of excellence
focused on national priority areas, with the ability to undertake new research and development facilitated
by modern equipment, partnerships and collaboration both at home and abroad. These are highly
satisfactory results.

46.     There was initial caution to not set overly ambitious targets, as this was the first of its kind project
in Nigeria. It used a very different paradigm of doing business that was more transparent, more demand

                                                     - 11 -
driven and competitive in nature, had more decentralized procurement for institutions using World Bank
guidelines that none of the PBEIs had experience with, and had more institutional accountability for
results. Please note that in the section below, while progress of performance indicators is described under
the two key PDOs, the accompanying narrative is difficult to split between the two PDOs since these are
so closely interlinked. The results which most closely relate to the PDO are grouped together (see Annex
2 for detailed achievements under all indicators).

47.      PDO Objective 1: produce more and better qualified S&T graduates:
PDO Indicators: (1) percentage increase in the number of S&T graduates from beneficiary PBEIs; (2)
percentage increase in the number of senior secondary school students who obtain a minimum of five
credits in S&T subjects at national examinations at beneficiary schools.
Intermediate Indicators: (3) Percentage increase in the number of students enrolled for S&T programs in
all beneficiary PBEIs, disaggregated by gender; (4) National Framework and Standards for S&T
education and training in place.

48.      After three rounds of selection, 198 institutions were implementing 220 projects with a total of
about US$51 million (Component 1). Based on both information available and site visits, most
institutions, especially at the secondary school level completed their sub-projects with substantial
increases in enrolment and pass rates in S&T.

49.     More S&T graduates: Substantial results were achieved in terms of increasing the number of
S&T graduates, including girls. While the initial target for more graduates was 6% over the baseline of
99,866 students (43,232 female; 56,634 male), the final result was 32% over baseline (57,006 female;
74,005 male). There was also substantial progress on the outcome to increase the number of enrolled in
S&T programs in all beneficiary PBEIs, with targets also significantly surpassed. The target was 6%
above the baseline of 438,929 students (176,212 female; 262,717 males). The final results was actually a
26 % increase over baseline = 552,628 (230,770 female; 321,858 male).

50.     Better qualified S&T from senior secondary schools: Substantial results were achieved in
terms of increasing number of senior secondary school students who obtained a minimum of five credits
in S&T subjects at national examinations at beneficiary schools. While the target was 25% over the
baseline of 36,953 students (21,978 female; male 14,975), the actual result was 53% over baseline
(33,924 female; male 22,628).

51.     Better teaching, research & development, and partnerships/collaboration among S&T
PBEIs: Under grant awards aimed at improving teaching and learning at PBEIs (Sub-component 1b),
about 37 PBEIs benefited form 45 grants of up to US$3 million. Results included: (i) increased levels of
knowledge and interest among teachers of S&T in entrepreneurship and innovation; (ii) improved
motivation of students to apply knowledge of S&T to their environment; (iii) greater relevance in using
S&T in solving real community problems; (iv) improved laboratories with adequate facilities and
materials; (v) introduction of e-classrooms e.g. seventy students at the department of Mineral Resources
Engineering at the Kaduna polytechnic; (vi) upgrade of facilities for post-graduate and post-doctoral
training and research in solid state physics/material science led by Sheda Science and Technology
Complex; and (vii) entrepreneurial skill development in areas such as bee-keeping, fish farming, and
movie-making.

52.      After the first year of implementation, another positive effect on the education system of the
project was that based on good use of funds observed in Unity Schools that received grants under the
STEP-B Project, the Government decided to adopt the practice of direct disbursement to schools to
upgrade S&T for all its Unity Schools and not just on a competitive basis. An assessment of the
feasibility of rehabilitating science laboratories in all Unity schools was undertaken and funds reallocated

                                                   - 12 -
to accommodate this increase. This led to a significant increase in the number of students who were
reached. The better equipment, teacher support and classroom learning environment also led to higher
motivation and increased academic achievement, as evident from interviews during site visits and
available data.

53.      Regarding related support services to PBEIs (Component 3), the National Commission for
Colleges of Education made impressive progress to review S&T curricula and develop a teacher standards
framework for all the major areas (with support from external expertise). The National Board for
Technical Education, through collaboration with the South Korean Government, developed a National
Vocational Qualification Framework, and developed National Occupational Standards under the guidance
of the National Vocational Qualification Framework Steering Committee, with assistance from the
International Labor Organization and the International Standard Organization. The National Universities
Commission developed a conceptual framework for a Labor Market Observatory. The Federal Ministry
of Science and Technology: (i) revised its S&T Policy based on stakeholder consultation, and external
support and knowledge-sharing; and (ii) developed S&T Laboratory standards through its Nigerian
Institute of Science Laboratory Technology (NISLT). All of these, which have been put in practice, have
been important for providing guidance and quality assurance for overall policies and for each institution.

54.      PDO Objective 2: produce higher quality and more relevant research:
PDO Indicators: (1) percentage increase in the number of S&T publications from PBEIs in peer reviewed
journals/conferences; (2) number of national, regional and international teaching and research
partnerships established and operational involving beneficiary institutions; (3) percentage of fully
accredited S&T programs in beneficiary tertiary institutions.
Intermediate indicators: (4) number of students granted Innovators of Tomorrow awards, disaggregated
by gender; (5) Number of re-equipped and refurbished laboratories and workshops in all beneficiary
institutions; (6) Number of Centers of Excellence established fields of focus of CoEx; (7) Number of
working papers (technical and research reports, patents, publications, consultant reports, manuscripts
and manuals) emanating from research in STEP-B COEx); (8) Annual post-basic S&T education
statistics report produced and disseminated to key stakeholders.

55.     There was substantial progress made on all three core result areas under the objective to produce
higher quality and more relevant research: (i) regarding the number of S&T publications from PBEIs in
peer reviewed journals/conference, the target was10% increase over baseline of 0, and the actual result
was 391 publications; (ii) regarding the number of national, regional and international teaching and
research partnerships established and operational involving beneficiary institutions, the baseline was 24
and the target 34. The actual result was 112 partnerships established; and (iii) regarding the percentage of
fully accredited S&T programs in beneficiary tertiary institutions, the baseline was 16%, and the target
30%. The actual result was 53%.

56.    Increased Publications and Partnerships: At higher institutional levels (under Component 1),
good progress in research was reported with a significant increase in the number of publications and
enhanced partnership/collaboration among institutions, as noted above.

57.     With the Institutional Awards (Sub-component 1a – Window A), there was a high level of
participation from PBEIs (including about a dozen research institutes) in diverse areas such as agriculture,
biotechnology, food research, health sciences, engineering, renewable energy and technology (including
information technology). More than 160 grants of up to US$250,000 were awarded to a total amount of
around $39million. The intervention contributed to enhancing research and development in S&T and
boosting capacity for entrepreneurial skills development with potential job creation, though on a small
scale, such as in fish farming, mushroom cultivation, bee-keeping and information communication
technologies.

                                                   - 13 -
58.      With the Partnership Awards (Sub-component 1a - Window B), the provision of higher
incentives for partnership and collaboration among PBEIs yielded substantial benefits from joint research
and development. This would not have normally occurred among institutions whose preference was to
work individually. About 30 eligible PBEIs benefited from 45 grants of up to $3million for a total
amount of around US$19 million. A few proposals for emerging Centers of excellence were also
approved under this window. Key collaboration and partnerships yielded positive results in many S&T
research and development areas, involving more than 30 PBEIs. For example, The University of
Agriculture Abeokuta has pioneered innovation in biotechnology research in both plants and animals
focusing on yam, poultry and palm wine production through partnership with research centers in Italy
(Center for Genetic Engineering), in USA (International Livestock Research Institute and Cornell
University) towards capacity building and staff and student exchange. Another example of collaboration
and partnership relates to PBEIs partnership (e.g. NASENI, NARICT, Shetsco) with the Africa University
of Science and Technology (AUST) in mechatronics, materials research and development, and
nanotechnology. A third example of partnership and collaboration relates to the Federal Institute of
Industrial Research (FIIRO), Oshodi, in the development of a center for skills development and
acquisition in food processing, partnering with the Nigeria Institute of Food and Science and Technology,
the Nigeria Institute of Science Laboratory Technology, and Jagee Nigeria Limited.

59.      The Innovators of Tomorrow program (Sub-component 1a - Window C) was very attractive to
students in the final year of studies with innovative research proposals and potential S&T contributions.
Student awardees, supervised by the concerned PBEIs were given grants of US$20,000 each to enable
them to graduate with bachelors, masters, or doctoral degrees in S&T. A total of 587 students (of which
156 female) from 34 institutions (227 departments) benefitted from grants (project target was 360-400
awards) totaling about US$3.7million. A study to assess the preliminary impact of these awards revealed
that 10% of students under this program had completed their projects and graduated from their respective
institutions. More than 70% of students completed their programs, and the remaining ones are near
completion. Among the graduates, some have excelled in their field for example winning awards at PhD
level for Chemistry of Botany e.g. one student at University of Port Harcourt undertook a project on the
production of Biodiesel from Vegetable (Cucurbits) Seed Oils, which has raised awareness on biodiesel
research such that the university has witnessed a significant increase in the number of post-graduate
applications in biodiesel research. More than 80 beneficiaries have attended professional conferences both
locally and internationally.

60.      The emerging Centers of Excellence (Component 2) progressed well with much interest. Nine
areas of S&T priority were originally identified by 2009. Of 93 proposals received, nine were selected
after a review by the International Advisory Board and the Technical Review Committee for a total grant
of US$44million. By November 2010, two other proposals were approved: (i) Multimedia Technology
and Cinematography led by University of Lagos in collaboration with others; and (ii) Solid Minerals
Research and Development, led by Kaduna Polytechnic. Results include: (i) enhanced research and
development though collaboration and partnerships (both nationally and internationally); (ii) increased
technical and conference papers; (iii) acquisition of specialized equipment; (iv) focused capacity-building
in research and development; and (v) an increased number of graduates in various S& T areas.

61.     Policy and Management Support Services: Regarding related support services to PBEIs
(Component 3) to strengthen strategic planning, management and M&E in S&T Education, results
included: (i) support of 29 projects benefitting Regulatory Agencies and Research Institutes, including
five policy studies; (ii) decentralized capacity-building at post-basic education levels through extensive
training of personnel in leadership, management, financial management, procurement, and monitoring
and evaluation from almost 200 educational institutions (under five Regulatory agencies: Federal Ministry
of Education, Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, National Universities Commission, National

                                                  - 14 -
Board for Technical Education, and the National Commission for Colleges of Education); and (iii)
development of a framework for interconnectivity, and increased used of information communication
technologies across post-basic educational institution, as well as implementation of two information
communication technologies enabled service pilots i.e. (a) Skills assessment initiatives – ACCESS
NIGERIA which helped to improve curricula delivery and greater communication between institutions
through internet delivery, under which about 1,500 trainees were certified according to international ICT
standards for jobs in the IT-enabled service sector; and (b) Microwork for job creation to reduce
unemployment through microwork and e-lancing opportunities online, with an estimated 2,500
participants having been oriented in this field.

62.      STEP-B also aimed at contributing towards the development of a framework for interconnectivity
for the National Research and Education Network to facilitate development and sharing of resources
among institutions. The framework for the National Research and Education Network has been
developed, and the network is now fully registered. The physical facility for the National Research and
Education Network management has been established. Provisions have been made for further expansion,
and its sustainability mainly through the ownership and commitment of National Universities themselves
(with a contribution of 10 million nairas each).

3.3 Efficiency
          	
63.       The Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) economic analysis (Annex 3)
highlights the project’s relevance and efficiency through the following methods of analysis of benefits
and costs associated with the project: (i) rates of return data for upper secondary and tertiary education;
(ii) efficiency analysis by using graduation ratios as a proxy; (iii) comparisons of unit costs of expansion;
and (iv) qualitative evidence of project efficiency.

64.      As described in Annex 3, given the unavailability of some pertinent project data to undertake a
full internal rate of return analysis, sector level data analysis indicates that returns to secondary and
tertiary education are high and those for S&T fields are higher than other disciplines. National data on
employment status by education levels suggest that a higher education qualification leads to a higher
employment probability. It is clear that the project’s focus on post-basic education has potential for a
greater impact on labor market outcomes.
         	
65.      Rates of returns data on the national level show that the Mincerian estimate of returns to higher
education in Nigeria (96%) is higher than those of most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa while the
employment adjusted internal rate of return of 16% is comparable to Mali and Ghana. Therefore
investments in post-basic education, particularly S&T are critical in increasing relevance and
employability of the education reforms.

66.      While the standard method of calculating completion rates is by following a cohort of students, a
proxy of such an estimate comparing the ratio of students who graduate to those that were enrolled
supports the efficiency argument since the project promoted increased institutional autonomy, greater
system differentiation, strengthened governance, and mechanisms for quality assurance. The table below
shows that the completion ratio has increased by 9% as compared to the project baseline. The Project not
only led to reduced periods of graduation, but also had an impact on the ratio of students who completed
their graduate studies.

67.     With regard to comparison of unit costs of expansion, the project has led to a significant
expansion in the number of masters and senior secondary students graduating from beneficiary institutes
and schools. The percentage increases were well over the target rates with a 32% expansion in S&T
masters graduates and 53% in senior secondary students. The unit cost analysis of this expansion is based
on the capital costs of the project. Compared with recurrent costs across Ghana, Namibia and Senegal,
the unit capital cost of expansion for senior secondary in Nigeria is significantly lower, though a bit
higher than Uganda (see Annex 3, paragraph 4).

68.      Substantial qualitative efficiency took place under the project. Competitive funding led to greater
autonomy of participating institutions and effectiveness of grants. Procurement efficiency (ranging from
11-36% savings) was evident in the comparison of government and project procurement related to
renovations, laboratory equipment, internet interconnectivity and supplies. Other areas of qualitative
efficiency were increases in in-house R&D capacity, internet connectivity (from original University cost
of about US$1,260 for bandwidth costs per month to about US$130), more effective resource use,
reduction in graduation time due to availability of needed resources, and efficiency gains made by Centers
of Excellence through the availability of specialized equipment and collaboration for research and
development, and training.

69.      Developments under the project resulted in substantial cost-reductions and increased efficiency in
the S&T area. For example, the acquisition of specialized S&T equipment, and greater collaboration and
partnership (including through ICT) at lower costs than estimated at appraisal resulted in project savings
which led to the recommitment of unutilized project funds of about US$20 million equivalent to the new
Regional Africa Centers of Excellence Project. Furthermore, another area of efficiency gains pertains to
the cost of conducting research itself. The availability of needed equipment locally at different research
institutions to undertake advanced research analyses also made it possible to conduct research and
development at lower costs. A clear example relates to the cost of doing solid minerals analysis abroad
(e.g. South Africa) versus doing so at home, which diminishes the cost by about a third, as well as reduces
the time taken for the exercise.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

71.      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development: Part of the objectives was to
benefit poor people. Examples of impact include through the Fish Production and Bee-Keeping
technology in the University of Agriculture Makurdi, local farmers (including the poor) got hands-on
training in fish production and bee-keeping were able to utilize this knowledge themselves for developing
their livelihoods. In Zaria, training helped local farmers make better use of cheaper, locally produced
organic fertilizer. In Ondo at the Federal\Technology in Akure, which focused on food security (including
agriculture extension courses, and skills training) farmers were able to benefit from The Federal
University of Technology, Akure (FUTA) research and development in increasing crop yield and
resistance, and in preserving fish through modern smoking methods. Moreover, poor students were able
to tap internet connectivity through bandwidth expansion at much lower costs, which resulted in lower
cost to end-users.

72.      Part of the objectives of this program was aimed at increasing female participation and pass rates
in S&T. Data indicate a percentage increase of 31% over baseline data of female enrolment in S&T
courses (as recorded in 2013 Implementation Status and Result Reports). The independent assessment
conducted in 2012 shows that the percentage of female graduates from beneficiary PBEIs is about 43% of
the total S&T graduates across different group of PBEIs. Females had a 60% success rate in obtaining a
minimum of five credits in S&T subjects. Thirty percent of the students that were granted Innovator of
Tomorrow awards were females.

73.      Site visits to both girls’ secondary schools and to other institutions where female
lecturers/researchers were employed showed motivating role models to encourage female students to find
S&T engaging with career prospects. In some other schools visited, overcrowded classrooms were an
issue with both male and female students finding it difficult to participate in experiments and to hear/see
lectures. More is needed to address these areas in those respective schools.


                                                     - 17 -
74.      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening: This is one of the few programs in tertiary education
that is actively aiming to improve quality and relevance of tertiary education through a demand based
incentive system. This is a significant institutional change. Also, the fiduciary capacity developed during
the STEP-B project was applied to other parts of benefitting institutions e.g. the Federal University of
Abeokuta team provided fiduciary support in the proposal development for the winning proposal from
University of Abeokuta in the new Africa Centers of Excellence follow-on project. Other issues of
institutional strengthening have been dealt with in earlier sections of the ICR.

75.     (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative): Some institutions were
motivated to address other issues so they could continue with their work e.g. finding their power solutions
to ensure electricity and water supply to laboratories through solar power and rain water harvesting –
possibly showing a way to others for sustainability.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

76.      The ICR team undertook two regional Stakeholder Workshops in Abuja and Lagos. The team
also held in-depth consultations and focus group discussions during site visits to various project sites
including Minna, Kaduna, Zaria, and Lagos and with the project staff from Maiduguri. Participants
included secondary students, school teachers and headteachers; university/polytechnic/research institute
senior management, project staff, academic staff, and students; personnel from national regulatory
agencies; business persons from industry, and National Project Secretariat staff and other Ministry
officials. Specifically the survey sought to: (i) collate perceptions around the projects ability to increase
the number of qualified graduates and improve the quality of research for development; (ii) gauge impact
of the project in other dimensions; (iii) determine lessons learned from each institutions experience; and
(iv) determine reactions to initial findings of the ICR.

77.     Overall, beneficiaries perceived that the STEP-B project had made a difference to both increasing
the overall number and quality of S&T graduates and improving the quality of research and development
in areas of specific priority areas for Nigeria. Various individuals and groups of participants offered
different insights into lessons learned and their experiences, which reinforced the relevance of this project
design and need for further capacity building. They also offered various suggestions to gain further results
in a next phase of this work. These suggestions are listed in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
       Rating: Moderate

78.     Based on the current commitments and motivation of the Government, including for the new
investments on Centers of Excellence Project, there is a low to moderate risk that development outcomes
may not be maintained. From an institutional capacity perspective, all five regulatory agencies involved in
the project were deeply involved in implementation, and they will continue their respective mandate in
terms of regulatory framework, policy formulation and implementation, capacity-building, and
monitoring and evaluation. The new S&T policy and curriculum are being implemented, including the
new ICT curriculum for secondary schools. The National Vocational Qualifications Framework
developed under the project has been mainstreamed into the system and is being utilized. A large number
of post-basic educational institutions have been able to enhance their S&T development through
equipment acquisitions, building of trained core management teams, and developing stronger
interconnectivity for leveraging knowledge and collaboration.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

    (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
        Rating: Satisfactory

79.      The Bank team worked closely with Federal Government of Nigeria to prepare the project,
 undertaking detailed and extensive analytical studies to inform the new project and made conscious
 efforts to consult widely with stakeholders from the education, private and industrial sectors as well as
 the ministries. Project preparation took into account many lessons learned from previous projects and
 international good practice in the sector, the emerging labor market needs of the developing economy
 and the priority for human resource development. The design of the project sought to directly meet these
 relevant needs and to build on the evidence base.

    (b) Quality of Supervision
        Rating: Satisfactory

80.      The Bank team recognized implementation problems at an early stage. They took suitable
corrective measures to ensure that problems were managed so that development objectives were achieved.
By the time of the Mid-Term Review, the team was clear regarding specific implementation issues to be
addressed and was responsive through the project restructurings to reallocate funding where needed and
to adjust results indictors to be more measurable and realistic. The task team had an appropriate mix of
skills to deal with issues. Despite the fact that there were three task Team Leaders in charge of this
project over the project period, there appeared to not be any interruptions in due diligence and quality
assurance and all were experienced task team leaders. Location of the task team leader in the field office
provided a greater level of participation and oversight, and just in time assistance than if located in
Washington.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
        Rating: Satisfactory

81.     The team flexibly responded to the needs of the country and the education sector, working closely
together on the design and implementation of the project. There was solid team work throughout the
project and proactive, positive dialogue with stakeholders. Intense supervision by the team was
instrumental in assisting with moving implementation forward.

5.2 Borrower Performance

   (a) Government Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

82.      The commitment and ownership of the Federal Government of Nigeria along with its willingness
to learn from both broader experience and that of the current project to place priority on national needs
had a strong impact on project design. The Federal Government of Nigeria’s ongoing political will
facilitated project implementation. However there were project start-up delays caused by the general
election, followed by the irregular replacement of the National Project Coordinator at the start of the
project with a person not familiar with the work. This was a major setback at the start of the project. This
was exacerbated by the limited communication to the Bank team on this.



                                                   - 19 -
    (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
        Rating: Satisfactory.

83.     There was strong ownership by the Borrower for this project as evident in the setting up of the
National Project Secretariat even before Appraisal. After the set-back of the change of first Project
Coordinator noted above and the project got going, the National Project Secretariat made progress to help
successfully achieve the key project development objectives. This project used a very new paradigm of
demand-driven interventions and decentralized procurement using Bank guidelines across an extensive
network of institutions, and there were many new ideas to adjust to including the competitive funding
process, and oversight for procurement, financial management and M&E. While media and other
communication tools were used for information sharing, there was no clear communication strategy
implemented.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
         Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

84.     The government showed high commitment and motivation to implement the project. However,
with the irregular change of the initial National Project Coordinator, and limited capacity to adequately
address the many new procurement, fiduciary and M&E processes, implementation remained a struggle
during the project. Improvements were made towards the latter part of the project as extra technical
assistance was brought on board to directly assist institutions.

6. Lessons Learned
General Application:

85.     Quality reforms and those involving institutional capacity building tend to need extended
periods of time to firmly take root in changed thinking and practice, and therefore to have an
attributable effect on institutional reform through changed staff and student thinking. This is often
beyond the typical project period of four/five years, so learning expectations need to be realistic for what
can actually be achieved during a project period and what is planned for beyond this. (Section 1.4, 2.2)

Project Preparation:

86.      Ownership of the project and continued political commitment at national and decentralized
levels was critical for successful project implementation. Despite elections and bureaucratic changes,
stability and political commitment was demonstrated to stay the course with the project despite
challenging Bank procurement guidelines and other implementation challenges. However, ensuring that a
well-qualified and experienced National Coordinator remained in place at the critical beginning of the
project would have ensured a firmer start-up of the project. The Commitment and buy-in of the target
PBEIs was ensured at project preparation by the involvement of the education sector in the initial studies
and discussions and sensitization events (Sections 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 5.2).

87.      The call for proposals for Centres of Excellence to establish the competitive selection of
grants should be in place by project effectiveness to save implementation delays later. There were
some delays under STEP-B due to the long time it took to set up the call for proposal processes during
project implementation. This key lesson was applied under the Regional Africa Centers of Excellence
Project, where selection of centers to be supported under the project is determined prior to the project
implementation phase. This new arrangement was instrumental to avoid delays in the allocation of funds
for the Centers to begin their work. (Section 2.1, 2.2, 3.1)



                                                   - 20 -
Project Implementation:

88.      Project effectiveness was considerably enhanced when ongoing technical assistance by zonal
consultants was provided to ensure timely and direct assistance to institutions in areas of
procurement, financial management and M&E. This is critical to provide just-in-time advice to
support implementation. In view of the demand driven and competitive nature of funding applied for the
first time in Nigeria, and the fact that none of the PBEIs were familiar with the Bank guidelines, they
needed considerable assistance before they could start major activities. Just communicating requirements
and do a training event or two is not enough to develop capacity and compliance. (Sections 2.2, 2.4).

89.     Competitive and merit-based allocation of funds based on clearly identified performance
criteria was beneficial to raise motivation and standards and increase innovation. For this to work
effectively, the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms need to be adequately in place early to ensure
reasonable performance. If these are not in place early, the withdrawal of funding might be considered to
encourage compliance (Sections 2.1, 3.1, 3.6).

90.      To leverage relevant knowledge sharing and research and development in S&T which is
linked to current industry needs, the development of industry and sector partnerships is critical.
The capacity to develop and manage partnerships through STEP-B has been a key lesson learned for the
beneficiary institutions. For example, Abuja University of Science and Technology, although not a direct
beneficiary of funding benefited greatly from partnership with the material science industry partnerships
under SHETSCO. In addition, industrial placement between universities and institutions such as the
Federal Institute of Research Oshodi (FIRRO) facilitated up-to-date industrial training for students. As a
result, relevancy to industry needs and jobs has increased. (Sections 3.1, 3.2).

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

        (a) Borrower/implementing agencies

91.      The Borrower provided its own summary ICR in Annex 6. Moreover, the Borrower’s feedback
on the ICR was positive, concurring with the ICR content, and particularly its ratings. They also noted
they were highly pleased with the achievements recorded and the impact the project had made on
Nigerian institutions to improve the quality of S&T education. Suggestions by the Borrower for accuracy
as to the actual number of Federal (Unity) Secondary Schools obtaining funding was incorporated in the
revised ICR. In addition, the Borrower has revised its draft portion of the ICR to include latest
information, particularly on project sustainability.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Context

Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, with an estimated population of 168.8 million people and
is the second largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa. There are 36 states and the Federal Capital
Territory (FCT) and 774 local government areas. Nigeria’s education system comprises 9 years of basic
education (6 years of primary and 3 years of junior secondary), 3 years of senior secondary, and 4 years
of tertiary education. The provision of education is a concurrent responsibility of the federal, state and
local governments, with a fast growing private education sector also active at all levels of the education
system, especially at the primary level. The Federal Government plays a dominant role in the provision of
postsecondary education, while state and local governments have principal responsibility for the provision
of secondary and primary education.

The primary determinants of the government’s revenues and expenditures, including for public education,
are the performance of the country’s oil sector and the rules governing revenue-sharing arrangements (see
World Bank 2006a). Between 2004 and 2007, federal education allocations increased sharply, from N
126.4 billion to N 230.6 billion, or more than 80 percent. Nevertheless, federal education allocations
have not kept pace with GDP growth, declining from 1.8 percent of GDP in 2001 to 1.4 percent in 2007,
after reaching a low of 1.0 percent in 2004. As a share of the total federal budget, the federal education
budget declined slightly, from 10.7 percent in 2001 to 8.6 percent in 2002, but later increased from 11.8
percent in 2005 to 13.2 percent in 2006.

The economic analysis highlights the relevance and efficiency of the project through the following
methods:
        Rates of Return Data for upper secondary and tertiary education: the project creates skills that
          lead to higher earnings and therefore the additional earnings of those benefiting under the
          project can be used as an estimate of project returns.
        Efficiency Analysis by using graduation ratios as a proxy: project resulted in significant
          internal efficiency gains (such as when drop-outs and repetition are reduced) then the cost
          savings may be a good measure of project benefits.
        Comparisons of Unit Costs of Expansion: reflect on the returns to the resources invested
          under the project.
        Qualitative evidence of project efficiency


1.       Returns to Post-Basic Education in Nigeria: Investments are expected in education to increase
people’s productivity over their entire lifetime. In project evaluation it is useful to compute the present
value of the increase, assessed at the time of graduation for each cohort of project beneficiaries. The
calculation typically involves two steps: (a) estimating the relevant age-earnings profiles to obtain the
increment in earnings at each age, and (b) discounting the stream of incremental earnings to the time of
graduation using an appropriate discount rate. In the absence of project level data on returns to education,
we make use of sector level data to highlight that returns to secondary and tertiary education are high and
those for S&T fields are higher than other disciplines. National data on employment status by education
levels suggests that a higher education qualification leads to a higher employment probability. It is clear
that the project’s focus on post-basic education has potential for a greater impact on labor market
outcomes.

Rates of Returns to Higher Education – Comparative Analysis: The table below provides estimates of
the rates of return to higher education across selected countries in Africa. On average, the internal rate of
return increases once it is adjusted for the rate of joblessness. In countries where the likelihood of being in
employment varies considerably with the level of education, calculations of the rate of return to education
cannot ignore the effect it has on employment. The Mincer coefficient represents earnings premium
associated with having a higher education qualification. Nigeria has a fairly high rate of return to
education across all methods.

2.      Investments in S&T pay-off: The lack of availability of data constrained the analysis to provide
evidence of higher returns of S&T education as compared to other fields. Furthermore, there are also
limited data available within Sub-Saharan Africa to provide comparable estimates. The case for return
estimates from UK is presented below, pending more relevant data for Nigeria being available.

3.       Efficiency Analysis by using graduation ratios as a proxy: While the standard method of
calculating completion rates is by following a cohort of students, we have attempted to proxy such an
estimate with a comparison of the ratio of students who complete their studies as compared to those that
are enrolled. This estimate supports the efficiency argument since the project promotes increased
institutional autonomy, greater system differentiation, strengthened governance, and mechanisms for
quality assurance. The table below shows that the completion ratio has increased by 9% as compared to
the project baseline. The project not only led to reduced periods of graduation but also had an impact on
the ratio of students who completed their graduate studies.

4.       Unit Costs of Expansion: The project has led to a significant expansion in the number of masters
and senior secondary students graduating from beneficiary institutes and schools. The percentage
increases were well over the target rates with a 32% expansion in S&T masters graduates and 53% in
senior secondary students. The unit cost analysis of this expansion is based on the capital costs of the
project and therefore the amount of Component 1. The closest comparison data is from 2001 for unit costs
of expansion in senior secondary using recurrent costs. Compared with recurrent costs across Ghana,
Namibia and Senegal, the unit capital cost of expansion for senior secondary is significantly lower.

   5.      Qualitative Evidence for Project Efficiency: The project has experienced several
   implementation efficiency gains, even though there were some delays in terms of project effectiveness
   and initial implementation, insufficient capacity of grant recipient institutions at the initial stage and
   cancellation of funds. Critical areas of effective implementation include (i) effective resource allocation
   and transparent process and implementation of competitive S&T grants for quality and innovation; (ii)
   human resource development at decentralized levels through intensive capacity-building in management,
   monitoring and evaluation, finance, procurement, ICT, and communications; (iii) procurement; (iv)
   laboratory upgrading in S&T institutions; and (v) use of Information Communication Technology.
   Qualitative evidence for project efficacy includes:
        Competitive Funding: Competitive funding has increased the effectiveness of the system.
           Performance-based allocations encourage institutional autonomy as institutions must function
           under full management control of the available meager funds rather than being constrained by
           government bureaucracy that restrains universities to function effectively and efficiently. The
           principles of competitive-based funding for Science and Technology innovations and research
           and development are now instilled in beneficiary institutions. The percentage increase in
           recurrent grants between the years 2000 and 2009 was 247. 54 percent and for capital grants was
           445. 85 percent. The increase in funding figures between the years 2000 and 2009 seems
           encouraging and impressive and the project could have contributed towards the expansion in
           competitive grants.

   In-house R&D capacity: Support for the emerging centers of excellence under component B has
    led to and increased interest in S&T research of direct relevance to the Nigerian economy and
    extensive partnership among institutions has led to greater R&D capacity in federal institutes.
    Centers were able to upgrade laboratories and equipment and develop in-house research capacity.
    For instance, the equipment provided at the Centre of Excellence for Solid Minerals Research &
    Development has impacted positively on lecturers and students. Earlier R&D was largely
    outsourced to South Africa for analysis, resulting in a high cost of research. According to team
    estimates the in-house capacity has significantly reduced 1/3rd of the cost of R&D.
   Interconnectivity: Increased use of ICT (including Internet interconnectivity, networking, e-
    learning and multimedia facilities) among post-basic educational institutions allowed host
    communities of PBEIs to access Internet through their ICT facilities and resulted in fruitful
    collaboration with the New Economy Skills for Africa Program on provision of business process
    outsourcing and microwork training geared towards employment in the ICT-enabled services
    sector. The availability of VC connectivity and broadband Internet at PBEIs led to savings on
    communication and travel costs. Students and faculty are now able to collaborate and interact in
    an efficient manner.
    o        NREN becomes a single Local Area Network (LAN) comprising of all member
             institutions, thereby making it possible to pass traffic across the institutions as local
             traffic at 10 gigabit capacity. Communication between two or more universities that used
             to traverse the globe (using VSAT or even fiber belonging to several operators) is now
             done within a LAN made possible by connecting all institutions through the local internet
             exchange point (IXP) that keeps local traffic local. This has been technically proven to
             enhance the efficiency of internet connectivity by up to 80%.

   Reduced Graduation Time: Observations suggest that the availability of greater facilities and
    opportunities for innovation have reduced the average graduation period by up to 12 months.
   Utilization of Resources: The utilization of resources improved as the numbers of students
    enrolling in beneficiary institutions increased substantially over the course of the Project. Faculty
    productivity improved reflected in the increase in the number of publications and patents per
    faculty member. There was also improvement in the utilization efficiency of resources due to
    sharing of physical and human capital resources across networked institutions. The Project also
    improved organizational and administrative efficiency of project institutions, further improving
    the productivity of resources. Project sustainability was built in project design, given that
    measures were incorporated to strengthen capacity at post-basic educational institutions through
    intense training of at least 1,000 personnel, and to provide direct linkage with their respective
    regulatory agencies (themselves part of the project).
   Implementation Efficiencies of Centers of Excellence: The Centers of Excellence benefitted
    greatly from several of the Project components and were able to introduce administrative and
    procurement efficiencies within their institutes. Some examples are as below:

Annex 5. Beneficiary Assessment and Stakeholder Workshop results

Introduction: The ICR team undertook two regional Stakeholder Workshops (Abuja and Lagos), and
held in-depth consultations and focus group discussions during various site visits, including Minna,
Kaduna, Zaria, Lagos and with the project staff from Maiduguri. Specifically the assessment sought to: (i)
collate perceptions around the project’s ability to increase the number of qualified S&T graduates and
improve the quality of research for development; (ii) gauge impact of the project in other dimensions; (iii)
determine lessons learned from each institutions experience; and (iv) determine reactions to initial
findings of the Implementation Completion and Results Report. A wide range of beneficiaries were
consulted including staff and students from universities, polytechnics, research institutes, secondary
schools; personnel from regulatory agencies, private sector/industry, and the National Project Secretariat.

Methodology: The consultations provided opportunities to respond to a written questionnaire of mostly
open-ended questions, followed by more in-depth consultations. Other data also used to cross check
information included various institutional progress reports, institutional DVDs, focus group discussions
and the two regional stakeholder workshops. It should be noted that the National Project Secretariat also
undertook a Rapid Beneficiary Survey Assessment in December 2012.

Key Points Arising from Stakeholder and Focus Group Discussions with the ICR team:

Design:
    There was general agreement that the STEP-B project had had a positive effect on increasing
        science and technology in the country, especially in secondary schools where there had been a
        number of cases of parents moved their children from private schools to the Federal Government
        Colleges which had much improved science labs and perceived improved teaching.
    While there were weaknesses in procurement and financial management capacity (insufficient
        adherence to procedures, low quality financial reporting, limited adherence to reporting
        deadlines), the objective of providing grants through transparent, competitive mechanisms was
        perceived as an effective new paradigm and process.

Performance:
     Having funds flow directly to some S&T institutions with commensurate capacity building,
       helped render recipients fully accountable for use of the funds and delivery of objectives.
     Some institutional project teams struggled with multiple responsibilities within their institutions
       i.e. they had other competing responsibilities other than STEP-B management tasks.
     Funds appear to have been used for the purposes intended based on available information,
       although comments from the beneficiary survey indicate that there is some interference pressure
       being experienced at some institutions. Beneficiaries strongly advised that the Bank maintain the
       control and oversight of funds flow.
     Despite the good overall outcome results, site visits to different institutions showed various types
       of engagement between students and mentors. In some cases, the collaboration was strong with
       students very active in joint research. In a few cases, students were left for long periods of time
       without tasks to undertake i.e. supervision less than optimal. This will need monitoring to ensure
       time and skills are maximized from both groups.
     In some instances, lecturers reported that they needed to pay journal fees before they were able to
       submit journal articles for peer review. The extent of this practice was not able to be ascertained.
     There has been an increased use of ICT to deliver academic instruction (e.g. instructors able to
       download suitable teaching materials; using ICT to deliver instruction to students and set up
       administrative tasks including monitoring of student work; and internet connectivity
       communication with other faculty between institutions). This has been especially important to

                                                   - 39 -
          assist delivery of instruction for large classes (e.g. at University of Jos, some compulsory first
          year courses have more than 1,500 students; Kaduna Polytechnic has e-classroom facilities in all
          the five campuses – seating capacity for 70 students and being fully utilized). It has also been
          reported that this delivery mode has been useful to reduce sexual harassment in some cases,
          especially important for increasing numbers of females in classes.
         Some participants noted the increase in entrepreneurship as a result of the project e.g. at the
          University of Abuja, University of Agriculture, Makurdi and Federal Polytechnic Idah’s capacity
          building in honey bee production and fish farming.
         Participants reported a reduction in the time it took post-graduate students to finish their research,
          and an increase in science and technology interests, including the non-oil sector.
         Under the Innovators of Tomorrow program about 30% of the 587 students were female. About
          45% of the awards were for Ph.Ds, and 19% Master of Science. In University of Lagos, one
          beneficiary won the Best Ph.D. in Pharmaceutical Chemistry award for 2009/2010 year.
         The management procedures were perceived as effective i.e. NPS to provide policy guidance,
          coordination and capacity building assistance such as the zonal consultants. The International
          Advisory Board and the Technical Review Committee provided transparent and international
          standard processes to manage the evaluation process. The Regulatory Agencies (FME, FMST,
          NUC, NCCE and NBTE) provided oversight and management support to implementing agencies.
          At the institutional level, Sub-project Implementation Units (SSIUs) managed the institutional
          processes and deliverables.

Recommendations:

(i)       To Increase Access to S&T Courses in Secondary Schools/Tertiary Institutions:
         Focus strengthening foundational skills in primary school including basic reading and

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
Summary: The Nigerian education system comprises 9 years of basic education (6 years primary and 3
years junior secondary) and 7 years post basic education (3 years of senior secondary, and 4 years of
tertiary). The provision of education is the concurrent responsibility of the Federal, State and Local
Governments. A fast growing private educational sector is active in all levels of the education system
catering to a sizeable number of students. Key issues that cut across all levels of education are:	
      Inequitable access to quality education
      Inadequate quality and relevance of teaching and learning
      Inadequate management, planning, and monitoring capacity
      Inefficiencies in funding and lack of targeted funding
      Poor quality S & T graduates and disconnects with the needs of the private sector

The Project: The STEP-B project essentially aimed to improve the quality, equitable access to, and
relevance of science and technology education at the Federal post-basic level so as to increase the
country’s competitiveness in a globalizing world and to promote improved responsiveness of the post
basic institutions to the needs of the labor market.

Management Structure: The FME owned the project and collaborated extensively with FMST. The
NPS (under the FME) provided coordination and oversight management nationwide. The Regulatory
Agencies provided oversight and technical support to the institutions. The sub-projects in the PBEIs were
managed by the SSIU.
Implementation Constraints included: The constraints included the Project being spread all over
Nigeria, inadequate capacity of NPS and SSIUs and poor understanding and implementation of the
Bank’s Procurement and Financial Management procedures.
Implementation Achievements included:
    32.17 % increase in S & T Courses
    72 international quality research publications
    76 Operational National Regional International Research and Teaching partnerships established
    26% increase enrolment in S & T courses (22.5 % male and 30.9% female)
    158 Laboratories re-equipped or refurbished
    587 Students granted IOT awards
    6 technical papers and 60 working research papers completed
    National Secondary S & T Curricula review completed
    National Vocational Qualification Framework developed
    Draft National Standards for S & T teacher education developed and piloted
    National S & T Laboratory Standards drafted
    Conceptual framework for Labour Market Observatory developed
    Tracer studies for graduates updated
    University System Portal developed and functional




                                                 - 42 -
Beneficiaries: 198 Institutions directly benefitted from STEP-B. The poor in the society, students and
teachers, firms, State and Federal Governments, and Innovation Clusters also benefitted.
______________________________________________________________________________

1.1     Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background: The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) plays the dominant role
in the provision of postsecondary education, while State and Local Governments have principle
responsibility for the provision of primary and secondary education. FGN maintains a system of Federal
Education Institutions: Universities, Polytechnics and Colleges of Education. The Federal level also
includes about 120 Federal secondary schools.

Key issues that cut across all levels of education are:
   (i) Inequitable Access To Quality Education: affects children in rural areas (especially girls) and
         children of lower income households throughout the country.
   (ii) Inadequate Quality And Relevance Of Teaching and Learning for science, mathematics and
         technology education at the post-basic levels resulting in poor quality graduates.
   (iii) Inadequate Management, Planning And Monitoring Capacity of FME to develop education sector
         strategic plans and related annual implementation plans is weak.
   (iv) Inefficiencies In Funding And Lack of Targeted Funding.
   (v) Poor Quality S&T Graduates and Disconnects with Needs of the Private Sectors.
1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

With approved revisions after the Mid-term Review (MTR), May 13, 2010: The PDO was for
Nigerian Federal Post-Basic Education and Research Sub-Sector to produce more and better qualified
S&T graduates, and higher quality and more relevant research. The key outcome indicators are: 
   (i) Increase in the number of master degree graduates in S&T related disciplines in (Post Basic
         Educational Institutions (PBEIs); revised to Percentage increase in the number of Science and
         Technology (S&T) graduates from PBEIs.
   (ii) Increase in the number of students obtaining grades B and above in S&T disciplines in PBEIs;
         revised to Percentage increase in the number of Senior Secondary School Students that obtain a
         minimum of five credits in S&T subjects at National Examination Council (NECO) in beneficiary
         schools.
   (iii) Increase in number of S&T publications from PBEIs in peer reviewed journals; revised to
         Percentage increase in the number of S&T publications from PBEIs in peer reviewed journals/
         conferences.
   (iv) The number of new collaborations (partnerships and institutional links) by Federal PBEIs with
         international institutes; revised to Number of National, Regional and International teaching and
         research partnerships established and operational involving PBEIs.
   (v) Percentage (%) of fully accredited S&T programs in Federal PBEIs; revised to Percentage of
         fully accredited S&T programs in beneficiary Tertiary Institutions.

1.3    Main Beneficiaries: The main beneficiaries were PBEIs (which included Federal Unity Colleges,
Colleges of Education, Polytechnics, Universities and Research Institutes.




                                                 - 43 -
     1.4    Other significant changes in addition to component revisions: (i) The project was extended by 21
     months beyond its initial life span of four (4) years to 5 years and 11 months to allow for adequate time to
     implement some PDO-critical project activities. The closing date was extended from September 30, 2011
     to June 30, 2013; (ii) Streamlining/refinement of development outcome indicators and intermediate
     outcomes and indicators to better match the project design and improve monitoring.

2.         KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES
     Delays at Implementation: The delay in project effectiveness and slow take-off was due to change in
     government, delays in receiving the Letter of Legal Opinion from the FGN changes and delay in putting
     in place new leadership at the FME after the 2007 elections, delay in recruiting the key staff of the
     National Project Secretariat (NPS), and initial weak implementation capacity of NPS and PBEIs.
     Implementation Protocol: The project was implemented as designed with the Federal Ministry of
     Education (FME) as the implementing agency in collaboration with Federal Ministry of Science and
     Technology (FMST). The NPS under the FME had full responsibility for overall project coordination,
     oversight of project activities, and project reporting. The NPS also liaised regularly with the World Bank
     and all stakeholders including the FME, the FMST, National Universities Commission (NUC), National
     Board for Technical Education (NBTE), National Commission for Colleges of Education (NCCE), the
     National Project Steering Committee (NPSC), and the Education Trust Fund (ETF).
     STEP-B Sub-Project Implementation Units (SSIUs) were set up at the PBEIs. The structure of the SSIU
     mirrored that of the NPS, comprising of the Project Coordinator, Procurement, Finance, M& E, Audit,
     Technical Assistance, and Communications Departments. S&T faculties of selected PBEIs implemented
     sub-projects in their local environment under the direction, oversight and supervision of the NPS.

     As proposals were received at the NPS, it became clear that project objectives could be better achieved by
     making the project demand- driven. So beneficiaries were encouraged to submit proposals based on areas
     of need, their capacity, and their potential for successful implementation. Once the proposals were
     screened and approved, the beneficiary PBEIs’ SSIUs administered and implemented the project with the
     funds granted. SSIUs provided project reports as scheduled.

     Implementation Experience: Overall, the project was successfully implemented. The PDOs and Key
     Performance Indicators (KPIs) were met (and exceeded in some instances). However, the following
     challenges persisted throughout the projected, lessening in volume and impact as the project progressed:
     (i) Effectiveness in procurement and financial management were problematic at the beginning of the
     project but improved with capacity building and intense supervision; (ii) Poor data collection due to
     inability of the PBEIs to use the pre-designed data collection tools and ineffectiveness of the tools
     designed to capture service-level quantitative data. The M&E tools were also redesigned to enhance data
     collection and reporting; (iii) Adequacy of data management system for data storage and retrieval and
     improvement in the level of data analysis for the NPS and the Regulatory Agencies; and (iv) Extensive
     use of electronic media as a cost effective and efficient information documentation and information
     sharing and feedback between NPS, Regulatory Agencies, institutions, national level partners, and other
     stakeholders.
     M & E Design: After the Mid-Term Review (MTR), the Results Monitoring Framework (RMF) was
     revised based on prevailing situations in the benefitting to increase realism of some of the indicators.
     Zonal Consultants were contracted to provide implementation support to PBEIs on need basis. The Zonal
     Consultants monitored progress and provided reports to NPS as needed.
     M&E Utilization: The independent assessment conducted in 2012 revealed that some SSIUs lacked
     sufficient capacity to carry out M&E and ability to analyse the data collected. The SSIUs also exhibited
     weaknesses in systematic use of M&E data to strengthen the project.

                                                        - 44 -
Environmental and Social: The Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) was the only safeguard policy
that was triggered. The MTR revealed that World Bank’s environmental safeguards clauses for minor
civil works were not consistently inserted in contracts and also that site specific Environmental
Management Plans were not prepared by the contractors. Changes were made to ensure compliance.
Financial Management: Adherence to the Financial Management arrangements for the project was
satisfactory. (i) Funds were used for the purpose intended; (ii) For the most part, financial reports and
production information for project management and government oversight were timely; and (iii)
Compliance with IDA fiduciary requirements was satisfactory.

Interventions in the Project’s Financial Management challenges included: (i) Financial Management
Training for Project managers and officers; (ii) Sensitization of Finance and Audit Committee on their
roles and responsibilities; and (iii) Internal Auditor Training for PBEIs on Risk Based Auditing.

Procurement: Poor procurement practices in a few PBEIs (most were rectified by the end of the project)
included: (i) Project Team Members turning themselves into Suppliers; (ii) Poor procurement planning
and contract packaging; (iii) Funding of selected activities of one PBEI by another beneficiary PBEI, with
both PBEIs claiming credit for project outcomes and impacts; (iv) Poor procurement filing and
documentation including poor contract documentation; (v) Persistent lack of understanding or poor
knowledge of World Bank procedures; (vi) An inadequate procurement capacity of the Project
Procurement Officers despite workshops attended and hands-on training received. These issues were
rectified with capacity building, use of zonal Procurement Consultants, and intense supervision.

Post- Completion Operation/ Next Phase:
Institutional Capacity: (i) The FME and FMST now have capacity to conceptualize and implement
various types of education sector enhancement projects; (ii) The design of the project provided for RAs to
supervise activities of PBEIs and agencies under their purview allowing for continuity and improvement
on the gains of the project; (iii) Trained human resources will continue to be available at all levels
(PBEIs, the RAs, FME, FMST, and the NPS) even after the close out of the project.


3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation: All the three components were appropriately
linked to the PDOS and maintained to bring about gains to both the educational sector and the economy
through improvements in learning environment, capacity building, financial management, procurement,
and M&E. The decision to cover the Federal PBEIs across the six geological zones and make funding
competitive, merit based, and demand-driven resulted in improved project impact and the achievement of
the KPIs. The challenges (weakness in NPS and SSIU capacity) notwithstanding, the core of the project
design remained highly relevant. Project restructuring were necessary adjustments to address
implementation challenges.

Based on the relevance rating of “Highly Satisfactory” for objectives and “Satisfactory” for design and
implementation, the overall relevance is rated “Satisfactory’’.

Achievement of Project Development Objective
Overall rating of “Highly Satisfactory” was achieved.

Summary of Project Achievements: The project built capacity within participating PBEIs. They were
able to manage and evaluate merit based S&T funding according to international best practices and to
increase the percentage of graduate and post graduate level in S&T courses with skills and qualifications


                                                  - 45 -
of international standards relevant for sustained growth in Nigeria. 132,001 students graduated from
PBEIs in S&T courses, making 32.17% increase over baseline. Male: 74,995, Female: 57,006.

List of KPIs Used to Measure Achievement of the PDO and Results Achieved
    (i) Percentage increase in the number of S&T graduates from beneficiary PBEIs. The project
          targeted a 6% increase from the baseline for the number of S&T graduates from PBEIs, but by the
          end of the project it achieved 26% above its target.
    (ii) Percentage increase in the number of senior secondary schools students that obtain a
          minimum of five credits in S&T subjects at national examination at beneficiary schools. A total
          of 56,552 students obtained a minimum of five credits including mathematics and English. (Male:
          22,628 Female: 33,924): 53% increase over baseline.
    (iii) (Percentage increase in the number of S&T publications/ presentations from beneficiary
          PBEIs in peer reviewed journals/ major conferences. Output data showed that the project
          achieved 76 Publications in total.
    (iv) Number of National, Regional and International teaching and research partnerships
          established and operational involving beneficiary institutions. At inception of the project there
          were no National, Regional and international teaching and research partnerships. Available
          outcome data showed that 77 were established.
    (v) Percentage of Fully Accredited S&T Programs in Beneficiary Tertiary Institutions. The
          Percentage of fully accredited S&T programs in Beneficiary Tertiary Institutions increased by
          77% above project target (from 16 fully accredited S&T programmes in the PBEIs to 53).

Efficiency of operations and procedures of the project is “Satisfactory”
Budget implementation and control was effective. Overall, there is no funding deficit. The initial budget
was $180 Million. As of this writing $10 Million remains unallocated. What is clear at this point is that
actual spending is less than the initial estimate. At the same time, all project objectives and KPIs were
achieved (and exceeded in some cases). In comparison with other projects of its kind in Nigeria, it is
believed that STEP-B is the most successful.

Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Overall Outcome is Satisfactory is reasonable for the following reasons: (i) PDOs were achieved; (ii) All
KPIs were achieved (and exceeded in some instances); (iii) Challenges with Procurement, Financial
Management, and M&E were addressed effectively and in time so that they had little or no effect on the
achievement of outcomes; (iv) The NPS and SSIUs adhered to the Bank’s standards and followed Bank
procedures (there were no material breaches); (v) Benefitting Institutions demonstrated high levels of
buy-in and ownership of the projects; and (vi) Institutional and sector-wide knowledge and capacity have
been developed based on best practice and international standards.

Overarching Themes, other outcomes and Impacts
(i) Poverty Impact
     Through the Fish Production and Bee Keeping technology in University of Agriculture
       Makurdi- local farmers got hands-on training in Fish Production and Bee Keeping.
     The research by Michael Okpara University of Agriculture (Abia State), gave rise to
       discoveries such as Mucuna (plant) species with useful properties for removing heavy metals
       from the soil and metal components of crude oil. A veterinary Plant (Spondias Mombin L.) that
       can be used by farmers to feed lactating ruminants in the face of scare concentrate diets was also
       discovered.
     Nigeria Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRID) - Abuja forged a good
       research relationship with the herbal medicine practitioners.
     ABU Zaria has a nutrition group conducting researches to come up with complementary food that
       addresses nutrition challenges in Nigeria.

(ii) Gender Aspect: Data from the STEP-B 2013 ISRs indicates a percentage increase of 31% over
     baseline data of female enrolment in S&T courses. The independent assessment conducted in 2012
     shows that the percentage of female graduates from beneficiary PBEIs is about 43% of the total S&T
     graduates across different group of PBEIs. Females had a 60% success rate in obtaining a minimum
     of five credits in S&T subjects. 30% of the student that were granted IOT award were females.

(iii) Social Development: The deployment of ICT has made teaching and learning easier and less
      cumbersome as against the use of old textbooks that students could not relate with due to obsolete
      references. Teachers teach with ease using more vivid illustrations. There is also an increase in the

                                                  - 47 -
    collaborations: Product Research and Development Agency Enugu purchased a refractometer,
    Ubbelohde Viscometer and a flue gas analyser which are being used by all institutions in the south
    east of Nigeria. The x-ray diffractometer purchased by S & T complex in Sheda Abuja is being used
    by from scientists all over Nigeria. Partnerships fostered under the guidance of the NPS included HP,
    ZTE Corporation, Hitachi, Data system, Huawei, Zinox, etc.

(iv) Institutional Change/ Strengthening: Major functions of the Education Sector benefited from
     capacity building. The institutional changes include:
      Development of Frameworks for National Board of Technical Education and minimum teacher
         training standards for National Commission of Colleges of Education.
      Partnerships between academic institutions and industries in the public and the private sector.
      Upgrade of equipment and rehabilitation of research labs increased the institutes’ capacity to take
         on more scientists and produce higher quality data that meet international standards.
      Molecular Biology and Biopharmaceuticals developed at National Biotechnology Development
         Agency (NABDA). Curriculum was developed for the Biopharmaceuticals resulting in the
         establishment of Department of Pharmaceutical Micro Biology and Biotechnology in Universities
         in Nigeria. The fund supported identification of 22 courses in biopharmaceutical curriculum.
         NABDA now has the capacity to intervene in viral outbreaks.
      PBEIs gained through evidence based knowledge transfer. Attendees of overseas seminars and
         workshops trained their colleagues once they returned to their institutions.

(v) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (Positive or Negative)
     A four-year strategic plan by the FME for the education sector that focuses on quality assurance,
       access, and equity.
     Increase in collaboration between PBEIs in Nigeria and reduction in the “silo mentality” among
       institutions.
     Revival of competitiveness among Federal PBEIs stemming from having to write winning
       proposals to qualify for funding.
     Increase in transparency and accountability of usage of project funds. This was enabled through
       the use of Bank’s procedure for procurement and financial management, and the peer- review
       approach to proposal review.

Summary of findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or stakeholder Workshop: A rapid Beneficiary
Survey took place in December 2012. Moreover, multiple stakeholder workshops were held annually,
amongst other things, to gather beneficiary feedback and to take appropriate corrective steps.

4.   ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME
Rating: Overall Assessment is Moderate.

Risk to Objectives
The overall Risk to the Development Outcome is rated as Moderate. The major risks were poor
procurement practices and Financial Management. The following risk mitigation measures were taken:

       A technical assistance programme assisted the FME (including NPSC, NPS, TRC and IAB) and
        the Federal S&T-PBEIs in transparent fiduciary management and reporting. Intensive training
        was provided on procurement and financial management to the implementing units.
       The NPS and the Bank ensured that PBEIs had established and approved fiduciary and
        procurement procedures before Grant award.
       Experienced staff from the participating PBEIs were seconded to the S&T implementing sub-
        projects.

                                                  - 48 -
       Extensive staff training was provided before and during project implementation at all levels under
        the technical coordination of the NPS.
       Surveys of user satisfaction among the PBEIs and S&T units that benefitted from the project were
        conducted several times during the project implementation period.
       Transparency was further ensured by the STEP-B website (www.STEP-Bng.org), where all
        relevant and pertinent information regarding the project were published.

Sustainability
It is likely that the PDO will be sustained for the following reasons: (i) the project developed institutional
capacity and provided equipment and facilities in 198 institutions spread out throughout Nigeria. The
sheer pervasiveness of the coverage of STEP-B project will translate into sustainability; (ii) project
Implementation, Financial Management, and Procurement manuals were developed and used for
implementation. In addition, most of the operational activities and systems were mainstreamed into the
RAs, FME and FMST. These institutional mechanisms and facilities if well maintained should help
sustain development outcomes. (iii) It is likely that the FGN will sustain project gains, especially with
improved technical capacity and functioning institution-based project management committees in
beneficiary PBEIs (though there is currently no plan in place to do so).

Technical Risks
New risks identified during implementation and restructuring was in the technical aspects of the project.
(i) Limited capacity in the NPS to guide and monitor over 500 grants covering a number of
activities at over 200 project institutions spread throughout Nigeria (rated “substantial”). (ii) The
risk was mitigated with assistance from different RAs and recruitment of field based consultants. The
bank team also intensified support throughout project implementation and conducted a number of in-
depth reviews in 2011 and 2012. (iii) Lack of implementation capacity in secondary schools
benefiting from the project (rated “moderate”). (iv) The risk mitigating measures taken were extensive
training in various areas of project management, project implementation, and support in Fund
Management. (v) Resistance to any systemic and institutional reforms based on studies (rated
“substantial”). (vi) The risk mitigating measures taken included Stakeholder’s workshops and
communications planned to raise awareness, grants based on needs put forward by the institutions, and
performance based criteria used for grant approval.

Risk to Component Result
(i)     Insufficient knowledge and experience with Bank procurement and financial management
procedures that may cause delays in project implementation (rated “substantial”).
As already stated in other parts of this report, this was due to lack of adequate and satisfactory
implementation capacity on the part of those institutions that use the project’s grants. The risk was
successfully mitigated. The following measures were implemented to mitigate the risk: (a) Procurement,
financial management, disbursement and implementation training for key staff in the implementing units
during project implementation; (b) Training for NPS staff and adequate TA support prior to effectiveness
and during implementation of the project. (c) Adherence to the TA plan for the development and
sustainability of an effective M&E system focused on S&T in PBEIs.
(ii)   Lack of incentives, ownership of and high staff turnover in key implementing units (rated
“moderate”): Generally, the staff of the SSIU were motivated and PBEIs demonstrated a high sense of
ownership. However, high staff turnover in some institutions was a major challenge.
(iii)   Lack of clear policy for the development and sustainability of Nigerian Centres of Excellence
in S&T (rated “moderate”): Funding mechanisms such ETF and PTDF are already established for
education and research which includes the CoEs.

5.   ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE
Bank Performance: Overall bank Performance Rating is “Satisfactory”

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating for Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is “Highly Satisfactory”. The Bank Team
(i)   Adopted an intensive participatory approach involving substantial national expertise in diverse
      technical areas.
(ii) Provided assistance in project preparation, identified and facilitated preparation and pre-appraisal
      operations to achieve planned development outcomes.
(iii) Conducted a wide, intensive, consultative preparation process that was considered “satisfactory” by
      Senior Government Officials of FME, Regulatory Agencies and PBEIs that had the responsibility
      of implementation.
(iv) Ensured professional quality in preparation that was based on public education expenditure reviews,
      technical assistance and feasibility studies.
(v) Undertook economic and financial analysis. In addition, Nigerian counterparts benefited from a
      workshop organized by the Bank team on “Strategic Choices for Education Reform” in January
      2007.

Quality of Supervision
Overall Performance in Quality of Supervision is rated “Satisfactory”. The Bank Team: (i) Provided
necessary support to move the project forward. As at February 2013, there have been 12 supervision
missions jointly conducted by the FGN and the World Bank and in March 2013, there was another
implementation support mission review. (i) The Task team leaders were involved in the lending operation
and supervision missions, thus supervision was adequate. (ii) Supervision teams, comprising a stable mix
of appropriate skills, were instrumental in identifying implementation challenges and proffering feasible
solutions to address them. (iii) Some key project officers at the NPS believed that the project fared well
because of the strong on-going, just-in-time support from staff of the World Bank. (iv) There were also
dialogues and training workshops with stakeholders and implementing agencies.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Based on the ratings for Quality at Entry (satisfactory) and quality of Supervision (satisfactory), the
rating for overall Bank Performance is satisfactory.

Borrower Performance	
Borrower Performance Rating is “Satisfactory”
Government Performance
Government Performance is rated “Moderately Satisfactory” for the following reasons: (i) The general
elections and leadership transition in the country and at the FME was a major factor in the delay of the
project. (ii) Once change in leadership was completed, the Government showed commitment to achieving
the PDOs. Necessary legal documents were quickly executed. The new leadership at FME quickly got on
board and committed its resources as needed. (iii) The FME and FMST remained actively involved in the
project throughout the project life, and ensured that all Bank Standards were met and procedures were
followed.
Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating of NPS is rated “Satisfactory”: (i) Achievement of PDOs and KPIs – “Highly Satisfactory”.
Despite initial challenges with data collection, procurement, financial management, and consistence of
staff at SSIUs, all PDOs and KPIs were achieved (and exceeded in some instances). (ii) Management and
Administration – “Satisfactory”. The structure and effectiveness of the NPS was adequate enough as
implementation issues raised by the PBEIs or the Bank were resolved effectively and timely. (iii)
Monitoring and Evaluation –“Satisfactory”. Despite initial challenges with data gathering tools and

                                                  - 50 -
measurement metrics, M & E was effective enough to ascertain that the KPIs were achieved. (iv)
Financial Management- “Satisfactory”. At the core of the Financial Management was compliance with
World Bank Standards and implementation of the Bank’s procedures. All covenants stated in the PAD
were adhered to. (v) Audit- “Moderately Satisfactory”. The Bank’s Audit standards were complied with
and procedures followed. Internal Audit was risk based. For expedience, only post payment audit was
carried out on all payments for recurrent and capital expenditures. (vi) Procurement- “Moderately
Satisfactory”. There were initial challenges with Procurement Management at the SSIUs (Poor
procurement planning, contract packaging, filing, and documentation including poor contract
documentation, issues of conflicts of interest with project staff becoming contractors). (vii)
Communication- “Moderately Satisfactory”. Though the project plan relied on utilization of
communication tools and media for dissemination of information and learning, there was no clear
communication strategy that was implemented.

6. LESSON LEARNED
Project Preparation
       Government Ownership and Continued Political Support: Where major changes in leadership
        are anticipated, contingency plans should be put in place to ensure that challenges are dealt with
        quickly to minimize any delays that may occur.
       Commitment and Buy-in of Target PBEIs: The Commitment and buy-in of the target PBEIs
        was ensured at project preparation by the involvement of the education sector in the initial study
        and discussions and sensitization events. The granting process was demand-driven which meant
        that the PBEIs determined what was funded based on their needs and capacity.
       Effective Management Structure: The model of the management structure at NPS being
        replicated at the beneficiary institution’s SSIU allowed for alignment of project management.
       Capacity Building for the NPS and the Benefiting Institutions: The project preparation should
        always include initial capacity building as part of the development plans for the main project
        management organization (in this case NPS). In STEP-B’s case, this was especially necessary as
        this was a new Project and all the staff being employed or seconded onto the project were new.
        Challenges of divided loyalty could have been dealt pre-implementation if the plan included staff
        in key roles like M&E, Procurement Officers, and Accounts, to be hired specifically for the
        project.
Project Implementation
Granting Process: The granting process was very effective. The STEP-B project was largely demand-
driven, based on pre-agreed criteria. Beneficiaries submitted proposals based on their needs and their
capacity to implement. If the initiative fell within the scope of the project, it was evaluated against the
agreed criteria. This ensured PBEI buy in and commitment to the project.
Management and Administration
       Establishment of Project Implementation Teams (SSIUs) in all PBEIs including Centres of
        Excellence that were replicas of the management structure of the NPS was an effective strategy.
       SSIUs needed dedicated staff (like the NPS to be fully effective). Whereas staff of the NPS were
        selected specifically for their role at the NPS and had no other responsibilities from their previous
        roles, some members of the SSIUs had double responsibilities (their regular jobs and their roles
        on the STEP-B sub-project). This often created conflicts and irregularities with delivery.




                                                   - 51 -
       It was assumed that the use of staff from the academia would guarantee adequate staff capacity.
        Experience showed a systemic lack of knowledge of the Bank’s standards and procedures
        resulting in compliance challenges.
       Ensuring that project team members have relevant qualifications and experience to meet the
        demands of the respective roles they occupy will ensure the glitches in procurement and financial
        management do not occur. Benefitting institutions seconded staff onto the SSIUs based on varied
        understanding of the demands of the various roles on the SSIU. This resulted in mismatch
        between the demands of the roles and the competence of the staff placed in these roles.
Procurement Management and Financial Management: It should never be assumed that just
communicating the Bank’s standards and procedures for procurement is enough to ensure consistency and
compliance. Project staff should be trained and retrained in the implementation of the Bank’s standards
and procedures prior to and during project implementation.
Communication: Effective communication is critical to the success of any project. A communication
strategy that clearly spells out and segregates audiences, appropriate media, and the frequency and
modalities of communication ensures effectiveness. It was not clear what frequency of communication
was considered adequate from the start. Communication between the NPS and PBEIs was initially
insufficient.
Sustainability: STEP-B has made a good number of contributions to the development of R & D and the
teaching and learning of S&T in post basic educational institutions. The Federal Ministry of Education
has approved funds through annual budgetary provision and Tertiary Education Trust funds to sustain the
project achievements. The Ministry also intends to have formal discussion with the World Bank on the
possibility of requesting for a new project, albeit with some design changes. Meanwhile, the FME has
also approved that the current STEP B Project structure including the National Project Secretariat and the
PBEIs should remain and continue to function beyond the formal project closure in order to scale up
activities already embarked upon.
Knowledge Management
       The design document made no provisions for Knowledge Management Strategy. There was no
        effort to document the range of strategies and practices used to identify, create, represent,
        distribute, and enable adoption of insights and experiences on the project in real-time. There are
        no records of process documentation as the various implementing institutions carried out projects.
        Rather, insights and experiences are embodied in individuals. Institutional processes and
        practices were often dynamic and malleable to meet World Bank directives and standards as
        communicated by the NPS or by World Bank Mission staff.
       Reports, invoices, memos and letters in soft and hard copies constitute the repository of the range
        of strategies and practices used on the project. Some of these records are kept at the World Bank,
        others at the NPS, and each institution maintained its own information as it deemed fit. As the
        project draws to a close, efforts should be made to collect and collate all documents in hard and
        soft copies and store in a repository.
       All STEP-B NPS staff as well staff SSIUs of the PBEIs attended various training programmes
        (depending on their area of responsibility). Teachers from S&T Units of various Unity Schools,
        lecturers from S&T Departments of Tertiary Institutions were also trained. The knowledge gained
        through the plethora training programmes should be organized and documented, and that
        information deposited into a repository that will serve as a National Knowledge Database.
