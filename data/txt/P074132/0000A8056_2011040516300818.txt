                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Development Objective of the Project (PDO) is for the Nigerian federal post-basic education and research sub-sector to produce more and better qualified
                         science and technology (S&T) graduates, and higher quality and more relevant research.

                          The proposed project will also build capacity within the participating federal Post-Basic Education Institutions to manage, monitor and evaluate merit-based
                         S&T funding according to international best practices. The project would be a first phase (of a longer-term program) of making it possible for Nigeria to produce
                         an increasing number of university graduates with relevant skills and qualifications in S&T areas relevant for sustained economic growth in Nigeria.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         After a slow start, the project is now on track. The project was restructured for more effective implementation. Some components were modified, development indicators rationalized,
                         credit funds reallocated between components and categories of expenditure, and the project closing date extended from September 2011 to June 30, 2013. Since Project

                         restructuring became effective in August 2010, good progress is noted in all three components. In terms of physical progress, 587 students (about 30 percent females) benefited
                         from the Innovators of Tomorrow program; (ii) about 720 grants (against an appraisal target of up to 600 grants) were awarded for quality of learning and research; (iii) Eleven
                         Centers of Excellence had grants approved (amounting to about US$55 million equivalent in commitments); and (iv) most planned studies planned have commenced. The final call
                         for proposal for competitive funding was issued in December 2010 - the proposals are under review.

                         Early signs of project impact indicate some positive results: (i) increased enrollment in S&T at all levels (33% at school level to 19% at university level in two years); (ii) the National
                         Project Secretariat reported increased interest in S&T research of direct relevance to Nigeria; (iii) increased co-operation and extensive partnership among institutions; and (iv)
                         greater transparency in public funding and procurement.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         All institutions, especially those having received funding for Centers of Excellence have been advised to expedite project implementation strictly as per project guidelines to ensure
                         project success at closing. Decisions on the final round of selection of proposals need to be taken by April 2011 to give adequate time to institutions for project implementation. All
                         major procurements also need to be completed during Calendar Year 2011.
