                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Development Objective of the Project (PDO) is for the Nigerian federal post-basic education and research sub-sector to produce more and better qualified science
                         and technology (S&T) graduates, and higher quality and more relevant research.

                          The proposed project will also build capacity within the participating federal Post-Basic Education Institutions to manage, monitor and evaluate merit-based S&T
                         funding according to international best practices. The project would be a first phase (of a longer-term program) of making it possible for Nigeria to produce an
                         increasing number of university graduates with relevant skills and qualifications in S&T areas relevant for sustained economic growth in Nigeria.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The project continues to make substantial progress under all three components. In terms of physical progress: (i) 587 students (about 30 percent females) benefited from the
                         Innovators of Tomorrow program; (ii) about 720 grants (against an appraisal target of up to 600 grants) were awarded for quality of learning and research; (iii) Eleven Centers of
                         Excellence are implementing their approved grants (amounting to about US$55 million equivalent in commitments); and (iv) most planned studies are nearing completion. Several
                         institutions have obtained grants under the final round of proposals issued in December 2010. NPS has embarked on an effort to extend additional grant funding to Post-Basic

                         Educational Institutions, based on their performance on ongoing/completed projects.

                         Early signs of project impact indicate some positive results: (i) increased enrollment in S&T at all levels (33% at school level to 19% at university level in two years); (ii) the National
                         Project Secretariat reported increased interest in S&T research of direct relevance to Nigeria; (iii) increased co-operation and extensive partnership among institutions; (iv) availability
                         of well-equipped S&T laboratories in post-basic educational institutions; (v) increased use of ICT; (vi) fruitful collaboration with the New Economy Skills for Africa Program on
                         provision on business process outsourcing training geared towards employment in the ICT-enabled services sector; (vii) framework and standards for teachers at the National
                         Colleges of Education; (viii) framework on National Vocational Qualifications for the recognition of skills and competence acquired on the job, based on nationally-validated
                         assessment and certification system; and (ix) greater transparency in public funding and procurement.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         To ensure project success, all institutions, including Centers of Excellence are making efforts to expedite project implementation as per project guidelines. All remaining procurement
                         also need to be completed expeditiously. There is need for the Federal Ministry of Education and Regulatory Agencies to ensure continuity and project sustainability, especially at
                         post-basic educational institution level.
