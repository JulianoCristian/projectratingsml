                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Development Objective of the Project (PDO) is for the Nigerian federal post-basic education and research sub-sector to produce more and better qualified science
                         and technology (S&T) graduates, and higher quality and more relevant research.

                          The proposed project will also build capacity within the participating federal Post-Basic Education Institutions to manage, monitor and evaluate merit-based S&T
                         funding according to international best practices. The project would be a first phase (of a longer-term program) of making it possible for Nigeria to produce an
                         increasing number of university graduates with relevant skills and qualifications in S&T areas relevant for sustained economic growth in Nigeria.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Early signs of project impact indicate some positive results: (i) increased enrollment in S&T at all levels (33% at secondary school level to 19% at university level in two years); (ii)
                         increased interest in S&T research of direct relevance to the Nigerian economy; (iii) increased co-operation and extensive partnership among institutions; (iv) availability of well-
                         equipped S&T laboratories in post-basic educational institutions; (v) increased use of Information Communication Technologies (ICT); (vi) fruitful collaboration with the New Economy
