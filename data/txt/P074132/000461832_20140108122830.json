for Nigeria had an overall satisfactory\n            outcome, with satisfactory performance from the Bank, while\n            the borrower's performance was deemed to be moderately\n            satisfactory. All the project development objective\n            indicators as well as the intermediate outcome indicators\n            were fully achieved, with many results surpassing the target\n            by a significant margin. Significant lessons learned during\n            the course of implementing the project are: 1) quality\n            reforms and those involving institutional capacity building\n            need extended periods of time to firmly take root in changed\n            thinking and practice, and to have an attributable effect on\n            institutional reform through changed staff and student\n            thinking; 2) ownership of the project and continued\n            political commitment at national and decentralized levels is\n            critical for successful project implementation; 3) project\n            effectiveness is considerably enhanced when ongoing\n            technical assistance by zonal consultants is provided to\n            ensure timely and direct assistance to institutions in areas\n            of procurement, financial management and monitoring and\n            evaluation; 4) competitive and merit-based allocation of\n            funds based on clearly identified performance criteria is\n            beneficial to raise motivation and standards and increase\n            innovation; and 5) to leverage relevant knowledge sharing\n            and research and development in science and technology\n            linked to current industry needs, the development of\n            industry and sector partnerships is critical."}, "docdt": "2013-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
