The changes are based on the\n            extensive discussions held with Government of Nigeria (GoN)\n            during the Mid Term Review, or MTR (February 12-25, 2010) of\n            the project and a request dated August 31, 2009 for\n            reallocation from GON. After a delay of about one year, the\n            project is now on track. As of MTR, about 37.8 percent of\n            funds are disbursed. Another 25 percent are committed,\n            mainly for establishment of nine Centers of Excellence (CoE)\n            in critical S&T areas for Nigeria chosen from 93\n            proposals. The MTR rated the project to be moderately\n            satisfactory with a potential of upgrading to Satisfactory\n            soon after release of the grants awarded to CoE (component\n            two) and commencement of planned studies for systemic\n            reforms (component three). Component one covering about 200\n            institutions is progressing well. Project management,\n            procurement, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) are\n            rated moderately satisfactory. Counterpart funding,\n            safeguards compliance are rated satisfactory. There is no\n            audit overdue. The project is in general compliance of all\n            legal covenants."}, "docdt": "2010-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
