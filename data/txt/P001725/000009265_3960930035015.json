The project builds on experience gained during the\n            implementation of the pilot project.  The main elements of\n            the program are:  (i) efficient organization of extension\n            services, provided with adequate human and physical\n            resources, at the farmer, regional and national levels; (ii)\n            regular and continuous training of responsible officials at\n            each level by means of a system of fortnightly, monthly and\n            annual training sessions; (iii) strengthening of the\n            linkages between the extension services and the national and\n            regional research services; (iv) strengthening of relations\n            between the crop farming, livestock and environment\n            services; (v) functional literacy and numeracy training both\n            for men and women.  Investment will be in:  (a) civil works;\n            (b) vehicles and equipment; (c) incremental operating costs;\n            (d) on-farm research; (e) training; and (f) short-term\n            technical assistance to establish and periodically supervise\n            a project accounting and budgeting system."}, "docdt": "1991-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
