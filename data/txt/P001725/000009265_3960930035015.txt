NEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO HALI
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PR TJECT
1.        The  folloving  memorandum  and  recommendatlon  on  a  proposed
development credit to Mali for SDR 1P.3 million (US$ 24.4 million) le
submitted for approval.  The proposed credit vould be on standard IDA terme
with 40 years maturity and help finance the first phase of a long-term
program almed at improving agricultural services to farmers and herders.
2.        Backaround.  Agriculture ln Mali accounts for about 50O of GDP and
75X of exporte and le the main or only source of livelihood for 85S of the
people. Agriculture grev at 2X per year between 1960 and 1989, but with
considerable inter-annual fluctuations due to rainfall variabflity. Improved
performance in agriculture vill be critical for future growth, poverty
alleviation, food security and sound envirormental management. Agrieultural
policies have been significantly lmproved la the last few yeare, culminating
ln the Agricultural Sector Adjustasnt project (Credit 2163-MLI) which vas
approved on June 22, 1990. Farm prices have been decontrolled, except for
c-Qton for which prices are now set in relation to border parities. Most
lu.it subsidies have been eliminated, and input distribution has been largely
privatized. Public investment planning le being improved, and annual revieve
have led to improved design and a significant svitch from publie irrigation
to rainfed farming. Area development projects are being phased out la favor
of national programs in support services and natural resource management.
The proposed project has been prepared on the basis- of a pilot extension
program undertaken by the Government and flnanced by IDA since 1988. lhe
results of the pilot program, which reached la 1989/90 over 40,000 farmers,
vere evaluated in 1990 by an interministerial team. The overall conclusion
of this evaluation vas highly positive vith substantial lacreases ln yields
ln test plots in the farmer's fields.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project forms an integral part
of IDA's sector development strategy; a closely-related project la national
agricultural research le under preparation, and pilot operations in village
land management are being undertaken as preparation for a natural resources
management project. IDA's considerable experience la agricultural extension
has made a valuable contribution to the above-mentioned pilot program and
vill help Government make a auccess of the proposed project.
4.        Proiect Obiectives.    The proposed project  seeke to improve
agricultural services to farmers and herders ln order to lacrease their
incomes. Complementary objectives are to increase poverty alleviation and
food security and to improve environmental management. The project vould be
the fîret four-year phase Qf a long-term national program.
5.        Proiect Descriotion.    The project vould have  two principal
components.  The firet, which vill bu-lmplemented--by the  Directorate_ of
Agriculture of the Ministry-of Agriculture and the Directorates of Forestry
and Water Resources, and Livestock of the Ministry of Environment and
Livestock, is improvement of crop, livestock and forestry extension services,



-a -
based on lessons learned during the pilot operationss systematic ln-service
training of extension staff at all levels, formal research-extension linkages
and on-farm trials, and careful implementation and effectiveness monitoring
vould be key ingredients of this component. The second, which is functional
literacy and numeracy training both for men and vomen, vill be hiplemented by
the National Directorate of Functional Literacy and Applied Linguistics of
the Ministry of Education which has long standing experience and a highly
successful record in this activity ln Mal4. The project, to be carried out
over four years, vould provide funding for --vehiçles, equipment and m»deet
infrastructure,  manpover  development  and  training  costs,  incremental
operating coste, and short-tern consultants.  The total cost of the project
is estimated at US$ 27.1 million equivalent vith a foreign exchange component
of US $ 13.5 million (502). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown  in  Schedule  A.    Amounts  and  methode  of  procurement  and  of
disbursements, and the disbursement sochedule are shown ln Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the statua of Bank Group
operations ln Mali are given in Sciedules C and D respectively.  A map i.
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9073, dated March 5, 1991, is
also attached.
6.        Agreed Actions.   The Goverument has agreed on the following
actionst (a) as conditions of effectivenesa: (L) presentation to IDA of the
first-year training program; (iL) the legal establisbment of the Technical
Coordinating  Committeet  (iii)  subaission  to  IDA  of  a  satisfactory
organization and vonk program for the monitorlng unit; (iv) a satisfactory
accounting system and accounting personnel satisfactory to IDA viii be in
place; (v) a mechanism to Lieure counterpart funding vill be in placel (b) as
covenantes (i) a joint mid term-review vill be held no later than June 30,
1993; (il) Government vill submlt to IDA by the end of March each year a
consolidated vork program and budget for the next cropping season; (ili)
Government vill submit to IDA not latet than the end of March each year an
analysis of project resuits as established by the monitoring unit and propose
monitoring objectives for the next season.
7.        Environmental Impact.  The main thrust of the vork of the crop,
livestock and forestry extension services to be supported under the project
vill be Lncreasing land productivity.  This vill be realized primarily by
improved cultural practices and tmproved herd management, i.e., low-cost
(often zero cash cost) and low-risk measures such as soll conservation, vater
harvesting, contour planting, zero tilling, composting, alley-cropping, agro-
forestry and better lntegration of crops and livestock, as vell as more
efficient application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Adoption of
these measures vill both increase land productivity and arrest soil
degradation.   It is thus anticipated that the proposed project vould be
environmentally positive.
8.        Benefits.  The project, vîth its broad range of activities, vill
greatly contribute to the improvement of living conditions of a large number
of rural families and to the agricultural sector overall. About 45Z of the
rural population (450,000 families) vould be reached by improved extension
services. The main benefits are expected te be (a) increased production and
productivity of both-the crop and livestock sector, (b) increaaed--autonomy
and self-reliance of village associations due to functional literacy sed



numoracy training which vill provide most villages with a cors group of
functional literates able to manage the affaire of the village and (c) more
skilled human resources due to the continuing training programs for farers,
horders and government staff.   Additional benefits would be tmproved
management of natural resources, improved integration of livestock vith
agriculture, and botter focussed agricultural research to farmer and herder
neoda.
9.        li_ks. The riaks ares (a) the possible inability of extension nd
research services to produce workable solutions to farmera' and herders'
problems; (b) problema of inter-agency coordination: and (c) the possible
failure of Government andlor donors to austain the long-tenm coumitment
required to achieve durable improvements in the effectivenoss of agricultural
support services. To minimite these risks, the lessons learned during the
pilot project implementation have been built into the project design.
Finacîal and management capabilities will be strengthened and annual revievs
of work plans and budgets, as ,ell as -the mid-term implementation reviîe and
close Bank supervision, vill provide an adequate number of opportunities for
program review and long-term commitment building.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit vould
comply vith the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Esecutive Directors approve the proposed credit.
