Key lessons learned included: An\n            institutionalized system of close collaboration with other\n            projects, agencies, and nongovernmental organizations yields\n            a much greater impact than would be possible with a standard\n            project. Farmers desire to assume responsibility for\n            activities that were formerly carried out by extension\n            services. To increase the effectiveness of the second phase\n            of the National Agricultural Extension Program, which would\n            require an increased role for farmers and farmers\n            organizations in both decisionmaking and financing of\n            services, decentralization and institutional reform are\n            needed. While low cost technologies can easily be introduced\n            in a favorable environment, the next level of technologies\n            requires that priority needs--like access to credit and to\n            markets--are addressed at the farm level at the same time\n            before these technologies can be adopted. Literacy trainers\n            need to be provided incentives in a systematic way in order\n            to encourage the most successful ones to stay in the\n            villages and continue training new students."}, "docdt": "1999-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
