four-year timeslice of a long-term national program designed\n            to strengthen agricultural, livestock and forestry extension\n            with a view to generate increased agricultural production\n            and sustained growth of farmers' and herders'\n            incomes.  The project builds on experience gained during the\n            implementation of the pilot project.  The main elements of\n            the program are:  (i) efficient organization of extension\n            services, provided with adequate human and physical\n            resources, at the farmer, regional and national levels; (ii)\n            regular and continuous training of responsible officials at\n            each level by means of a system of fortnightly, monthly and\n            annual training sessions; (iii) strengthening of the\n            linkages between the extension services and the national and\n            regional research services; (iv) strengthening of relations\n            between the crop farming, livestock and environment\n            services; (v) functional literacy and numeracy training both\n            for men and women.  Investment will be in:  (a) civil works;\n            (b) vehicles and equipment; (c) incremental operating costs;\n            (d) on-farm research; (e) training; and (f) short-term\n            technical assistance to establish and periodically supervise\n            a project accounting and budgeting system."}, "docdt": "1991-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
