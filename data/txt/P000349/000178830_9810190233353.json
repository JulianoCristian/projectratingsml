project\n            are to: (i) improve and extend water supply systems in 13\n            secondary centers and two major cities, Douala and Yaounde,\n            with particular emphasis on low income areas, as a first\n            major step toward achieving the Government's sector\n            program of 100 percent potable water services in urban areas\n            in 1990; (ii) lay the ground work for organized urban\n            development planning for Douala and Yaounde; (iii) initiate\n            a pilot public health education project in order to ensure\n            that the public health benefits which should derive from the\n            project are realized; and (iv) strengthen the organization\n            of the water supply sector. The project consists of six main\n            components: water supply systems for 13 secondary centers;\n            expansion and reinforcement of Douala water systems;\n            expansion and reinforcement of Yaounde water systems; master\n            plan studies for water supply, sewerage and drainage for\n            Douala and Yaounde; consulting services for hygiene\n            education; and a program of specific actions to be\n            undertaken by SNEC to strengthen its management and organization."}, "docdt": "1979-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
