Project for Chile were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            balanced project design and adequate team supervision are\n            critical to achieve agreed intermediate indicators and final\n            goals. The project benefited from a very stable environment\n            and it has proven an ideal context for institutional\n            reforms. The National Financial Administration System\n            (SIGFE) project was instrumental in supporting these reforms\n            process, avoiding any disruption and facilitating an orderly\n            evolution process of modernization. Chile provides good\n            example for many nations. It has decided to take longer, but\n            critical steps. By doing so, transparency and governance\n            indicators compared with international benchmarks have been\n            stable and even facilitated the increase of foreign\n            investment and economic growth. The efficient allocation of\n            resources and timely reporting have promoted and benefited\n            from efficiency gains. It is crucial to incorporate the user\n            into the design and implementation process. The Central\n            Agencies needed to coordinate both the messages and the\n            actions in order to avoid confusion among the other agencies\n            and to maximize the impact on government functioning.\n            Finally, the importance of institutional tolerance to\n            mistakes and the open discussion of alternative solutions\n            protected the project goals. In the case of SIGFE, instead\n            of insisting on following the original plan, the project\n            redesigned the initially complex prototype that was\n            interfering with the dissemination process as soon as it was identified."}, "docdt": "2007-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
