1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

For almost three decades, Chile has been firmly committed to economic liberalization and free
trade. Chile has had the most robust economic performance in Latin America and it figures
prominently among the list of winners from globalization. Chile has averaged an annual per capita
growth rate of over 4 percent over the fifteen years since the return to democracy in 1990. Chile's
economic success reflects past economic reforms, strong public institutions and the maintenance
of a solid macro-economic policy framework.

    The soundness of Chile's public institutions, together with prudent fiscal policies and a strong
commitment toward the rule of law, have been critical factors contributing to the country's
economic success. Public sector modernization as a whole has remained a top priority in the
agenda of presidential administrations since 1990, with the modernization of public expenditure
management being one of the central pillars of the reform efforts. Although Chile's budget
procedures had been effective in yielding the fiscal surpluses critical to macroeconomic stability,
by the first half of the 1990's they were identified as an obstacle to the efficient allocation of
public resources. As opposed to more modern budget systems, Chile's budget was characterized
as having a narrow focus on controlling expenditures rather than on promoting the efficient and
effective use of resources, assessing the results of spending, and fully accounting for the economic
costs incurred.   There were approximately 117 different financial management `systems' in
Chile's central administration, including 16 semi-manual ones. Consequently, there were delays
of up to 7 weeks or more in reporting some financial transactions to the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) and, multiple data were provided in different formats inhibiting financial and economic
analysis. As a result of a hierarchical structure with the Ministry of Finance at the apex, line
agencies lacked financial and management skills and played only a minor role in planning and
executing their operations. In addition, a lack of timely and adequate information, together with
insufficient capacity for planning and evaluation, undermined service delivery. Finally, the
legislature and the public saw the budget process in terms of haggling over incremental annual
changes in resource allocations rather than an opportunity for more informed debate on strategic
goals and trade-offs. To address these shortcomings, in 2002 the Government sought Bank support
to strengthen its public expenditure management. The Bank responded by financing the First
Public Expenditure Management Project (Loan No. 7141-CL) for a total amount of US$23.23
million, which was approved in February 19, 2002.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

N.A.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The project's primary beneficiaries have been the government agencies where the sub-systems
were to be implemented, including the Ministry of Finance, the Comptroller General's Office
(CGR) and all agencies using the new systems.

1.5 Original Components
Component 1 - Financial Management Modernization (US$11.85 million, of which US$9.02
million were to be financed by the Bank): This component supported a comprehensive effort to
modernize and integrate the government's financial management information system, focusing on:

1.1. Implementation of a Financial Management Information System (FMIS): This sub-component
supported the design, testing, and installation of a modern integrated financial management system
at the central, sector and ministry levels.
1.2. Related Sub-Systems Reform: This sub-component supported the revision of the Borrower's
business processes and norms in accounting, cash management and procurement in order to
maximize gains in efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency.

Component 2 - Budget Reform to Create a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
(US$1.91million, of which US$1.55 million were to be financed by the Bank): This component
provided support to strengthen DIPRES' capacity for:

2.1. Multi-Annual Financial Planning: This sub-component supported the strengthening of
DIPRES' capacity to focus on macroeconomic, fiscal, and public investment policies as a means
for deciding on the allocation of resources and the budget in a forward-looking multi-annual
context.
2.2. Budgeting by Results: This sub-component supported the development of methodologies to
strengthen the implementation of existing programs for result-oriented budgeting, including
Performance Indicators, Evaluation of Governmental Programs, Comprehensive Evaluations, and
Governmental Priorities Fund.




                                                2

Component 3 - Human Resources Management Information System (US$2.42 million, of
which US$1.93 million were to be financed by the Bank): This component provided support for
the design and implementation of an information system for human resource management and
control in central government agencies, including DIPRES and CGR.

Component 4 - Strengthening MOF's Financial and Human Resource Management
(US$13.06 million, of which US10.4 million were to be financed by the Bank): This component
supported the strengthening of the institutional capacity of DIPRES, the Comptroller General's
Office, and financial management and human resources management units of central government
agencies to ensure the successful implementation of the IFM and human resources management
systems.

Component 5 - Reform Management (US$4.03 million, of which US$0.1 million were to be
financed by the Bank): This component financed the costs of the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU).

1.6 Revised Components

Project components remained unchanged throughout the life of the project.

1.7 Other significant changes

    Amendment to the Loan Agreement: The original loan agreement was modified in mid-2002 to
    change the terms of the loan from variable-spread to fixed-spread terms. As a result, the loan's
    number changed from 4650-CH to 7141-CH.
    Extension of the closing date: The loan's original closing date was extended six months, from
    December 31, 2006 to June 30, 2007.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The ICR finds the quality at entry to be Satisfactory. The loan objectives were consistent with
those of the Bank as articulated in the 2002 CAS (CAS Report No. 23329-CH; February 19, 2002),
which emphasized the need to continue to focus on the modernization of the state that, in turn,
supported the other two CAS objectives, namely: sustaining economic growth and social progress
and heightening inclusion.     The Project also reflected the Government's own priorities, as
reflected in the `State Reform and Modernization Program' instituted by the Lagos
Administration, which sought to deepen public sector modernization to obtain further
improvements in efficiency and effectiveness, enhance transparency and access to information, as
well as promote a culture of service and public participation. E-government and the
implementation of state-of-the-art information systems such as the ones supported under this
operation were an important feature of the Lagos administration's state modernization agenda.
Thus, the Bank's team recognized a window of opportunity to strengthen Chile's public
expenditure management, capitalizing on the Borrower's self-motivation and the Bank's ample
expertise in public-sector modernization in general and public expenditure management in
particular.

    The appraisal team correctly identified a set of core areas of intervention that could have a
significant impact on enhancing public expenditure management. Accordingly, the project's four
substantive components focused on these areas of intervention, capitalizing on the progress
already made in these areas and strong ownership on the part of the main actors, particularly




                                              3

DIPRES in the Ministry of Finance. These components provided a comprehensive navigation
chart that included clearly defined outcomes and a corresponding timetable.

    Drawing from an in-depth analysis of the lessons learned from previous operations and best
practices from the Bank's global experience, the appraisal team clearly identified the key
determinants of the project's success and incorporated them into the reform strategy. Strategically,
the project capitalized on the main findings of the 1997 World Development Report by, inter alia,
supporting operational decentralization with appropriate policy oversight and uniform standards.
Operationally, the appraisal team ensured adequate project preparation resources, strong support
from top government officials and sound technical capacity of the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) and counterpart team. Likewise, the project's design and implementation strategy included
risk-control mechanisms to minimize the risks stemming from the logistical challenges of
implementing state-of-the-art information systems in a large number of government agencies with
a wide array of needs and technical capacity. First, under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF),
the project financed the design of prototypes of the financial and human resources management
systems to test the main functionality, engage end-users in the process, and validate their design
before launching full development efforts. Second, project implementation was conceived in
stages, piloting the newly developed information systems in small groups of agencies in order to
identify lessons from experience and internalize them while maintaining fiscal control.

2.2 Implementation

    Stable macroeconomic conditions: Project implementation benefited from a stable
macroeconomic environment, with economic growth accelerating from 2-3 percent in 2002 to
above 6 percent in 2004 and 2005. Chilean authorities within the Ministry of Finance capitalized
on this stability, focusing fully on the modernization efforts.
    Political stability: The project benefited from Chile's remarkable political stability. The
government agendas of President Ricardo Lagos (2000-2006) and President Michelle Bachelet
(2006-2010) built upon those of the two preceding administrations of the Concertación coalition,
providing continuity in the country's overall policy framework. Public sector modernization has
been a high priority in Chile's medium-term development agenda. Together with stable macro-
economic policies and targeted investments in human capital and social protection, strong public
institutions are seen as key factors in achieving the larger development objectives of sustainable
and equitable growth and poverty reduction.
    Political support: The development and implementation of the financial management system
(Sistema de Información para la Gestión Financiera del Estado ­ SIGFE) benefited from the
support of the highest authorities within DIPRES. In fact, DIPRES' sub-director also served as
the Project's Executive Director and was closely involved in its implementation, effectively
leveraging his position within DIPRES to promote SIGFE's implementation in individual
government agencies by forging agreements with the top agencies authorities. Conversely, despite
the strong sense of ownership of SIAPER within the division responsible for its development (i.e.,
"División de Toma de Razón y Registro"), the latter lacked comparable political support from
top CGR authorities. This, in part, reflected the fact that the post of Comptroller General remained
vacant for over a year, from early 2006 to April 2007.1
    Clear assignment of responsibilities: An agreement was subscribed between DIPRES and
CGR transferring sole responsibility for developing and implementing SIGFE throughout the
central government to DIPRES. Similarly, the CGR was responsible for developing and

                                                4

implementing SIAPER. This clear assignment of responsibilities contributed to facilitating
coordination between the two institutions.
     In-house versus outsourced product development: While DIPRES relied on in-house resources
for the development of SIGFE, the CGR opted to bid out the development of the human-resources
management system (Sistema de Información y Control del Personal de la Administración del
Estado ­ SIAPER) to a consultant firm. Both approaches had their pros and cons. While the
quality of the initial SIGFE product suffered as a result of the incremental approach toward its
design and development, DIPRES was able to fully control the pace of the development process.
Moreover, the process of `learning-by-doing' served to develop the maturity needed within
DIPRES to define the characteristics and functionality of the next-generation of SIGFE (the
development of which is being contracted out under the follow-up operation). In the case of
SIAPER, the winning bidder subcontracted SIAPER's development to a smaller consultant firm
that lacked the necessary technical capacity, which resulted in substantial delays. Although a more
capable consultant firm was eventually subcontracted, the initial delays were never overcome,
including wide-scale rollout of and accessibility to HR management data.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project benefited from an extensive set of indicators. While the PDO of improving the
effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency of the Chilean public administration was too broad, two
of the three Key Outcome Indicators helped to narrow it down. Specifically, two of these
indicators (i.e., Internet-based reporting of budget execution according to specific criteria and
financial information available in real-time to policy makers) were well defined and easy to
measure. The third one (i.e., adjustments made to budgets based partly on strengthened financial
and performance indicators) was rather ambiguous, as it did not specify the expected level of
utilization of performance indicators in budget-allocation decisions.

    An extended set of output indicators were identified for each of the four core project
components. Some of these indicators were valuable in terms of measuring the impact of the
activities being carried out under each component (e.g., all central government agencies reporting
financial transactions on line to the Ministry of Finance no later than 24 hours after accounting
closing dates). Other indicators were less valuable in terms of measuring project outcomes, but
provided a detailed timetable for the implementation of SIGFE and SIAPER (e.g., CGR has
piloted a human resources information system in five agencies by June, 2003).

    The loan agreement also required the preparation of Annual Project Plans (APP) specifying
the main activities to be implemented during the year, their timetables, costs and corresponding
share of IBRD and Borrower financing. These APPs were very detailed, particularly for
Components 1 and 4 that were fully under the auspices of the project's PCU. They were a
valuable M&E tool that supported the original Results Framework throughout the life of the
project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The PCU had adequate financial management systems, software, and trained staff. Annual audits
were conducted by an external auditing firm regularly throughout the life of the loan. No
irregularities were identified during project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

     Follow-up operation: The Second Public Investment Management Project (Loan No. 7485,
US$24.8 million) was approved on August 28, 2007. Its overall development objective is similar



                                                5

to that of its predecessor: to increase efficiency of financial management operations, effectiveness
of budget planning and execution, and transparency in public expenditure management. This
objective would be achieved through the upgrading and expansion of SIGFE and the development
and implementation of a new municipal financial information system. In addition, the follow-up
operation will finance the continued improvement of M&E mechanisms and budget execution, as
well as the implementation of SIAPER throughout government agencies at the central level.
    Mainstreaming of the PIU: The institutionalization of SIGFE is already taking place as of
2007. A budget for SIGFE operations has been approved, independent of the Bank-supported
follow-up operation. The government has also approved financing for the ongoing administration.
In line with Chile's excellent track record of dismantling project units at the end of the project
cycle and integrating its functions into the regular administration, the Government has decided to
maintain the PCU for a limited time during the implementation of the new operation. Specifically,
the SIGFE's PCU is scheduled to be dissolved in the second year of the project, and assimilated
into DIPRES as a unit. A first step has already been taken to mainstream and institutionalize
SIGFE's team within DIPRES by designating the head of DIPRES' ICT unit as the person in
charge of ICTs for the SIGFE project to ensure that the technology and the strategic priorities of
SIGFE are well aligned with the institution.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The operation's objectives continue to be highly relevant for Chilean authorities, as public sector
modernization remains a top priority in Chile's development agenda. In November 2006,
President Michelle Bachelet, the fourth president leading the country since its return to democracy
in 1990, announced her Transparency and Probity Agenda, aimed at further enhancing the probity,
transparency, efficiency and modernization of Chile's public sector. With state modernization as
one of the central pillars, the transparency agenda will focus on enhancing management oversight
to ensure not only accountability--that is, an appropriate use of public funds--but also high
standards of public services. In addition, financial management would be increasingly
decentralized. Moreover, the expansion and strengthening of SIGFE is one of the Government's
key initiatives as discussed in the 2007 Budget law.2

    The project's objectives continue to be fully consistent with the Bank's overall strategy of
assistance to Chile, as it directly supported the CAS objectives of modernizing the State. Likewise,
the project's objectives are fully consistent with those of the new Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) endorsed by the Board in May 2007, contributing directly to the CAS objective of
supporting decentralization.3

preparation of the new CPS, the World Bank held a CPS preparation seminar with the Government on
October 27, 2006. It was agreed that the current strategy includes six broad areas of support in which the
Bank and Chile will seek to develop a program of assistance during the period of the new CAS: (i)
education and labor markets; (ii) innovation and business climate, (iii) infrastructure and public services,
(iv) social protection and health, (v); decentralization and regional development and (vi) agriculture and
environment.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The operation met its development objective, as it succeeded in improving the effectiveness,
efficiency, and transparency of the Chilean public administration, public expenditure management
in particular. It did so by effectively supporting key institutional reforms, successfully
implementing three of the project's four substantive components. Specifically, it supported the
implementation of a new integrated financial management system (Sistema de Información para
la Gestión Financiera del Estado - SIGFE) at the central level (e.g., Component 1). It also
succeeded in improving the capacity of the Ministry of Finance and line agencies to formulate,
execute and evaluate results-oriented budgets and in strengthening the government's capacity to
establish macroeconomic, fiscal and public investment policies and mechanisms to analyze
options and alternatives in a multi-annual context (e.g., Component 2). It furthermore provided
individual agencies with the needed support in terms of ICT equipment, capacity building and
technical support to guarantee the successful insertion of SIGFE and results-oriented evaluation
tools at the agency level (e.g., Component 4).

    However, the project fell short of implementing a human-resources and control management
information system in the CGR and line agencies (e.g., Component 3). While the development of
such a system (Sistema de Información y Control del Personal de la Administración del Estado ­
SIAPER) has been completed, it has not yet been deployed as originally envisioned. Human
resources administrators in five pilot agencies are being trained in the use of SIAPER, and it is
anticipated that these agencies will start using the system on a pilot basis starting the first semester
of 2008. Final data migration to SIAPER is in process and scheduled to be completed by the end
of 2008. The implementation of SIAPER will bring significant gains in effectiveness, efficiency,
and transparency to the administration of human resources in Chile's public sector. It will cover
approximately 185 government agencies and 35 municipalities, with an estimated 8,000 users.
SIAPER's consultation module would provide access to roughly 360,000 electronic personnel
files to the employee, his/her supervisors and those deciding on transfers and promotions. SIAPER
will also administer the electronic processing of approximately 600,000 personnel-related
processes per year. This will result in substantial reductions in paperwork and bureaucratic red
tape, as well as in enhanced transparency, as the system will identify those responsible for taking
action at every stage of the process, decision outcomes when applicable, delays, etc. Finally,
SIAPER will also provide managers, including those at the central agencies (DIPRES and CGR) a
comprehensive view of human resources within each agency, a critical input for improving human
resources management decisions.

    Despite the slow implementation of SIAPER in favor of ensuring the quality of the final
product, the operation has resulted in significant gains in effectiveness, efficiency and
transparency in the area of public expenditure management. These gains are reflected in the
overall achievement of PDO Indicators (see also Section F ­ Datasheet) and a more
comprehensive set of indicators (see Tables 1, 2 and 3):

    PDO1 - Internet-based reporting of budget execution disaggregated to the agency level
available to the public within one week of registry: Partially Achieved - Budget information
consolidated at the central government level is available to the public on DIPRES' website on a
monthly basis within 30 days after the end of the month. It is important to note, however, that




                                                 7

SIFGE offers DIPRES the capability to disaggregate information at the agency level and to report
it within one week of the closing of accounts.4
    PDO2 - Adjustments made to budgets from FY2004 onward based partly on strengthened
financial and performance indicators: Achieved - The operation has supported the continuous
development of DIPRES' robust results-oriented evaluation system. Agency performance is used
as an input in the allocation of budgetary resources. Reports on agency and program performance
are presented to Congress together with the proposed Budget Law on an annual basis.
    PDO3 - Information available in real time to policy makers by 2003: Partially Achieved -
Managers in the 159 (out of 190) central government agencies in which SIGFE has been deployed
have access to the agency's financial information online, on a real-time basis. No substantial
improvements have been achieved in the availability of human resources information.
    Other gains in the effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency in public expenditure
management resulting from the operation can be summarized as follows (see Annex 2 for a
detailed description of the project's outcomes):

Enhanced effectiveness of Chile's public administration5: Table 1 shows specific outcomes

Enhanced efficiency of Chile's public administration6: Although they have not been
systematically monitored, substantial efficiency gains in terms of human resources and monetary
costs are expected to result from the implementation of SIGFE. Some of these gains are shown in
Table 2.




6   Efficiency refers to the value assigned to the cost--time, human resources, monetary cost--associated
with producing a given output.         In this regard, project outcomes that reduce the operation cost of
government agencies and the cost of their programs are considered to enhance efficiency.

                                                864 man-hours per year. This estimate does not include
                                                the savings at SENAME's 46 UDAFs.

Enhanced transparency of Chile's public administration: The operation has resulted in
enhanced transparency in terms of reporting, adoption of international standards, and closer
scrutiny of the quality of public expenditures by Congress and the public as a result of DIPRES'
M&E systems. Some of the gains in transparency are summarized in Table 3:

                                                achievement levels in 2006.


3.3 Efficiency

No standard financial analysis was conducted at appraisal since the operation was a technical
assistance project. However, evidence from individual agencies suggests that the implementation
of SIGFE has resulted in substantial efficiency gains in terms of time, monetary and human
resources (see Section 3.2 - Achievement of Project Development Objectives). Moreover, the
costs associated with SIGFE's development, implementation and operation are estimated to be
substantially lower than those of comparable systems (see Annex 3). Additional non-quantifiable
benefits can also be expected in terms of transparency and increased investor and citizen
confidence in government budget projections and fiscal discipline.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

This operation has met its project development objective of improving the effectiveness,
efficiency, and transparency of the Chilean public administration. Specifically, the implementation
of SIGFE together with the strengthening of the expenditure analysis framework with emphasis on
multi-annual financial planning and budgeting by results has yielded significant benefits,
including enhanced fiscal transparency, robust institution strengthening, improved inter-agency
coordination, and enhanced financial planning. It has also contributed to strengthening Chile's
public expenditure management, thus consolidating the fiscal discipline that has been at the core
of the country's sound macroeconomic management. The operation's objectives remain highly
relevant for both the Government and the Bank. Project costs, which have been moderate, have
yielded substantial gains in efficiency, not only within DIPRES, but also the central government
as a whole. Although the project fell short of completing the implementation of the SIAPER
throughout Chile's public sector, the operation succeeded in developing a sound human-resources
management system that it is now being piloted in five agencies and will be fully deployed under
the follow-up operation. In view of its achievement of the PDO, its continuous relevance and its
overall efficiency, the operation is rated as Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The operation had an indirect impact on poverty alleviation by generating greater efficiency,
effectiveness, and accountability in the utilization of public resources. Since 1990, the four
consecutive Concertación presidential administrations have enhanced public sector management
to channel fiscal resources to finance social expenditures and targeted social programs, aimed at
balancing economic growth with equity.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
As described above, the operation's institutional impact was substantial. The more recent Reports
on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) of the International Monetary Fund provide
an assessment of Chile's overall fiscal transparency (IMF 2003, 2005). These reports reveal a high
level of fiscal transparency and document the rapid progress made in recent years to close
remaining gaps. In particular, the reports point to the Government's success in constructing and


                                                13

disseminating a very clear view of its objectives and targets, both at the macro level and for
individual budget programs. According to the IMF report, the budget clearly articulates
government priorities and there are well-developed tools for evaluating budget performance. In
addition, Chile has completed the first stage in adapting its fiscal statistics to the IMF's
Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM). As mentioned above, the authorities also
reformed the budgetary classification system and introduced a new functional classification of
expenditures in line with the GFSM. In addition, the report points to the importance of SIGFE in
facilitating public financial management, addressing data gaps (e.g., on arrears), as well as a
reconciling fiscal and monetary accounts (IMF 2003, 2005).

    By helping to further increase effectiveness, efficiency and transparency in public sector
management, the operation has contributed to further cementing the sound reputation of Chile's
public institutions. In turn, the soundness of Chile's institutions has been vital to instilling foreign
investor confidence, thereby ensuring a steady flow of foreign direct investment, as well as access
to international financial markets. A wide range of governance indicators rank Chile highest in
Latin America and better than some Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) countries. Specifically, Chile stands out as a highly competitive country, ranking 23 out
of 117 countries in the 2005 World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report, far ahead
of the rest of Latin America. Similarly, Chile holds the top Latin American ranking in the World
Bank's Doing Business in 2007. It ranks 28th out of 175 countries in terms of `ease of doing
business,' better than Spain and France. Out of 163 countries assessed by the corruption
perception index of Transparency International in 2006, Chile was ranked 20 out of out of 158
countries, together with Belgium and the United States. It is widely recognized that Chile's strong
public institutions have been key to the country's economic success.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

The process of implementing SIGFE has encouraged coordination between key government
agencies, particularly between DIPRES and CGR, as well as DIPRES and line agencies. Given
DIPRES' strong influence over Chile's public sector, its modernization efforts have `spilled over'
to other agencies. Aggregated information from SIGFE is increasingly being used to support not
only reporting requirements but also decision making by various government agencies, including
the Ministry of Finance, sector ministries such as the Ministry of Housing and Urban
Development, and other government agencies.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N.A.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

Overall, the sustainability of the achievements of the operation is deemed Moderate, due to
pending implementation of SIAPER. SIGFE is already firmly inserted within the central
government and its sustainability is assured. The Government is fully committed to its
consolidation and further expansion, which will be supported by the Bank under the SIGFE-II
operation that was recently approved. Similar continuity is expected for the further development
and consolidation of DIPRES M&E system. Under the SIGFE-II project, special emphasis will be
given to integrating the various management tools under the auspices of DIPRES, including its
budget administration system (Sistema de Administración de Presupuesto ­ SIAP), SIGFE and the
M&E system. Likewise, the Government is fully committed to the continuous improvement of
budget planning methodologies with an emphasis on multi-year planning. The forecasting of
future revenues, particularly those arising from copper and other export commodities, is crucial in


                                               14

the achievement of a structural fiscal surplus rule, to which the Government has committed since
2001.

    The sustainability of SIAPER, however, constitutes a notable exception. While the
Government has been commended for recent progress made, SIAPER's pending implementation
makes its sustainability more questionable. Strong political will from top CGR authorities and a
proactive and dynamic implementation team are needed for its successful deployment throughout
Chile's public sector. Presently, these two factors seem to be lacking. However, SIGFE's
successful implementation constitutes a sound foundation from which to draw a workable
implementation strategy and even experienced human resources.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

During preparation, the Bank team contributed its cross-country experience in Latin America,
providing access to international specialists with ample experience in public expenditure and
management. Project preparation, which was partly financed with a Project Preparation Facility
(PPF), went beyond regular project preparation activities to include the development of two
prototypes for SIGFE and SIAPER. This helped reduce uncertainty during project preparation and
gain useful insights for the task ahead. The Bank team correctly identified areas of intervention in
which the Government had already demonstrated its commitment and progress. It designed an
ambitious--albeit feasible project--capitalizing on the Borrower's strong sense of ownership and
sound technical and institutional capacity. As mentioned above, the project's quality at entry was
satisfactory in terms of the relevance of the operation, its overall design, the M&E framework, and
the overall risk assessment--except, perhaps, for overestimating the implementation capacity of
the CGR. A project launch workshop with participation from the PCU, DIPRES, the CGR, and
individual government agencies was organized by the PCU in December 2002 to reinforce
implementation and define monitoring responsibilities.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank mobilized a strong project team to support the design and implementation of this project.
The project is well documented, with Aide Memoires, Back-to-Office Reports (BTOs), Project
Status Reports (PSRs) and Implementation Status Results and Reports (ISRs) being filed regularly.
Throughout the life of the project, the Bank provided considerable technical assistance through the
project team and consultants in core substantive areas, including financial administration `experts'
with experience in, among others, the implementation of integrated financial management systems
in Argentina and Guatemala. This technical assistance was highly valued by the Borrower--even
more, perhaps, than the financial support provided under the loan in question. During the
supervision missions, the Bank team met with various SIGFE users, not only at the agency level
but in individual UDAFs located in remote areas of the country as well. This allowed for a more
accurate pulse-taking that incorporated multiple perspectives.

    Although the Bank closely monitored the design and implementation of SIAPER, it seems to
have overestimated CGN's capacity to effectively implement the system. When the seriousness of
the delays in the design of SIAPER by a private firm became obvious, the Bank immediately
requested that the SIAPER team review and agree on revised, more aggressive design and
implementation plans, aimed at ensuring the quality of final product. These plans were partially


                                               15

met. As mentioned above, the lack of a permanently designated Comptroller General for 18
months limited the Bank team's ability to seek the support of top CGR authorities. Even though
ISR reports and documents attached were indicating the delays, the supervision ratings did not
fully convey the challenges being faced in SIAPER's implementation.             With the benefit of
hindsight, it would have been useful to downgrade the component's performance to signal the
implementation delays.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank succeeded in capitalizing on the window of opportunity to further strengthen DIPRES,
which is one of Chile's most influential institutions. As a result, the project has had a substantial
impact on enhancing public resource management throughout the central government. The Bank's
contribution was substantial as it provided high-quality technical advice based on worldwide and
regional experience in financial and public resources management.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government played a key role during project preparation, exhibiting high ownership,
commitment, and a clear strategic vision. It effectively sought technical assistance from
international financial institutions and bi-lateral cooperation agencies (including the IMF and the
IADB) to support its ongoing efforts to improve public expenditure management. Political support
from top government authorities remained strong throughout the project, particularly within
DIPRES. This was a `condition sine qua non' for the successful deployment of SIGFE throughout
the central administration, which was made possible by political agreements between top agency
administrators and the influential Deputy Director of Budget. Unfortunately, comparable political
will and, more importantly, drive was lacking within the CGR. Now that a permanent Comptroller
General has been appointed, it would be crucial to gain his support for SIAPER.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

DIPRES was the project's executing agency and the institutional home of the PCU. The PCU
reported directly to the Deputy Director of Budget, who served as the National Coordinator
responsible for project implementation.        The PCU was responsible for technical support,
monitoring and evaluation, and financial management. It provided a crucial link between DIPRES,
CGR, and the Bank. The PCU comprised a very solid project management and technical team,
which brought sound expertise in key areas, such as financial management and ICTs, as well as
the inner workings of Chile's public sector. The PCU's key staff was highly stable during project
implementation, which was critical to ensuring continuity. Throughout the life of the project, the
PCU coordinated implementation efforts in the various areas, exhibiting a cooperative attitude--as
opposed to that of enforcer--not only vis-à-vis the various institutional actors within Chile but
also with the Bank. In summary, the PCU fully capitalized on the political support that it received
from DIPRES' top leadership and was a crucial factor in the project's success.

    The PCU was also directly responsible for SIGFE's development and implementation. The
SIGFE team exhibited a remarkable capacity to adapt to the needs arising at different stages of
project implementation. Specifically, it demonstrated focus during product development (2002-
2003), an impressive logistical capability during the deployment stage (2004-2005), and a
remarkable response capacity during the consolidation stage (2006-2007). Particularly noteworthy




                                                16

were the technical support and capacity building provided to government agencies to ensure the
successful implementation of SIGFE at the agency level.

    DIPRES' Evaluation Division, which was responsible for the further development of
expenditure management M&E systems, also exhibited a clear conceptual vision, strong technical
capacity, and a remarkable logistical ability to introduce its M&E tools within individual agencies.
This is not surprising since the project provided support to the division's longstanding efforts in
this area.

    The SIAPER team within the CGR had sound substantive knowledge of the processes
pertaining to human resource management in Chile. This knowledge is reflected in SIAPER,
which constitutes a valuable administrative tool. However, perhaps as a result of the inherent
nature of the CGR, the team was more inward looking than DIPRES and seemingly lacked the
dynamism and drive needed to meet the challenges of deploying SIAPER throughout Chile's
public sector.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory for the reasons outlined above. Had it not
been for the incomplete implementation of SIAPER, the rating for Borrower's performance would
deserve an unqualified Highly Satisfactory, as the performance of DIPRES and the PCU proved
outstanding.

6. Lessons Learned

Lessons of general application

    Leadership, clear strategic direction, and commitment are critical for success. DIPRES
has led the project from the beginning. Through the passage of the annual budget laws, the
project's recommendations have been incorporated. For example, the budget and accounting
indicators were simplified and improved in accordance with the IMF's GFSM international
standards to better integrate accounting information.
    Balanced project design and adequate team supervision are critical to achieve agreed
intermediate indicators and final goals. As the project's implementation progressed, it was
imperative to understand the country's particularities in order to adapt the fully integrated
financial management model, generally advocated by the Bank in Latin America and the
Caribbean, into a more custom-made model where full integration is not an end but a result of
institutional efforts. The aggregation of information is now understood as a result of the
coordination among agencies to achieve better results and effective use of scarce public sector
resources rather than an obligation of management control.
    Context matters. The project benefited from a very stable environment, and it has proven an
ideal context for institutional reforms. The SIGFE project was instrumental in supporting these
reforms process, avoiding any disruption and facilitating an orderly evolution process of
modernization.
    Governance can be strengthened and public efficiency is possible. Chile provides good
example for many nations. It has decided to take longer, but critical steps. By doing so,
transparency and governance indicators compared with international benchmarks have been stable
and even facilitated the increase of foreign investment and economic growth. The efficient
allocation of resources and timely reporting have promoted and benefited from efficiency gains.
    Technology facilitates internal communications and the simplification of bureaucratic
processes. Automatization of internal processes reduced red tape and facilitated the flow of



                                               17

information and the identification of bottlenecks. The decentralization process and transfer of
resources have been accelerated, while central authorities receive budget execution information in
real time.
    It is crucial to incorporate the user into the design and implementation process. A mature
information system is best conceived as a system with multiple actors, including those who
provide input data and those who use it. Participatory mechanisms such as workshops, focus
groups, user groups, and ongoing surveys can be helpful not only in incorporating the users'
perspective, but also as a `pulse-taking' mechanism.
    Training and technical support throughout SIGFE's implementation and beyond are
critical.  As in many other public sector projects, the process of reform was slower than
anticipated. A critical mass of officials at the managerial and operational level had to be trained in
the use and benefits of the new instruments. Such activities demanded more time, budget, and
effort than initially anticipated. The project was flexible enough to adapt to such needs, and
corrections were made in time to train more than 10,000 public officials.

Project-specific lessons
    Learn from pilots. The pilot implementation approach allowed the project to identify
problems, develop best practices, and generate economies of scale in the full implementation.
    Help is needed along the way. It was critical to provide timely and adequate support to users
during implementation. The Chilean model supported the development of reports, the facilitation
of the different training programs from basic computer use to specific techniques, such as
accounting or treasury, and the installation of a help desk able to solve urgent problems on the
spot to ease the implementation of the project.
    Coordination is key. The Central Agencies needed to coordinate both the messages and the
actions in order to avoid confusion among the other agencies and to maximize the impact on
government functioning.
    Be open and flexible. Finally, the importance of institutional tolerance to mistakes and the
open discussion of alternative solutions protected the project goals. In the case of SIGFE, instead
of insisting on following the original plan, the project redesigned the initially complex prototype
that was interfering with the dissemination process as soon as it was identified.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies (for full text in Spanish, see Annex 7)

In the Borrower's assessment, the Project achieved its main objective of enhancing the quality and
availability of financial information. Other significant outcomes resulting from the project include
a deeper understanding of financial management, the strong know-how developed in the areas of
project management and service management, as well as increased coordination between rector
agencies and the central government in general.

    The Borrower finds the ICR to achieve its intended purpose, providing a clear and detailed
overview of the project's implementation and its achievements. The Borrower, however, wants to
emphasize the effort on the part of the CGR team responsible for the development of the human
resources management system to overcome the difficulties encountered with the consultant firm
that was responsible for the development of SIAPER. Undoubtedly, the implementation of
SIAPER will be successfully completed under the follow-up operation.

    The Borrower wants to emphasize the high degree of complexity of the SIGFE Project,
resulting in large part from the challenge associated with transforming financial and accounting
practices that were deeply rooted within Chile's public sector. In this regard, the support and
personal commitment of the Bank's task manager, Mr. Roberto Panzardi, has been vital in



                                                18

ensuring that the implementation process, including procurement procedures, was not only sound
and transparent but also dynamic.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

CHILE'S FIRST PUBLIC EXPNDITURE MANAGEMENT TAL PROJECT OUTPUTS
1. Financial Management Modernization ­ Highly Satisfactory
Outputs Anticipated at Appraisal
New integrated financial system (SIGFE) implemented in five pilot
agencies by end 2002 (including core sub-systems of budget                         Achieved
formulation and execution, and accounting).
New integrated financial system (SIGFE) implemented in 25 agencies
by end 2003 (including core sub-systems plus cash management and                   Achieved
treasury).
New integrated financial system (SIGFE) implemented in 171
agencies by end 2005 (all sub-systems).
(*) Note: All 190 central government agencies integrate their financial           Achieved (*)

information into SIGFE--31 agencies, however, have maintained their
own ­homologated- financial administration systems.
All agencies with SIGFE system adhering to commitment control
system after 2003, leading to identification of `floating debt.'                   Achieved

All agencies with IFM system Finance and CGN reporting financial
transactions on line to the Ministry of Finance no later than 24 hours             Achieved
after accounting closing dates.
Description of Actual Outputs
This component supported a comprehensive effort to modernize and integrate the government's
financial management information system, focusing on the development and implementation of an
Integrated Financial Management Information System (SIGFE). This component also supported
the revision of the Borrower's business processes and norms in accounting, cash management and
procurement in order to maximize gains in efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency.
The conceptual framework of SIGFE was conceived as an integrated financial management
system comprising core sub-systems--i.e., budget, accounting, and treasury--to be developed
during the initial stage, and other sub-systems--i.e., public credit, public investment, procurement,
and public assets--to be developed subsequently. SIGFE is constituted by thee core modules of
SIGFE, including: a) the transaction module that records payments and receipts; b) the aggregation
module that consolidates financial information; and c) the configuration module that enables the
initial loading and subsequent changes of the national budget, the chart of accounts and other
institutional or sector classifications. While operationally decentralized, SIGFE operates under
normative centralization. DIPRES and CGR share responsibility for its administration. Since its
inception, SIGFE has substantially improved the availability and quality of information, thus
contributing to greater fiscal transparency in Chile.

2. Budget Reform to Create a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework - Satisfactory
Outputs Anticipated at Appraisal
New budget evaluation system implemented in all                            Achieved
agencies in year 2004.

Budget results implemented in at least 20 agencies,                        Achieved
explicitly linked with MOF in year 2003.
Improved multi-year financial scenarios presented to
Congress from 2004 onward, including alternative
macro-fiscal projections and estimations of future                         Achieved

budget costs of policy/program options.
Description of Actual Outputs
Medium-term expenditure framework: This component supported the strengthening of
DIPRES' capacity to focus on macroeconomic, fiscal, and public investment policies as a means
for deciding on the allocation of resources and the budget in a forward-looking multi-annual
context. Multi-year budget planning is now in place. A financial planning tool allows DIPRES to
forecast revenues and expenditure at the agency level using a ten-year time horizon. More robust
financial planning methodologies have been developed to implement the Structural Surplus
(Balance Estructural del Sector Público - BESP), for which the Government has committed itself
to achieving structural surplus equivalent to 1 percent of GDP since 2001. A panel of independent
experts was consulted to develop realistic projections of out-year resource inflows (e.g., long-term
price of copper). Alternative recurrent and capital expenditure scenarios are assessed in terms of
their impact on the structural balance. The targeted structural balance has been achieved every
year since it was adopted. From 2002 onward, DIPRES has presented to Congress a Public
Finances Report (Informe de la Finanzas Públicas), which explicitly links the Proposed Budget
Law to fiscal policy, the medium-term financial program with a multi-year projection of future
revenues and expenditures for three years beyond the year for which the budget is being proposed.
The submission of this report is now required by law (Law Nº 19.896, Sept. 2003).
Result-oriented budget and the further integration of Management, Control and Evaluation
(M&E) System into the budget cycle: Under this component, the operation also provided
support to DIPRES' highly regarded M&E system aimed at enhancing effectiveness and efficiency
in the management and control of public expenditures. The system encompasses management and
control as well as ex-post monitoring and evaluation. Chile is practically the only country in the
region, which has succeeded in developing a management and control system that fully
encompasses budget formulation, approval, execution, and monitoring and evaluation, along with
mechanisms to provide feedback throughout the budget cycle. Furthermore, the methodologies
and systems provide timely and reliable information, which, in turn, enable resources to be
allocated on the basis of policy priorities. Some of the tools are: (i) Strategic Definitions; (ii) the
Evaluation Program of Government Projects (PERG); (iii) Comprehensive Management Reports;
(iv) the Government Competitive Fund; and, (iv) Indicators and Performance Goals included in
the budget to enhance the quality of discussion about government programs among line agencies,
the Ministry of Finance and Congress. At DIPRES' request, a Bank team conducted an
independent evaluation of the M&E system and found it to be robust, comprehensive,
methodologically sound, systematic and objective.

3. Human Resources Management Information System - Moderately Unsatisfactory
Outputs Anticipated at Appraisal ­
CGO has piloted a new human resources information system
(e.g., SIAPER) in 5 agencies by June, 2003.                                   Achieved (*)
(*) Note: It was achieved in October 2007.
SIAPER established in at least 200 agencies by 2004.                         Not Achieved
Description of Actual Outputs
This component supported the design of an information system (i.e., SIAPER) for human resource
management and control covering personnel information of all public employees.                 The
development of SIAPER--has been completed, including its three modules:              (i) personnel
information; (ii) management of human resources processes; and iii) generation of reports. In a
pilot test, the human resource information now existing in the CGR has been successfully
migrated into SIAPER. However, delays in the design and development process have precluded
full deployment of the SIAPER in individual government agencies, as originally expected. The
implementation stage will be completed under the SIGFE-II follow-up operation.
     The implementation of SIAPER will bring significant gains in effectiveness, efficiency, and
transparency to the administration of human resources in Chile's public sector. It will cover
approximately 185 government agencies and 35 municipalities, with an estimated of 8,000 users.
SIAPER's consultation module would provide access to roughly 360,000 electronic personnel
files to the employee, his/her supervisors and those deciding on transfers and promotions. SIAPER
will also administer the electronic processing of approximately 600,000 personnel-related
processes per year. This will result in substantial reductions in paperwork and bureaucratic red
tape, as well as in enhanced transparency, as the system will identify those responsible for taking
action at every stage of the process, decision outcomes when applicable, delays, etc. Finally,
SIAPER will also provide managers, including those at the central agencies (DIPRES and CGR) a
comprehensive rendition of the human resources within each agency, a critical input for improving
allocation and management decisions.
4. Strengthening Financial and Human Resource Management - Moderately Satisfactory
Outputs Anticipated at Appraisal
Agencies successfully implementing SIGFE and SIAPER systems               Achieved for SIGFE
in line with above schedules.                                          Not Achieved for SIAPER
Description of Actual Outputs
The expansion of SIGFE since its inception in 2002 has been remarkable. Currently, SIGFE's
transaction module, which records budget and accounting data, commitments, and cash
transactions, is now operational in 349 out of the 391 agencies within the central government
(equivalent to 90 percent coverage within the central government). This includes the totality of the
health sector with 192 public hospitals. The remaining 31 agencies are still operating their own
financial administration systems; they feed standardized financial information to SIGFE on a
periodical basis, thus permitting the consolidation of financial accounts for the central
government. Overall, there are close to 7,000 registered users in 1,313 financial management units
(Unidades de Administración Financiera - UDAFs). They handle budget, accounting, and cash
management operations using the standardized norms, procedures, and information software
defined by SIGFE. The implementation of SIGFE has resulted in substantial capacity building
among central government agencies as a result of formal training to support the deployment
process, as well as `hands-on' experience resulting from the direct use of a modern management
tool.
   Unfortunately, SIAPER has not yet been implemented. Its implementation will be supported
under the SIGFE-II operation, which has been recently approved.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

No standard financial analysis was conducted at appraisal since the operation was a technical
assistance project. However, evidence from individual agencies suggests that the implementation
of SIGFE has resulted in substantial efficiency gains in terms of time, monetary and human
resources (see Section 3.2 - Achievement of Project Development Objectives). Moreover, the
costs associated with SIGFE's development, implementation and operation are estimated to be
substantially lower than those of comparable systems using local providers and world-class
solutions (see Table 3.1). Additional non-quantifiable benefits can also be expected in terms of
transparency and increased investor and citizen confidence in government budget projections and
fiscal discipline.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

La dirección del Proyecto SIGFE, concuerda en términos generales con la evaluación de los
resultados de este que hace el Banco a través del informe. Considerando que, al año 2002, los
objetivos del proyecto se enfocaban en mejorar la calidad y oportunidad de la información
financiera, se debe reconocer que en tal aspecto los logros del proyecto son muy relevantes.

También ha sido muy valiosa la experiencia acumulada en distintas dimensiones: conocimiento
del negocio, gestión de proyectos, gestión de servicios, coordinación de organismos rectores y
relacionamiento con las entidades del Gobierno Central. Todas ellas constituyen un valioso activo
para la nueva etapa que se inicia.

El presente informe de cierre del Proyecto no nos merece objeciones, por el contrario nos parece
un muy buen informe en el sentido que cumple cabalmente con su objetivo, al reflejar clara y
detalladamente el desarrollo del Proyecto considerando de manera adecuada los logros en sus
diferentes componentes.

Una observación que nos cabría efectuar, se refiere a la percepción del informe con respecto al
logro parcial del Sistema de Información de Recursos Humanos. Específicamente respecto de este
sistema, nos parece destacable el esfuerzo llevado a cabo por parte de la Contraloría General de la
República a pesar de las dificultades que ha debido enfrentar, derivadas en parte importante por
los obstáculos en su relación con la empresa consultora externa que tuvo a cargo el desarrollo del
sistema. No obstante ello, su estado de avance permite estimar el pronto término de la fase de
desarrollo e inicio de la implantación del sistema, por tales razones su continuidad ha sido
considerada en la próxima etapa de SIGFE.

Finalmente es preciso destacar la alta complejidad de este Proyecto, debido principalmente a la
necesidad de transformar estructuras y prácticas muy asentadas y enquistadas en el área financiero
­ contable del sector público de nuestro país. Para ello se requería de una actitud muy
comprehensiva respecto del desarrollo y la implementación del Proyecto. En tal contexto la
contraparte del Banco Mundial dirigida por el señor Roberto Panzardi ha sido una gran ayuda,
comprometiéndose fuertemente con el proyecto, facilitando el dinamismo necesario para llevar
adelante la tarea, convocando oportunamente a los expertos pertinentes que fueron requeridos, y
muy importante, facilitando los contactos y comunicaciones a través de la burocracia del Banco en
especial en el área de adquisiciones al confiar en la transparencia y probidad de nuestra
institucionalidad.
