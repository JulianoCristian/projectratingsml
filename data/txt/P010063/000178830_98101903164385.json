Its lending has concentrated\n            heavily on the export-oriented industries of textiles and\n            jute. IDBP has, moreover, made special efforts to assist in\n            East Pakistan, where 41 percent of the total amount of past\n            lending has been directed; IDBP hopes to increase this\n            percentage in its future operations. For the next phase of\n            Pakistan's industrialization, adequate facilities for\n            the financing of industrial investment will be very\n            important. Among the chief priorities for investment are the\n            expansion of the domestic jute processing industry, the\n            modernization of the textile industry and the encouragement\n            of certain engineering and chemical industries. IDBP should\n            continue to play a key role in financing these developments."}, "docdt": "1970-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
