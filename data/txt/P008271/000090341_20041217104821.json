The lessons learned indicate that\n            bottom up approaches were more successful that top down.\n            Technical assistance for institutional reform: greater\n            impacts could be derived by supporting achievement of\n            bench-marked targets within an agreed development program;\n            where institutional capacity is weak, supervision can be\n            effectively augmented through provision of a resident\n            adviser; involving local governments and stakeholders in\n            training and awareness programs is critical for successful\n            decentralization. Communal Forestry: there is significant\n            value in creating a repeatable methodology for working with\n            communities; small but significant steps toward transfer of\n            land ownership provided a strong incentive for local\n            participation, and helped build awareness and capacity for\n            land management. Protected Areas: it is important to build\n            awareness of the needs and opportunities for conservation;\n            operational plans, based on multi-stakeholder input, are key\n            to ensure effective protected area management. Project\n            Management: it is important to establish clear roles and\n            responsibilities for the Project Management Unit (PMU) and\n            the implementing agency; a strategy for carrying out PMU\n            functions following project closure is necessary to ensure sustainability."}, "docdt": "2004-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
