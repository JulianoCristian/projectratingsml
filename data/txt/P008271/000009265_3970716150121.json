Its purpose\n            is to improve decision making and to ensure that the project\n            components are environmentally sound and sustainable.  It is\n            a sector environmental assessment used for the design of\n            sector investment programs.  Where possible, it also\n            addresses the impacts and mitigations of specific project\n            components.  It was prepared to improve the Forestry Project\n            by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for\n            adverse impacts.  After a description of the Forestry\n            Project, the report discusses the laws, institutions, forest\n            management plans, road rehabilitation, forest thinning,\n            forest harvesting, communal forest and pasture management,\n            biodiversity, sustainable forestry, public participation in\n            forest management, and protected area network in Albania.\n            Finally, the last chapter presents the project's\n            alternatives analysis."}, "docdt": "1996-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
