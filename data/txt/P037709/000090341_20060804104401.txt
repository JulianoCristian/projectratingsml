About this Report
        The IndependentEvaluationGroup assessesthe programsand activitiesof theWorld Bank for two purposes:
 first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessand to verifythat the Bank's work is producingthe
 expected results,and second, to help develop improveddirections,policies,and proceduresthrough the
 disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As partof this work, IEGannuallyassesses about 25 percentof the
 Bank's lendingoperations. In selecting operationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento those that are innovative,
 large, or complex;those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or countryevaluations;thosefor which Executive
 Directorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments;and thosethat are likelyto generate importantlessons.
 The projects,topics, and analytical approachesselectedfor assessmentsupport largerevaluation studies.
       A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is basedon a review of the Implementation Completion
 Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department)and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
 PPARs, IEGstaff examine project files and other documents, interviewoperational staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing country for onsite discussions with projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to
 validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
 IEG studies.
        Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and IEG managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the
 PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank departmentand amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then
 sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
 Board of Executive Directors.After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG RatingSystem
       The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEG are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work. The
methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Followingis
the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the IEGwebsite:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
       Relevanceof Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,Modest, Negligible.
       Efficiency: The extent to which the projectachieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higherthan the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost comparedto alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustmentoperations.
       Sustainability: The resilienceto risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
       InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictabilityof institutional arrangements and/or (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organizationwith its mandate,which derives from these
institutionalarrangements. InstitutionalDevelopment Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectiveswere achieved, or are expectedto be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      BankPerformance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementationthrough appropriate supervision (includingensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regularoperation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
      BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrowerassumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparationand implementation,and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievementof developmentobjectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

as well as a reviewo f Bank files. An IEGmission was inHonduras inOctober-November 2005
and held interviews with a number o f stakeholders including ministers and former ministers of
FHIS, former FHIS staff, former ministers and staffofother ministries, representatives of donor
agencies and civil society organizations inHonduras, and subproject staff andbeneficiaries. The
cooperation and assistanceo f all stakeholders and government officials i s gratefully
acknowledged.

         Following standard IEGprocedures, a copy o f the draft PPAR was sent to government
officials and agencies for their review and comments. Borrower comments are included inAnnex

 Summary
 The Honduran Social Investment Fund(FHIS) was established in 1990 to mitigate the social
 effects o fthe stabilization and adjustmentprogram. It was meant to be a temporary mechanismto
 transfer resources to the poor who were most affectedby structural adjustment. However FHIS
 has come to stay andhas beenplaying an important role inthe financing o f small social
 infrastructure throughout the country. This PPAR assesses the Third and Fourthcredits to FHIS.
 The Third Credit for US$30 millionwas approved inJune 1995, andthe FourthCredit for US$45
 millioninJune 1998. The FourthCredit also had a supplement of US$22.5 million approved in
 December 1999 to help finance the reconstruction activities after hurricane Mitch hit the country
 inOctober 1998.

 The objectives o f the ThirdCredit were to assistthe government instrengtheningits poverty
 alleviation efforts and inmaintaining social cohesion, while it attempted to regain fiscal balance
 and the line ministries strengthenedtheir institutional capacities. The project was to also support
 the government's decentralization strategy, development o f the local contracting industry,the
 sustainability o f subprojects, and the targeting o f scarce resources to the poorer areas. The main
 objective o f the Fourth Credit was to increase access among the poor to small-scale social and
 economic infrastructure, inaccordance with local developmentpriorities andbasedon a proven
 approachfromprevious phases.

The IEGassessmentrates the outcome moderatelysatisfactoryfor bothprojects. The central
objective o f FHISo f supporting the government's poverty alleviation strategy was relevant and in
line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Country Assistance Strategy
 (CAS). FHIS has expanded access to basic education and health facilities, buthas achieved much
less success inincreasing access to water supply and sanitation. While the non-poor also
benefited from FHISactivities, there was an increase of access for the poor to basic
infrastructure. Interms o f poverty targeting it i s performing better than most state agencies. This
i s by no means a small achievement. Almost three-quarters o f households provedto have been
consulted on a FHISproject, but ina majority o f cases households would have preferred another
project than the selected one -includingsometimes projects beyond the FHIS menu. While FHIS
achieved highoperating speed, quantity has often been at the cost o f quality, and costs have not
been low. There i s evidence that FHISi s more expensive than NGOsand other agencies in
buildingwater and sanitation subprojects. FHISalso provedto bemore expensive inconstructing
schools when comparedto standards set by the Honduran Chamber o f Construction. Low internal
coordination inFHIS(especially duringthe FourthCredit) andthe fact that construction firms
and supervisors usually travel from Tegucigalpa to the areas o fproject execution are said to be
the mainreasons for the higher costs.

The assessmentrates overall sustainability as unlikely for bothcredits. Although most FHIS
projects are reported (inproject evaluations) to be inuse, the same evaluations also note that they
are often not used infull and there were many problems with the quality o f subprojects and with
their maintenance. On average, utilization, quality andmaintenance seem to have improved in the
non-emergency subprojects o f the Fourth Credit as comparedto subprojects o f the Third Credit.
Among other reasons, this was due to better provisionof staffing and other resources by the
ministryofHealth, and to a greater effortbyFHIS to trainuser committees. Butmost Fourth
Credit subprojects are infact emergency subprojects inwhich less attention was paidto issues
like securing community demand, design, quality and sustainability. Agreements betweenFHIS
and line ministries inHealthand Education were not completely effective. Inparticular,
ministries did not comply with their commitment to maintain facilities due to their general lack o f
resources for maintenance. This lack o f compliance by line agencies didnot change over time.

                                                   X



Overall, institutional development impact i s ratedas substantial.This i s the balance o f three
assessments: a neutral assessmento f having a separateinstitution for implementingsmall
infrastructureprojects: it worked positively, onbalance, for health and educationprojects butnot
for water and sanitation projects; a qualified positivejudgment o f the role FHIS played duringthe
emergency, and a positive assessmento f the effect that FHIShadon the decentralizationprocess
inthe country.


Overall Bankperformance was satisfactory with caveats. Bank staffwere overoptimistic about
thepossibilities of securingmaintenance, first by expectingtoo much from line ministries and
later by relying too heavily on user committees. The Bank was flexible inthe emergency period
allowing FHISto respondquickly to the reconstructionneeds, which was good, but this flexibility
appears to have beenmaintained for too long and it might have beenbetter to postpone approval
o f the FifthCredit untila returnto normalprocedures hadbeenguaranteed. Borrower
performance was also satisfactory with caveats. Ingeneral, FHISreceived the necessary
government resources and attention, but constructed facilities were sometimes underutilized due
to country-wide deficiencies insupplyingtextbooks andmedicines. The lack o fresources for
maintenance o f small basic infrastructure i s also a critical issue that needs to be addressed.

The experience o f the two projects offers three lessons:


     0   While social funds are attractive for donors and can initially be successful inproviding
        remote communities access to basic health andeducational facilities, the experience o f
        the Honduras social fund shows that they are not a long-term sustainable solution for
        providing basic infrastructure. The maintenance issue, especially o f health and education
        facilities, goes beyond social funds andneeds to be seriously addressed as a part o f the
        overall policy dialogue o f the World Bank with the country. Social funds may contribute
        by training o fuser committees, butthat initselfcan never be sufficient for securing
        maintenance.

     0  Because o f the apparent success inits core activity o f financing basic infrastructure
        projects, FHIS has been and continues to be attractive for donors for programs that do not
        belong to the core activity (example, the Basic Needs Programthat involved fundingfor
        priority social programs innutrition, childcare, training o f midwives, care for elderly and
        disabled, etc. and the Nuestras Raices Programwhich involved social assistance for
        indigenous communities). However, it took much longer for the Basic Needs Program
        and the NuestrasRaices Programto achieve some efficacy. Currently FHIShas become a
        patchwork o f donor-financed programs. Donors shouldbe cautious inchanneling money
        to social funds for carrying out non-core activities.

     0  FHIShadapositive institutional development impact inpromotingdecentralizationby
        helpingto strengthen local government capacities inproject planning and
        implementation. However, once these capacities are strengthened, it canbe questioned           '

        whether donors should still fund small infrastructure projects through FHIS insteado f
        searching for more direct channels to finance local governments.

 1. Introduction

 COUNTRY BACKGROUND

  1.1      Honduras is one o f the poorest countries inLatin America with a per capital income o f
 US$ 926 (World Development Indicators CD-Rom, 2005). According to the most recent poverty
 assessment, 50.7 percent o f the population is poor, andpoverty i s especially widespread in rural
 areas: 72.2 percent of ruralpopulation i s poor as against 27.6 percent o f the urbanpopulation.'
 Relative povertyhas come down from 52.6 percent in 1998/99 to 50.7 percent in2004. Giventhe
 highpopulation growthrates, however, absolute poverty has increased.

 1.2       Since 1990, Honduras has carried out stabilization and adjustment programs
 recommendedby the IMF and the World Bank. Price subsidies have been cut, import tariffs have
 come down, the financial sector has been liberalized, andbanks andpublic utilitycompanies have
 beenprivatized. But stabilizationi s still delicate since fiscal discipline i s usually lost during
 election years,2 and donor-financed programs for institutional reforms like the public sector
 modernization program, civil service reforms, and anti-corruption measures have had limited
 success. Honduras i s one o f the more corrupt countries inthe region: it was ranked 20 out o f 28
 on the regional (North and South America) corruptionperceptionindex o f Transparency
 Internati~nal.~  Interest groups are strong and able to capture state institutions; the strongest i s
 probably the teachers union, which holds the Ministry o f Education ina firmgrip.

 1.3       Despite large amounts o f aid, especially since the early 1990s with another upswingafter
 hurricane Mitch, economic growthhas been low - growth per capita over the years beingmore or
 less at the level o fpopulation growth (Figure 1). Growth has been mainly fuelled by investment
 (Cuesta and del Cid 2003) whichinturn has been driven by the expansion o f assembly industries
 inexportprocessingfree zones, public investment (due to aid), andremittances(leading to
residential investment). The main "cause" for the relative decrease inpoverty between 1999 and
20044i s said to be rural-urban migration (Demombynes 2005). Poverty i s still highestinrural
areas, and there has not beenmuch improvement inrural incomes. Another factor behind the
registered decrease inpoverty i s probably the large and rapidly increasing volume o fremittances,
from US$ 328 millionin 1999 to US$ 867 millionin2003 (World Development Indicators 2005).

 1.4      By comparing Honduraswith other LatinAmerican countries, there appear to be two
reasons for the country's low economic growthper capita inthe last three decades: low labor and
capital productivity (Juan-Ramon 1999). With respect to the first, secondary school enrolment i s
very low inHonduras and duringthe 1990s the percentage o fpersons withpartial or finished
primary school education decreased. With respect to the second, investments increasingly are in

'These   figures are from the first National Living Standards Survey carried out inthe second halfo f 2004.
The poverty line is defined as the extreme poverty line only including the cost o f food to provide 2200
calories per day plus an allowance for non-food consumption that i s computed on the basis o fthe average
non-food share o f consumption for households close to the extreme poverty line. Per person and per month
the poverty line was at 996 Lempiras, see Demombynes (2005: 4-5).
  National and municipal elections are held every four years and lead to a major disruption ingovernance:
first due to the campaigning period which takes more than a year, and thendue to the change in
government which implies a complete overhaul o f a majority o fpersonnel at all levels.
  See www.transparency.org/news~room/in~focus/200~1cpi~2005
  The I99811999 National Survey o fIncome and Expenditure has produced household consumption data
that are comparable with the 2004 Survey referred to above, see Demombynes (2005: 9).

the form ofconstruction as against machinery andequipment, andwithinconstruction
increasingly inresidential construction. Bothdevelopments (decrease inlevel o f human capital
and increased residential construction) can probably be explained by the emigration o f
Hondurans, mainly to the United States. The better educated leave the country, and the
remittances sent back to their families are used for survival and for construction o f houses.

OVERVIEW OFFHIS 1990-1995

1.5      The Honduran Social Investment Fund(FHIS)was established in 1990 to mitigate the
social effects o f the stabilization and adjustment program. It was meant to be a temporary
mechanism to transfer resources to the poor who were most affectedby structural adjustment.
However, FHIShas come to stay, and has beenplaying an important role inthe financing o f
small social infrastructure subprojects throughout the country.

1.6      FHIS's main activity has beento fund small subprojects insocial and economic
infrastructure that would satisfy the basic needs o f the poor, while at the same time creating
employment and income. FHIS has been effective inquickly disbursingmoney for these small
infrastructure subprojects, based on proposalsby NGOs, municipalities or sometimes directly by
communities. After appraisal and approval by FHIS, a construction company was contracted and
oversaw the subproject. FHISwas granted some exemptions from applicable country rules to
enhance its efficiency and effica~y.~These includedthe possibility o fpayinghigher salaries to its
staff than other state agencies, exemptions from national rules on contracting and on the required
hiringofprofessional engineers for its subprojects. The higher salaries, especially duringthe
1 9 9 0 allowed FHISto attract professional staff o frelatively good quality, often with work
        ~ ~
experience inthe private sector or with donor agencies.

1.7      FHIS has also been successful inattracting donor money. The first Bank credit o f $20
millionto FHISwas approved in 1990. Total financing for FHIS for 1990-1993 was then
expected to be $68 million, includingan $8 milliongovernment contribution and a $7 million
contribution from project beneficiaries. Inreality, total FHIS turnover inthis period amounted to
$98.4 million(OED 1994). A second Bank credit, o f $10.2 million, was approved in 1992, and



 The Region inits comments notes that nationalrules were often arcane and unfair, and Bank rules always
applied.
 ByNovember 2005, FHISwas no longer allowed to pay higher salaries to its staff as compared to other
ministries.

                                                   3


 some $50 millionwas raisedby other donors, o f which the Inter-American Development Bank
 and the GermanKfW were the largest.

 1.8     Duringthis earlyperiod, FHIS was successful inbuildinginfrastructure andalso in
 creating employment. However, other components of the programwere less successful. The First
 Credit was also to finance a pilot targeted nutritionassistanceprogram, provide technical
 assistanceto improve efficiency and equity o f the Ministries o f Healthand Education, and
 establish a monitoring and evaluation system. Very little attention was paidbyFHISto the
 technical assistance and monitoringand evaluation components (OED 1994). By the end o fthe
 period, it also became clear that there were problems with maintenance o f completed subprojects
 (the core activity), and sometimes also with their operation.

 1.9     After September 1993 and untilwell into             Box 1:Correspondence BetweenBank
 1994, FHISexperienced a slow-down inoperations              Projects and F H I S Phases
 due to the elections and uncertainty about its future.
 The new government in 1994 first extended FHISfor           F H I S 1 (1990-1994) Bank Credit IandI1
 four years, and then made it more permanent by
givingit a 12year extensionuntil2007. InJune 1995            F H I S 2 (1995-1998) Bank Credit I11
the Bankapproved its ThirdCredit ofUS$30 million
to FHIS.The government calls the periodo f the             1 F H I S 3 (1998-2002) Bank Credit IV and V
ThirdIDA Credit "FHIS 2", to distinguishit from
"FHIS 1" o f the former (1990-1994) administration. InJune 1998, the Bank approved a fourth
credit o f US$45 millionto FHIS, well before the ThirdCredit was closed. Just before the Fourth
Credit became effective, Honduras was hit by hurricane Mitch inOctoberhIovember 1998. A
 Supplemental Credit o f US$22.5 millionwas approvedby IDA inDecember 1999 to provide
additional financing for reconstruction needs. A FifthSocial Investment FundCredit o f US$60
millionwas approved inNovember 2000. The Fourthand Fifthcredits together financed what the
government calls "FHIS 3".

2. Project Objectives,Designand Implementation

PROJECTOBJECTIVESAND DESIGN

2.1      The objectives o fthe ThirdCreditwere "to assist government instrengtheningits poverty
alleviation efforts and inmaintaining social cohesion, while the government attempts to regain
fiscal balance and the line ministries strengthen their institutional capacities. It would also support
the government decentralization strategy, development o f the local contracting industry, the
sustainability o f subprojects, andthe targeting o f scarce resources to the poorer areas" (World
Bank 1995).

2.2      The objectives o f the FourthCredit were to "continue IDA'Ssupport for the successful
FHISprogram, aimingto increase access amongthe poor to small-scale social andeconomic
infiastructure inaccordance with local developmentpriorities, to develop social assistance
programs for disadvantaged groups, and to contribute to the prospects for sustainability o f such
programs." (World Bank, 1998). The Supplementary Credit o f December 3, 1999hadthe same
objectives as the FourthCredit. It was estimated that post-Mitchreconstructionneeds requiredan
additional US$75 million. The Supplementary Credit of US$22.5 millionwas to finance 30
percent o f that with the highestpriority. The remainder would be left to the FifthCredit or to
other external sources.

2.3      The Third Credit had six components (see Table 1for planned and actual costs):

                                                      4


           Financing o f subprojects insocial and economic infrastructure.
           Basic needs program: funding for priority social programs innutrition, childcare, training
           o f midwives and other health workers, care for elderly and disabled, school and health
           center furniture and teaching materials.
           Institutional strengthening o f FHISthrough technical assistance aimed at improving its
           internal functioning (monitoring and information system, auditing, management o f
            subproject cycle) and inimproving specific tasks, such as water and sanitation projects,
            and the basic needs program.

2.4        The FourthCredit had four components (see Table 2 for planned and actual costs):

      0    The largest component was the financing o f subprojects insmall social and economic
           infrastructureand special programs for social assistance to disadvantaged groups. Within
           the latter, there was a program o f social assistance ingeneral, and one for indigenous
           communities: "Nuestras rakes."
           A pilot program for local institutional strengthening, includingparticipatory local
           planning, preventive maintenance, and transfer o f some functions andresponsibilities for
           subprojectprocessingto municipalities.
     0     A pilot to strengthen community andrural water systems.
           Project management.

2.5        The share o fthe main infrastructure component intotal actual expenditure was lower
than planned at appraisal inthe ThirdCredit (Table 1). Project management and institutional
strengtheningtook a much larger share than planned. However, these figures include the full year
1999 which means that the higher management costs (inparticular administration and vehicles &
equipment) may be partly due to the response to hurricane Mitch. As Table 2 shows, duringthe
period of the FourthCredit the share o f actual spending on infrastructurewas much higherthan

                                                     5


 envisaged at appraisal stage. This additional financing was achieved at the cost o f the pilots and
 also partially at the cost o f the implementation of the special programs. The Fourth Credit was
 plannedto be o f about the same magnitude as the ThirdCredit, but after hurricane Mitch the total
 amount became larger mainly as a result of the Supplementary Credit from the Bank, which also
 impliedlarger local government contributions.
 2.6       The objectives oftargeting the poor (ThirdCredit) andimproved access o fthe poor
 (Fourth Credit) were expected to be met within the main component o f FHISby the use of a
 poverty map that determined allocation ceilings for departments and municipalities. Inaddition,
 the FHISproject menu(Thirdand Fourthcredits) and the low salaries paidinthe subprojects to
 the construction workers (only mentioned inthe appraisal report for the Third Credit) were meant
 to leadto a kindo f self-targeting. Inthe design o f the ThirdCredit, FHISwas expected to
 undertake special efforts to increase project proposals from the poorest communities, while the
 FourthCredit mentions the promotiono f and assistanceto participatory local planningas an
 instrument for better targeting o f investments.

2.7        The objective o f supportingthe government's decentralization strategy does not seemto
be reflected inthe design o f the components o f the ThirdCredit, other than promoting requests
for subprojects from communities and municipalities. Although support to decentralization was
not a formal objective o f the Fourth Credit, muchmore attention was given to it inthe design o f
the project whichrecognizedthe importance of strengthening capacities ofmunicipalities for
operation and maintenance (O&M) of subprojects and for localparticipatory planning, and
included a pilot program for local institutional strengthening.

2.8       To improve prospects for sustainability o f subprojects (an objective inboth the Thirdand
Fourthcredits), the Third Credit included three types o f actions: improved coordination between
line ministries andmunicipalities;' expandingthe involvement o f beneficiaries insubproject
'Theministers    ofHealthandEducationwere to be includedinFHIS' Board of Directors, andnew inter-
institutional agreementswith these agencies were to be concluded. There were also to be agreements
betweenFHIS andthe 293 municipalities,inwhich responsibilitiesfor maintenance of educationandhealth
facilities were to be defmed.

O&M through more extensive training; technical assistancefor improved training. However, the
design o f the FourthCredit included more concrete actions to be taken for this objective. The
design emphasizedthe need for clearly definedresponsibilities for central and local governments,
NGOs, and FHIS, along with maintaining coordinationwith line agencies; more systematic
participation o fbeneficiaries as well as their systematic training and improved local government'
capacities to ensure O&M o f investments.


IMPLEMENTATION

Before Mitch

2.9      When compared with the first and second credits, temporary employment creationwas no
longer an objective inthe Third Credit.However, the wording o f the objectives still reflected a
short termperspective o f FHIS, since FHISwas considered necessary as long as government was
struggling"to regain fiscal balance" and as longas "line ministries are (were) strengthening
capacities". During implementation o f the project, it was recognizedthat the existence of FHIS
had little to do with fiscal balance or strengthenedcapacities o f line ministries. FHIS was
collaborating already muchmore with municipal authorities, promotingdecisionmaking on
public sector investment at the municipal level (World Bank 1997). The Implementation
Completion Report stated (p.2): "A few years after appraisal (it was) ... no longer (considered)
appropriate that FHISwould only exercise its roles as long as governmentsregain fiscal balance
and line ministries strengthentheir institutional capacity." FHIS "had taken over the project-
implementing functions o f line ministries and hadbegun to look at a new focal point o f
institutional strengtheningand development partnership: municipalities and community
organizations" (World Bank 2000).
2.10     During1995-1998, FHISoperated at top speed, disbursingUS$96.3 millioninsmall-
scale infrastructure subprojects and another US$11.7 millioninother small activities. The same
liberal party won the national elections inNovember 1997, and as the continuation o f FHISwas
already secure (para 1.9), operations were hardly interrupted with the change ingovernment. In
June 1998, the FourthCredit to FHIS was approvedbutjust before it became effective, Honduras
was hitby hurricane Mitch inOctoberiNovember 1998. By December 1999,95 percent o f the
Fourth Credit hadbeen disbursed. However needs remained large and the Bank approved the
Supplement Credit.

2.11     Technical assistance was mainly provided during 1996 and 1997. Fourteenconsultancies
were planned, o f which eight hadalready been finished by April 1997.8FHIS staffmembers also
went on study trips and conferences abroad to learn from the experiences o f other Social Funds.
Resultsincludedthe creation o fapre-investmentunitand a contracting department, as well as a
Management Information System with 48 performance indicators that monitored performance on
a weekly basis. An important contributing factor inthis strengtheningwas the fact that the three
main financing agencies, the IDB,the Bank and KfW,allowedFHIS to work with the same
subproject cycle. Duringthe Third Credit, FHIS could apply direct contracting for amounts up to
US$35,000, and private bidding(three quotes) for amounts up to US$50,000. Public biddingwas
required for amounts above US$50,000. FHIS useda detailed price system to control costs for the
direct contracting.

2.12     Dueto arestructuringof the Ministryofthe Environment, the implementation ofthe
"environmental assistanceprogram" was delayed. In 1997 a new arrangement was signed so that

'Ayuda  temario Misiondel IDBBM 17-19 april 1996.

                                                       7


 FHIScouldbegincarryingout the small subprojects andthe assistanceto municipalities (World
 Bank 2000). Inpractice, FHISprovided technical assistanceto a few municipalities and some 50
 innovative environmental subprojects were implemented. Inaddition, the "environmental
 improvement program" which was a programwithin FHISitself, ledto the carrying out o f eleven
 small-scale projects andto an improved environmental assessmentmechanismwithin FHIS.

 2.13      The component on social data collection and analysis was carried out together with
 SECPLAN, the Ministryo f Planning. This component included support for combining an
 inventory o f existing social infrastructure at below municipal level with population data, so that
 line ministries andFHIS are better able to make their investment plans (World Bank 1995). It led
 to a sophisticated social data mapping system (World Bank 2000). However, according to the
 completion report, the future o f that systemi s uncertain since SECPLAN disappeared a few years
 later inthe context o f the IDA-supported 1996Public Sector ModernizationProject (World Bank
 2000).~
 2.14     The Basic Needs Programwas meant to provide support to vulnerable groups such as
 orphans, small children inprecariouspositions, pregnant andnursingmothers, ethnic minorities,
 disabled, and elderly. Before 1995, 1432 subprojects hadbeen financed and all of them were
 executed by NGOs.However, infinancial terms the most important component o f the program
 hadbeenthe supply o f school desks. With the approval o f the ThirdCredit, it was agreed between
 government and donors that (among other things) the program would focus on highpriority needs
 o f a nationalnature, that there would be more attention for needs o f indigenous groups, and that
 the supply o f school and health center furniture would be transferredto the infrastructure
 component o f FHIS.Technical assistancewas provided for that purpose (World Bank 1995).

 After Mitch

 2.15     Whenhurricane Mitchhitthe country inOctober-November 1998, FHIS beganto carry
 out cleaning andreconstruction activities. FHISquickly set up nine temporary regional offices
with executive authority to implement projects. This was done inclose cooperation with
municipalities. Withina year, FHIShad financed 3,400 emergency subprojects (World Bank
2000). With Bank approval, the components directed to pilot decentralization and to strengthen
rural water systems were put on hold. Inagreement with its main financing agencies, FHISalso
simplified its subproject cycle (eight steps instead o f fifty) and was allowed to apply direct
contracting for all emergency subprojects (World Bank 2003). Also inagreement with the Bank,
environmental assessments were no longer applied (World Bank 2003). The flexibility with
which all these changes were made enabled a quick response to the crisis situation."

2.16      However, duringthe emergency period, internal management and control weakened. The
regional offices sent their information to headquarters but it was no longer standardized andnot
tilways complete. Headquarters hadto process the informationmanually and couldnot keep up.
As aresult, the sophisticated management informationsystem (MIS)with its 48 indicators that
hadbeen developed during 1995-1998, broke down.

2.17      While the simplification ofprocedures and weakened internal control mechanisms could
bejustified duringthe emergency phase, the delay inreturn to normalprocedures was a serious

issue. In2000 and 2001, FHISwas still operatingwith the short subproject cycle although the
emergency phase was over (World Bank 2003). MIS quality has not achieved its previous level."

2.18      Supervision missions by financing agencies do not appear to have hadmuchinfluence. In
July 1999,the World Bank, IDBandKfWrequested areturnto normalprocedures. ForIDBand
KfW,the localparticipation inthe planningofsubprojects andthereturnto a formal selection
mechanism o f municipalities was a condition for new financing. The World Bank, on the other
hand, was still willing to finance emergency subprojects with special procedures, butwished to
isolate them from regular procedures.

2.19     A concern on "dragging o f emergency procedures" was repeated duringthe supervision
mission inMarch 2000. The mission also found that FHISwas still operating on a first-come
first-served basis, thusjeopardizing transparency (Box 2). There had also beentwo changes in
ministers o f FHIS within eight months, and the accompanyinghighturnover inkey staff brought
about ``... reduced operational efficiency, loss of staff morale, and complaints from various
sectors regardinga growing lack o f transparency." These changes almost wiped out the
institutional memory o f FHIS.Hardly anybody knew about FHIS operational procedures o f
before the emergency period. A conclusion o f the mission was that FHISurgently hadto "re-
establish orderly procedures, make a new Operations manual andrestore the MIS." Itwas also
recommendedthat the approval o f the FifthCredit bepostponedpendingthese improvements. In
practice, anew Operations Manual was put as a condition o f effectiveness and this ledto a short
delay. But the FifthCredit was approved inNovember 2000, while the MIShadnot been
restored. It i s questionable whether this early approval was appropriate.l2

2.20     A November 2001supervision mission still found serious deficiencies inoperational
procedures o fFHIS. Fromthe interviews held, the same picture emerges. Although a new
subproject cycle was established, it was not as good as before the emergency. The FHIS minister
2000-2002 confirms that hisprimary goal was to raise the quantity o f financed subprojects. When
he started inMarch 2000, mayors all over the country were complaining about the slow response
o f FHISto their needs, and his primary goal was to satisfy this demand. The ICR o f the Fourth
Credit reads (p. 27) that after the emergency phase, FHIS struggled with problems such as a
"large pipeline o f unfinished projects". It also concludes that "subproject quality was uneven and
FHIS's institutional capacity continuedto beweak."




l1The Regioncommented that "while we agree that the MIS is no longer the state-of-the-art model it was
prior to Hurricane Mitch, it i s still one o f the more sophisticated systems inthe country."

 Box 2: Ad-hoc decision makingduringthe FourthCredit

 The mission's visit to a 2001 school project (of the Fourth Credit) confirmed that decision making was
 not always according to formal procedures. Two teachers told the missionthat they met the minister o f
 FHIS duringthe inauguration o f another school intheir city, inAugust 2000. They convinced himto visit
 them and to have a look at the garage and the other small building(donation o f German embassy) in
 which they were then teaching a total o f 60 pupils from fast growing urban and rural neighborhoods.
 Three months later construction began and another three months later, February 2001, they could
 inaugurate three new classrooms. InAugust 2001, they were again visitedby FHIS engineers who told
 themthat they came to prepare a project for three classrooms. When the engineers saw that the
 classrooms hadbeenbuilt already, they wanted to leave. But the teachers told themnot to go away, since
 theybadly neededthree more classrooms for their growing school. So it happened. The school now has
 six classrooms for almost 200 pupils. It doesn't use the garage anymore, and the "German embassy
 building" is used as a schoolkitchenand storage facility. However, teaching only takes place inthe
 morning from 7.30 to 12.30 hrs. Inthe afternoon, the buildings are only partially used: some children
 stav at school inthe afternoon to do their homework, since there are not enough textbooks.

 2.21      The lack o f orderly procedures incontracting, supervision and control also contributed to
 difficulties inthe closure o f the FourthCredit. When it came to accounting for the use o f the
 disbursed money, some subprojects were found to have been abandoned, inother cases
 subprojects were there butthe documentationwas missing, and sometimes there were legal
 disputes about the subprojects. The November 2001 elections brought a change ingovernment. In
 early 2002, a new FHIS minister was again appointed and this ledto new staff, which increased
the difficulty o fclosing old subprojects. According to the newminister, the new stafffound 5000
unfinished subprojects andthese hadto be solvedbefore new financing couldbe attracted. The
 original closing date o fthe FourthCredit was 28 February 2002, which was advanced inthe
 Supplementary Credit to 31 December 2001.13Butthenthere were three extensions: first to 30
June, then to 30 September 2002, and finally to 31January 2003. Similar problems were
experienced by IDBand KfW inthe closure o f their credits.
2.22       Inthisperiodtherewere also someproblemswiththeannualexternalauditreports
requested by the World Bank. In 1999, the auditors qualified their opinion on the financial
statements o f FHISdue to several missingfigures and statements, and due to inconsistencies
between project management reports and accountingrecords.l4The Bank financial management
specialists consideredthe auditingreport over 1999 to be "unacceptable" as evidencedby an
internal Office Memorandum o f 16 June 2000.15Accordingto Bank staff, a satisfactory solution
was eventually found.
2.23       Inapublic sector auditingprogramfinanced byseveral donorsthat aimedto improve
efficiency and transparency o f government agencies,16 FHISprovedto be the state agency with


l3No reasonis mentioned inproject documents for this advance. Probably it was inducedby the fact that
disbursementwas muchhigherthan originally foreseen.

l4This occurredbothina report on statements up to 31 July, and inareport over the full year 1999.Inthe
latter, the auditors also report on other weaknesses inFHIS, such as lack o f documentation and insufficient
supervision and inspection on some o f the works.

l5After the first auditing report on statements up to 31 July 1999, the Bank auditors had made specific
recommendations and requested additional information, but they note inJune 2000 that very little hadbeen
done with their findings and recommendations inthe next report o f the same auditing firm.

 the largest number o f "findings", i.e., irregularities. These range from incomplete documentation
 on a subproject, for example a missingaddress o f a contractor, to the lack o f proofthat the work
 had actually been delivered. The most serious irregularitieswere found on older subprojects, i.e.
 those before 2002 (inthe Fourthand Fifth credit^).'^ Bilateral donors and civil society
 representatives who participate inthe Steering Group expressed concern about the lack o f
 attention from state agencies ingeneral and FHIS inparticular to this program. FHIS
 representatives note that incarrying out about 3000 subprojects a year (much more than other
 state agencies) it i s not unusualthat some irregularities are found, especially since FHIS deals
 with so many different programs from differentfinancing agencies with their specific contracting
 andreporting requirements. Yet, FHISi s working on the implementation o f the recommendations
 o f the study.

 3. Analysis

 RELEVANCE

 3.1      Overall, relevance i s rated substantial for boththe projects. The central objective o f
 FHISo f supporting the government's poverty alleviation strategy is highlyrelevant giventhe
highpoverty incidence inthe country andis also inlinewiththe country assistance strategy
 (CAS). The components o fFHIS are inline with the core program areas of the Honduran Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), notably, reducingboth urban and ruralpoverty, investingin
human capital and social protection. The most recent CAS (2003) is based on this PRSP.

3.2       The objective o f supporting the government's decentralization strategy i s relevant if
assessed against the decentralization efforts o f the Maduro administration (2002-2006), but much
less so duringthe time o f earlier governments. Inthose periods, decentralization was largely
donor-driven and was a policy onpaper. Inthe design o f the Third Credit, support for
decentralization was primarily through stimulating requests for subprojects from municipalities
and communities. Inthe design o f the FourthCredit, muchmore attention is given to
strengtheningmunicipal capacities for subproject selection, implementation and O&M.

3.3       The objective o fpromoting sustainability (both Thirdand Fourthcredits) clearly reflects
the problems with O&M that had emerged duringthe earlier phases o f FHIS, and i s therefore
highlyrelevant. However, measuresto enhancethe sustainability o f subprojects were defined
more concretely inthe design o f the FourthCredit than inthe ThirdCredit.

3.4       Finally, it i s unclear from the objective o fpromotingthe "local contracting industry" in
the Third Credit whether "local" i s meant to be Honduran or municipal. No references are made
to it ineither the project design or inthe implementation completion report.

EFFICACY

3.5      Onbalance efficacy i s rated substantialfor the ThirdandFourthcredits.'* This section
primarily focuses on the primary objectives o f improving access o f the poor to small scale social

commissioned to a private firm, Price Waterhouse Coopers. Another agency, SWIPCO, orders the findings
and advises the state agencies examined on how to improve their procedures so as to avoid future problems.

l7For example, a contract was given to an NGOthat didnot exist, or a private biddingincluded three fm
(as required) but they all proved to be from the same family.
'*The  objectives o f decentralization and sustainability are left to the sections on institutional development
and sustainability.

                                                        11


 infrastructure, targeting andpoverty alleviation. The contribution o f boththe projects to
promotingdecentralization and sustainability are largely covered inthe sections on Institutional
 Development Impact and Sustainability respectively.


 Access
 3.6     FHIShas expanded access to basic education andhealth facilities, buthas achieved much
 less inwater and sanitation. Ithas been slightly progressive inits allocation. Although this means
 that non-poor also benefitedfrom FHIS, increase of access for the poor to infrastructure is by no
 means a small achievement. The Basic Needs programcontinuedto lack focus and direction
 duringthe ThirdandFourthcredits, buttheNuestrasRakes programachievedits objective o f
 improving incomes o f the poor and improving social cohesion by strengtheningethnic
 organizations. l9

 3.7     The assessmentrelies heavily ontwo impact evaluations that were carried out byESA
 Consultores.20Inaddition, reference i s made to visits by the assessmentmission to randomly
 selected subprojects o f the Third and Fourthcredits. FHIS made a large contribution to the
 increase inprimary schools and innumber o f class rooms inHondurasbetween 1995 and 1998:
 58 percent and 61 percent, respectively (Walker et al. 1999), and these figures probably
underestimate the real contribution.21Between 1998 and 2002, the number o f class rooms
increased again which was remarkable since many class rooms hadbeen destroyedby hurricane
Mitch. FHIS 3 (Fourth and Fifthcredits) built 40 percent o f the new schools and 29 percent o f the
new class rooms, and its contribution to the number o f improved or repaired schools was 24
percent (ESA Consultores 2005). Access o f households to primary education improved slightly
between 1993 and 1997, from 93 percent to 94 percent. The number o f pupilsper class room
decreased from 45 in 1995 to 37 in 1998, to 33 in2002. This i s expected to have increased the
quality o f primary education. Under bothcredits, most FHIS resources have been used for the
buildingofschools (Table 3).
3.8      Inhealth, between 1995 and 1998,FHISbuilt72percentofthe newruralhealthcenters
and 56 percent o f the new urbanhealth centers. Between 1998 and 2002, the relative contribution
o f FHISwas even greater with FHISbuilding81percent of the newrural centers and 97 percent
o f the new urban centers.




l9 See 3.24,3.25 and Box 3 for further analysis o fthese programs.

2oBoth evaluations were commissioned by the Bank. The first was carried out in 1998, is referred to here as
Walker et al. 1999 and covered the period o fthe Third Credit, 1995-1998. The second evaluation was
carried out in2002, covered the period 1998-2002 (FHIS 3), and included projects financed with the Fourth
and Fifth Credits. Inthis last evaluation, a separate assessmentwas made o f emergency projects, which will
be dealt withseparately inthis report. This second evaluation is referred to here as ESA Consultores 2005.
The results ofFHIS 2 will generally be compared withthose o fFHIS 3. Itmustbe born inmind, however,
that FHIS 3 includes the FifthCredit and therefore gives perhaps a too positive picture o f the outcomes o f
the Fourth Credit. Infact, virtually all subprojects financed with the Fourth Credit and its supplement were
either emergency projects, or projects financed under the (shorter and faster) emergency project cycle. It
was only with the FifthCredit that a longer and more appropriate project cycle was inplace.
*'Thefigures  on the capital stock inprimary education are not very reliable. Actual contribution o f FHIS in
primary education is probably higher giventhat the school construction division o f the Ministry o f
Education was closed in 1996.

 3.9      Access to water improved considerably between 1993 and 1997, from 73 percent to 92
percent, but the contribution o f FHISto improved coverage was modest: only 1.7 percent. Inpart,
 this was due to the fact that FHISoftenjust repairedexisting water systems. Mitchdestroyed a
 large number o fwater systems, and coverage decreasedto 80 percent between 1998 and 2002.
 FHIS made a large contribution to a SANAA-USAIDprogram to restore water access, especially
 inurbanareas.The shareofFHISinconstructionofnewwater systems was 40 percentinthis
 later period.'*

 3.10     Coverage in sanitation didnot improve between 1993 and 1997, butnew systems were
builtto maintain coverage, andFHISbuilt 17percent ofthem (Walker et al. 1999). During 1998-
 2002, coverage insanitation even decreased, from 83 percent to 81percent o f the population, due
to the effects o fMitch. It i s estimated that FHISbuilt 74 percent o fnew sewerage systems in
urban areas, and 10percent of new latrines (ESA Consultores 2005).

3.11     The FHIS emergency subprojects carriedout after hurricaneMitchhelpedthe people
affectedbythe disaster intwo ways: byrepairingphysical infrastructure and by providing
temporary employment. Most persons interviewed agree that FHIS was able to respondquickly to
the needs inmunicipalities.

Targeting
3.12     Inorder to reduce politicalor other distortions inthe allocation ofresources, FHISuses a
poverty map. Ceilings per department andper municipality are definedon the basis o f size o f
population and the extent of poverty. At the beginning o f the ThirdCredit (1995), the poverty
index was composed o f access to clean water supply (50 percent), malnutrition (30 percent), and
access to sanitation (20 percent). Inthe Fourth Credit, the weight for the water and malnutrition
indices was reduced to 40 and 20 percentrespectively, and that for illiteracyrates became 20
percent. Inaddition, the relative weight o f the poverty index increased relative to the weight for
population inthe establishment o f the resource ceiling.

3.13     For an assessment o f actual targeting, data are used from the two impact studies (Walker
et al. 1999; ESA Consultores 2005). The allocation o fresources duringthe ThirdCredit (FHIS 2)
was marginally progressive at the municipal level. This was an improvement over FHIS 1(1990-
1994), when the distribution had beenne~tral.2~       FHIShas beenable to allocatemore than average


22The total excludes contributions fromNGOs, which are important inwater and sanitation.

23Each quintile o f municipalities ordered according to poverty (interms o f basic needs inkeeping with the
above definition), received about the same per capita amount o f resources fromFHIS. The redistribution
index (A kindo f Ginicoefficient: it has value 0 incase o fa neutraldistribution, and a value of 1incase all

 o f its resources to the poorer municipalities and households andhas increased access o f the poor
 to latrines, health centers and schools. This i s a positive development. Onthe other hand, the

 that o f the FourthCredit it was ``....to improve access of the poor to facilities." Hence it i s
 objective o f the Third Credit was "poverty alleviation ...by targetingresources to the poor,'' and

 worrisome that still a large share o f FHISresources benefits the wealthier part of the Honduran
 p o p u l a t i ~ nSome donors to FHIS, like KfW allocate only to the poorer regions. However, the
                    . ~ ~
 Bank has always supported the overall FHISallocation.

 3.14       Inrecentyears, there hasbeen some pressure onFHIS,for example inthe context ofthe
 Consultative Councilthat overseesthe implementation o f the Honduran PRSP, to allocate
 resources only to the poorest municipalities. But this proved politically impossible. As the FHIS
 minister stated duringthe mission in2005, FHISis aministryandis expected to serve the whole
 c0unt1-y.~~     Evenleaving out large andrichmunicipalities such as Tegucigalpa and SanPedro Sula
 i s politically impossible, according to another respondent. Nevertheless, FHIS did change the
 targeted allocation o fresources again in2005, making it more progressive than before.26

 3.15       Another aspect o fthe targeting process i s more subjective: do communities really get
 what they want; have they been involvedindecision-making and i s the facility constructed or
 repaired their first priority?Ifso, it i s expected to enhance their sense o fresponsibility for O&M
 o f facilities. The 1998 evaluation found that 73 percent o f households2' hadbeen involved in
 some kindo f consultation for the choice o f subprojects, and 58 percent o f households participated
 intheir executionbyprovidinglabor, money or materials.A significant minority ofthe fifteen
 subprojects o f which procedures were examined in-depth hadbeennegotiated directly with FHIS
by individuals, such as ateacher, an engineer with interest inthe subproject, or the mayor
 (Walker et al. 1999).Inthe quantitative household survey it was also asked whether members o f
 communities would have had other priorities. Inhealth, education and water subprojects the
priority coincided generally with the subproject implemented, but insewerage and latrines only 4
and 7 percent respectively o f the respondents inthe household survey said that they would have
chosen it. There proved to be considerable demand for other types o f subprojects not included in
the FHISmenu, such as roads (which became included inthe FourthCredit) and electricity (still
excluded).


resources go to the poorest decile o f municipalities) increasedfrom -0.01 inFHIS 1to 0.12 inFHIS 2. In
FHIS 3 (Fourth and Fifthcredits), the redistributionindex at the level o f municipality increased further to
0.26. However, there were important differences between kinds o f subprojects. Inbothperiods, health
projects had the most progressive allocation. Sewerage projects were most regressive inFHIS 2, while
environmental projects were so inFHIS 3. Water projects inFHIS 3 had a redistributionindex o f only 0.10.
The resource allocation by household deciles (potential beneficiaries, so within the area o f influence) was
slightly moreprogressive than that for municipalities: 0.21 duringFHIS 2, and 0.23 duringFHIS 3. For
latrines and health facilities it was most progressive.

24 2 1.7 percent o f resources allocated underFHIS 2 benefited the richest 30 percent o f the population. This
was reduced to 12.4 percent under FHIS 3, but given the objective o f targeting resources to the poor, this
should perhaps be zero.

25 Interview with the minister for FHIS during 2002-2006, Leony Yu Way.

26  The Region commented that there are a great number o fpoor households who live inthe municipalities
o f Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. IEGnotes that the report raises the issue o ftargeting poorer
municipalities and not poor households within rich municipalities  - which  have the resources to take care o f
their poor neighborhoods themselves. The Borrower inits comments agrees with the Region. For details on

projects (Walker et al. 1999).

                                                       14


 3.16     On26 September 1998,just beforethe Fourth Credit became effective, all municipalities
 (except the two largest, Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula) organizedopen town hall meetings
 (cabildos abiertos) inwhich Municipal Investment Plans were established. Although this
 participatory decisionmaking was far from perfect, at least representatives o f all communities,
 local civil society organizations and community based organizations were invitedto participate.
 These plans were to form the basis for negotiationsbetweenFHISand municipalities on
 investment inthe years 1998-2001. However, hurricane MitchinOctober 1998 interruptedthis
 planning process.

 3.17     The extent of involvement ofhouseholds indecisionmakinginFHIS subprojects didnot
 increase inFHIS 3 (Fourth and Fifthcredits) as compared to FHIS 2 (ThirdCredit). The
 percentage o f household involvedinconsultation on the subproject, was 2 percentage points
 lower than inFHIS 2 (71 percent versus 73 percent).** The focus groups interviews reveal that
 only ineight out o f fifteen cases the implementedsubproject was selected inthe cabildos abiertos
 and was also the first priority o f the community. Infour other cases the subproject was or had
 become (after Mitch) a priority for the community, but inthe remaining cases the subproject was
 not the priority o f the community. There was lower coincidence between actual and desired
 subprojects than under FHIS2 for educationand water subprojects (down from 47 to 22 percent,
 and from 64 to 38 percent, respectively), but higher coincidence for latrines (from 7 to 23
 percent) and slightlyhigher for health subprojects (from 35 to 40 percent). The coincidence on
 sewerage which was very low in 1998 (4 percent) i s missinginthe 2005 report.

 3.18     Although the appraisal document o f the FourthCredit speaks o f securing beneficiary
participation inall phases o f the subproject cycle, this was not carried out systematically during
the Fourthand Fifthcredits (FHIS 3) - even apart from the emergency subprojects. Infact, the
percentage o f households participating duringsubproject execution was 54 percent inFHIS 3 and
this was about the same duringFHIS2 (58 percent)?'

3.19      Inthe second evaluation(FHIS3) there provedto be alinkbetweenhavingbeen
consulted and having participated inconstruction, andthe utilization o f subprojects at the
household level, so this appeared to be important indeed.Utilizationat household level o f health
centers, water systems and latrines proved to be slightlyhigher under FHIS 3 than under FHIS2,
butitwas the other way roundfor schools (constituting the vast majority of subprojects).


Impact onpoor households

3.20      The two evaluations also examined the impact o f FHIS on development indicators at the
household level, such as enrolment rates, use o f health centers and incidence o f diarrhea.30



28Inbothevaluations, this figure isbasedona sample ofabout 1300households inthe direct "area of
influence" o f FHIS projects: 48 projects inthe first (Walker et al. 1999), and 110 inthe second evaluation
(ESA Consultores 2005). The table inESA Consultores (2005: 23) gives numbers for the 1998 evaluation
(for the total o fprojects) that are much lower than the actual numbers inWalker et al. (1999) and also do
not square with the figures by project type inESA Consultores (2005), so it is incorrectly concluded that
involvement indecision making has increased.

29Based on the same samples o f households, see notes 27 and 28. Again, see also note 28 above, the
numberinESA Consultores (2005) for total ofprojects for FHIS2 is lower than inWalker et al., 1999,
giving the impressionthat participation has increasedwhile it has not.

30This was difficult since no baseline data hadbeen collected ondevelopment indicators incommunities
where FHIS had implemented a subproject. The study therefore compared households incommunities that
benefited from a FHIS project, withthose that didnot have a FHIS project. For this control group, the

                                                      15


 3.2 1    The first evaluation found no significant increase inenrolment rates but did find a
 statistically significant increase inthe percent o f children that was inthe right grade for ages eight
 and nine.This may be the effect o f an improved quality o f education. Inthe second evaluation
 (2002), both variables were higher inthe communities with a FHIS subproject but a statistically
 significant result was only found for enrolment rates. Inthe before and after comparison 1998-
 2002, enrolment rates increased from 89 percent to 98 percent, and there was an even larger
 increase inthe percentage o f children that was inthe right grade for their age: from 4lpercent to
 60 percent. Bothincreases were statistically significant.
 3.22     The first evaluation found a statistically significant higher percentage o f persons using
 medical services incase o f a medicalproblem incommunities where FHIShad constructed or
 improved a health center: 51percent versus 41 percent. In the second evaluation, the pipeline
 only provedto include improvements o f health centers andno new constructions, and no
 significant effect couldbe found. Butthe before-after comparison revealed an increase from 41
 percent to 55 percent inhouseholds who visit a health center incase o f a medicalproblem. There
 also provedto be an increase inthe percentage o f pregnant women visiting a health center, but it
 was not statistically significant.
 3.23     The 1998 study found a statistically significant effect from latrine subprojects on the
 incidence o f diarrhea: it was 10percent lower. The second study found a significant impact on
 diarrhea from both latrines and sewerage (toilets) inthe with-without comparison. The incidence
 o f diarrhea provedto be higher ifwater from a well was used as comparedto tap water, but lower
 ifwater from "other sources" was used.These other sourcesmayincludelesshygienic sources,
butmay also includebottles, or water tapped fromneighbors. Inthe before- after comparison,
 improved use o f water and sanitation facilities couldbe registered, implyinga lower use o f
 alternative sources o f water. Butno significant reductions of diarrhea could be established.

Supportto VulnerableGroups

3.24      Duringthe ThirdCredit, the amount investedinthe Basic Needs Programwas small and
FHISlackedstrategic direction to evaluate and oversee the pr~gram.~'the FourthCredit itwas
                                                                                In
decided to set up a Steering Committee, comprised of representatives o f government andNGOs,
for the implementation o f the program. This Committee was expected to improve the evaluation
and oversight o f subprojects set up under the program and also to increase transparency and
efficiency inthe identification o f subprojects (World Bank 1998). A Steering Committee was
established, some workshops were held and technical assistance was provided, but the actual
implementation o f subprojects inthis area was suspended when hurricane Mitch struck and all
investmentresources o fFHISwere usedfor cleaningandrepair activities.32


researchers usedthe pipeline o f FHIS projects. However, this pipeline o f projects was so small that no
sample could be taken, thus reducingthe statistical validity o f the comparison. The second evaluation could
use the pipeline o fthe first for makingan additional comparison o f communities before and after the FHIS
project. It is also important to remember that FHIS oftenjust improved or expanded existing facilities. In
those cases, it cannot be expectedthat FHIS has a large impact.

3 1The completionreport on the ThirdCredit notes that although 69 subprojects were carried out under the
Basic Needs Program, the amount invested was small ($1.6 million intotal over three years; indeed, much
less than the amount mentionedinthe appraisal document) and only a few types o f subprojects were
supported. The completionreport also concludes that there was still a lack o f strategic direction inFHIS to
evaluate and oversee these programs.

32 In2000, during thepreparation ofthe FifthCredit, the Basic NeedsProgramwas re-establishedunder the
name FIDAS, Social Assistance and Development Innovations Fund.N e w aspects o f FIDAS include
competition among proposals, that FHIS no longer decides but leaves decisions to a Steering Committee in
which the majority o f members represents civil society, and that there i s more explicit targeting. The target

                                                       16


 3.25      The Nuestrus Rakes programbegan in 1995 as a response to demands from indigenous
 groups. According to the completionreport o f the Third Credit, between 1995 and 1998, F H I S
provided US$3.8 million infinancing for construction and rehabilitation of rural roads or canals
 etc. inethnic minoritycommunities using paid labor. Inaddition, the communities were
 encouraged to save at least part of the money earned to finance agricultural or commercial
 activities. They received training inorder to better organize themselves. Untilmid-1999,the
programbenefited 3,500 communities representingten different ethnic groups. There were about
 107,000 beneficiaries and 42 percent of them were women (WorldBank 2000). The subprojects
helped generate income for the poor while at the same time bringingabout improvements in
community level facilities.

Box 3: A SuccessfulNuestrusRuices (NR) Subproject

Among the subprojects visited for this study there was one NR subproject. Unlike the other visited
subprojects, this one was not randomly chosen and apparently it was a rather successful case. The
indigenous (Zenca)community Tenampud inAguafayer, department o f Comayagua, had a NR subproject in
the thirdand inthe fourth phase o fNR, with money from the Fourth and FifthBank credits. Daily
payments per worker were first 50L and later 60L. This community decided to save all the money received
for their construction work and set up a commonbank (caja rural>.Intheir first project they built a
community house together. With the next project, they began to buildanother house and they used a small
part o f the money for buying furniture. The second house i s going to be a big one and was still under
construction inNovember 2005. They intendto use it as a future office for the credit bank as well as for
renting.

The rural credit bank was the most successful part o f this experience. The members (socios) were making
profits, and several members had been able to borrow money to set up or expand profitable agricultural
activities, such as mango and rice growing. They hadreceived training for setting up this rural bank. The
interest rate was high(3 percent per month) but borrowers were paying. Despite the highinterest rate there
i s a high demand for credit, also from outside the community. Non-members have to present collateral,
while members don't. Inorder to meet the highdemand, the caja rural would like to expand its capital
base by using aid money, for example from the EuropeanUnion, or byborrowing from a regular bank.
However, the first proved impossible since they are not putting up the legally requiredreserves for a small
savings bank (encaje legal; they call it a tax) and the second was also denied to themby the (state)
development bank, despite submitting an impressive amount o fpapers testifyingsufficient security and
collateral. This indicates that government policies are not very favorable for promoting rural credit
expansion. This successful NR subproject cannot expand further.


3.26      Duringthe FourthCredit FHISconcentratedon financing small hurricane recovery
subprojects prioritizedby communities, applyinga kind o f learning-by-doing. Within six months,
F H I S had spent $2.1 millioninthe form of 1,843 small subprojects, benefiting 57,940
households. The FourthCredit also provided for a role for ethnic federations inimplementation
which contributed to their strengthening(WorldBank, 2003).33


areas are children inprecarious conditions (children affected by HIV-AIDS, by violence, orphans, teenage
mothers, etc.), disabled and elderly. Although there are no evaluation results available yet, interviews inthe
field indicate that this program finally appears to be successful. Hence though the Basic Needs Programdid
not achieve its objectives during the Third and Fourth credits, lessons learned seem to have had a positive
effect on the programas executedunder the FifthCredit.

33 With money from FifthCredit, the fourthphase o fthe programwas carried out and the Bank financed
about $13 million for this phase, which began inJune 2001, This fourth phase has beenevaluated by ESA
Consultores (2002) who found that the project was good at targeting extremely poor communities and
households. It also helped to strengthenand increase legitimacy o f ethnic federations through the role they
had inthe coordination o f the projects. Representatives o f these federations served as contact persons with
FHIS and as supervisors.

                                                   17


 3.27     One lessonlearnt according to the appraisal document o f the FourthCredit i s that FHIS
 should have "limited objectives". Nevertheless the Basic Needs Program andNuestras Rakes
 were still included. Bothwere not part o f the core business of FHIS and required special
 procedures and operations, and specialized personnel. There are not many synergies betweenthe
 core business o f FHIS and these programs. Bothprograms neededa long lead time before they
 obtained some efficacy.

 EFFICIENCY

 3.28     Efficiency of both projects i s rated modest. While it i s true that FHIS has achievedhigh
 operating speed, but quantity has often been at the cost o f quality (see below, under
 sustainability) and costs have not been low.
 3.29     FHIS project documents do not include any cost-effectiveness analysis. The appraisal
 document of the Third Credit gives an amount to be spent and does not give physical targets: it
notes that ifcosts per subproject are higher, fewer subprojects will be implemented (p. 27). The
 appraisal document o f the FourthCredit states "Since the project i s fully driven by community
 demand andbasically a line o f credit, no cost-benefit analysis has been carried out for the full
program." It goes on to explain how FHIS uses standard designs and "technical and simple

beneficiary) to ". .. determine subproject economic viability". (p. 11). These statements are more
 economic criteria" (the latter referring to a maximum amount to be spent per expected

 or less repeated inthe completionreport o f the Fourth Credit (World Bank 2003). Both
 completion reports make an assessmento f the relative project management costs (15 percent o f
total, see Tables 1and 2 above) which are considered within the normal range for Social
InvestmentFundsinthe region.
3.30      Most subprojects were directly contracted. This made the process o fproject
implementation fast: for example, duringFHIS2 (ThirdBank Credit) there were on average only
 14 days between subproject approval and contracting indirect hiring, against 112 days for private
biddingand 78 days for public bidding(Walker et al. 1999). Onthe other hand, to be able to do
direct contracting FHIShadto invest ina systemo fregisteredprices and inmaintaining a list o f
reliable contractors.
3.31      Almost all persons interviewed for this assessment(except for FHIS staff) were o f the
opinion that costs o f construction through FHISwere relatively high.Usually, constructing firms
and supervisors hadto come from Tegucigalpa, and most workers also came from outside the
community where the work took place. One respondent estimatedthat costs would be about 40
percent lower ifmunicipalities had contracted the works to local construction firms usinglocal
labor and materials to the extent possible.  34 However, inthe 1990s most municipalities were not
yet able to do this.Other respondents referred to NGOs that would have been cheaper in
implementing water and sanitation subprojects. Several respondents pointedto the highoverhead
o f FHISitselfand the lack o f internal coordination, which both increased costs. For example, it
was remarkedthat inone community, FHIS hadconstructedlatrines twice, with different
materials -and none o f themwas inuse; they were used for storage.
3.32      The 1998 impact evaluation attempted to assess the costs o f direct hiring, as the dominant
operation mode o f FHIS, by comparing it with competitive bidding.This resulted inonly a small
increase for most subproject types, but a larger increase o f 13 percent inthe case o f water and
sanitation subprojects. It also compared the costs per square meter ineducation and health
buildingswith standard costs as recommendedbythe Honduran Chamber o f Construction. FHIS
proved to be slightly cheaper inhealth, and about 19percent more expensive, on average, in

34 Interview with directoro fAMHON.

 education (computed from evidence presented inWalker et al., 1999: 44). Inwater, the same
 evaluation found that the cost per connection for the user proved to be three times higher than
 what i s considerednormal inother projects (Walker et al. 1999).35

 OUTCOME

 3.33     The overall rating for outcome i s moderately satisfactory for bothprojects. This i s the
 balance o f substantialrelevance, substantial efficacy and modest efficiency.

 SUSTAINABILITY

 The overall sustainability i s rated unlikely for both credits. Although most FHIS subprojects are
reported (inthe evaluations) to be inuse, they are often not usedinfull and there were many
problems with the quality o f subprojects and with their maintenance. On average, utilization,
 quality and maintenance seemto have improved in the non-emergency subprojects o f the Fourth
 Credit. But most FourthCredit subprojects are infact emergency subprojects inwhich less
 attention was paidto issues like securing community demand, design, quality and sustainability.


Use of Subprojects

3.34      Each FHIS subproject inhealth and education i s approvedby the ministrieso f Healthand
Educationbeforehand, implyingthat the ministrypromises to secure staffing, other resources and
maintenance. Evaluationsby ESA Consultores in 1998 and 2002 and also the mission's visits
show that health and education facilities were generally used, but often not infull. This was due
to problems like lack o f medicines, shortages o fpersonnel, shortages o f textbooks and sometimes
also o f furniture, and leakingroofs inbuildings.In 1998, FHIShealth centers operated at a
similar level as non-FHIS health centers; the utilization o f schools was generally better than
health centers but FHIS schools had more operation problems than non-FHIS schools (Walker et
al. 1999). The use o f FHIShealth facilities improved inthe FourthCredit as more staff and other
resources became available. Between 1998 and 2002, the average number o fpupilsper FHIS
constructed classroomwent down from 30 to 20. This indicates some underutilization o f FHIS
facilities: the national average was 32 in2002. A recent inventory o f schools carried out by the
MinistryofEducationfound that there are manyvery small schools all over the country, also
pointing to possible underutilization and overinvestment. All o f the subprojects constructedunder
the Thirdand Fourthcredits that were visitedby the mission were operating, butto different
degrees.
3.35     While the study by ESA Consultores found that most latrines constructedunder the
Fourth Credit were used, the more in-depthanalysis o f latrine subprojects constructedunder the
ThirdCredit revealedthat they were oftenused for other purposes. There provedto be a clear
relationship with whether training hadbeenreceived (Walker et al: 1999: 54,56). Many persons
interviewed also noted that latrines were used for other purposes, such as storage.

Quality of Subprojects

3.36     The 1998 impact evaluation o fFHIS 2 showed that quality of schools andhealthcenters
constructedby FHISwas not very different from schools and health centers constructed by other


35The Region commented that the recent ICR mission for the FifthCredit found no hard evidence that
FHIS costs were too highand for some time now FHIS contracts have been based on competitive processes
and the institution has worked with several hundred private sectorfirmsduringthat time. IEGnotes that the
analysis presented inthe report was for the Third and FourthCredits.

 agencies, but inFHISfacilities a larger proportion o f sanitary and electric installations (about
 one-third) were not working (Walker et al. 1999). Only 44 percent o f schools and 67 percent o f
 health centers were classified as having "good quality". In2002, with the Fourth and Fifthcredits
 the percentage o f schools o f good quality increased to 87 percent (ESA Consultores 2005)?6
 3.37    In1998, FHIS sewerageandlatrine subprojects were assessedto bebetter thannon-FHIS
 ones, but inwater the FHIS subprojects were o f lower quality. While the quality o f construction
 o f water subprojects seems to have improved betweenFHIS2 and FHIS 3 (percent o f good ones
 went from 70 to 86), that o f latrines deteriorated (from 80 to 71). Inlatrines there was also a big
 problemwith the quality o f doors and seats: only 57 percent of themwere found ingood shape in
 both evaluationperiods.
 3.38    The focus groups inthe 1998 study brought to the fore many problems with the quality o f
 FHIS subprojects, resultingfrom both design faults and poor quality materials. Water systems
 hadproblems with sand filters, the highpressures ledto frequent breaking o f pipes, latrines were
 builtonunsuitable soils, and schools andhealthcenters lackedwater supplies or had septic tanks
 without proper drainage fields (Walker et al. 1999: 39).
 3.39    The field visits undertakenfor this assessmentalso revealed several problems with the
 quality o f the works. Inall cases an inferior material hadbeen usedfor the roofs, so that they
were all seriously leaking. None o f the three primary or pre-primary schools visited proved to
have had a water source at deli~ery.~'According to several respondents, this i s a general problem:
FHISprimary schools typically do have latrines, butnowater. Two visited subprojectshadhad
serious technical problems immediately after construction that hadto be corrected, and inone
case three new class rooms hadbeenbuilt on soil that was inthe process o f eroding. Inthis case,
the parents association was active and was constructing a protective wall, but this problem should
have been foreseen and addressed at the start o f the subproject.
3-40     Representatives o f the Ministries o f Education and Healthreport that they have had
problems with inappropriate FHIS designs and bad quality. Inwater, S A N A A complained o f bad
quality o f the subprojects. This was not due to bad designs (when FHIS started it hadhired
S A N A A personnel, so these people knew what they were doing), but to lack o f adequate
supervision. Several donor and NGO representatives and former staff o f FHIS confirm the poor
quality o f many FHISworks: the use o f inferiormaterials and deficient supervision and control
duringconstruction are mentioned as main causes. Another example given byrespondents refers
to the construction o f school desks, which were part o f the Basic Needs Programuntil 1995 but
then became part o f regular FHIS subproject financing. Most suppliers didnot use driedwood.
As desks consisted of wood gluedtogether, they fell apart within six months. Since FHIS didnot
exercise control over the constructionprocess, there was no way o f ensuringthat dried wood was
used.

Maintenanceof Subprojects

3.41     Duringthe ThirdCredit, responsibilitiesfor maintenance were not clearly defined: they
were formally shared between line ministries, which were not doing it, municipalities, which had
insufficient means to do it, and user committees, which were not sufficiently trained. Inthe
FourthCredit, it was intendedto increase training for user committees but this was not fully
implemented. After hurricane Mitch, speed became even more important. Most o f the money o f

carried out immediately after hurricane Mitch. This "emergency sample" will be dealt with separately
below.

 the FourthCredit was disbursedunder an emergency subproject cycle and maintenance received
 even less attention.
 3.42     Withrespect to maintenance, the agreements concluded by FHISwith ministries didnot
 mean anything: all (ex) ministers and government officers admit that they do not have money for
 maintenance o f schools andhealth centers, whether constructedby FHIS or not. Maintenance in
 practice therefore depends on the efforts o f user committees and municipalities. According to the
 appraisal document, FHISwas expected to systematically train beneficiaries so that they would
 set up user committees (ORMAs) and water boards that would be able to carry out simple
 maintenance tasks and would also be able to approach municipalities to get resources ifneeded.
 Inpractice, accordingto the completion report, beneficiariesofall water andlatrine projects
 (526) receivedtraining, while training was also provided to beneficiaries o f 381 other
 subprojects. Hence beneficiaries of 907 out of a total o f 6,137 projects, or 14.8 percent, were
 trained under the FourthCredit. No training was provided duringthe emergency phase.38 Hence
 ifwesubtractallhurricanesubprojects(4,138), trainingwasprovidedto45.3percentof
 subprojects constructedunder the FourthCredit, Inthe ThirdCredit, beneficiaries o f 416 out o f a
 total of 4,120 subprojects, or 10.1percent were trained. Though there was a clear increase inthe
 FourthCredit, training was by no means a systematic effort yet. Eveniftraining were given inall
 subprojects, it can be doubted whether this would fblly secure maintenance, since communities
 cannot be expected to always have sufficient time and raise sufficient money for it, see also
 3.52.39
 3-43     The evaluations by ESA Consultores didnot compare the maintenance situation of FHIS
 subprojects with non-FHIS subprojects, but they did look at maintenance o f FHIS subprojects in
bothperiods. Withrespect to schools and health centers, they examined the decoration condition
(painting) and the extent o f cleanliness. The decoration condition was low inbothperiods, but
improved over time (Table 4). Cleanliness was badinFHIS2, especially inhealth centers, but
some improvement inFHIS 3 (Fourth and Fifthcredits) was observed.
3.44      Three out o f five visited social infrastructure subprojects hadnot beenmaintained at all.
The quality ofpaintingwas bad, the facilities dirty andthe roofswere leakingbadly. Doors of
latrines were broken. Because o f the leakingroofs, these facilities couldnot be used duringrains.
These three were all constructedin 1996, under the Third Credit (FHIS 2). Intwo other cases,
constructedin 1999 and 2001, the facilities were clean and well maintained. Inthese cases there
was an active user committee (consisting o fparents and teachers) that raisedfunds for
maintenance and improvement o f the facility. Inthe case o f a pre-primary school, the user
committee had evenbuilt a water source. And the other school was buildingthe protective wall
for the three new class rooms that hadbeenbuilt on soil about to be eroded (see above).




38 This does not needto be aproblem: incase o frepairs of existing facilities, well organized user
committees may already have been active. Incase o f cleaning mud, training o fuser committees i s also
unnecessary.

39The Region inits comments notes that "A recent ICR mission for the FifthSIF Project found that the line
agencies were still not providing the agreed maintenance, but that much headway hadbeenmade interms
o fpractical arrangements with municipalities and user committees."

3.45     The Basic Needs Programdidnot meet its objectives (see 3.25) so it i s o f little use to
analyze its sustainability. The evaluation o fthe Nuestras Rakes program found that the
subprojects were infact cash transfer programs, and that little was done to guarantee the
sustainability o f the works. FHISonly paid for salaries and didnot pay for materials, often
leading to deficient quality. The training provided mainly reachedthe contact persons and
coordinators and was not focused on maintenance. Training for the rural credit banks was also
insufficient. Infact, although 84 percent o f the communities that hadhada project didhave a
rural credit bank, the amounts saved from the payments receivedwere low and the money that
was saved was sub-utilized andnot very well managed. Inresponse to these weaknesses, the new
Bank credit for Nuestras Rakes allows payments o f materials and includes more extensive
training at the community level (World Bank 2004).

After Mitch

3.46     The highspeedo f operations after hurricane Mitch and the breakdown o f internal
management controls also affected the quality o f subprojects, for example due to inadequate
appraisals ex ante, the hiringo f inexperienced constructors or supervisors, or sometimes even
lack o f supervision. Even less attention than before was given to participation o f communities in
decision malung and to training o f user committees. Butthere were also specific problems. For
example, the completion report notes that FHIShadreconstructed six schools and one health
center on exactly the same location as where the flooding had occurred, thus making it likely that
flooding would take themaway again (World Bank 2003). Another example i s the "cajapuentes"
that FHIS constructedon a large scale after hurricaneMitch. These are dams withpipes inthem
to secure the water flow and they also serve as cheap bridges. However, according to a civil
society representative, the capacity o f the pipes was often too small so that new floods occurred
inthe next rainyseason, destroying houses andharvests again!'



40These "cajapuentes" had a standard cost; ifrivers were broader, it was not possible to include more
pipes. According to several interviewees, these FHISbridges had to be reconstructed every year.

                                                    22


 3.47      These observations from interviewees are by and large confirmed by more systematic
 studies o f the subprojects of the emergency period. ESA Consultores (2005) made a separate
 evaluation of a sample o f 28 emergency subprojects, andheldinterviews with eight ex-mayors
 about their experience with FHIS inthis period. The mayors were generally satisfied with the
 speed and flexibility o f FHISinits emergency activities and with the professionalism o f FHIS,
 but about halfofthemwere not satisfied with the extent ofcoordinationwith the municipality,
 the quality o fthe projects and the transparency inFHIS' financial, contracting and accounting
 procedures.
 3.48       "Good" or "regular" supervision byFHIShad only been available in58 percent o fthe
 subprojects. The shortcomings o f the emergency subprojects were most evident inO&M. Only 16
percent o f themhad an O&M plan, and inonly 2lpercent o f the cases hadcommunities received
 training for maintaining the works. A user committee was only active in37 percent o f the cases.
 3.49      KfWalso didanassessmentofsubprojects carriedout inthisperiod. Out ofa total of274
 subprojects, 29 subprojects were examined, o f which 83 percentwere emergency subprojects
 (World Bank 2003). The study found that the shortening o f the project cycle ledto superficial
project formulation and appraisal, implyingthat technical documentation was not always
 complete nor fully checkedinthe field. Procedures for targeting subprojects to the poorest
 communities were no longer applied, and insufficient attention was givento verifylng the need
 for a subproject at the beneficiary level. The prototypes for school construction were not always
 suitable for the zones where they were built, and water supply and drainage subprojects were
often poorly designed and were inadequate inscope. Supervision by FHISwas insufficient.
Ninety-nine percent o f subprojects were given to contractors recommendedby municipalities
without looking at the FHIS database o f qualified contractors. The selectionprocedure o f
contractors was not transparent. Twenty percent of projects had cost overruns, and 53 percent
were finished later than planned. Although FHIS had inmost cases not providedtraining o f user
committees, andthe ministries o f Healthand Educationdidnot provide finance for cleaning and
repair, most subprojects were adequately operating and maintained thanks to the efforts o f staff
and users. Butusers didnot have sufficient resources for carrying out larger repairs, suggesting
that over time these sub-projects may not be maintained.41
3.50      In2003, FHIS startedanewmodalityinorder to improvethe sustainability o f
subprojects, the PEC (proyectos ejecutadospor la comunidad, projects executedby the
community). InPEC, the community organization manages the funds, supervises the work and
pays the contractor. The community i s also expected to contribute 10 percent to the costs o f the
project, inlabor or inprovidingmaterials or money (30 percent inthe case o f water subprojects).
FHISprovides for extensive training o fthe community organizationbefore and duringsubproject
implementation, and there are also follow-up visits after finishingthe subproject. PEC subprojects
mustbeincluded inthe strategic municipaldevelopmentplans andthey are carried out in
consultation with municipal governments. By November 2005,200 subprojects had started under
thismodality. However, this modalityalso has its limitations. Managingand-daily-supervising
the project implies aheavy burden on community members, and-despite the training they
receive -they cannot be expected to have adequate capacity to supervise technically the work o f
engineers and construction workers. Furthermore, it can only be expected to work if subprojects
are a very highpriority for the community. This does not always seem to be the case. The mission
visiteda PEC subproject inexecution. This happenedto be an expansion o f a vocational school, a
"Colegio", and it was clear that it was not the community that had asked for it.The expansion had
beenrequestedby the mayor and the school director had intensively lobbied for it.The



41IEG's recent Natural Disaster Study found that these shortcomings are typical o fprojects responding to
disaster situations.

                                                    23


 chairperson o f the user association was afraid that the community would not be able to contribute
 the 10percent required. It canbe questioned whether this i s the ultimate solution for achieving
 sustainability.

 INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPACT

 3.51     Overall, institutional development impact i s rated substantial.This i s the balance o f
 three assessments: a neutral assessmento f having a separate institution for implementing small
 infrastructureprojects: it worked positively, on balance, for health and educationprojects but not
 for water and sanitation projects; a qualified positivejudgment o f the role FHIS played duringthe
 emergency, and a positive assessmento f the effect that FHIShad on the decentralizationprocess
 inthe country.

 InstitutionalDevelopmentImpactinGeneral

 3.52    FHISwas effective inrepairing andexpandingthe stock o fbasic social infrastructurein
 the country. Its use o f a poverty map that was based on availability o f infrastructurewas an
 innovation and ledto a slightly progressive distribution o f its resources. FHIS had an advantage
 over other agencies inthat it was exemptedfrom state procurement rules (more direct contracting
 and more contracting o fnot formally qualified engineers was allowed) and that it couldpay
 higher salaries. The latter allowed FHISto attract higher quality personnel and to apply higher
professional standards o f work. There are however drawbacks to havingthis task carried out by a
 separate institution. The quality o f designo f healthand education facilities was sometimes
 affected by the fact that FHISdidnot always take the professional views o f the Ministries o f
 Healthand Education into account when designingnew or repairing existing f a c i l i t i e ~But~
                                                                                                . ~
relationships inthis area have improved over time. Further,despite the fact that FHIS worked
mostly inresponse to priority setting by municipalities and communities, the allocation o f
 subprojects may have been suboptimal, This was because choice was limited to subprojects that
were within the FHIS menu, excluding a potentially important developmental facility such as
electricity. Inaddition, priorities according to demand and within ceilings definedby a poverty
map may lead to suboptimal allocation within a sector. For example, according to the recent
inventory o fprimary schools there may be too many small schools.

3.53     Yet, the bottom line i s that inthe absence o f FHIS, line Ministries inHealthand
Education would not have implemented the same number of subprojects, and they would
certainly not have achieved the same progressiveness andrural coverage. Though the line
Ministries didnot provide for maintenance, the fact o f the matter i s that they would not have done
so even ifthe donor money for construction hadbeen givendirectly to them.Hence, with respect
to schools andhealth centers, the existence o f FHIS as a separate institution financing basic
infrastructure can be assessed as positive.

3.54     Inwater andsanitationthe situationwas different. FHIS only playeda small role inthe
water sector, and water subprojects were not sustainable because sufficient attention was not paid
to the establishment o fwater boards that are incharge o f O&M. Furthermore, FHIS sometimes
underminedcommunity participation policies o f other agencies, by paying community members
for their contributions (for diggingholes, or supplyingmaterials) instead o frequestinga
contribution from them as the Ministry of Healthdid.43



42According to interviews with staff and former ministers o f these agencies.

43The region commented that "FHIS's practices inthe water supply and sanitation sector have evolved
tremendously, and have more recently been referred to as good practice ina number o fpublications o f the
Bank and other agencies," and that IDA support also ledto greater harmonization inthe water sector.

                                                   24


 3.55     There are also limitations to the extent that FHIS can be seen as a highquality
 professional institution. FHIShas proven not to be exempt from the politicalprocess. First,
 changes ingovernment every four years bringabout highstaff turnover, thus weakening the
 professionalism o f the institution. Second, andjust like other state agencies, FHIS i s subject to
 political interference. Infact, the huge amount o f donor money that can be spent through FHIS
 makes the institution particularly suitable for the advancement o f political objectives. Yet,
 according to some civil society representatives and other non-government observers, political
 intervention inFHIShas been less than inother state agencies.
 Emergencyperformance
 3.56     Withrespect to the situation after hurricaneMitch, FHISwas a suitable institution for
 carrying out emergency subprojects since it was able to react quickly. But the speed accentuated
 the already existing weaknesses o f FHIS, especially inthe area o f securing quality and
 sustainability. Getting things done quickly took priority over quality leading to weaknesses in
 subproject design, contracting, and supervision. Inthe emergency periodFHISworked mainly
 with municipalities andmayors to determine priorityneeds. The involvement of direct
 beneficiaries insubproject selection and formulation, inexecution and inO&M was even less
 than before. Interviews heldby ESA Consultores revealed that even mayors were not always
 satisfied on contractingprocedures and transparency o f FHISduringthe emergency period.
 3.57    After the emergency period, FHISwas not able to return to its institutional strength o f
 before the hurricane. Although finally, in2000, a normal subproject cycle was reestablishedit
 was much shorter than before and ad-hoc decision making continued to dominate. Furthermore,
 the internal administrationremained chaotic and the MIS was never fully restored. One reason for
these problems i s that due to the huge scale of the devastations by Mitch, emergency subprojects
were not additional to a "regular FHIS", but FHIS became an emergency institution. Evenmore
importantly, FHIS then sufferedtwo changes inits leadership within eight months, with high
turnover inother key staff. The institutional memory hadbeen completely lost. Inaddition, the
FHISministerfromMarch2000 onwards appearedmainly interested inincreasingthe quantity o f
 subprojects and not so much inrestoring orderly procedures and criteria.

Role of FHIS in Decentralization

3.58     Toward the end o f the ThirdCredit, FHIS hadbegun working with municipalities and
communities, responding to their demands, providing training to communities and building
capacities inmunicipalities. Inthe emergency period after Mitch, FHIS gave an important
coordinating role to municipalities and mayors indeciding on priorities for emergency
subprojects. The decentralizationpilot that was finally carried out in2002 involved, apart from
improvingparticipatory micro-planning, the setting up o f a decentralizedoperation o f the project
cycle (DOCP), makingmunicipalities responsiblefor almost the full project cycle.
3.59     FHISwas byno means the only institution to strengthen capacities inmunicipalities and
to give them more responsibilities, but its efforts have certainly contributed to the decentralization
process inthe country. Duringthe Maduro administration (2002-2006) decentralization was taken
more seriously and the Ministryo f the Interior couldbuildon the experience o f FHIS, as well as
on other experiences, to develop standards for localparticipatoryplanning for elaborating long-
term Strategic Municipal Development Plans. These plans have since been elaboratedinall
municipalities, and their content i s no longer limitedto the FHIS menu. The Ministryalso began
to use the FHISpoverty map for the allocation o f a part o f the five percent transfer o f central tax
revenues to municipalities.

However, IEGnotes that all these achievementsdidnot happenduringthe Third andFourthCredits which
are the subject of review.

                                                     25


          With strengthened capacities withinmunicipalities (and sometimes groups of
 municipalities - mancomunidades), FHIShas developed the delegated project cycle for the
 3.60

 execution o f subprojects, implyingthat the municipality carries out almost the fullproject cycle.
 The government sees FHIS as the appropriate agency to mobilize donor money for supporting
 this decentralizedproject execution, andIDBandKfWhave providednewloansto support this
 decentralizedmodality. However, between the signing o f these new credits (December 2004)
 untilNovember 2005, FHIShasnotbeen able to carry out a singleproject accordingto this
 modality. This raises concerns whether FHIS still is the appropriate agency through which to
 promote decentralization. Donors willing to support decentralization shouldperhaps consider
 financing municipalities directly or via budget support, for example to the Ministryo f the Interior
 so that it canraise the municipal transfers.

 BANKPERFORMANCE

 3.61     Overall Bank performance was satisfactory,but there are certain caveats. Project quality
 at entry was generally good for boththe interventions, though the design o f the Basic Needs
 Programwas not given adequate attention and the two projects were ambitious with respect to the
 objective o f enhancing sustainability. Responsibilities were meant to be shared betweenline
 agencies, municipalities and beneficiaries though it was not made clear how these were to be
 distributed between the three (especially inthe Third Credit) and neither was adequate provision
 made for providing training andresources for user committees (both credits). With line ministries
 not complying with agreements on providingmaintenance, FHISnow seems to expect
 maintenance from beneficiaries. However, it i s doubtful whether relying on beneficiaries can
 provide a long-term sustainable solution to the problem o f maintenance o f education andhealth
 facilities.
 3.62     Inthe aftermath ofMitch, the Bankwas very proactiveand flexible inallowing all the
 money to be disbursed inemergency sub-projects. This allowed FHISto respond quickly to the
 hugeneeds and to contribute to restorationo fbasic facilities. However the Bank appearsto have
 agreed to flexible procedures for too long. Despite the fact that FHISdidnot returnto normal
procedures inproject appraisal and implementation, the FifthCredit was approved inNovember
 2000. Inthis period, there were also problems with auditing. Inthis light, the FifthCredit was
probably approvedtoo early.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE

 3.63     Borrower performance was satisfactoryduringboth credits, but with some caveats. The
government has ensured availability o f counterpart funds. Given the moderately progressive
allocation o f FHIS resources, line agencies have probably assigned more staff to the poorer areas
than they would have done inthe absence o f FHIS. Lineministries have also complied with their
agreements with FHIS insofar as they have provided finished FHIS subprojects with staff and
resources to the same extent as other facilities. While some underutilization o f FHIS facilities has
been found, this i s at least partly due to the fact that line agencies do not give sufficient priority to
providingthe accompanying resources such as medicines and textbooks. A more fundamental
problem i s that there i s lack o f a good government policy with respect to maintenance o f basic
infrastructure facilities.

3.64      Whenhurricane Mitchhitthe country, FHIScoulduse its institutional strength andits
previous contacts with municipalities all over the country to quickly respond to the huge needs.
However, the short and fast emergency procedures adopted by the social fundcontinued even
after the emergency was over, and hence most subprojects financed through the Fourth Credit and
its supplement did not pay sufficient attention to quality and sustainability, although not all o f
these were emergency projects. The lack o f orderly procedures duringthe post-emergencyperiod

                                                 26


also caused auditing reports that were unacceptable to the financial management specialists o f the
Bank. A recent donor-financedpublic auditing program also found irregularities inFHIS
accounts.

3.65     Another area of weakness, especially duringthe FourthCredit, was lack o f stability in
FHIS leadership. The frequent changes inleadership and staff inthe crucial period after Mitch,
when FHIShadto return to normalprocedures after actually serving as an emergency institution,
wiped out the institutional memory o fFHIS.This impliedthat the institutional strengtho fFHIS
o f the periodbefore Mitchwas largely lost.

4. Lessons
Three lessons are identified here.

Lessonl: While social funds are attractive for donors and can initially be successful inproviding
remote communities access to basic health and educational facilities, the experience o f the
Honduras social fund shows that they are not a long-term sustainable solution for providing basic
infrastructure. The maintenance issue, especially o f health and education facilities, goes beyond
social funds and needs to be seriously addressedas a part o f the overall policy dialogue o f the
Bank with the country. Social funds may contribute by training o f user committees, butthat in
itselfcan never be sufficient for securing maintenance.

Lesson 2: Because o f the apparent success inits core activity o f financing basic infrastructure
projects, FHIS has been and continues to be attractive for donors for programs that do not belong
to the core activity (example, the Basic Needs Program that involved funding for priority social
programs innutrition, childcare, training o f midwives, care for elderly and disabled, etc. and the
Nuestras Rakes Programwhich involvedsocial assistance for indigenous communities).
However it took much longer for the Basic Needs Program and the Nuestras Rakes Programto
achieve some efficacy. CurrentlyFHIShas become a patchwork o f donor-financed programs.
Donors should be cautious inchanneling money to social funds for carrying out non-core
activities.

Lesson3: FHIS had a positive institutional development impact inpromoting decentralization by
helpingto strengthen local government capacities inproject planning and implementation.
However, once these capacities are strengthened, it can be questionedwhether donors should still
fund small infrastructureprojects throughFHIS insteado f searching for more direct channels to
finance local governments.

EstimadoSr. Barbu:

Tengo el agrado de dirigirme a usted para informade que hems revisado el
documento que amtiene el infome de Evoluci6n del Tercer y Cuarto Proyecbo del
Fondo HonduMo de Inversih Social, Cr6dibp2768H0, 31180 y 31181 y se timen
10s siguientescomentaSos:


Enel lndso 3.2, den&) del Aspecto Pertinencia,los avams en descentralizaci6nen
10s perSdos evaluados+son consideradospor ustedes corn0 menwes, es de nuestra
opinh que estos son dgnificaWos, poque fueron la base para el alcance de 10s
logros posteriores, en esa etapa las municipalidades no estaban preparadas para
enfrentar 10s retos de descentralizacibn, pot lo que el FHlS tenia micialmecrte que
involucrarias en la solicitudde losproyectos y fartalecerlas en lasdiferentesetapas de
10smismos,parlo que se mcomiendasi es posible reevaluaresteaspecto.

En el lnciso 3.4: en rsdaci6n al t6rmino "InduMaContratista Local", d FHlS define
dicho terrnino corm la mano de obra de cada cornunidad, se recomiendadefinirlode
dicha manera dado que son amcepbs dfirentes y que deslacan la participaddn
ciudadanaen laejecua6nde 10s proyectos.

aEnlas personascon mayores ingress, al respecto,c a b aclarar que el hecho que se
    el inciso3.13,se afirmaque unagranpropM66nde 10s mcu~s6sde FHISbeneficia

destinenrecums a 10s municipiosde Tegucigalpay San Pedro Sura, no significa que
&os no tenganalto indioe de pohza (barrios marginales),de igualmanera el FHlS
desarrolla pmyectosen 10s rnunicipios para betwficiode 10s mas desposeldas. Es por
estarazdnque enel Miapade la Pobmza,no s8 exduyea ningtinmunidpia,ya quela
pobrera es a nivel na9ona1, por lo que se wmienda omitir o rnodicar dichas
asevemiones,

En el lndso 3.34, ham referencia al us0 de 10s subpmyectos, especificamente la
infraestnrcturade educsci6ny salud, las que no smpm se uSan de forma plena. Es
Importanteh a wde amocirnientoque la responsabilidad del FHlS es llevar a cabo la
finalizad6n de las coristrucciones de lo$ pmyectos y que estas queden en prfedo
funcionamiento, (Escuelasy Hospitales),Envista de que el rnantenimientode estas
obras no depende del FHIS, sino de la asignacicln del limitado pfesupuesto con que
arentan estas instihrciones. for lo que se m i e n & tomar en cuenta que esto es
una variableex6genaImrpartedel FHIS,laque notendriaque afectar negativamente
su Calificacib.

En general, muchas de las lirnitacionesque present6el FHlS en el period0evaluado
son resultadodel prolongado period0 de reconsiruccihluego del paso del Hum&
Mitchaspectosqueensu mayoria hansido supemdos.

En espera que nuestras obsefyadones sean tomadas en cuenta para ef'ecb del
infomefinal.

 Dear Mr.Barbu:

 Iampleasedtoinformyouthatwehavereviewedthedocumentcontainingtheprogress
 report on the Third andFourthHonduran Social InvestmentFundproject (FHIS), Credit
 2766-HO, 31180 and 31181, and would like to make the following comments:

Under section 3.2 entitled "Relevant area," your team concluded that little progress had
been made inthe area o f decentralization during the periods evaluated. However, we are
o f the view that significant progress has beenmade, because it set the stage for
subsequent success. Moreover, duringthat stage, municipalities were not prepared to
face the challenges posed by decentralization, andthis i s why the FHIS hadto initially
include these municipalities when the projects were beingrequested and support them
duringthe various stages ofthese projects. We are therefore recommendingthat this area
bereevaluated.

Insection 3.4, theFHISdefines the "local contracting industry" asthe labor force ofeach
community. A recommendation hadbeenmade to define this term as such, because the
concepts vary and the citizenscontribute significantly to the executiono fthe projects.

Insection 3-13,itwas notedthat alargeportionofFHISresourcesbenefits higher-
incomepersons. I t i s therefore important to make it clear that the allocation o fresources
to the cities o f Tegucigalpa and SanPedro Sula does not meanthat these cities do not
have highpoverty rates (marginal communities). Similarly, the FHIS i s executing
projects incities for the most dispossessedpeople. This i s why no city was left offthe
Poverty Map, as poverty i s a nationalphenomenon. We are therefore recommendingthat
these assertionsbe deleted or modified.

Insection 3.34, reference is made to the use ofsubprojects, particularly thehealthand
education infrastructure, which are not always fully utilized. It i s important to point out
that the FHIS i s responsible for completing the construction of the projects and ensuring

                                                38


that they function properly (schools andhospitals), inview o f the fact that maintenance
o fthese constructionworks does not dependon the FHIS but on the allocation o f the
limited funds available to these institutions. This is why we are proposingthat it be taken
into account that this i s a variable which i s external to the FHIS, which should not
adversely affect its evaluation.

Ingeneral, manyofthe limitations oftheFHISnotedduringtheperiodofevaluationcan
be attributedto the extended reconstruction period following the passage o f Hurricane
Mitch. Itbears noting that most o f these obstacles have beensurmounted.

Inthehopethat our remarks willbetaken into account inpreparing the final report, we
remain,

Yours truly,
