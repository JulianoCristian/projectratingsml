Fund projects for Honduras.\n            The central objective of Honduran Social investment Fund\n            (FHIS) of supporting the government's poverty\n            alleviation strategy was relevant and in line with the\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Country\n            Assistance Strategy (CAS). The assessment rates overall\n            sustainability as unlikely for both credits. Although most\n            FHIS projects are reported (in project evaluations) to be in\n            use, the same evaluations also note that they are often not\n            used in full and there were many problems with the quality\n            of subprojects and with their maintenance. Overall Bank\n            performance was satisfactory with caveats. Bank staff was\n            overoptimistic about the possibilities of securing\n            maintenance, first by expecting too much from line\n            ministries and later by relying too heavily on user\n            committees. The experience of the two projects offers three\n            lessons: While social funds are attractive for donors and\n            can initially be successful in providing remote communities\n            access to basic health and educational facilities, the\n            experience of the Honduras social fund shows that they are\n            not a long-term sustainable solution for providing basic\n            infrastructure. Because of the apparent success in its core\n            activity of financing basic infrastructure projects, FHIS\n            has been and continues to be attractive for donors for\n            programs that do not belong to the core activity. FHIS had a\n            positive institutional development impact in promoting\n            decentralization by helping to strengthen local government\n            capacities in project planning and implementation."}, "docdt": "2006-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
