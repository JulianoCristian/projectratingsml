project outcome is satisfactory, and\n            sustainability is likely. Among the many lessons drawn from\n            the project, it is indicated that because of the Honduran\n            Social Investment Fund's (FHIS) autonomy, in the\n            management of financial resources, its efficiency is strong,\n            attracting highly qualified professionals, who convey strong\n            leadership in decision-making, thus strengthening the\n            institution. The properly designed management information\n            system, facilitated indicators, and monitoring to take\n            corrective actions as needed. But an institution designed to\n            process infrastructure subprojects, is not easily adapted to\n            deal with the social aspects of work, nor social assistance\n            projects, thus improvements in the Social Fund's\n            capacity to handle social issues, depend on the continuous\n            effort of both the borrower, and donors, in providing\n            appropriate technical assistance, training, and\n            opportunities. These could actually be incorporated as\n            elements for social funds programs. But regardless of\n            FHIS's outstanding performance to communities,\n            particularly in response to Hurricane Mitch's needs,\n            the institution took a toll on the efficiency previously\n            established. Hence, contingency plans could be developed\n            with the Bank, to better face emergency situations."}, "docdt": "2000-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
