and improved equity and efficiency for a\n            decentralized education system. It is the Bank'\n            assessment that a four month extension would be prudent to\n            ensure the completion of all activities undertaken in the\n            second round of the school improvement grants program and to\n            allow loan proceeds to be fully disbursed. The Ministry of\n            education and science has prepared an action plan for\n            completion of the remaining activities reflecting the\n            extension of four months. The plan has been closely reviewed\n            by the Bank team during the supervision visit in the week of\n            September 11, 2010 and has been found acceptable. There are\n            no outstanding audits for this project.
