1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

The Education Modernization Project was approved on December 16, 2003. The Loan Agreement
was signed on April 2, 2004 and it became effective on April 23, 2004. The Project was the second5
Bank-financed operation supporting the education sector of the former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of
Macedonia.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Sector Information. At the time of appraisal, the quality of education of FYR Macedonia had
seriously declined since the break-up of the Federal Republic. International tests ranked the FYR
Macedonia among the worst performing countries among participating economies in terms of
education quality - a lot of it explained by disparities among different social groups, regions and
localities. Curriculum and teaching was constrained by rigid and outdated input norms and standards,
and by overly specialized program structures in secondary education. Disparities in the system were
noticeable in terms of inputs (funding, qualified teachers, supply, etc.), participation (including
enrollment to preschool, secondary and tertiary education, and education attainment) and student
performance (measured in sample based tests). Overall, the system did not provide sufficient
transparency. Further, the results of surveys related to quality, relevance and participation in
education were strongly defined by local conditions, including the communities socio-economic status
and expectations and the schools’ capacities and commitment to find adequate responses to critical
challenges. The creation of a politically independent Republic in 1991 reopened traditional rivalries
and ethnic violence erupted in the country, with a ceasefire reached through the signing of the
“Framework Agreement” between the Republic of Macedonia and the Euro-Atlantic community.
This agreement prompted a new education policy agenda around the handover of responsibilities to
the municipalities for financing and administering education, followed by measures to provide
additional support to ethnic minorities to achieve equity and participation of significant ethnic groups.

The Government’s higher level objectives were tied to: (i) the Framework Agreement including the
rights for equal access to “uniform” quality of education, some extra support to ethnic minorities in
terms of access; (ii) the Government’s Education Strategy of preserving or improving the quality of
education; and (iii) the process of decentralization of the public administration, including the Law on
Local Self-governance, empowering municipal governments to establish, administer and finance
public education at pre-tertiary level.

The Bank Country Assistance Strategy of September 9, 2003 (CAS Report No. 26513) targeted
poverty reduction focusing on three development themes: (i) to maintain uninterrupted provision of
core services while the education administration was being decentralized; (ii) to maintain social
cohesion by reducing variations in educational attainment across gender and ethnicity; and (iii) to
improve the quality and relevance of education and decrease the disparities in educational outcomes.
The FYR Macedonia Education Modernization Project (EMP), according to the goals set by this CAS,
was to support specific sectoral elements of the decentralization process and it sought to mitigate
against critical risks, such as a breakdown in the delivery of key services, focusing on improving the
quality of primary and secondary education while piloting new financing arrangements. In addition,
the Project sought to improve the access of minority groups (especially girls) to primary education
through school-based initiatives, which represented a key weakness in FYR Macedonia’s progress
towards achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of universal primary education.

 The first World Bank financed education project was Macedonia Education Rehabilitation Project (Credit 2982), approved
on September 2, 1997.




                                                           1
The Bank had been supporting FYR Macedonia’ efforts in the education sector through the FYR
Macedonia Education Rehabilitation Project (Credit 2982) completed in 2001. Many lessons drawn
from the implantation of that Project were taken into consideration during the design of this operation.

In addition, the Bank had gathered valuable experience in the sub-region (including Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo) in promoting education decentralization while empowering
education authorities to strengthen their focus on access and quality. While the Dutch Government
was ready to support the Macedonia education agenda, even with the Government’s limited
borrowing capacity, the Bank’s involvement was crucial as it aimed to stimulate institutional changes
that would result in measurable and sustainable progress in access and quality over the long-term.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Project Development Objectives as stated in the PAD and its Results Framework were to improve
quality of learning and participation at the targeted schools by strengthening school level planning and
management, and to improve equity and efficiency for a decentralized education system.

The PDOs did not change during implementation, but some of the indicators were modified. The
outcome indicators at the time of appraisal were as follows:

Objective I: Improve quality of learning and participation at the targeted schools by
strengthening school level planning and management. The key indicator to measure this was: 75
percent of the schools receiving school improvement grants under the Project would have measurable
improvements either in quality of learning (tested via school based assessments) or in education
participation (measured at the school level by increased enrollments, attendance and retention rates,
depending on the nature of their most critical challenges).

Objective 2: Improved equity and efficiency for a decentralized education system. Key indicators
to measure the achievement of this objective included:
 Declining disparities between comparable municipalities and schools based on public funds per
    student allocation and targeting measures for municipalities in need.
 Increased spending on non-recurrent expenditures (i.e., in service training).
 Increased spending on pupils attending zero (introductory) year instruction.
 Plans developed by participating municipalities targeting efficiency improvements and measured
    by student/school ratio, student/teacher ratio, and proportion of full-time teachers or by efficiency
    in use of utilities.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/ justification

As previously stated, there were no revisions to the Project’s Development Objectives. However,
during the Project’s Mid-term Review (MTR), as per agreement reached between the Borrower and
the Bank on June 19, 2009, a revision of the Project Performance Monitoring Indicators was made.
Accordingly, the Project’s outcomes were to be measured according to the following indicators:

Objective I: Improve quality of learning and participation at the targeted schools by
strengthening school level planning and management. Key indicators to measure progress toward
this objective were defined as follows:

   60% of students achieve the minimum level of the PIRLS study
   Net enrollment rate in primary education is 95 percent
   Drop-out rate in primary education is 1 percent
   Transition rate to secondary education is 98 percent


                                                   2
   Drop- out rate in secondary education is less than 1.5 percent

Objective 2: Improved equity and efficiency for a decentralized education system. Key indicators
to achieve this included:

   Schools increase their focus on vulnerable groups of students providing teaching by teachers
    trained in:
         o learning and teaching techniques in schools with larger number of Roma students, and

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The Project’s beneficiaries included all 324,244 students, 427 primary and secondary schools
benefiting from the School Improvement Grants, 26,038 teachers who were trained through nine
modules of In-service Teacher Training programs, all municipalities which were involved in the
Project benefiting mostly from the school grants, and MoES agencies and departments, which
increased significantly their capacities, especially State Examination Center (SEC), State Education
Inspectorate (SEI), MoES, and Regional Education Boards (REB).

1.5 Original Components

The Project had three components:


Component 1: Improving Education Quality and Participation (US$16.34 million or 84.6% of
total project cost at appraisal). This component had the following four sub-components:

        Sub-component 1.1: School Development and Planning targeted primarily school
        effectiveness, which included training staff to carry out self-evaluation and planning and to
        implement small school improvement grants.

        Sub-Component 1.2: School Improvement Grants (SIG) was designed to support schools
        that voluntarily carried out a School Self-Evaluation (SSE) exercise and prepared a School
        Development Plan (SDP), with grants of approximately US$10,000 to US$15,000, called
        School Improvement Grants (SIG) program.

        Sub-Component 1.3: Education Assessment sought to help carry out both school-based
        (formative) assessments and external (national and international) assessments to monitor the
        quality improvements in the schools during project implementation, under leadership and
        guidance from the Education Assessment Unit (EAU) of the Bureau for the Development of
        Education (BDE). In addition, the Project aimed to strengthen the State Education
        Inspectorate (SEI) to develop standards for school effectiveness, and develop competence and
        capacity to monitor it as well as to take a lead role in approving and monitoring school
        improvement grants.

        Sub-Component 1.4: In-service Teacher Training was designed to support the
        establishment of an accreditation system to assure that in-service teacher training services
        were provided by multiple providers and that they met adequate standards of quality. The
        system sought to facilitate schools to use SIGs to acquire training services from these
        providers.




                                                   3
Component 2: Capacity Building for Decentralized Education (US$1.75 million or 9% of total
project cost at appraisal). This component had two sub-components:

        Sub-Component 2.1: Strategic and Financial Planning was designed to build capacity
        within the MoES for strategic and financial planning through the establishment and support of
        two units, the Strategic and Policy Unit (SPU) and the Analytical Unit. These units sought to
        strengthen planning systems and the strategic capacity for the central and local governments
        to administer and manage education in a decentralized environment.

        Sub-Component 2.2: Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) focused on
        the development and maintenance of an EMIS - a tool designed to monitor education service
        delivery and outputs (based on agreed standards and indicators), and resource flows, and help
        to strengthen partnerships between all levels of authorities and operations. The EMIS would
        provide supporting information and analytical capacities for decentralized governance and
        management education systems at all levels, and be used for projections and assistance in
        decision making.

Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$1.17 million or 6% of
total project cost at appraisal). This component aimed to provide overall coordination and supervision
of project activities including administrative and fiduciary responsibilities, and to ensure the highest
quality through monitoring and evaluation of project indicators.

1.6 Revised Components

Components were not revised during the course of implementation of the Project.

1.7 Other significant changes

The Loan Agreement was amended three times, as follows:

Amendments related to loan Closing Date. The Loan Agreement was amended twice to
accommodate loan extensions for a total of sixteen months. At the request of the Borrower, the loan
was granted an extension of 12 months to the original closing date of September 30, 2009 (until
September 30, 2010), to permit launching of the second round of the SIG involving around 140
additional schools, the finalization of the EMIS software design and installation, and finalization of
Strategic Planning for the MoES. In September 2010, MoES asked for another four month extension
of the closing date (until January 30, 2010) in order to finalize the second round of the SIG Program.
Specifically, the extension was needed to complete the distribution of the procured goods (teaching
aids and books) to 246 schools and to conclude the procurement process of audio visual equipment.

Amendments related to financial constrains. The Project was originally designed to be co-financed
by the Macedonian Government at 15 percent of its total cost, 26 percent from the Bank, and 59
percent from the Netherland Government. In late 2009, the Borrower requested the Bank to eliminate
the counter-part contribution requirement due to financing constrains imposed by the global financial
crisis. This request was approved on November 19, 2009, but did not change the Project scope, as the
team managed to adjust the cost of activities within the available budget, and there had been gains
from exchange rate variations.


Amendment of Performance Monitoring Indicators. During the Project’s Mid-Term Review
(October 2006), a review of Project indicators concluded that many of the original indicators were not
fully relevant, and difficult to measure as they were based on former MoES recording and reporting
systems. For that reason, the MoES, the Bureau for Development of Education and the State
Education Inspectorate organized a workshop and agreed on a revised set of indicators, defining



                                                   4
protocols to measure them and assigning responsibilities to educational agencies and departments to
collect and report them accordingly. The Project’s Performance Monitoring Indicators were revised
and formally agreed with the Bank through an attachment to Supplemental Letter dated June 19, 2007
and countersigned by the Borrower on July 7, 2007.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The ICR team rates Design and Quality at Entry as Satisfactory for the reasons elaborated below.

Key positive aspects of Project preparation include:

Ownership and Government political commitment during project design was considerable, and
it was consistent with the Government’s policies. The Project’s objectives were consistent with
the Government’s policies and objectives of the education reform such as: (i) the Ohrid Framework
Agreement (including the rights for equal access to “uniform” quality of education, and some extra
support to ethnic minorities in terms of access); (ii) the Government Education Strategy of preserving
and improving the quality of education; and (iii) the ongoing process of decentralization of public
administration, including a recent Law on Local Self-governance, empowering the municipal
governments to establish, administer and finance public education at pre-tertiary level.

The Project was in line with the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of August 14, 2003,
which presented three key development challenges and opportunities for education, embedded in the
EMP Project design: (i) to maintain uninterrupted provision of core services while the education
administration is being decentralized; (ii) to maintain social cohesion by reducing variations in
educational attainment across gender and ethnicity; and (iii) to improve the quality and relevance of
education and – especially decreasing the disparities in educational outcomes.

Cooperation and partnership with other donors and Government to co-finance the Project was
achieved. Given the limited borrowing capacity of the FYR Macedonian Government, 59 percent of
the total project cost targeted for supporting the Education Modernization Project was provided as a
grant by the Dutch Government on a co-financing basis for a total of US$11.4 million. The FYR
Macedonian Government planned to participate with 15 percent of the total Project cost (US$2.91
million). The signing of the Trust Fund Agreement for the Dutch co-financing was considered as a
condition of effectiveness for the IBRD Loan.

Project preparation bridge fund was ensured. The preparation phase enabled a good start for the
Project. The Dutch Government provided a bridge grant funding of EUR 300,000, which was used to
finance technical assistance to support project preparation and pave the way for a smooth
implementation. The grant aimed at supporting the following major objectives of the EMP: (i) pilot
school development plans and institutional arrangements for school improvement grants; (ii) develop
a strategic framework for education decentralization; and (iii) support to the Project Coordination Unit
during Project preparation. More precisely, some of the key achievements of this Grant that directly
contributed to a smooth implementation of the Project were as follows: (i) ten pilot schools developed
school level planning documents, including school self-evaluation, school development plan, and
school improvement proposal; (ii) school level support material in the form of SIG Guidelines,
including procurement and financial arrangements were developed; (iii) institutional arrangements for
the EMP, including steering, monitoring and evaluation bodies were identified and the majority of
them established and tested; (iv) an Education Decentralization Concept Paper was developed and
agreed within the MoES and the broader constituency; and (v) an Inter-governmental Project
Advisory Board was appointed by the Vice President of the Government consisting of the State
Secretaries of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Local
Self-government, the Secretary of the Parliamentarian Committee for Education, Science and Sport
and chaired by the State Secretary of the MoES.


                                                   5
Project design was based on solid technical evidence. A Bank Education Policy Note6 released in
2002 identified the following areas as critical challenges and opportunities for the Government: (i)
strengthening strategic and policy capacities to improve attainment and overall system performance;
(ii) improving education finance to assure equal access and equitable allocation of public resources;
(iii) improving the relevance of education through new curriculum (Matura), improving the quality of
instruction and learning, and by developing education standards and sustained assessment activities;
and (iv) reforming tertiary education. Following this Policy Note, the Project addressed (i), (ii), and
to some extent (iii).

Lessons learned during previous Bank operations were taken into account. From the first Bank-
supported education Project (Education Rehabilitation Project 1997-2000), the EMP Project design
took into consideration lessons regarding: (i) education assessments - by broadening the use and
impact of assessment activities, bringing them closer to school level and central decision making; and
(ii) teacher training - by designing a competitive and professionally coordinated in-service teacher
training system, rather than attempting to centrally administer the in-service training system.

Project design also considered international experience, such as school grants activities in several
Bank-financed Projects in Former Yugoslavia countries, as well as in Romania and Russia. The
usefulness proved not only in terms of efficient support to the level of service delivery, but also in
empowering schools to engage in planning, improving quality, and making education responsive to
local need and conditions, with the objective of improving both the cognitive and social outcomes of
education, thereby promoting a more effective and efficient school system.

Notwithstanding the solid preparatory work, the following were some shortcomings of Project design:

Result framework indicators had shortcomings. As explained above, the PDO was appropriate. At
the same time, during the first years, PDO and intermediate indicators were very difficult to measure
and report. One of the reasons was that some indicators were based on the previous institutional set up
of MoES and protocols for reporting. With the change of MoES structures, existing protocols for
collection of those indicators were not relevant anymore. The other reason was that some of the
indicators were not measurable. Subsequently, the Project Mid-term Review (2006) revealed the
problem with indicators framework resulting in their revision in 2007.

Overly ambitious institutional strengthening interventions. This was particularly true in the case
of the development of Education Management Information System (EMIS), which was a delayed
activity with some significant impact in the Project monitoring. EMIS was expected to be developed
and operational within year three of the Project, and to be able to provide information on project
implementation and overall education reforms. In fact, the activity in its complex and novel nature
needed much more time to allow for advanced technical expertise absorption, nurturing of a data-
usage culture across education agencies and schools, development and adoption of specific policies
for its institutionalization, as well as purchasing of hardware and software.

Failure to identify some risks and incorporate appropriate mitigation measures. The global
financial crisis affected the Government’s ability to provide co-financing for the Project. In addition,
the risk of financial sustainability to finance some of the key reforms such as School Improvement
Grants and In-service Teacher Training after the closing date of the loan was underestimated.
Currently, the Bureau for Development of Education’s (BDE) education budget (yearly and Mid Term
Budget Plan) has provisioned only a modest amount of EUR 66,000 to finance teacher training, and
has no funds allocated to School Improvement Grants (SIG). Hopefully, this is a temporary
circumstance due to tight budget constraint resulting from the global financial crisis.

Over-estimation of fiduciary and technical capacity of schools. Macedonian schools had never
been responsible for procurement before this project, and this first-time engagement with funds
execution subsequently required extra time for them to comply. As result, the first phase of the SIG
implementation took three years instead of one. In addition, despite the relatively small procurement
packages that each school had to procure, items related to infrastructure improvement required a skills
mix such as architecture/engineering that schools did not have and this was not anticipated at Project
design.

2.2 Implementation

The ICR team rates implementation as Satisfactory.

Overall, Project implementation went smoothly, and challenges were overcome. The majority of
project outcomes were achieved (Annex 2). The School Improvement Grants, In–service Teacher
Training Scheme, EMIS, and Strategic Development Document for the MoES were all completed and
instituted in the education system of the country. Educational agencies, such as Bureau of
Development of Education and State Examination Institute are better established and strengthened.
Throughout implementation, the commitment and professionalism of the MoES, including the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) and the Overall Project Working Group, was recognized as one of the key
factors for the successful implementation of the Project. The key Project events that affected
implementation included:

The partnership with the Dutch Government’s represented a major positive factor for Project
reforms. A Dutch Grant (TF-52855) co-financed almost two-thirds7 of the overall Project cost, a
significant contribution to the Project’s success, as the fiscal space of FYR Macedonia was
insufficient to allow it to be funded through loans. It is also relevant to note that Dutch officials from
the Embassy in Skopje participated in joint supervision missions with the Bank, contributing to
enhancing the quality of supervision, and helped coordination with other Dutch government grants
operated by Macedonian education institutions in parallel to the reforms’ activities.

The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for FY04-06 supported FYR Macedonia overall
decentralization reform and facilitated the education decentralization aimed by the Project.
Three Programmatic Development Policy Loans8 focused on decentralization policies and achieved:
(i) adaptation of a stable and transparent mechanism for financing municipal governments; (ii)
reduction of municipal arrears; and (iii) adaptation of a plan for financing teachers’ salaries. These
three DPLs contributed to proper use of public resources in a decentralized environment, thus
facilitating the work of the Project on the education decentralization front.

Budget cuts to the education budget were imposed in late 2007, negatively affecting the
availability of counterpart funding, but the Government appropriately adjusted project
activities to the circumstances. In response to budget cuts, the Government requested an amendment
to the Loan Agreement to reduce the total amount of counterpart funding. This amendment went into
effect on December 18, 2009. Up to that point, the Government had contributed about US$1.91
million out of the US$2.91 million planned at appraisal. The Government’s share was used partially to
pay suppliers, and partially for conducting a special procedure for VAT reimbursement to the
suppliers. The reduction in Government share did not affect the Project scope and planned activities,
as the Project’s team made appropriate adjustments within available funding and the exchange rate
variations, particularly the Euro appreciation in relation to the local currency and US$, made more
resources available to the Government.

                                                             7
Exchange rate fluctuations affected the implementation of school grants. Concretely, a strong
drop in the value of the US Dollar and EUR against the Macedonian Dinar (MKD) on 2006-2008
affected the planning of project resources. These fluctuations had a particular impact on
implementation of the first round of School Improvement Grants. Specifically, EUR 6.5 million had
been intended to be allocated to this activity, but given that the amount per school was planned in US
dollars, the fluctuation of US dollar relative to the MKD led to a smaller amount of MKDs paid per
school. Thus, at the end, about EUR 5.7 millions instead of the initially planned amount of EUR 6.5
million was allocated for this activity resulting in the schools receiving a smaller amount in EUR than
previously intended. However, this issue was resolved with the second round of SIGs, by planning
and accounting these grants in EUR, a currency that was more stable when compared to the MKD
during Project implementation.

Policy priority changes impacted some long-term sector issues. For example, while the State
Matura exam was well instituted, the Government dropped its participation in the international
assessments, with the rationale that Matura alone would suffice for assessing teachers’ performance
and other activities would overcrowd the agency in charge of assessment. This decision was reversed
later with the agreement to participate in PIRLS and PISA. Another similar case was with the
Government’s initiative to support the Computer for Every Child (CfEC) Project, which required
exceptional commitment from the Bureau for Development of Education and caused significant
delays with activities related to the In-service Teacher Training component such as accreditation of
providers, preparation of training catalogue, etc.

Frequent political changes partially affected the implementation pace of the Project. Four
Ministers of Educations took office during Project implementation and two municipal elections
brought deep changes in municipal staff. These changes were followed by staff turnover resulting in
additional time required to build capacities of the newly appointed staff and delays in the
implementation of activities. As a result, the PCU had to devote considerable human resources to the
implementation of the second phase of the SIG in those municipalities where mayors and school
masters were replaced due to result of local elections.

Insufficient fiduciary capacity in schools was noted. As mentioned earlier in this assessment,
another challenging factor during implementation was the insufficient fiduciary capacity of schools to
conduct SIG activities. In 2008, a Bank Review flagged procurement issues in some schools involved
in the first phase of the SIG.9 This review, and ensuring correction of the identified issues, ended up
leading to an 18 month delay during implementation. At the same time, the corrective actions
strengthened the program so that it could be successfully implemented in a second round.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

This assessment concluded that the original project indicators had shortcomings, but those were
addressed after the Mid-term Review. As already discussed, many indicators were inadequate to
measure the Project Development Objectives and most indicators were missing baselines. As a result,
supervision teams were unable to monitor progress on the basis of the indicators, and by the time a
mid-term review was carried out, the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) performance was rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory. In an effort to resolve the situation, the Bank recommended to the MoES
to revise the Results Framework. Subsequently, the MoES, the Bureau of Development of Education
and the State Examination Institute organized a workshop and agreed on a revised set of performance
indicators, and assigned formal responsibility within the education system to collect and report them
accordingly. Overall, the revision was adequate and provided measurable indicators. At the same
time, a significant shortcoming of this revision was the introduction of an international student

  In response to reports of procurement irregularities by some of the schools, in February 2008 the Bank carried out an in-
depth Procurement Post Review entitled Procurement Forensic Review (PFR) to identify problems and, later, recommend
corrective actions to address them.


                                                            8
assessment performance (PIRLS) as an indicator of improvements in education quality. While this
indicator is a relevant one, the team introduced it without considering that the results of the next
PIRLS would not be available until after the Project was closed and thus this indicator could not be
used to measure project performance. The Bank approved the revision through an exchange of letters
on June 19, 2007, and the result indicators were officially changed on July 9, 2007. Since then, the
reporting of the indicators was periodic and helped EMP reporting and follow-up.

Despite initial shortcomings with indicators, the Project still had an adequate level of
monitoring during implementation. The Project employed five levels of monitoring and evaluation
instruments: (i) school level self-evaluation; (ii) a SIGs regional evaluation system; (iii) central
steering bodies focusing on the main Project components; (iv) key central agencies and management
systems (SEI, EAU/SEC, EMIS/analytical unit of MoES) with functional M&E role; and (v) the PCU
overall monitoring, fiduciary supervision and evaluation system. These instruments were used to
ensure relevance, effectiveness and efficiency of project activities, and quality reporting.

In addition to regular project monitoring, several reports were commissioned during project
implementation: Baseline Assessment on Educational Input, School Staff Perceptions About
Reforms, Evaluation of the Provision of In-service Teacher Training Among Pilot Schools, SEI
Evaluation of the Achievement of the Schools: “read and listen” skills during SIG1 and “listen” skills
during the SIG2, etc.

The most noteworthy project contribution to M&E in the education sector was supporting the
establishment of an Education Management Information System (EMIS). The purpose of EMIS
is to: (i) support capacity building for decentralization of education; (ii) be a tool to monitor education
service delivery, outputs, and resource flows; and (iii) help to strengthen partnerships between all
levels of authorities and operations. The Project planned for the EMIS to be developed during the
initial years of implementation, and thus support project monitoring. This plan, however, did not
materialize until project closure when the EMIS hardware, software, protocols, and users’ training
were finally all in place.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environment. While the Project did finance minor civil works such as school repairs or replacement
of windows, doors floor and toilets, these civil works were of no impact on the environment.

Fiduciary

Procurement performance is rated by this evaluation as Satisfactory. Throughout implementation
the PCU demonstrated sound procurement performance, acquired through training and experience.
Some weaknesses on contract management and physical inspection of goods and works were noted at
the beginning of the Project but were all addressed and the changes incorporated into the revised
Procurement Handbook.

At the same time, as stated earlier, the team indentified some shortcomings with the
procurement policies and procedures governing School Improvement Grants (SIG). In response
to reports of irregularities in conducting procurement by some of the schools, the Bank hired a local
company to conduct a technical and procurement review of the alleged irregularities. This review
raised certain procurement procedural and possible fraud and corruption issues in some schools.
Focused on those concerns, in early 2008 the Bank carried out a review of the EMP procurement
performance (Procurement Forensic Review - PFR) to: (i) determine whether or not Bank- financed
activities had been procured observing agreed procedures; (ii) identify possible risks of procurement
mismanagement; and (iii) propose mitigating actions to reduce these risks. The sample review
concluded that: (i) there was no evidence that fraud and corruption had actually taken place but they
should be treated as warning signals; (ii) SIG activities were implemented according to the agreed



                                                    9
procurement procedures; and (iii) there were some weakness on the School Grant Procurement
Handbook, which were addressed immediately.

Financial Management (FM) performance is rated by this evaluation as Moderately Satisfactory.
During early implementation, FM arrangements were rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) due to
internal control weaknesses identified by the auditors. The 2006 audit report qualified the Project
Financial Statements of the Dutch Grant NETH 52855. The report found seven cases of over payment
or double payments not based on an invoice from this grant, which amounted to EUR 14,669. The
audit report of 2005 also identified two other similar cases amounting to EUR 1,730. In addition,
several FMRs submitted to the Bank presented inaccuracies and the audit report at least in one case
was received with a four month delay. As a response to the recommendations of the 2005 and 2006
Audit Reports, the FM chapter of the Project Operations Manual chapter was updated and financial
internal controls for the Project were strengthened. The issue of erroneous payments was addressed
by the PCU by providing reduced payments to relevant suppliers. The quality of FMRs improved
gradually with the use of locally developed accounting software. From September 2007 onwards,
Bank supervision missions found that financial internal control issues had been properly addressed.
However, FM performance continued to be rated as MU due to issues related to the lack of
functionality of the accounting software. The FM performance was upgraded to Moderately
Satisfactory when the audit report for 2008 was received on time, was clean, and pointed out that
internal control issues which led to incorrect payments during previous years had been remedied.

The Bank’s share of the total project resources was 99.8 percent disbursed. A portion of the TF-
520855 (The Dutch government grant) of US$0.51 millions was not disbursed and therefore
cancelled.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase


Despite concerns about financial resources to support the sector, the FYR Macedonia
Government has shown willingness to continue to invest on education. Indeed, education remains
among the top five priorities of this Government. Via joint portfolio meetings, the Government has
expressed its desire to continue working with the Bank, especially to pursue the skills agenda. In line
with a Government’s request, a Bank-financed Technical Assistance for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 is
supporting MoES in making informed policy choices with regard to financing of Higher Education,
including establishment of bodies for external quality assurance in accordance with good practice and
European agreements and guidelines. Furthermore, the Country Partnership Strategy for FYR
Macedonia FY11-FY14 includes inclusion of all groups in pre-university education and quality
improvements of higher education, as one of its priorities. Another follow-up operation focusing on
education is listed in the menu of possible areas for future Bank support in fiscal years 2013-14,
which is likely to be discussed during the annual review of Government priorities.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Relevance of objectives, design, and implementation arrangements are rated High.

The relevance of the Project’s development objectives was high at the time of the preparation
and continues to remain high, as confirmed in the CPS FY11-FY14. The Project strived to
improve the quality of learning and participation at the targeted schools by strengthening school level
planning and management and improving equity of a decentralized education system and its
efficiency. Secondary schooling is now compulsory, but expanding access of low income and
vulnerable groups remain a challenge. While Roma children are under-represented at all levels of
education, additional work is needed to ensure the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal


                                                  10
of universal primary completion, as well as to increase the quality of education that marginalized
children receive. This has significant importance to ensure that these groups have adequate
achievements to go and thrive in the secondary education level. It is important to note that the
ongoing Bank-financed project on Conditional Cash Transfers (Loan 7735-MK) is providing
incentives to encourage enrollment and retention in secondary education for children from poor
families and marginalized groups. Furthermore, the national goal to become a “country of knowledge”
envisioned in the Government’s education strategy is to build on the ongoing reforms.

Project design was relevant and identified activities needed for education sector reform. It
considered the experience of the first Bank-supported Project in Macedonia and other countries
education reforms.

Project implementation maintained focus and responded to the needs of the sector. This was
facilitated by the fact that there was good consensus on the Project’s objectives from the
Government’s side as well as from several donors, demonstrated through government-donors
coordination activities. Other government initiatives such as the Computer for Every Child (CfEC)
Project, which initially had great government support but faced skepticism by the Bank’s team,
ultimately did not change the focus or scope of the Project, and despite some policy dialogue and
technical debate between the two, there was never a formal request to restructure the Project. Project
resources provided some support to the CfEC to enhance readiness of the school for the ICT
investments (electric supply, security, etc), without affecting the planned activities under the EMP.
Budget constraints caused the Government to cut the counterpart budget but this reduction did not
affect Project activities and outputs. Finally, the implementation arrangements were adequate, Project
resources were disbursed almost entirely, and all activities were completed.

At the same time, Project implementation varied with regards to dynamics and quality. The
main reasons for the inconsistencies in implementation were several political changes that ultimately
did not impact the overall commitment of the Government to project objectives. Project
implementation arrangements remained consistent, including the composition of the EMP Overall
Working Group and the PCU staff, whose commitment and diligent work safeguarded significant
implementation breaks. The Project has been considered by the Government and donor community as
the most important investment in the education sector in the last decade, and thus leveraged other
donor investments to the sector.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Overall achievements

This evaluation rates achievement of PDO as Moderately Satisfactory based on the following
considerations.

The Project’s development objectives were to improve the quality of learning and education
participation in targeted schools by strengthening school level planning and management, and to
improve equity and efficiency for a decentralized education system.

The ICR team reviewed all project indicators and concluded that while the revised indicators were
somewhat analogous to the original ones, they provided a better measuring of the PDO because they
were more specific and data was available. As such, those indicators guided this evaluation. Overall,
by Project completion one can argue that the Project had a positive impact on school planning, that
teachers’ skills have been enhanced through training, particularly making them more sensitive to
diverse learning styles, and that the overall learning environment had improved. Specifically:

Outcome I: Sixty percent of students achieve the minimum level of the PIRLS study.
Improvements in learning achievement as measured by PIRLS could not be appropriately measured.



                                                 11
PILRS was carried out in 2001 (baseline) and 2006, and it will be done again in 2011. The PIRLS
2006 assessment showed no improvements in reading literacy among 10 year old students; at the same
time, given that the loan became effective on April 23, 2004, this evaluation finds that any change in
these PIRLS results could not even be attributed to the Project. It is really not clear to the ICR team
why the Bank agreed to the introduction of this indicator when it was known that the next PIRLS
would not take place until after the Project was closed and thus there would be no indicators to
measure it. This was clearly an oversight on the part of those involved in this amendment. On the
other hand, the Matura 2008–2009 tests show an increase of top performers as well as a decrease of
low performers. Based on the same database, there is also evidence that minority groups had an
increase in performance. As such, using Matura results as an indicator of student performance, the
ICR team concluded that there is evidence of a positive trend in terms of student achievement in
Macedonia, thought it is not captured by PIRLS yet.

Outcome II: Increased net enrollment rate in primary education. There was no increase reported
in net enrolment rate (NER) in primary education during Project implementation. While in 2004 the
NER was 92.5 percent, by 2010 it was reported as 91 percent. One possible explanation for this
change, as argued by the Government, is the un-reliability of demographic data. Potential problems
with the demographic data include overestimation of the school-age group population and the fact that
a considerable number of students could have left the country, as movement to EU countries was
liberalised in 2008.

Outcome III: Drop-out rate in primary education was expected to be less than one percent
throughout the Project life. Based on reports from the National Statistical Agency at the time of
Project closure, drop-out rate was less than 0.5 percent, exceeding this outcome target value.

Outcome IV: Transition rates to secondary education were expected to be 98 percent. Transition
rates increased significantly from the baseline value of 85.3 percent to 95 percent between 2004 and
2009. This increase is probably the result of a parliamentary decision to make secondary education
mandatory, followed by pro-activity on the MoES’s part to attract youth to school. The proactively
measures included free textbooks for all students (supported also by EMP), free transportation to
schools outside a defined catchment area, and additional places in dorms.

Outcome V: Drop-out rate in secondary education was expected to be less than 1.5 percent. By
project closing, the drop-out rates had reached 0.72 percent- exceeding the outcome target value from
the baseline of 2.14 percent.

Outcome VI: Schools increased their focus on vulnerable groups of students providing teaching
by teachers trained in learning and teaching techniques in schools with larger number of Roma
students, and students with special needs. This objective was measured by how much of the School
Development Plan proposals focused on children with special needs. At the start of the Project, this
indicator was not systematically measured. At the time this ICR was prepared, 83 percent of SIG
benefitting schools financed training on interactive teaching methods, while 18 percent of schools
selected training to work with children with special needs. The ICR team considers that this outcome
indicator was achieved.

Outcome VII: Increase in non-salary expenditures. During fiscal year 2003 – 2009, the executed
non-salary expenditures has systematically increased from MKD 1.8 billion at Project start to MKD in
4.1 billion in 2008, according to the annual balance sheet of the MoES, as published in the Official
Gazette.

In addition to the above outcome indicators, the following specific project contributions have
laid the basis for continuous improvements in the education system in FYR Macedonia.

(i)     Consolidation of a three-stage quality assurance system at the pre-university level
        composed of school self-evaluation, followed by an integral evaluation performed by the


                                                  12
        State Education Inspectorate, and a nationally-administrated large-scale assessment of student
        achievements which produces data on quality of the education system at different levels.
        This system has contributed to the development of a decentralized monitoring and evaluation
        education system as a tool to policy makers at all levels to make more informed policy
        decisions.

(ii)    Establishment of a market for a demand-driven in-service teacher training, along with
        the criteria for accreditation and monitoring of teacher-training services. The training
        programs offered met 90 percent of schools priority training needs.

(iii)   Strengthening of school boards’ capacity to plan and implement their School
        Development Plans through two rounds of the SIG Program. Six hundred and seventy three
        (673) primary and secondary schools were awarded with grants ranging from US$5,000 to
        US$17,000 aimed at improving school infrastructure, providing teacher training, and teaching
        aids. According to the SEI evaluation report of the first SIG round, 83 percent of the visited
        schools had improved the quality of teaching and learning. The SEI evaluation report of the
        second SIG round pointed out that about two-thirds of the schools either fully or significantly
        achieved the objectives set in their School Improvement Plans.

(iv)    Development of an Education Management Information System that connects the
        Ministry with all primary and secondary schools and with the municipalities. The system
        has established a web-based application with school profile for each elementary and
        secondary school, with records of human resources, the school’s physical conditions
        (including equipment), and student statistics. The system was expected to process the data and
        provide prompt analysis on trends and comparisons on the participation of education, as well
        as implementation of decentralized education financing, but EMIS was not yet operational at
        Project closure, so this data was not available.

(v)     Improvement of the Ministry’s staff capacity for strategic planning through acquired
        technical advice and training. The first MoES Mid-term Strategic Plan was recently
        approved by the Minister. The Strategic Planning Unit established at the Ministry is now in
        place and will secure that education data collection and planning continues regularly. The
        strategy, the established unit, and EMIS will enable the Ministry’s officials to adopt education
        policies based on relevant information.


3.3 Efficiency


An economic analysis of the Project was not carried out as part of this ICR.

At the time of Project preparation there were no data available or any labor market surveys for
estimating education social and economic rates of return. FYR Macedonia had a high unemployment
rate compared to other countries in the region at the appraisal stage, so the Project estimated a social
rate of return to education similar to those in other middle income countries in 2000, across all levels.

More recent global studies have shown that the rate of return to schooling varies across levels of
education (Barro and Lee 2010). According to Barro and Lee, the estimated rate of return of an
additional year of schooling in the ECA region is around 10 percent higher in the secondary level and
17.9 percent higher in the tertiary level compared to primary level returns. Thus, it could be argued
that by increasing transition rates to secondary education of about 9,000 students, as well as
decreasing drop-out rates at the secondary level, the Project will eventually lead to higher earnings for
the beneficiary students and therefore higher standard of living for them.




                                                   13
The impact of the School Improvement Grants (SIG) component cannot be quantified but some
potential efficiency gains from it could be inferred. The SIG component targeted many schools
serving marginalized groups. This extra support helped to reduce the education equity gap. SIG also
directly encouraged the use of resources to foster more inclusive teaching techniques, and also
promoted greater community participation in school boards and school management. The experience
of other Bank-financed education projects has shown that school grants are often an effective way of
addressing specific school needs (responses are better targeted and the community is often able to
rationalize resources). Additionally, community participation promotes good governance and higher
transparency in the use of resources. Finally, it could be argued that by making schools more
responsive to student needs – particularly those who are often marginalized— the grants contributed
to student retention. However, there is no information on the impact of these grants in FYR
Macedonia to properly validate these gains.

The Macedonian Government implemented a reform for decentralization of the education system in
parallel and mutually supporting the EMP agenda. The education budget framework moved from a
traditional input-based into a per capita one, through a phased approach10. The Project contributed to
this through increased MoES capacity to operate into a decentralized sector, and to monitor and
evaluate the outputs and outcomes of the sector, through EMIS. Per capita financing reform brought
improvement in efficiency of use of public funds; however the efficiency gains deriving from this
reform could not be entirely attributed to the Project, nor could be quantified.



3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating for this project is based on the achievements of its development
objectives, as measured by the outcome indicators, as well as in recognition of the important
interventions it financed which have laid the foundations for continuous improving of the education
sector in FYR Macedonia. Overall, the Project contributed to increasing transition rates from primary
to secondary education, increasing secondary enrollment, and reducing drop-out rates at both primary
and secondary levels. While PIRLS results are not available, Matura results show a positive trend in
terms of student achievement, leading the ICR team to be optimistic that student learning has in fact
improved as a result of all these interventions. The Project also financed important inputs for
institutional strengthening, such as the development and implementation of an education MIS system,
setting up of criteria for accreditation and monitoring of teacher training, the establishment of a
national assessment system under an independent institute, as well as the training that accompanied
the implementation of school grants. Finally, under the Project non-salary education expenditure has
gone up.

Notwithstanding all the above achievements, the Project had a few shortcomings in terms of achieving
its objectives. Particularly, primary net enrollment rates have officially gone down. Furthermore,
Roma children continue to be under-represented at all levels of the education system, and there is no
evidence that the Project resulted in improvements in equity, as it sought to in its objectives. Finally,
two key interventions initiated under the Project – the School Improvement Grant instrument and the


10
   The decentralization of Macedonian Education sector devolved in stages. From 2005, maintenance functions (such as the
provision of heating, energy, materials and services) and the transport of students to school were decentralized to
municipalities, based on their historical costs. In 2006 the allocations were based on a formula that included a fixed basic
amount for each municipality and a variable amount based on enrollment, while allocation for teachers’ salaries was based
on the number of classes in schools and paid by the central government. Starting in January 2008 and on, the amount of the
grant was determined by a capitation-based formula. According to the Ordinance governing the distribution of the block
grant for elementary education, the formula consists of a lump sum for each municipality, plus a standard amount per pupil,
with additional adjustments for low density, students subject teaching classes (in primary) and students in vocational classes
(in secondary), and students with special needs.


                                                             14
In-Service Teacher Training - have their sustainability compromised by the lack of funding allocated
to them in the current budget. For this reason, our assessment is that this Project was Moderately
Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Project did not include any specific impact measurement on poverty or gender. At the same time,
the School Improvement Grant scheme, especially in its second round, was designed in a way to
target vulnerable children, especially Roma students, which directly contribute to break the poverty
and exclusion cycle among these children.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Project made a commitment to establish and strengthen strategic and financial planning within
the MoES through the setting up and support of two Units, the Strategic and Policy Unit (SPU) and
the Analytical Unit (AU). These measures helped to enhance planning systems and the strategic
capacity for the central and local governments to administer and manage education in a decentralized
environment. MoES institutional development was strengthened through two exercises - the
systematization of the MoES in 2006 as well as the functional review of MoES - which subsequently
caused the change of the MoES organizational structure, and the adoption of the mid-term Strategic
Development Plan of MoES, which is still being implemented.

Another notable achievement was the establishment of the State Examination Center as an
independent assessment agency, with cutting edge expertise in education assessments and exams
administration.

The school grant development concluded with institutionalization of the school based management,
including establishment of a school development planning system, policy and institutional instruments
to operationalise school grant implementation, a system to assess achievement at school level and
competitive school based teacher training scheme. All school masters, teachers and board members
were trained and can handle planning and procurement activities related to SIGs; now the door is open
to similar activities, provided financial support is secured for this at central, communal or school
levels.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
       N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The assessment of the risk to development outcome is rated as Moderate. This rate is given as a result
of the lack of required financial support from the current government budget for two key activities:
School Improvement Grant and In-service Teacher Training. Both of these programs were important
achievements under the Project. The Government needs to find ways to sustain its school based
activities for the marginalized students and communities targeted so far, to address specific diversity
of Macedonian society. The impressive achievement of the creation of the market for a continuous
teacher training for the country should be adequately and systematically supported, once the




                                                  15
interventions showed first successful results, and the enthusiasm of teachers and interest from system
players are still active.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The team worked
closely with the MoES in identifying key sector issues, defining a strategy on how to best address
those issues, and designing interventions appropriately. The team was guided by solid background
work such as a Bank’s Education Policy Note released in 200211 . In addition, EMP built on the
experience of other previous Bank experiences in the education sector and took into considerations
lessons learned.

The Bank was also successful in coordinating a bridge funding of EUR 300,000 with the Government
of the Netherlands, which contributed to finance technical assistance, Project coordination, as well as
to pilot the school planning/school improvement grants sub-component. More precisely, the Dutch
grant financed key Project preparation inputs such as public consultations, build institutional
mechanisms for Project planning and future implementation, technical assistance for key reforms,
piloting of SIG, etc.

At the same time, the ICR team notes two important weaknesses during Project preparation:
i)      Inadequacy of many outcome indicators to measure the Project’s development objective and
         lack of baselines for many indicators. As a result, supervision teams were unable to monitor
         progress on the basis of the indicators up until the indicators were amended.
ii)     Sustainability consideration for two interventions – School Improvement Grant and In Service
         Teacher Training (see section 2.5).

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The quality of Bank team supervision is rated as Satisfactory for reasons elaborated below.

The team demonstrated commitment and enjoyed strong relations with both counterpart and the co-
financier to build an understanding on reform options, and flag issues which could affect development
outcomes and project implementation. Furthermore, the team was proactive in identifying issues and
jointly addressing them with the Government on a timely manner. This good partnership was
demonstrated through numerous communications, technical discussions and joint events, field visits
and supervision missions.

The Bank team was led over time by four team leaders, each of them providing sound expertise on
Project operations, reform issues and policy advice on government efforts to strengthen education
outcomes. Despite the changes in leadership, the transition from one task team leader to the other
seemed to be smooth. The team organized supervision missions twice per year and prepared very
informative Aide Memoires. The Bank team was greatly strengthened by a locally hired education
specialist who demonstrated sound expertise of the education sector, and especially in the assessment
field. A Bank Policy Note on the use of computers for schools was prepared to serve as an input to




11
     “Toward an Education Strategy for the Twenty-First Century.” Report No. 24831-MK, July 1,002.


                                                            16
the Computer for Every Child initiative that the Government wanted to support; the note argued in
favor of maintaining the original focus of the Project.

The Bank was pro-active on fiduciary oversight especially in the high risk activities of the school
grants implementation. Indeed, this direct approach to financial management and procurement
oversight was instrumental to increased procurement and financial management performance of
schools staff and PCU. It greatly contributed to the increased trust that government officials, co-
financiers, teachers and parents had for the reliability, professionalism and transparency criteria
provided by SIG guidelines and procedures.

The Bank also fostered a strong partnership with the Dutch Government. MoES was among the few
ministries receiving extra support from donors, and therefore it was crucial that the Bank, as the main
player in the sector, encouraged a good cooperation atmosphere. Furthermore, a very good partnership
with other donors such as USAID, UNICEF, etc, was maintained, with MoES in the driving seat.

The one shortcoming of the Bank’s role at supervision is related to the revision of the monitoring
framework for the project. While the Bank addressed issues related to appropriateness of EMP Results
Framework and in 2007 agreed with the Government to revise it, it also overlooked the implications
of introducing an international student assessment as an outcome indicator. Introducing PIRLS results
as a PDO indicator was not adequate as the baseline used was from 2001, almost three years before
the Project became effective, and the only PIRLS assessment that could be used to measure progress
was from 2006 – taken at same year as MTR (Section 3.2), since the next PIRLS was planned for
2011, after the Project was already closed. In the end, the existing PIRLS data had, at best, limited
attribution to project supported activities, and the relevant indicator (2011 test results) was not
available at project closing. This is a significant oversight on the part of the Bank’s team and it is not
clear to the ICR team how this occurred.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Following the “Harmonized Evaluation Criteria for ICR and OED Evaluations” the overall Bank
performance for this Project is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. This evaluation finds that Bank’s
performance was Moderately Satisfactory at the preparation phase and Satisfactory during
supervision. A fruitful partnership with the Borrower led to a smooth technical and institutional
collaboration during both stages. Effective planning and Project design attracted support from other
players culminating with the pledge of almost EUR 10 million to complement the Project financial
needs. Technical expertise was engaged to support the Borrower in reform launching and
implementation. Pro-activity was observed in many cases when issues were identified and addressed
promptly. At the same time, there were important weaknesses with the results monitoring indicators
at the time of preparation, as well as lack of a more robust consideration of the sustainability of some
of the interventions at the post-completion phase.

5.2 Borrower Performance


(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Borrower performance during preparation and implementation is rated as Satisfactory.
The two administrations in power during Project preparation and implementation showed ownership
and commitment to the Project’s development objectives. More importantly, Parliament approved the
legal instruments pertaining to basic and secondary education which stipulates some of the EMP
achievements such as teacher training scheme, institutional arrangements for education quality



                                                   17
assurance, external assessment system, indicators for schools self-evaluation, transparency measures,
etc.

Moreover, the Government pushed through the decision to turn the secondary education into a
compulsory program, contributing to the achievement of the development objective of increasing
enrollment rate to secondary education. This decision, which directly supported project objectives,
resulted in additional costs for the education system (free textbooks provisions, dormitories for
secondary school attendees, school bus and teachers’ salaries) which were financed entirely by the
Government. In addition, the Government established one independent institution from MoES to
serve as the National Assessment Body.

Government education objectives remained un-changed throughout the Project life, although a
national program on Computer per Every Child diverted in the short-term the Government’s attention
and resources.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall, the MoES’s implementation performance is rated as Satisfactory. Notwithstanding its
leadership and management changes, the MoES did not lose its level of commitment and pace of
activities. MoES showed strong will to reform and transform itself, and managed to build – at the
benefit of Project objectives - two highly specialized units – Analysis and Strategic Planning and
Strategic Development Plan, so to ensure education sector management effectiveness.

MoES showed strong ownership toward the Project through: (i) an open discussion about the EMP
scope and planned activities, prior to the ratification of the Law on the loan, within the
Parliamentarian Committee for Education, Science and Sport; (ii) ensuring that the Education
Decentralization Concept Paper benefited from extensive consultations with a broad constituency; and
(iii) establishing high-level institutional arrangements for the EMP steering, monitoring and
evaluation bodies.

The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) deserves considerable credit for keeping Project activities
moving forward. In general, the PCU demonstrated persistence and creativity in solving the issues,
by providing close follow-up, just-in-time training and proposing revision of operational guidelines
when needed. Contract management and fiduciary issues were judged to be adequate by Bank
standards. Some irregularities flagged by audit reports and a procurement review of SIG activities
received immediate follow-up from the PCU. The PCU prepared very thorough and professional
progress reports, which were a valuable source for documenting reforms activities. Another positive
aspect of PCU activity was the good public awareness strategy which included information and
familiarization meetings and an EMP monthly newsletter.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Borrower performance is rated as Satisfactory. The Borrower ensured good participation
at Project preparation, maintained focus on the reform activities, and provided active and productive
political commitment towards the achievement of the PDOs The MoES, State Examination Center,
schools, and other levels of management all gained considerable capacity, making sure a critical mass
of technical expertise remains in place to further education excellence in FYR Macedonia.

6. Lessons Learned

Adequacy of international tests as project outcome indicators needs to be considered carefully.
The use of international student assessments as outcome indicators should be considered cautiously,



                                                 18
particularly in favor of other alternatives under the Government’s direct control. The use of such tests
raises concerns of attribution and their timing is beyond the control of the Government. In the case of
FYR Macedonia, PIRLS was selected as an instrument to proxy the education outcomes achieved
through the Project. However, the application cycle of PIRLS was not consistent with the Project’s
implementation period –the baseline data was from 2001, about three years before the Project started,
and the next testing data was from 2006 (about two years into implementation), hardly any time for
the interventions in the education sector to be reflected into gains in student achievements. Further,
the next PIRLS is scheduled to take place in 2011, more than one year after the Project closed, and
results will not be available until 2012. Additionally, PIRLS covers a broader universe than the
targeted schools under the Project. The Macedonian national examination machinery was functional
since 2007 and may have been a better way to monitor progress.

Activities targeting the out-of-school children might be included for education projects aiming
at enrolment increases. While the Project targeted very well in-school vulnerable children through
In-service Teacher Training and School Improvement Grants, thus seeking to prevent school drop-out,
the children who had already dropped out of school were not targeted at all. These groups need
special programs to be re-integrated into schools, which starts from out-reach activities, cooperation
between school- communities, time and content flexible educational programs for diverse age-groups
and specific teacher skills that would help them cope with complex issues of these excluded
categories. Community education could better respond to local realities and cultural differences. As
such, education projects that aim at increasing education participation of marginalized groups need to
expand the scope of their interventions to look into alternative ways of attracting out of school
children and youth back to school, as well as strategies to retain them.

A participatory approach is a key element to the successful implementation of an education
project which has at its core decentralization, and community participation. Almost all bigger
decisions in the EMP were adopted at a forum attended by various groups: MoES, Bureau for
Development of Education, State Examination Institute, schools, municipalities, business sector, and
trade unions. In addition, parents and students were part of the decision making process especially
during the schools development planning process and Matura dissemination. One of the important
tools to disseminate information was the regular EMP news monthly publication, which served to
inform on project objectives, activities and achievements. This approach generated commitment and
support in the implementation of activities and it was crucial for successful and undisturbed
finalization of the Project.

A focused design enhances the likelihood of a project succeeding. The Project had important
development objectives and strategic goals, yet the design was simple and focused only in a few but
really key systemic improvements that would have at the end - as proved - a concrete impact on the
areas targeted under the Project.

Successful management of modern educational systems and related effective policies are
strongly related to a culture of monitoring routines at all levels. In many projects like EMP, the
investment in EMIS is limited to improvements in information technology systems, and insufficient
attention is paid to the creation of an institutional culture of data reporting and management.
Strengthening of technical capacities should be supported by creating the data demand and by rooting
a culture of open communication, data exchange and data application.

Sustainability of new interventions needs clear fiscal analysis at start up. After establishing an
effective in-service teacher training in FYR Macedonia, including training providers and designing
procedures, the challenge to its continuation remains its financing. The analysis on the required
resources to maintain this system should have been completed before project closure, in order to help
MoES to plan resources, and guide the policy dialogue with MoES.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners


(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies

The Government of Macedonia, through a letter dated June 6, 2011, informed the Bank that it had
reviewed this document and accepted its conclusions. Their contribution to the ICR is included in
Annex 7 of this document.

( b)    Co financiers

The ICR team met with representatives of the Dutch Embassy in Skopje who shared the opinion that
Project implementation went smoothly with the exception of some fiduciary concerns with the
procurement under school grants, which were addressed on time. Additionally, the Dutch team raised
the issue of the school selection criteria, which according to them could have been more needs- based

                                           By PCU/MoES

Rationale

The Government of FYR Macedonia is committed to fighting poverty and developing and prospering
economy through reforms and investments in the sectors related to the development of human
potential. The Project start, the consensus about the nature of the reforms was restricted by the social
and ethnic differences, the excessively politicized events of public interest and the lack of capacity in
the public administration. The Government inherited a long and unproductive process of defining a
poverty reduction strategy and development of an efficient education strategy.

Undoubtedly there was a need to improve the education. Still, the expectations were very different
and were based on the different categories to which different people belonged. One common
denominator was the need to reform education management and administration which had been overly
centralized. Questions were raised regarding capability of the system to adapt to the varying needs
and demographic trends. The status quo situation could have lead to inequalities and inefficiencies
both with respect to the education quality as well as the fund allocation and utilization.

Project objectives and key indicators

The Government of FYR Macedonia, through the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES)
received a loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD, World
Bank) as well as grant from the Government of the Netherlands to provide support to the Education
Modernization Project (EMP).

The purpose of the investment was to contribute to the achievement of the main strategic priorities of
the Government including: 1) Preparation of the country for the process of accession to the European
Union; 2) Successful implementation of the constitutional changes arising from the framework
agreement and decentralization; 3) Improved social policy; 4) Development of the private sector and
creation of new jobs.

In addition, the Education Modernization Project fully fitted into the main strategic goals for the
education in Macedonia determined by the MoES and contributed to the achievement of those goals
through the following: 1) Provision of support to the efforts of the Government for decentralization of
the education sector; 2) Increasing the access to education of the most vulnerable groups of society; 3)
Improving the quality of learning and the relevancy of education; 4) Increasing school effectiveness;
and 5) More efficient distribution of the funds and improving education results.

Description of Project components

The Project had three components: 1) improvement of quality and participation, 2) building capacities
for decentralized education, and 3) Project management and monitoring and evaluation.

The first two components were designed to support the decentralized education administration and
management, as well as to enable schools to better focus on the key policy expectations, including the
improvement of quality, significance, equality, efficiency and transparency. The third one focused on
Project management issues per se.

Component 1: Improvement of education quality and participation




                                                   30
The objective of this component was to improve the quality of teaching and education participation in
the target schools by strengthening school level planning and management, on the job teacher training
and by implementing the school improvement grant program. The Project had these subcomponents:

Subcomponent 1.1 School planning and development.
This subcomponent primarily focused on the effectiveness of the schools, which is of central
importance for the improvement of education quality, relevancy and participation. The programs of
this component included staff training to perform self evaluation and planning and implement small
school improvement grants. The schools were authorized and trained to: perform self evaluation based
on general standards for school effectiveness; measure student performance through formative
assessments; to establish school development plans; receive on the job teacher training by multiple
providers; and, involve the community through the School Board in the monitoring or the work and
the evaluation process.

Subcomponent 1.2 School Improvement Grants.
The schools that voluntarily implemented School Self Evaluations (SSE) and prepared School
Development Plans (SDP) were entitled to submit grant applications through the School Improvement
Grant Program (SIG). The schools received technical assistance in the methodologies for preparing
school development plans and grant applications.

The SIGs helped in achieving some of the goals established by the central government, including the
introduction of the “zero” year in primary education, or introduction of curricula based Matura
examinations in the secondary education. Furthermore the SIG supported investments in the
categories of unrecoverable costs, including provision of on the job teacher and staff training.
Although all schools had the right to participate in the grant program, still the poorer schools with
limited management capacities received additional assistance to become eligible for the grant.

Subcomponent 1.3 Assessment in education.
This subcomponent helped implement both school based (formative) assessment and external
(national and international) assessment for the purposes of monitoring the quality improvement in the
schools during Project implementation. The Bureau for Development of Education (BDE) and later
National Examination Center (NEC) conducted the external assessment and provided instructions for
development of school capacities to conduct formative assessment. They developed examination
standards such as the Matura.

The Project also strengthened the State Education Inspectorate (SEI) to develop standards on school
effectiveness and develop competent capacities to monitor, as well as overtake the lead role in the
approval and monitoring of the school improvement grants.

Subcomponent 1.4 In Service Teacher Training.
 This subcomponent introduced an accreditation system to ensure that the on-the-job teacher training
services were provided by multiple providers and that all providers met the appropriate training
quality standards. The system instructed the schools to use the SIG resources and processed for
training from these training providers.

Component 2: Building capacities for decentralized education
This component improved the systems and capacities related to the functioning of a decentralized
education system, including improvement of strategic planning, managing and monitoring
performance and the accountability procedures in the education sector. Considering the limited
planning and management capacities and the overly centralized administration, additional
competences of the education administration units were introduced in several phases.

Subcomponent 2.1 Strategic and financial planning.
This subcomponent supported building of capacities in the MoES for strategic and financial planning
by forming and supporting two units: a Strategy and Policy Unit and an Analytical Unit. This


                                                 31
strengthened the planning and strategic systems and capacities of the central and local authorities to
administer and manage education in a decentralized environment.

Subcomponent 2.2 Education Management Information System (EMIS).
The focus of this subcomponent was on the development and maintenance of EMIS – an instrument
designed to monitor the implementation of the education and its results (based on established
standards and indicators), as well as the flow of funds which would help strengthen the cooperation
between all policy and operational levels. EMIS was to provide the required information and
analytical capacities for decentralized management of the education systems at all levels; to be used
for projections as well as to inform decision making; to increase the decision making flexibility and
will help apply the acquired experiences related to improving policy decisions. This subcomponent
included technical support, hardware, software, as well as goods and services on central, regional and
municipal levels.

Component 3: Project management and monitoring and evaluation
The objective of this component was to provide full coordination and supervision of pactivities, and to
ensure the highest quality through monitoring and evaluation of the Project indicators.

Main Project beneficiaries

The main indirect Project beneficiaries are all the students in primary and secondary education (in the
period of the first cycle of the grant program, the number of these students was 324,244, while during
the second round the number of students was 155,055)  that benefited from: teacher training and
improved teaching and learning conditions.

Still the main direct beneficiaries of the Project were the teachers in primary and secondary education
(about 27,000 of them), the school directors (427), the central institutions MoES and BDE that
acquired new knowledge about teaching, school organization and management, improved data
collection and better planning.

Project Design, Implementation Arrangements

Project design assessment

The Project design provided for a multifaceted approach to the improvement of the quality of the
teaching and learning. Namely, the grant program encouraged schools to adopt a systematic approach
to the self evaluation and development planning. Through the training support to implement this
process, as well as the procurement of the necessary trainings, equipment and infrastructure the
schools were encouraged to prepare a systematic self reflection, i.e. to implement the process of self
evaluation and prepare a plan to improve the identified weaknesses.

This process was implemented in three stages, starting from the pilot stage which involved the
establishment of the system, followed by the first phase involving the inclusion of all primary and
secondary schools, and concluding with the second round of competitive school grants.

On the other hand, series of measures and activities for external evaluation of the schools were
undertaken. The interest in this segment focused on the SEI as an authority responsible for assessing
school effectiveness.

The third aspect followed as an addition to the self evaluation and the external assessment and
involves assessment of the effectiveness through student performance. The EMP was designed in a
way that helped external assessment through the implementation of the Matura exam and participation
in international external assessments.




                                                  32
Institutional organization

The implementing agency for this Project was the MoES. In order to achieve the goals of the Project,
the MoES formed the following bodies that were accountable to the MoES: Project Coordination Unit
to coordinate the Project activities and Advisory Groups which were responsible for the entire policy
management of the Project components.

After the Project activities were made operational, these groups and bodies also changed. The initial
planning groups stopped functioning one year after their first meetings and instead of these bodies, the
role of the EMP Project Collegium was strengthened. This Collegium was composed of the Project
director, the education advisor and, on an as needed basis, the procurement specialist and the financial
management specialist from the EMP, as well as the MoES representatives such as the State
Secretary, the MoES Project advisors (Decentralization Advisor, Teacher Training Advisor and
School Efficiency Improvement Advisor). The Collegium discussed all pending issues of the EMP
and convened at least once per month. This body functioned during the period from 2004 to 2006.

In 2006, the EMP Collegium was replaced by a working group for the overall EMP activities. This
group was composed of representatives from all sectors and departments involved in the EMP
activities. The working group operated until the end of the Project.


A summary of Project progress and results by components

Main phase of the grant program – implementation and results

Having seen the experiences of the pilot phase, all primary and secondary schools got involved in the
implementation of the main phase. The Republic of Macedonia was subdivided into 7 regions with
RBEs in Skopje, Kumanovo, Ohrid, Prilep, Shtip and Strumica. Twelve schools at a time were
involved from each region within one round. It took six cycles to involve all of the schools.

Two representatives from each school that participated in the development planning seminars
replicated the training in their schools with the assistance of the outreach officers. This was followed
by the preparation and submission of the documents to the RBE for approval. This included the
following documents: school self evaluation, school development plans and school development
proposals. This lasted for 6 months while the implementation took 1 year.

The total maximal funds per school were determined in accordance with a formula. The funds for the
primary schools were calculated using the following formula: US$ 7000 per legal entity + US$ 1500
for a satellite school + US$ 9 per student and for the secondary schools: US$ 10,000 per legal entity
and US$12 per student. The investment constraints referred to the conditions to invest at least 30
percent for staff development and at most 40 percent for infrastructure. The remaining funds were for
equipment.

The discussion regarding the realization of the new round of grants began in March 2007 with the
preparation of a short document which emphasized the opportunities and the dilemmas as to the way
forward. The document was first discussed in the overall EMP activities working group. Then a
questionnaire was sent to the schools and the process ended with a workshop involving focus groups
comprising representatives from municipalities, representatives of the nongovernmental sector that
have a vested interest in education and the school directors. The final solution was approved by the
Minister and it was close to the standpoints of the school directors and the nongovernmental
organizations that spoke about positioning the entire system on a competitive basis, but also providing
advantages to certain types of schools.




                                                  33
National assessment

In November 2006, a national assessment was conducted to assess student performance in 4th grade in
the subjects of nature and society. At the same time, testing was conducted in the subjects of
Macedonian language, Albanian language and Mathematics for 8th grade. The test involved about
2000 test booklets in mathematics and about 1400 test booklets in the other subjects. After the entry
of the results from the tests and questionnaires, three types of data analysis were made for each
subject: classical data analysis of the test data using the TIA-plus program, item calibration and item
scaling for all areas covered by the two subjects, as well as a data analysis of the data from the
questionnaires for the students, teachers and directors using the SPSS. The reports were distributed to
the schools.

In May 2007 the Student performance Assessment Sector (SPAS), for all 5 subjects, organized and
implemented a seminar on the topic “Procedure of establishment of standards in national
assessments.” For that purpose working groups were formed comprising 20 teachers for each subject,
the procedures were conducted and student performance standards were defined for: Macedonian,
Albanian language and mathematics in the 8th grade, nature and society in the 4th grade on national
level.

On 12th December 2007, the Final Conference for National Assessment was held with about 90
participants. The 5 reports on student performance were promoted at the conference. The analysis of
the results from the external examinations within the State Matura for all three years of
implementation suggests that in 2010 there is a mild improvement of student performance in
comparison to 2008 and 2009. This, among other things, is an indicator of the improvement of the
basic knowledge and adaptation to the requirements and standards of the State Matura. In the area of
mother tongues, most significant improvements were noted in the Albanian language and literature.
On the other hand, among the students that took foreign language exams, a slight drop was noted due
to the improved level of control during the exams.

International assessments

Testing reading literacy (PIRLS): After having translated the instruments and manuals, the
pretesting reading literacy (PIRLS) was implemented in 2005 and involved a population of 2000
students in the 4th grade of primary education. The main PIRLS testing was realized in 2006. The
results suggest that the Republic of Macedonia was on the 38th place on the international performance
scale out of a total of 45 participating countries. 37 countries had significantly higher results than
Macedonia and only 6 countries had significantly lower results. The PIRLS study had 4 levels of
accomplishments. The low level was attained by 66 percent of the Macedonian students, the average
level was attained by 40 percent of the students, the high level was attained by 15 percent, and the
advanced level by 2 percent of the Macedonian students.

TIMSS-R: The TIMSS-R 2003 report for the performance of Macedonian students in mathematics
and science studies provided professional information for the wider public about student performance
in these subjects, the factors that influenced performance, as well as the position of the students from
FYR Macedonia at the end of the primary education on international level.

The results from the test of the knowledge in mathematics (30th place) and natural sciences (31st place)
out of a total of 45 participating members could be assessed as more than poor. Out of 19 European
countries the Republic of Macedonia ranked lowest with respect to student performance. Lower
results than Macedonia were demonstrated by the participants from the African countries, some Asian
countries and Chile. Considering the results, Macedonia’s position in 1999 and 2003 was about the
same.

Teacher Training System Reform



                                                  34
Pilot phase – analysis of the training needs and training selection: The teachers training needs of
all 10 pilot schools in their self evaluation were analyzed and grouped in 5 areas. After publishing the
standard advertisement for election of consultants (in January 2005), out of a total of 64 firms
interested to provide training and applied with a total of 102 programs (8 foreign and 94 local), 4
firms were selected for the five areas.
          
Analysis of the needs for and preparation of the call for the schools from the 1st and 2nd: The
international expertise, the detailed analysis of the school self evaluation documents and the meeting
(October ’05) held with the group of 20 directors of primary and secondary schools in the Republic of
Macedonia, served as a basis to define the criteria for selection of the on the job teacher training
providers and the possible training areas. This was followed by a preparation of a call for application
for the interested providers (January 2006).

Two documents were keys in the definition of the selection procedures and criteria for training
providers and programs: Manual and Criteria for Selection of Providers and Programs and Procedures
for Selection of Providers and Programs in the pilot phase.

The selection procedures comprised two steps. The first step – pre-selection included an overview of
the capacities of the provider to provide effective training. The second step, the selection, involved an
assessment of the quality of the proposed staff and the price. The pass threshold was 75 percent.

Analysis of the training needs and preparation of a new call for providers and programs and
accreditation of the schools in the 3rd – 6th round: During the period from April to May 2006, a
more comprehensive analysis of the training needs was performed. Questionnaires were sent to all
428 schools, and 256 (60 percent) of them completed and returned the questionnaire. These schools
have 8,709 classes with 206,184 students and 12,191 teachers.
         
Analysis and new call for the primary schools that competed for grants: The new questionnaire
and analysis of the training needs answered the question whether the offered defined topics according
to the national programs and priorities of the country have been identified as needed. The process of
data collection was implemented between March and June 2008. The questionnaire was sent to 425
schools, while the analysis was based on questionnaires of 255 schools (210 primary and 45
secondary schools). These schools have 8,196 classes and a total of 179,927 students and 11,645
teachers.

In April 2009, after having made some modifications to the Call for Service and Training providers,
the BDE also published an advertisement for service and training providers in the public media. The
most important modifications in the call comprised the following: 1) instead of requiring at least 3 or
5 trainers for each program provided, now the requirement was 10. 2) the time allotted for preparation
of the documentation was reduced to 25 instead of 45 days, 3) the organization that applied were
required to have credit worthiness of about 10,000 EUR.

Other outputs

Free textbooks for primary and secondary education: EMP also helped with the MoES Project
involving free textbooks because it fits in the first Project development objective, i.e. the
Improvement of education quality and participation. The assistance comprised financial assistance to
print and distribute part of the textbooks.

Transformation of the State Education Inspectorate:With EMP support, the State Education
Inspectorate has implemented several significant capacity building activities for decentralized
education system and the process of preparation of the new Law was initiated and supported by
EMP.
 



                                                   35
BDE Transformation: A new BDE Law was adopted in the Assembly of RM in the spring of 2006,
in line with EMP recommendations. The main changes applied to: externally prepared plans and
curricula as well as research (this was changed in the later amendments), external on job teacher
training through the process of accreditation of the training providers as well as strengthening of the
BDE advisors in the promotion of quality in the schools.

School capacity building: In the first round of grants, in a period of almost two years, around 850
school representatives took part in development planning trainings. The training lasted for 6 days. In
the second round of grants, in one month, around 650 school representatives participated in trainings
on preparation of application for support of development planning process. If we add the on job
trainings realized by field support and BDE representatives, the scope of school support was
significant. The questionnaires distributed to the schools before the grant and after one year showed
significant progress in capacity building/development and sustainability either among the school
principals or in the group of teachers who have completed this questionnaire.

Capacity building in the municipalities: Due to limited procurement capacities of PCU and the
permanent increase of the number of schools that were included in the procurement process, PCU had
initiated discussions with the municipalities, and based on the mechanisms in place for functioning of
REBs, signed contracts with seven municipalities across the country, offering them cooperation. All
seven municipalities accepted this offer for cooperation and appointed municipal staff that would be
trained by PCU in procurement aspects of the school grants. Then, they provided support to the
schools in their regions in the implementation of the procurement procedures. Representatives of the
municipalities participated in all bodies within EMP.

EMIS: A working group was established to support implementation of EMIS and with assistance by
the consultants hired prepared EMS basic documents. User Requirements Specifications (URS)
included the correct user requirements of the EMIS stakeholders in order to remove the gap in the
formulation of the plans and curricula as well as in the administration, monitoring and evaluation and
to allow gathering of sufficient amount of information and data in order to enable decisions based on
knowledge on all management levels (school, municipality, central). Financial Requirements
Specification (FRS) document’s goal was to convert the user requirements in functions which should
be provided within EMIS. Technical Requirements Specification (TRS) is the document that included
the minimum technical requirements which should be fulfilled in order to build a relevant EMIS.
These three documents formed the base for defining of the engagement conditions. This was followed
by a selection of a firm with which a contract for implementation of the activities was signed. The
relevant bodies for monitoring of the system building were established in MoES. The hired firm
delivered the hardware and Human Resources Module component and the EMIS component was
commissioned in the spring of 2010.

Monitoring and evaluation – design, implementation and use

The Project has designed the M&E system which collected data in order to make informed decisions
and to monitor the Project implementation. Several indicators were harmonized at Project level, while
other indicators were harmonized for any of the components in order to measure the progress. Project
progress reports were prepared every six months and described the main events and drew conclusions
for the future.

Influence of the Project on the implementation of MoES reforms

EMP had a significant contribution in the decentralization of the education in Macedonia through its
activities relating to the school autonomy and development. Namely, the EMP components for school
development planning empowered the local level to bring the decision making process closer to the
education service providers i.e. the schools. The school development grant program involved a
process which begins with self-evaluation, continued with relevant development plans and

consequently finances the proposals for school development. The activities, as well as all the solution
in this process are planned and implemented by the schools with an active role of all stakeholders in
the school level education process: students, parents, teachers, school board, and parents’ council. The
questionnaires which were filled in by the schools state about the improved self-confidence of the
schools for management in decentralized environment.

Work in decentralized environment also means stronger central institutions, but with slightly changed
roles. EMP contributed to the roles ri-definitions and capacity building as needed. For example, the on
job teacher training market encouraged demand-led-activities and changed the BDE role, while
strengthening the role of the local levels in the formulation of their own needs and programs needed.
Thus, it neutralized the traditional centralist role of BDE as unique agency for teacher training service
provision.

Considerations on the WB and Government Partnership

The Bank role during the duration of EMP was especially constructive and of great assistance. WB
helped the activities and provided mild but permanent encouragement for continued activities. Its
supervision missions presented a beautiful possibility for deepening of the discussions and finding
most adequate solutions for the current problems. In May 2006, a Bank team conducted a Midterm
review of the Education Modernization Project. The review result showed that significant changes
were not necessary in order to achieve the Project development goals, illustrating this way the fact
that the Project design and its arrangements were still relevant. However, the review indicated that it
is necessary to revise the EMP performance indicator, which were revised and formally adopted in
2007 with exchange of letters between the Minister of Education and WB. It is worth notifying that
that the WB role has changed and adapted during EMP implementation in terms of the intensity and
content of the support.

Project impact on the Structure and Sustainability if EMP-supported activities

To work in a decentralized working conditions means strengthening of the central institutions and
change of their role. The same, the implementation of the grant program, introduction of matura and
implementation of the activities for improved strategic planning also meant a relevant institutional
structure i.e. institutional support. For these reasons, the role of several institutions including SEI and
BDE changed under direct influence of EMP.

Namely, in order to respond to the challenges the following intuitional changes happened:
 SEI took the competence to monitor and evaluate the education quality,
 Two new sectors have been established in BDE: Professional development sector –which was put
   in charge to create a systematic approach to the professional development of the teachers, and
   Student Performance Assessment Sector (SPAC) – which was put in charge to operate the
   national exams,
 The SPAC transformed from BDE department into an independent State Examination Center
   (SEC), and was provided with working space in a form of new building with high safety and
   protection standards as well as the necessary technical equipment,
 In order to improve the analytical capacities of MoES, the already established Analytical Unit was
   up-graded into a Planning and Development Department and the department started to manage
   EMIS,
 EMP had strong impact on the schools. School based permanent team are established and operate
   everywhere such as Teacher Professional Development team, Monitoring and Evaluation of
   School Development Plans, and Procurement.

Lessons Learned

Ownership: MoES, BDE and SEC representatives, representatives of the schools, municipalities,
business and trade unions participated in all important consultations and practically in all bigger
decision under. PCU retained some authority only in the fiduciary functions, while allowed other
bodies to perform at their full capacity. PCU produced regular monthly Project information
dissemination, which kept everybody on the loop. This support for the implementation of activities
was key for successful and undisrupted finalization of the Project.

Design for success: The Project design was directed rightly so toward a systematic approach for
improvement of the education quality, but yet had strong focus on few activities which were key to
Project outcomes.

Stability for success: The key EMP/PCU staff was not changed during the Project, so the capacities
were retained and developed further, and smoothed the effects from political changes.

EMIS – culture of data exchange: For successful management of the modern education systems it is
necessary to have effective policies and system monitoring through data and information. Due to that,
the FYR Macedonia, like many other countries in the world decided to make significant investments
in collecting, processing and management of as many as possible data through relevant education
management information system. However, in most of the cases, EMIS investments were limited to
efforts to improve the information technology and/or data storage and management, and insufficient
attention was paid to the management environment in which EMIS operates and to the use of data for
decision making purposes. In addition to IT, for successful implementation of EMIS it is necessary to
pay special attention to the organizational and institutional preconditions which should be met in
order to provide effective education system management through decision making based on
information and data.

Simultaneously, building of technical capacities should be followed with creation of information
demand and maintaining a culture of open communications, information exchange and utilization
thereof.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


Comments received from USAID

The collaboration between USAID and the World Bank in the area of education has been very
collegial and fruitful in the past several years. As a result of the exemplary cooperation and close
relations with the host government, USAID, the World Bank (through the Education Modernization
Project), and UNICEF, earned a reputation in the country as highly respected partners, who truly
understand education and targets the most important areas of intervention.

Few of the examples for a synergy among the three partners are the following: when the Minister of
Education and Science (MoES), Nikola Todorov, proposed establishing an Academy for Professional
Development and Certification of Teachers (APDCT) and commissioned lawyers to draft a Law on
APDCT, the three organizations jointly discussed the idea and made an analysis of the situation. The
consultations with other experts we engaged in confirmed our opposition for the idea. We decided to
write a joint letter to the Minister of Education and present our arguments against the establishment of
the agency and proposed other viable alternatives. As a result of the prompt reaction and the
unanimous voice of USAID, WB and UNICEF, the MoES stopped any further actions with the
Academy.

Another example of excellent collaboration is the registration of Macedonia for the 2011 international
test Trends in International Math and Science Study (TIMSS). Macedonia has been severely criticized
in the education community for its absence from the international tests of student knowledge. Once
again, as a result of intensive exchange among the three institutions and multiple meetings with the
Minister of Education, MoES agreed to register for the 2011 TIMSS and the three institutions agreed
to support the costs.

The cooperation between the USAID project Primary Education Project (PEP) and the Education
Modernization Project (EMP) has been permanent and complementary. Both project implementation
teams have cooperated intensively to avoid overlaps and maximize resources and know-how. The
most prominent example was the synergistic work in the area of school infrastructure improvements
as well as the State Education Inspectorate capacity building.



Comments received from UNICEF

UNICEF has maintained close collaboration with the Bank and USAID to ensure synergy and
complementary of interventions supported by the different organizations.  One concrete initiative
includes the cooperation in the area of teacher professional development. In response to the low
learning achievements in the area of numeracy and literacy UNICEF introduced a teacher training
program in early grades for numeracy and literacy while ensuring that the process of training
remained consistent with the principles and the approach established as part of the in-service training
of the EMP.


The baseline study produced at the beginning of the program in both numeracy and literacy was
developed in close consultation with WB. This analysis provided insight into the causes of such low
learning achievements and set the basis for measuring the impact of the program.
