"Final", "loan_no": "7190", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Education Reform Project\n            for Paraguay were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was also highly moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned include: the stability\n            existing within the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC)\n            authorities throughout the entire lending and implementation\n            cycles (up to August 15, 2008) created the required\n            conducive environment by limiting shifts in education policy\n            and implementation strategy and of changes in key\n            implementation players. On the other hand, the revision and\n            appropriation of the ongoing project by the new education\n            authorities resulted in a temporary delay of project\n            activities. Ensuring implementation readiness conditions\n            prior to negotiations leads to a more effective and timely\n            physical and financial execution cycle. The delays in\n            physical and financial implementation experienced by this\n            project, especially in the period 2004-2006, could have been\n            mitigated, had the Bank team and management ensured\n            appropriate implementation readiness conditions at the time\n            of appraisal, especially in the case of the acquisition of\n            learning goods, construction of schools and CDEs (State\n            (Department) Education Council - Consejo Departamental de\n            Educacion), the alternative secondary education modality and\n            the in-service teacher training, just to mentioned some\n            examples. The logical chain that links project activities\n            and outputs to the project outcomes should be clear and\n            include all factors that are present in that chain. Even\n            though project outputs which are under the influence/control\n            of the project have been achieved the logical chain may have\n            overlooked other factors that are important to produce the\n            desired project outcomes. Even though outputs have been\n            achieved the desired outcome may not achieved due to\n            incomplete logical chain. Cost-benefit analysis is required\n            during the design of a project to avoid the inclusion of\n            cost ineffective interventions like the prototype schools\n            and have the appropriate technical arguments to debate\n            design options."}, "docdt": "2010-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
