1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Macroeconomic situation. Compared with other countries in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC)
region at the time of project preparation, Paraguay registered some of the lowest economic growth
patterns, highest income distribution inequalities and striking levels of poverty. The average per-capita
income growth in Paraguay in the period 1980-2000 was only 0.4 percent of the average growth
registered for the LAC region during the same time-period. Although Paraguay had improved income
inequalities during the nineties, the income Gini coefficient at the time of appraisal (2003) was 58
percent, as compared to 54.9 percent for Chile, 51.3 for Argentina, 46.1 for Mexico and 44.9 for Uruguay
for the same year. About 13.8 percent of the total population in Paraguay in 2003 was poor (earning
US$2 or less a day) as compared to 8.5 percent in Brazil and 7.1 in Argentina.

Basic education reform background. In June 2001, the Government of Paraguay (GOP) was
implementing the Basic Education Reform launched in 1994 with the financial and technical support of
the World Bank (Bank) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). This Reform aimed to expand
mandatory free basic education to nine grades including six of primary followed by three years of lower
secondary1, improve its quality, establish systems to measure student learning performance and improve
sector planning. The reform was gradually implemented one grade per year. Thus, by 2003, the year this
project was taken to the Board, the GOP was ready to undertake some improvements in secondary
education (grades 10 to 12).

Significant gains were achieved before the start of the preparation cycle of this project. Net enrollments
had expanded slightly in the first six grades of basic education from 92 percent in 1994 to 95 percent in
2002, and more significantly in grades 7-9 from 35 to 52 percent in the same time period. Net enrollment
rates had also risen significantly in the preschool level from 30 to 70 percent in the 1994-2002 period.
Textbooks were provided by the GOP free of charge to all students in grade 7-9 for the first time in the
country. A new national standardized student learning achievement system (Sistema Nacional de
Evaluación de los Procesos Educativos ­ SNEPE) established baseline data to gauge future quality
improvements. The Paraguayan Ministry of Education and Culture's (MEC) Department of Planning and
Statistics compiled the national education statistics as a way to strengthen the educational information
management systems. Parents were encouraged to take active participation in the school through the
parent's association (Asociación de Cooperación Escolar ­ ACE).

Issues. At the time of project preparation, GOP had expressed its intention to continue improving the
coverage and enrollment, especially for grades 10-12, the learning outcomes of students attending
secondary education and the MEC's institutional capacity.

Coverage and enrollment. The enrollment and completion gains in grades 7-9 of basic education
increased demand for attending grades 10-12, which GOP could not appropriately address. Consequently,
both gross and net enrollment rates of secondary education (grades 10-12) in Paraguay continued to be
among the lowest in LAC and far behind its peer countries of Mercosur.

  The first three grades of primary education are known in Paraguay as the first level of basic education while the
next 3 grades (4, 5 and 6) are known as second level of basic education, and the last 3 grades (7, 8 and 9) are known
as third level of basic education. The Reform made these nine grades of basic education compulsory. Grades 10 to
12, which were not compulsory, are currently known as secondary education.

In addition, only 50 percent of students completing basic education (grade 9) continued to secondary
education with only 24 percent of those that started secondary education finishing this level (the
secondary education completion rate in rural areas was 5 percent). Although there was gender parity in
enrollment at the secondary education level, there was a stark contrast between the urban and rural
enrollment (83 percent of total secondary education enrollment was urban and 17 percent rural) in a
country like Paraguay with 50 percent of its population living in rural areas. The inequitable access to
school mirrored the overall income inequality mentioned above.

Low coverage at the secondary level was due to a combination of demand- and supply-side factors.
About 32 percent of 13 to 18 year olds did not attend school, with this share rising to 46.4 percent in the
lowest income quintile and to 38 percent in the next income quintile. Lack of financial resources to cover
annual fees, uniforms, transportation and other related expenses were found to be inhibiting increased
demand. Lack of secondary education supply was an issue mostly in rural areas, where a shortage of these
schools forced rural families to forego further schooling for their children or sent them to urban secondary
schools, thus creating direct lodging and travel-related costs, which in many cases could not be financially
sustained by these families. As a consequence of families sending their children to urban secondary
schools, the capacity of these schools was exceeded, with many classrooms holding up to 70 students.

Quality and outcomes. At the time of the identification phase, Paraguay's students learning achievement
was low in general, and usually lower in rural areas. SNEPE test results for third graders in language and
mathematics in urban areas averaged 47.8 and 45.3 percent pass rate respectively, while in rural areas it
was 40.4 and 43.8 percent. Learning outcomes in grade 12 (measured through a non-standardized national
student performance test - Pruebas Nacionales - a different testing instrument than SNEPE) were not too
much different. Urban secondary education students scored consistently higher than rural students, girls
higher than boys, private school students higher than those in public schools, and day shift students higher
than night shift students.

Dropout rates were relatively high in 2001 ­ 5 percent as an average for grades 1-6, 8.5 percent as an
average for grades 7-9 and 11 percent as an average for grades 10-12. According to a study by the
Universidad Católica de Asunción (1999), students who did graduate from grade 12 showed crucial
deficiencies in the ability to think critically and interpret ideas, thus lacking the skills to become
productive citizens in the knowledge economy and the changing world.

Poor learning outcomes in secondary education were partially due to teaching and learning shortcomings
mainly characterized by: (a) teachers delivering rote lessons with no room for participatory learning; (b)
school environment not conducive to good teaching and learning and lacking basic teaching and learning
materials, textbooks (for grades 10-12), laboratories and new education technology; (c) poorly stocked

and under-utilized school libraries, not connected to the Internet; and (d) few available facilities for
individual study, group meetings and hands-on science education. Bilingual education was an issue,
especially at the basic education level and in rural areas, where many entering students spoke only
Guaraní. Few teachers had received formal bilingual training and the there were issues in appropriately
translating the oral Guaraní language into written texts.

Many teachers had low qualifications, with the majority of the less-qualified working in the rural area.
Only about half of the secondary education teachers were specifically trained for that level, and the
training was of doubtful quality. In addition, the MEC had changed in basic and secondary education the
subject-based curricula for competency-based area curriculum for which the majority of secondary
education teachers were not trained to teach. Pre- and in-service teacher training was fragmented and
disconnected and accounted for many of the deficiencies observed in teacher's performance. The limited
in-service teacher training provided in the secondary level was supply rather than demand driven, with
training content determined at the central level totally detached from individual schools' and teachers'
needs. School supervision at the secondary education level was focused on administrative rather than
pedagogical issues. Each school supervisor was responsible for about 60 schools, visiting mostly urban
schools a few times per year and rural schools only once a year. About 68 percent of school directors also
taught, leaving little time for classroom observations and teacher support. The quality of the teacher
training institutes was low and functioning without quality standards and accreditation procedures.

Institutional capacity. At the time of project preparation, the MEC was burdened with inefficiencies
mainly characterized by: (i) lack of control over personnel recruitment and leaves; (ii) an inadequate legal
framework to efficiently manage teaching staff appointment, to avoid unnecessary growth of teaching
positions and teaching hours; and (iii) lack of institutional tools to properly plan and manage the human,
financial and physical resources of the education sector. MEC's administrative, planning and budgetary
systems were totally uncoordinated working as independent units.

Although legal framework to decentralize the delivery of education services through MEC's regional
administrative departments was approved in 2000, MEC's management model continued to be highly
centralized at the time of project preparation and greatly uncoordinated between the central, regional and
school education authorities. The top-down management style was replicated at the Departmental and
school levels, whereby school principals made key decisions sharing little information with students,
teachers or parents. ACEs, a growing voice in basic education, had not yet gained a place in secondary
schools, especially with respect to planning, monitoring and motivation related activities.

The decentralization process was weak and poorly managed and financed. State education councils
(CDEs) had been formed, but they did not receive the required resources to carry out their envisaged
decentralized mandate.

Government's strategy. The education sector has been at the forefront of the GOP's political agenda
since the arrival of the democratic process in Paraguay at the end of the eighties. In 1991, the
democratically elected Government launched an ambitious education reform. As part of this reform
process, a Steering Council for the Education Reform (Consejo Asesor para la Reforma Educativa ­
CARE) was established in 1991 to bring together all the key stakeholders from political, religious, civil
society and government organizations in order to agree on key state educational policies and strategies, to
be later included in the newly adopted 1992 Constitution. As a result, all the key strategies, programs and
specific activities to be financed in the education sector to achieve the reform objectives were grouped
into three main axes: (a) quality; (b) equity; and (c) efficiency.

One of the initial outcomes of the reform was for the MEC (through CARE) to contract with the Institute
for International Development of the University of Harvard and the Paraguayan Center for Sociological

                                                     3
Studies a series of diagnostic studies of the education sector (see Annex 9) to highlight key issues in the
sector and propose remedial actions. Derived from these studies, a series of actions were undertaken by
the MEC including, inter alia: (a) the provision of textbooks and learning materials for preschool and
basic education (grades 1-9); (b) a curriculum revision for preschool, basic and secondary education; (c)
the promotion of bilingual education with the teaching and learning of Guaraní; (d) the strengthening of
parent participation in basic education; (e) the development and implementation by public schools of their
annual school development plan (Plan Educativo Institucional ­ PEI); (f) the strengthening of the
education statistical system; and (g) the installation of the SNEPE. Some of these initiatives were partially
financed by the Bank and others by the IDB.2

The MEC announced in 2003 its long-term Strategic Plan for Secondary Education Reform for the period
2003-2015 through the publication and dissemination of the Plan Ñanduti (Plan Nacional de Educación
para Todos 2003-2015) aligned to the GOP's National Development Plan 2003-2008. The project was
developed in accordance with the major objectives of the Plan Ñanduti, namely: (i) improving the quality
of the teaching and learning, especially of language and mathematics at all educational levels, including
secondary education; (ii) improving the equity in secondary education as it pertains to access and
completion rates; and (iii) improving the efficiency of the education systems through more pertinent
planning, better utilization of available human and physical resources, better and timely utilization of
management information systems and by updating obsolete management procedures.

Accordingly, the GOP and the Bank agreed on an six-year Adaptable Program Loan (APL), to be carried
out in two phases lasting about four years the first phase (from September 30, 2003 to June 30, 2007) and
two years the second phase (from July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2009), to help design, implement and evaluate
these policies and institutional reforms and provide the needed financial, human and physical resources
(more detail on the second phase of the proposed APL is provided in section 2.5 of this ICR). The first
phase of the APL aimed at working on policy reform issues and piloting processes, in particular in the
areas of teacher training and certification, learning materials, access to secondary education of poor
students and managing/planning in the education sector. The second phase aimed at expanding those
activities of the first phase that proved to be cost-effective.

Rationale for Bank's assistance. The rationale for Bank's assistance was argued on the basis of the
Bank's long history of commitment to financial and technical assistance to the GOP and an ongoing
relationship with the MEC through the implementation of the then ongoing Bank-financed MECES
project. The collaborative approach developed in the preparation and supervision of MECES yielded
increased cooperation between the Bank and a wide range of education stakeholders, including the
teacher union and student association representatives, creating a conducive environment for a subsequent
operation attuned to the ongoing education reform.

In addition, the Bank project team also drew on the extensive work and experience in supporting other
secondary education projects elsewhere in LAC (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and El Salvador) and
in the world, thus providing best practice examples of initiatives at this educational level to improve
quality. In particular, the Bank team offered expertise on secondary education reforms, school-based
programs and continuous teacher training programs.

 The Paraguay Secondary Education Improvement project (Proyecto de Mejoramiento de la Calidad de la
Educación Secundaria ­ MECES) to improve the access and quality of grades 7-9 was financed by the Bank through
Loan 39410-PY. The following initiatives were financed by the IDB: (a) Paraguay Primary Education Improvement
Program to improve the access and quality of grades 1-3; (b) Strengthening of Bilingual Education to support
teacher training and provision of learning quality inputs for basic education, especially in the Guaraní language; and
(c) Program to Strengthen Basic Education Reform to continue improving the access, retention and completion rates
as well as the quality of grades 1-6.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

Attuned to the Plan Ñanduti and to MEC's Strategic Plan for Secondary Education Reform for the period
2003-2015 the objectives of the project were to improve the Borrower's: (i) management and efficiency
of the education system; and (ii) educational outcomes and equity in opportunity at the secondary
education level.

The achievement of these objectives was to be measured by the following outcome indicators shown in
Table 2 below.

Of these indicators, the only ones monitored during project implementation and reported in the ISRs were
the net enrollment rate and the gross completion rate at the secondary level. However, the ISRs
monitored progress on the following trigger indicators for moving to Phase II of the APL except the one
concerning scholarship which was converted into an intermediate outcome indicator and reported
accordingly in the ISRs:

     ·   Model for selection and contracting of personnel designed, approved by the MEC, and in use in
         at least 3 states (Departamentos);
     ·   Number of students per class increased from 18 to 20 in the first two basic education cycles and
         from 25 to 27 at the secondary level;
     ·   Certification and accreditation policies designed and approved by the MEC;
     ·   Design of an initial teacher training finalized, design and implementation plan approved by the
         MEC, and new program introduced in 30 percent of the official training institutes (5 institutes);
     ·   50 percent of the PEIs in place in selected schools (100 schools);
     ·   At least 4,500 scholarships assigned, a strategy established and approved by the MEC to assign
         funds exclusively for scholarships, thereby ensuring sustainability of the program; and
     ·   Existing alternative secondary education programs evaluated and modular program designed,
         design and implementation plan approved by the MEC and program initiated on a pilot basis in
         20 locations.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators

The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) were not modified during project implementation. However,
for the reasons explained in Section 2.3 of the ICR, the outcome indicator concerning learning outcomes
in Spanish and Mathematics in grade 2 as measured by SNEPE was removed from the list. The SNEPE
findings of the measurement carried out in 2006 were now made the new baseline, expecting to measure
changes with the next (comparable) measurement to take place at the end of 2010, outside the scope of
this first phase of the APL.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) the project aimed at providing about 22,400
additional poor students with the opportunity to access and complete good quality secondary education in
addition to the ongoing secondary education enrollment at the time of project preparation of about
167,000 students. The additional supply to be provided and financed by the project was to include 9,000
scholarships to attend the regular secondary education modality, 5,000 places in new
classrooms/secondary schools through the construction of three macro-secondary schools and 8,400
through alternative education programs. The project design estimated that labor earning over the student's
working lifetime would increase by approximately 35 percent for those graduates of secondary education.

Changes in the teacher training programs and better quality control of teacher training institutes through
the new accreditation system included in the project aimed at improving the quality of all new teachers
entering the system during project implementation (about 260) and of approximately 12,000 public
secondary school teachers working in schools at the time of project launch.

The project also intended to benefit the Ministry of Education by generating savings through a more
efficient allocation of students across schools in the education system as a whole. Accordingly, the
project design estimated that by increasing the number of students per section in the first two cycles of
basic education (outside the scope of the project) from 18 to 28 and from 25 to 30 in third cycle of basic
education (also outside the scope of the project), the potential total savings would be equivalent to 11.7
percent of the total budget of the MEC, equivalent to about US$44.8 million in teachers' salaries in one
year. Even though the first three-levels of basic education were outside the scope of the project, the
above-mentioned savings were intended to be generated by the strengthening of micro-planning activities
carried out by the Planning Unit of the MEC financed by the project. These strengthening activities aimed
at rationalizing existing human and infrastructure resources at all levels of education and making better
allocation of fresh ones.

The project design also intended to benefit the planning units of the Ministry of Education at the national
and state levels as well as project secondary schools through better monitoring and supervision at the state
level, improved planning and management of resources at the school level and stronger parent and
community participation planning and monitoring resulting in greater efficiency in school management
and improved accountability. Accordingly, the project intended over the six-year period of the two
phases to benefit 200 schools to produce their PEIs, 400 schools to elaborate their Social Community
Project (Proyecto Socio-Productivo ­ PSP) and to train parents in 1,200 ACEs to participate in the
preparation of their school's PEI and PSP.

1.5 Original Components



                                                     6
The following four components comprising 7 sub-components and 17 distinctively different large key
activities were included in the project's original design as fully explained in the PAD Project Appraisal
Document (PAD), report No. 25630 dated June 25, 2003:

Component A ­ Improved tools for planning and management of the education system (total cost
US$8.86 million; US$8.52 million from the loan). This component, representing 33.4 percent of the
total project cost covered two dimensions ­ one dealing with the strengthening of the MEC's management
capacity and another one pedagogical in nature. Within the first dimension, the project aimed at financing
the following key activities: (i) the enhancement of macro and micro-planning, management and
supervision capacity; (ii) the design and implementation of a certification system for MEC professionals,
including administrative staff and teachers; (iii) the design of an accreditation system for teacher training
institutes; (iv) the expansion of the student performance assessment system (SNEPE) for secondary
education in the areas of language, mathematics and critical thinking; and (v) the implementation of a
national education communication plan to reach a diversity of stakeholders.

Within the pedagogical dimension, the project aimed at financing the following key activities: (i) the
design and implementation of a continuous pre-service teacher training system; (ii) the provision of in-
service teacher training to selected secondary education teachers to improve teaching and learning
outcomes; and (iii) the implementation of a graduate leadership program for selected key public education
leaders, authorities and managers.

(g) acquisition of vehicles for the central MEC, the Departmental Education Councils and the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU); (h) workshops; and (i) funds for the design of printed and media messages.

Component B ­ Secondary School Improvements (total cost US$8.4 million; US$7.57 million from
the loan). This component, representing 31.7 percent of the total project cost, aimed at financing the
following key activities: (i) the provision of quality didactic materials and learning equipment to
secondary schools, including training; and (ii) community-associated management through the design and
implementation of PEIs to carry out demand-driven investments for institutional planning purposes at the
school level as well as PSPs consisting of investments for productive purposes at the school level.

This Component intended to finance, inter alia: (a) the acquisition of newly designed textbooks for
secondary education; (b) the acquisition of learning resource centers (Centros de Recursos de Aprendizaje
­ CRAs) to provide a place for research and group activities as well as a learning material reference center
for teachers in 75 schools including visual and information equipment, library books, maps and
operational handbooks; (c) the acquisition of 25 science laboratories, including the training of teachers;
(d) the provision of funds (grants) to finance the preparation and implementation of PEIs and PSPs; and
(e) the provision of technical assistance and training for ensuring parent participation in the design of their
school's PEI and PSP as well as their participation in the ACEs.

Component C ­ Mechanisms to Provide More Equitable Access to Secondary Education (total cost
US$7.8 million; US$6.82 million from the loan). This component, representing 29.4 percent of the total
project cost, aimed at financing the following key activities: (i) a sustainable scholarship program for
extremely poor students; (ii) the design and implementation on a pilot scale of alternative secondary
school programs for rural and working youngsters; and (iii) the construction of prototype secondary
schools in marginal urban areas.

This Component intended to finance, inter alia: (a) the provision of technical assistance for the design and
implementation of the scholarship system to be implemented in six Departments (Alto Paraná, Caaguazú,
Central, Guairá, Itapúa and San Pedro) to benefit low-income students; (b) scholarship funds; (c)
operating costs associated to the provision and monitoring of the scholarships; (d) the provision of
training to about 100 education professionals to carry out the application of indirect income tests and
home visits; (e) the provision of technical assistance for the design and implementation of an alternative
secondary education program to provide flexible opportunities to out-of-school low income students
demanding secondary education; (f) training; (g) printing and distribution of learning modules; and (h)
civil works for 3 prototype secondary schools in the Departments of Caaguazú, Fernando de la Mora and
Luque.

Component D ­ Project Management (total cost US$1.2 million; US$1.09 million from the loan).
This component, representing 4.5 percent of the total project cost, aimed at financing the following two
key activities: (i) the management of the project by a PCU, including the required annual audits, office
equipment, operating costs and training of the PCU staff; and (ii) the project monitoring and the carrying
out of tailored-made impact evaluation studies.

1.6 Revised Components

The original components were not revised during project implementation. Nevertheless, even though
Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement (LA) does not include civil works for the construction and/or
rehabilitation of CDEs (including their CDSs and the UDEs), the Bank approved the construction of 8
CDEs in the cities of Asunción, Caacupé, Caazapá, Concepción, Encarnación, Filadelfia, San Lorenzo
and Villarrica during the implementation cycle.




                                                     8
1.7 Other significant changes

As detailed elsewhere in the ICR, one of the three prototype schools included in the original design (the
one located in Fernando de la Mora) was dropped from further consideration due to lack of available
financial resources once the original architectural design for each of the three prototypes was radically
modified by the pedagogical units within MEC resulting in significant increases in construction square
footage and unit cost. In addition, only 5 of the 8 intended CDEs construction projects were financed by
the loan (Caacupé, Caazapá, Concepción, Encarnación and Filadelfia).

The original closing date of June 30, 2007 was extended three times for a total of two and a half years.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

This and the following sections in the ICR were written based on: (i) a thorough review of the project
files; and (ii) the findings of the supervision missions carried out in November 17-21, 2008, March 23-27,
2009 and June 22-25, 2009 and the ICR field mission undertaken on December 1-4, 2009, which included
a visit to the construction sites of the prototype schools in Luque and Caaguazú and the CDE of Caacupé.

The ICR rates Quality at Entry as moderately unsatisfactory, based on current standards for quality at
entry, which were not in place at the time of project preparation. A summary of the ICR's assessment on
these topics follows, while sections 2.2, 2.3 and 5.1 (a) of the ICR provide more detail on the reasons for
this assessment.

The strategic relevance and approach was appropriate based on: (i) the findings of the studies
commissioned by CARE to launch the education reform in 1994; (ii) the lessons learned from the then
ongoing Bank-financed MECES and other education sector operations financed by the IDB; and (iii) the
recommendations of experts from others countries, in particular Argentina and Chile that were
undergoing an education reform.

The selection of an APL as the lending instrument to gradually achieve GOP's secondary education
sector medium-term vision attuned to the ongoing education reform was also an appropriate decision.

Project preparation included effective policy dialogue with the GOP and an extensive consultation
process, including key members of the Education Commission of Congress that were to play a key role
during the implementation cycle, thus ensuring in the process, GOP's ownership of the project design.

Relations with other agencies. Although no other multilateral or bilateral institution was included in the
financing of this project, the Bank team worked closely with the IDB, which was heavily involved in
supporting basic education in Paraguay. In addition, variety of qualified non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) participated in other activities of the preparation and design.

Outcome and output indicators. The project's results framework as set out in the PAD was appropriate
and well defined for the series as a whole. However, only two outcome indicators (out of six) were
monitored during implementation of Phase I,3 so that there is a disconnect between ICRs and ISRs
ratings.

3
  As mentioned earlier, the ISRs monitored progress on two PDO indicators (net enrollment rate and gross
completion rate at the secondary level) and the trigger indicators for moving to Phase II of the APL.

Technical, financial and economic aspects. While recognizing that most of the approaches included in
the project design, except the ones concerning the prototype schools and alternative secondary education,
were well-tested elsewhere and proven effective, the project design was overly ambitious covering too
many fronts (17 key activities grouped in 7 sub-components and 4 components). This complexity in the
design caused significant delays in project implementation of some activities, like the civil works of the
prototype schools and the acquisition of the textbooks, learning materials for the CRAs and science
laboratories, alternative secondary education as well as the tools for planning and managing the education
system.

The ICR detected four additional technical shortcoming fully explained in section 5.1(a): (i) lack of
articulation among project activities; (ii) inclusion of sub-components ­ such as alternative secondary
education option, new model of teacher training and social communication ­ in the absence of a technical
and operational description at the time of Board approval; (iii) projected unit cost estimates that turned
out to be significantly below actual costs, for example in the case of management re-engineering for the
MEC, learning inputs and civil works (for the CRAs and CDEs/UDEs); and (iv) lack of a cost-benefit
analysis to justify the construction of three prototype secondary schools.

On a more positive note, the ICR highlights the extreme care taken during project preparation to ensure
the appropriate poverty-related targeting of the scholarship scheme and the mechanism to ensure
transparency and accountability in the selection of candidates and in the allocation and management of
the corresponding financial resources.

The implementation arrangements for this project were appropriate entrusting: the PCU with the fiduciary
responsibilities and provision of technical assistance and MEC's frontline units with the actual operation
of the different project activities.

The project design complied with almost all the Bank's safeguard policies in existence at the time of
project appraisal, except with the Indigenous Peoples Plan (to benefit the indigenous population enrolled
in some project schools), which was not included during the preparation phase. The fact that the
education policy in Paraguay makes the teaching of Guaraní mandatory in primary and secondary schools
mitigated this project preparation oversight, thereby ensuring that the interests of indigenous communities
were taken into account during project implementation. Procurement and financial management
assessments were carried out, a first-year procurement plan was made available and a thorough social
assessment was undertaken highlighting key issues, like the high opportunity costs for poor students to
continue with their secondary education, which were appropriately addressed by project design.
Environmental guidelines were provided for the prototype schools.

Risk assessments. The overall risk assessment for this project was adequate. The project highlighted
some potential critical risks and proposed some mitigating measures as detailed in section 5.1(a) of the
ICR. One risk that was missed was possible delays in Congress approval (see section 2.2).

Lessons learned. Lessons learned from the Bank-financed MECES program and from other education
projects worldwide, detailed in section 5.1(a) of the ICR, were incorporated in the project design.

Weighing the above strengths and weaknesses of project design, in particular the lack of cost-benefit
analysis to justify the inclusion of the large civil works, the lack of a technical and operational description
of some key activities and the lack of implementation readiness at the time of Board approval, the ICR
ranks the Quality at Entry of this project as moderately unsatisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

The following factors significantly delayed the physical and financial implementation progress of the
project and affected achievement of results. First, the loan effectiveness required Congress approval that
took almost 10 months after the signing of the loan in September 2003. Once the loan was approved by
the Paraguayan Congress in mid-2004 the loan could not be disbursed until overdue payments on other
loans needed to be resolved. The Special Account was finally opened towards the end of 2004 and the
first allocation of one US million dollars was made by the Bank.

Second, the project was not ready for implementation at the time of loan approval, in particular: (i)
several key activities under the project (pre-service teacher training, the alternative secondary education)
were not defined; (ii) there were no technical and pedagogical specifications for the acquisition of
textbooks, science laboratories and other learning resources for the CRAs, or technical specifications for
the reengineering process; and (iii) there was no agreement between the architects and the pedagogical
units within the MEC about the prototype schools resulting in a significant change of the original
appraised designs including a noteworthy increase in costs and square footage and the deletion of one of
the 3 original construction sites.

Third, the PCU was not effective in implementing required procurement activities, especially during the
early (2004 to March 2006) and latest stages of the implementation cycle (2008-2009).

Fourth, project implementation slowed down for some months (August 2008 to March 2009) after the
new government took office (see section 5.2(b) of this ICR).

It took the MEC about 33 months after Board approval in July 2003 to address the above-mentioned
implementation issues and get all the project activities under implementation. As a consequence, from
the mid-term review of March 2006 until the end of 2007 the physical and financial implementation
progress improved with total documented disbursement amounting to US$16 million (67 percent of the
total contracted loan) during these 21 months. One project activity ­ the scholarship program ­ was
successfully completed. The local counterpart teams coordinated better among themselves and began
demonstrating greater cost-effectiveness in their work.

From 2008 onwards it became clear that the project was running out of funds and difficult trade offs
(further explained below) had to be made by the MEC. Several reasons explain this financial situation.
First, the local currency (Guaraní) appreciated: Guaraní was worth 6,900 units for one US dollar at
appraisal, reaching its highest appreciation in October 2008 of 3,930 to one US dollar and falling back to
4,780 at the closing of the loan in December 2009. As the loan was denominated in US dollars, but by law
expenditures had to be made in local currency, the appreciation already reduced the purchasing capacity
by about one third. Second, the reallocation of loan proceeds to the civil works category of expenditure to
cover the additional requirements of the new design of the prototype schools (going from US$3.8 to
US$4.8 million) reduced the availability of financial resources for other ends such as to acquire learning
and multimedia goods, computing equipment for the management reengineering of MEC, school furniture
and to select qualified consultants or firms to carry out some evaluation studies. Third, the original cost
estimation in the project design included only textbooks for the first grade of secondary education but
during implementation the acquisition scope was increased to also cover the second and third grades of
the common curricular plan. Finally, the projected unit costs at appraisal were below the real ones, partly
due to local and international inflation.

After the hand-over of project management to a new administration in August 15, 2008, the
implementation process slowed for some months. This situation hindered the ongoing construction
process of the two prototype schools and the management re-engineering process. At the end of 2008 the

                                                    11
new administration cancelled the international acquisition process worth approximately US$500,000 of
computers for the prototype schools and the MEC's management reengineering that was started by the
previous administration. Key technical and fiduciary staff at the PCU was replaced by Ministry of
Education staff which required initial training and close supervision by Bank procurement staff to
implement planned procurement activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project's monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements as well as the baseline data were ready at
the time of Board approval. The results framework included seven outcome and nineteen output
indicators that the MEC/PCU was able to monitor and report during the implementation cycle.

Outcome indicators were intended to measure the attainment of the three parts of the PDO: education
system management and efficiency; educational outcomes (quality of education); and equitable access to
secondary education. In particular, improvements in management and efficiency of the education system
were expected to be manifested by increased class sizes, improved gross completion rates and lower
repetition and dropout rates. Educational outcomes were to be measured directly through math and
language SNEPE tests. Finally, equity in access to secondary education was to be achieved by increasing
enrollment rates and specifically by providing targeted scholarships to poor students, thus increasing
enrollments for this group.

These indicators were expected to be measured at the end of the entire APL program. For APL I, in
addition to tracking progress towards these outcome indicators, the project was expected to report on the
attainment of APL II triggers and on the delivery of specific outputs by component.

While in general the M&E framework was reasonably well defined and appropriate, it was too complex
and included too many indicators. There were also discrepancies between the indicators listed in the main
text of the PAD, Annex 1 of the PAD and those tracked in ISRs, which further complicated M&E
arrangements. Finally, one of the key indicators ­ learning outcomes as measured by SNEPE ­ had to be
dropped during implementation when it turned out that the 2001 learning outcomes exams administered
by SNEPE (under a subject-based curriculum) and intended to be used as a baseline for the project were
not comparable to the exams to be administered in 2006 and then again in 2010 (under a competency-
based curriculum). For this reason, this baseline was considered inappropriate and replaced by the
findings of the 2006 learning assessment. The indicator was dropped as the second measurement to assess
changes against the baseline (the one to be carried out at the end of 2010) was outside the project's time-
horizon. No alternative indicator was proposed to replace it, thus leaving the project with no tool to
measure the attainment of one of the parts of the PDO.

Finally, the project design intended to carry out several independent evaluation studies and/or thorough
monitoring follow-up activities of the pilots being tested under the project. With the exception of the
impact evaluation study carried out for the scholarship scheme, whose findings were reported in the sector
work (World Bank 2007), and some follow-up on the use of textbooks and CRAs, none of the other key
activities was assessed with respect to the attainment of their particular goals. Accordingly, there is a lack
of hard evidence to ascertain if some of the following project activities had an immediate observable
impact and/or if they had attained their expected goals: (i) the leadership program; (ii) the pre and in-
service teacher training; (iii) the use of school mapping to make a better allocation of scarce resources in
secondary education; (iv) the community-based strategies including the PEIs, PSPs and ACEs; and (v) the
alternative secondary options. Lack of financial resources prevented the carrying out of these evaluation
studies.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project implementation process generally complied with the Bank's procurement and financial
management requirements. Main issues arising during implementation concerned: (i) poor documentation
quality; and (ii) duplication of review tasks, confused roles within the MEC, cumbersome coordination
mechanisms and accountability channels making the existing administrative arrangements in place at the
early stages of implementation neither efficient nor conducive to expeditious and timely decisions thus
causing significant procurement delays. These were satisfactorily addressed by the MEC.

Although at the time of project approval the Bank agreed to a first-year procurement plan and judged the
procurement implementation capacity as adequate, several issues arose in practice. First, no approved
final project's Operational Manual, including a procurement section, was available at project approval,
although a draft had been discussed with the Bank. It took almost 3 years after Board approval to have
the technical and pedagogical specifications ready for the acquisition of learning goods, the selection of a
qualified firm to undertake the MEC's reengineering task and the final design for the construction of the
prototype schools. The construction and/or rehabilitation of 72 classrooms to house the different size
CRAs was a procurement activity started on time.

MEC/PCU did not select a qualified construction oversight firm (fiscalizadora) in a timely manner, which
delayed loan disbursements against eligible expenditures incurred in the construction of the two prototype
schools and the 5 CDEs. This firm was contracted towards the end of 2007 and construction was
accordingly delayed.

On the positive side, the PCU's procurement unit was the recipient of the Ministry of Finance's prize for
good governance and transparency, among other things, for having implemented the nation system-wide
integrated acquisition management procedure (Gestión Integral de Adquisiciones ­ GINA). This system
is a digital back-up of all the acquisitions of goods, services and works undertaken during the life of the
project, including documents from the original request to initiate the acquisition to the final payment to
the supplier. This system produces a series of decision-making reports, among others the annual and
revised procurement plan and a supplier's compliance tracking record.

The Bank was provided in a timely manner with the quarterly financial management reports and with the
unqualified annual audit reports. All the reports were found to be satisfactory.

Environmental and resettlement assessments were carried out for the two prototype schools built under
the project but not for 5 CDEs. For the latter case, a retroactive assessment undertaken by the Bank'
Team found that no environmental issues were triggered during the construction of the CDEs. Despite
the fact that no Indigenous People Plan was prepared for this project, the MEC satisfactorily complied
with the corresponding safeguard including learning materials (textbooks) and teacher training in
Guaraní, mostly as a result of a national bilingual educational policy in existence in Paraguay long before
the launching of the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

All the triggers to move to the second phase, except one (increase in number of students per class), were
satisfactorily attained. Preparation of the second phase started in 2008, but after the change in
government MEC decided not to request a second loan and the preparation activities for the second phase
were suspended.




                                                    13
Nonetheless, the following project activities are being sustained by the MEC with their own fiscal
resources:

(a) In the area of improved tools for planning and management of the education system supported by the
project under component A: (i) the educational statistical management information system is an ongoing
activity within the MEC that has made available the official statistics for the school year 2008 as well as
the preliminary information for 2009; (ii) the management re-engineering process that was installed by
the project is also an ongoing and, gradually, expanding activity within the MEC; (iii) four of the five
CDSs completed before the closing of the loan are fully functional and providing the expected
administrative services (see Annex 2 for details on the fifth, partially completed CDS); (iv) the model to
accredit and certify teacher training institutes is being currently applied to 20 teacher-training institutes;
(v) the pre-service teacher training developed under the project is being utilized in 5 institutions
benefiting 260 students expected to graduate during the second semester of 2010; (vi) the in-service
teacher training developed under the project is being provided to about 1,780 participants during 2010;
and (vii) SNEPE has been institutionalized within the General Directorate of Evaluation of Education
Quality within MEC, with an expected learning assessment measurement in secondary education at the
end of 2010 and a subsequent one in 2014.

(b) In the area of mechanisms to provide more equitable access to secondary education supported by the
project under component C: (i) the scholarship scheme instituted by the project is a recurrent annual
activity sustained by the MEC with 10,060 scholarships granted in 2009 financed completely with fiscal
resources; and (ii) the two prototype schools are functioning, albeit at a reduced enrollment as envisaged
by the appraised design (the school in Caguazú started operations in early 2009 has 133 in first grade and
112 in second grade for a total of 245 students, and the school in Luque started operations in March 2010
with 143 students in first grade).

The MEC's authorities informed the ICR team that at least during 2010 the activities financed under
component B (textbooks, learning resource centers, science laboratories and the management community-
based strategies) are not going to be financially sustained and that the alternative secondary education
modality will be suspended once the current student cohort completes their remaining modules at the end
of 2010.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Project's Development Objectives were relevant at the time of project design and continue to be relevant
now.

At the lending stage. The project PDOs were consistent with those outlined in the Bank's Paraguay
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on March 27, 1997, covering the period until
December 2003, including: (i) to increase coverage and quality of secondary education to augment the
supply of qualified labor; (ii) to improve quality and efficiency of secondary education; (iii) to increase
the MEC's capacity for information-based decision making; and (iv) to promote decentralized
participation of the education community. In addition, the project design was in line with the CAS's
recommendation to focus on poverty issues, in this case, equity in access to quality secondary education.

The project design was also attuned to the Country's Poverty Reduction Strategy (Estrategia Nacional de
Reducción de la Pobreza y la Desigualdad, November 2002), prepared with the support of the Bank. This
strategy also highlighted the important relationship between education opportunities and poverty
reduction, noting that the extreme poor are those with the least number of years of education and with the

                                                     14
most limited access to education. As the greatest number of poor and extreme poor population resides in
the rural areas, the proposed operation was also consistent with Poverty Reduction Strategy by assisting
the GOP in its efforts of increasing net enrollment rates in secondary education, especially in the rural
areas. With these goals in mind, the proposed Bank-financed operation aimed at: (a) improving human
capital through provision of education; and (b) strengthening the social capital of the poor by offering
greater opportunities for participation in the local education community.

Finally, the PDOs were also consistent with the Millennium Development Goals of eradicating extreme
poverty and increasing literacy rates of 15-24 year olds, thereby increasing the country's possibilities of
sustainable economic growth and more equitable income distribution.

At the closing of the loan. The project's PDOs are also consistent with two of the three objectives set
forth in the current Country Partnership Strategy for the Republic of Paraguay (Report 48087-PY), dated
April 7, 2009 and covering the period 2009-2013. Accordingly, this CPS sets the direction of Bank
support to help the GOP achieve:

    (i) Strengthened state institutions to improve policy making, public services provision, and the rule
              of law;
    (ii) Improved investments in the social sectors and focusing public spending on the extreme poor; and
    (iii) Fostered growth with a focus on employment generation and on improving income distribution,
              without destabilizing the country's macroeconomic framework or the environment.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Assessment of PDO achievements. This ICR recognizes that the PDO and outcome indicators selected
to measure it at the time of project design assumed that both APL phases would materialize. In reality
only the first project was completed, and the second stage that intended to scale up its impact to the
national level was not carried out. Therefore, it is hard to claim that activities supported by the project
had a direct causality link to the intended outcomes expected by the end of APL II. Nevertheless, no
separate outcome indicators had been defined for APL I, and only intermediate (output) indicators were
tracked during project implementation. This design flaw has a broader implication for the evaluation of
the project. The limited attribution between intermediate project outcomes and expected program
outcomes makes the process of establishing linkages of causality artificial. This ICR has opted for giving
more weight in the rating to the results outcomes as opposed to the intermediate outcomes because (a)
outcome indicators better reflect the purpose and intention of the project, and (b) it took as long to
complete the first phase as it should have taken to implement the entire program.

Using the data collected during project implementation as well as information from other sources, the
following conclusions can be drawn with respect to the achievement of project's development objectives:

Improved Management and Efficiency of the Education System: not achieved. Indicators that were
intended to measure improvements in management and efficiency of the education system are increase in
class size, increased gross completion, lower repetition and lower dropout rates. Specifically, between
2001 to 2009 class size in the 1st and 2nd cycle of basic education was supposed to increase from 18 to
28 students, in the 3rd cycle from 29 to 30 students, and in secondary education from 25 to 30 (revised to
27 during implementation). In practice, no increase in class size at any level has been achieved, and at
least for secondary level, there has been a reduction in the class size from 25 to 21 students, largely due to
union pressures. Gross completion rate at the secondary education level was expected to increase from 76
percent in 2001 to 82 in 2009. The actual outcome (2008 data) has been 69 percent, meaning that the
indicator moved in the opposite direction compared to the goal. Even though the average dropout rate has

                                                     15
decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to 10.7 percent in 2008, the rate is still above the target for the end of
APL I (9 percent). The only indicator where the target has been surpassed is the reduction of the
repetition rate which decreased from 1 percent in 2001 to 0.6 percent in 2008 versus a 0.9 percent in the
PAD as a target for the end of program.

It should be noted that although the outcome of greater efficiency has not been achieved, outputs meant to
lead to that outcome have been successfully delivered. In particular, alternative secondary education
programs have been designed and approved by MEC and implemented in 20 sites, but the modality turned
out to be cost-ineffective. Only 172 students out of the original 600 that started this modality in 2006 have
remained in 17 sites (3 sites have dropped out). From the surviving cohort, only 76 had graduated in
December 2009 ­ January 2010 period, which means that it took them more than three and a half years to
complete their secondary education, about 6 months longer than in a regular school. It is expected that
the remaining 96 students will complete this level during 2010 (taking them more than 4 years). MEC
decided not to continue offering this alternative.

Improved Educational Outcomes: not possible to evaluate. As mentioned before, this outcome
indicator was dropped for APL I after the change in methodology made original baseline data
incompatible with subsequent assessments. It was decided to use the 2006 SNEPE results as the new
baseline to be compared with the next measurement due to take place in 2010 and then again in 2014. By
early 2010, MEC had completed the validation of the assessment instrument that will be administered
nationwide at the end of 2010 to all graduates of secondary education (grade 12), while the sample ­
based assessment to grade 11th has been postponed until 2011.

However, all of the outputs intended to bring about better education quality have been achieved. In
particular, MEC has designed and approved a model for the selection and contracting of personnel and is
using in not just in 3 Departments as originally envisaged, but nationwide. MEC has also surpassed the
target on designing certification and accreditation policies, which are now applied to 20 pre- and in-
service teacher training institutions. With respect to teacher certification, MEC is currently implementing
the approved model nationwide in both basic and secondary education levels, albeit with different degrees
of progress (moving faster in basic than in secondary education). A new General Directorate has been
established within MEC by the new administration (Dirección General de Evaluación de la Carrera
Magisterial then recently renamed Dirección General de Desarrollo Profesional del Educador) to
manage the implementation of the above-mentioned activities. MEC has also designed and approved
initial teacher training program that is now being implemented in 13 teacher-training institutes (8 more
than original agreed at appraisal) with an enrollment of 260 students. The goal on quality improvement
projects (PEI) has also been surpassed: not just 50 but all 100 project secondary schools have
implemented their PEIs.

Greater Equity of Opportunity in Secondary Education: achieved. Indicators that can be used to
gauge progress on the equity front are changes in the net enrollment rate and incremental growth of the
number of secondary students from poor families. The target on the net enrollment rate has been met: this
indicator increased from 33 percent in 2001to 42 percent in 2008, which has been the target for the end of
APL I. This number is somewhat short of the 44 percent expected by the end of the program (2009). In
addition, the scholarship scheme supported by the project has proved to be a highly cost-effective and
well targeted intervention. The project provided 4,500 scholarships annually to poor secondary education
students. Furthermore, MEC has sustained this activity with its own fiscal resources since 2007, granting
4,518 scholarships for secondary education in 2007, 3,000 in 2008 and almost tripling the number to
10,060 in 2009. The size of the scholarship has remained stable at about US$260 equivalent.

On balance therefore, the project's PDO achievement is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Assessment of the intermediate output indicators. The number of intermediate output indicators
reported to Bank management at the end of each supervision mission since the beginning of project
implementation only included the - number of scholarships granted by the project.

Table 4 below includes the status of the 19 original output indicators. From the findings indicated in this
table, the ICR rates the achievement of the original output indicators as moderately satisfactory.

* Indicators that are incorrectly also utilized as outcome.

Assessment of the triggers to move to Phase II

(a)      The following triggers were achieved fully or even surpassed: (i) the model for selection and
contracting of personnel designed, approved by the MEC, and in use in at least 3 states; (ii) the
certification and accreditation policies designed and approved by the MEC and implemented; (iii) the
design of an initial teacher training finalized, design and implementation plan approved by the MEC, and
new program introduced in 30 percent of the official training institutes (5 institutes); (iv) 50 percent of the
PEIs in place in selected schools (100 schools); and (v) at least 4,500 scholarships assigned, a strategy
established and approved by the MEC to assign funds exclusively for scholarships, thereby ensuring
sustainability of the program;

(b)      The following trigger was only partially achieved: (i) existing alternative secondary education
programs evaluated (never done) and modular program designed, design and implementation plan
approved by the MEC and program initiated on a pilot basis in 20 locations (implemented in 17 of the
original 20 sites, but the model is rated unsatisfactory); and

(c)     The student classroom ratios moved in the opposite direction than expected at appraisal for
reasons described elsewhere in the ICR.

Accordingly, the ICR rates the attainment of the agreed Phase I triggers moderately satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

The Net Present Value (NPV) was US$3.8 million and the estimated Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
was 15 percent, considering a 10-year time horizon since the beginning of the project. The estimated NPV
and ERR for a 20-year time horizon since the beginning of the project were US$ 25.4 million and 33

                                                              18
percent, respectively. The Cost-Benefit Analysis was re-estimated to calculate the NPV and the ERR
using end of the program actual values.

The estimates indicate a negative NPV of US$ 1.4 million and a revised ERR of 8 percent. Under this
scenario (10 years) the project could not be considered a good social investment. However it is important
to highlight two aspects. First, the Cost Benefit Analysis model used at project preparation did not
quantify the benefits associated with a more educated labor force. These benefits may have two types of
effects: (i) productivity and growth effects above the direct income increases that beneficiaries are
receiving, and (ii) lower risks of unemployment that more educated people face. Additionally, intangible
benefits were not included (e.g. aesthetic appreciation, better health, and better voting behavior and social
behavior that research has linked to increases in education). If these benefits would have been quantified
and included in the analysis at appraisal the expected direction of the effects would be an increased NPV
and an increased ERR.4 Second, a longer time horizon would change this result. For example, using a 15
year time period since the beginning of implementation would make the project to break even5 using end
of program values and considering a 20 year time period the estimations indicate a revised NPV of
US$600,000 and a revised ERR of 11 percent.6

Based on the above, the ICR rates the efficiency of this project as moderately satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Given that only one of the three development outcomes of the project has been achieved (greater equity of
access to secondary education), one outcome (learning outcomes) is impossible to evaluate, and one
(management and efficiency of the system) has actually deteriorated, the overall outcome is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

An important caveat to this rating is that the objective was to be achieved as a result of two APL phases,
while in practice only one of the operations materialized. Nevertheless, given the fact that it took nearly
as long to complete the first phase as was envisioned for the entire program, it seems appropriate to
evaluate the project against the original program outcome indicators. If favorable data were available on
changes in education outcomes, it would have been possible to rate the project outcome as moderately
satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Out of the three key activities included in the project design under Component C to improve equity in
access, retention and completion in secondary education, only the scholarship program was fully and
successfully implemented and targeted. Two other project interventions also aimed at reducing poverty -
the prototype schools and the alternative secondary model. The prototype schools, although completed,
are recently in operation with about 10 percent capacity of their original design, while the alternative
secondary models has not yet completed the graduation of its present student cohort and presents
efficiency problems (high dropout rates and of significantly longer duration than the school-based
modality). Given that the total number of scholarships provided to poor students annually represents only

4
  The analysis conducted in this report did not make an attempt to value these benefits.
5
  That is the project will have a NPV = $0 and an ERR = 10 percent.
6
   The selection of the time horizon is an option of the analysis but it is expected that the benefits of these
intervention are closer to 15 years since the beginning of the implementation of the project rather than the 10 year
considered in the PAD.

                                                        19
about 5 percent of the total enrollment in public secondary schools,7 the impact of this intervention in
alleviating poverty is moderate.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Even though the original project design was ambitious with respect to making structural institutional
changes with the re-engineering and support for the decentralization of the MEC, in reality only modest
changes were accomplished with almost no visible impact in the short term. However, the new
selection and recruitment of teachers, the certification of teachers and the accreditation of pre and in-
service teacher-training institutes will, in the medium to long-term horizon, improve the quality of the
teacher cadre. The availability of updated statistical education information, school-mapping and learning
outcomes could also improve the decision-making process to better allocate the limited financial, human
and physical resources within the education system.

There is no hard evidence that the graduates of the leadership program have made an impact in promoting
constructive changes within their working environment. There is a long way still to go before
management reengineering will bear fruit. Finally, there is no institutional strategy to concentrate
teachers' working hours in fewer secondary schools, so that they can have more time to participate in
strengthening teaching and learning activities in the classroom implemented at the school level.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The project includes three development outcomes: enhanced education system management and
efficiency (increased class sizes, improved gross completion rates and lower repetition and dropped out
rates); improved educational quality (as measured by standardized tests); and equitable access to
secondary education (as measured by increased enrollment of the poorest).

The Development Objectives were relevant at the time of project design and continue to be relevant now
for the current administration. At such, efforts will be continued to achieve these outcomes.

However, there are some risks: first, the reengineering program completed at the end of 2009 will be
gradually scaled up to the rest of the Departments in the country. However it will take some time and
additional fresh financial resources and hardware before MEC reaches this threshold to have an impact on
the education system management.

Second, the standardized learning assessment SNEPE to measure impacts on quality, a crucial monitoring
and evaluation task, is being institutionally, technically and financially sustained by the MEC by housing
it in the recently created Dirección de Evaluación de la Calidad Educativa (DECE) within the General

  A rigorous impact evaluation study conducted on the scholarship program (World Bank, 2007) showed that the
program increased the probability of beneficiaries' attendance and graduation from secondary education as
compared to a carefully selected group of non-beneficiaries.

Directorate of Planning. This unit has been strengthened with qualified staff to write and validate test
items as well as to process and analyze the field information. The MEC is still dependent on external
financing is to conduct the administration of tests and dissemination of results. In terms of inputs to
produce quality of education, the Paraguayan Congress did not approve in the 2008, 2009 and 2010
Budget Laws financial resources for the reprinting of the textbooks acquired under the project neither for
the acquisition of other learning goods (laboratories, learning resource centers).

Third, in terms of equity of access the scholarship scheme is currently funded by the GOP and the
authorities are committed to maintain the funding for this program.

Accordingly, the ICR rates the risk of this activity as moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

The Bank provided effective project preparation support to the GOP through a highly qualified and
experienced core Bank team. When specific technical issues required attention, the Bank team drew on
senior expertise from across the Bank and from outside the Bank. There was only one task team leader
assigned to this operation during the entire lending cycle (from pre-identification to Board approval) thus
providing continuity during the preparation phase. As shown in Annex 4 of the ICR, a significant number
of professionals were involved in the preparation cycle.

The quality at entry of this project is rated as moderately unsatisfactory because of the following:

On the positive side the analysis performed for this report indicates that: (i) the strategic relevance and
approach is considered appropriate because it was nurtured by a vast array of useful information
stemming from different sources; (ii) the decision to support the GOP's public secondary education
system with this operation was considered an appropriate strategic decision by the Bank at the time of
project preparation; (iii) an APL was considered an appropriate financial instrument; (iv) the GOP had
full ownership of the project design; (v) the Bank Team demonstrated client orientation; (vi) the Bank
team developed good working relationships with the IDB, who was supporting other levels of the
education system, and elicited the participation of several NGOs in capacity building strategies for the
implementation of some project activities; (vii) the extreme care taken by the Bank team during
preparation to ensure appropriate poverty targeting of scholarship scheme and transparency and
accountability in the selection of candidates; (viii) the implementation arrangements included for this
project were appropriate; (ix) there was a compliance with Bank's safeguard policies; (x) the Bank team
presented appropriate risk assessment highlighting some potential risks and proposed some mitigating
measures; and (xi) the project introduced appropriate lessons learned.

On the downside: (i) the short time horizon of the APL, the limited amount of financial resources
allocated to the first phase and the restricted geographic scope of the project covering only 8 out of 17
Departments of the entire country, and within each project Department, only few secondary schools,
prevented this operation to have a significant impact in achieving the policy reforms sought by the GOP
in secondary education; (ii) the project design was overly ambitious covering many fronts; (iii) some
components, like the alternative secondary education, were included in the design lacking a technical and

                                                     21
operational description at the time of appraisal; (iv) there was a high degree of lack of articulation among
the different activities financed by the project; (v) the poorly defined results framework; (vi) a major
drawback during preparation was the lack of a cost-benefit analysis or an assessment of potential demand
to justify the inclusion of three large prototype schools to be financed by the Bank loan;8 and (vii)
implementation readiness conditions were not fully present at the time of Board approval causing
implementation delays.

As stated above the decision to build the large prototype schools has not been based on good analysis.
Smaller secondary schools, holding a maximum of about 500 students and with about one sixth the square
meters of the prototype schools9 would have been a more efficient way to improve access and retention,
and learning outcomes. In addition, high cost of these schools effectively prevented their replication and
expansion elsewhere in the country after the closing of the loan. This alone should have been a sufficient
reason never to include this intervention, as it defeats the principle of sustainability and scaling up of
successful interventions. Finally, the cost of annual maintenance estimated at about 2 percent of the total
cost of construction (US$ 50,000 per school per year) was not considered in the design.

Rating criteria. Weighing the relevant achievements and shortfalls of the Bank team at the preparation
stage, the ICR rates the Bank project preparation performance as moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: moderately unsatisfactory

The project had three Task Team Leaders (TTLs). Continuity was provided during the entire preparation
and implementation cycle, ensuring a smooth and effective change of command from the Bank's side.

The Bank carried-out on-average about one supervision every five months and supervision was adequate
and effective. Supervision missions included the appropriate skill-mix to carry out their envisaged terms
of reference as attested in Annex 4 of the ICR. The project files also confirm the support provided by the
various missions to the counterpart team including: (i) a procurement and financial management-training
workshop during the launching mission in March 2004 to familiarize the MEC/PCU teams with Bank
procedures; (ii) the identification of a set of qualified consultants to provide technical assistance in the
redirection of the alternative secondary modality; (iii) advice to the MEC/PCU team to better articulate all
the components seeking improved synergy and the usage of cost-benefit consideration of the different
project activities; and (iv) provision in May 2008 of a qualified civil engineer specializing in structures to
assess the collapse in part of the ceiling of one of the prototype schools and to recommend ways to
address this issue.

Supervision missions were candid in raising issues, and in some occasions, also flags, like for example:
(i) the inappropriateness of the original alternative secondary model; (ii) the cancellation of one of the
three school prototypes; (iii) the weaknesses of the in-service teacher training model; and (iv) the
unresolved safety issues during the construction of the prototype schools. The reporting during the early
stages of implementation lasting up to mid-2006 focused mainly in inputs and processes, while from mid-
2006 onwards, and especially once the sector work was completed and discussed with the MEC in 2007,
the reporting was more holistic in nature focusing on results. Accordingly, supervision missions tried to
strike a balance by looking at intermediate and final outcomes with inputs and processes. Likewise, some
of the early supervision reporting is based on expectations (like for example with respect to the alternative
secondary option up to and including 2006, the in-service teacher training up to early 2007, the prototype

    During implementation only two of these prototype schools were built.

    The size of the prototype schools built was approximately 6,600 square meters.

schools and the leadership program), while the reporting in the latter stages of the implementation cycle is
based on more solid evidence and facts of the grounds.

On the downside, nothing was done by the TTLs to correct the project's inadequate results framework
during phase I.

Another major drawback was the 2006 approval of the increase in the size of the schools from 3,700 to
6,600 square meters (78.4 percent increase in square footage).10 Again no evidence can be found of a
cost-benefit analysis or assessment of potential demand to justify such an increase. This lack of
assessment is evidenced by the current underutilization of the schools (only 245 students in the prototype
school in Caaguazú and 146 students in the school in Luque).

The construction of the two prototype schools built with loan proceeds has been the source of constant
and significant criticism to the Bank, especially from the Paraguayan press and the newly elected
government who sees these schools as "white-elephant projects" not meriting the financial investments
allocated to them. During 2008 and 2009 the Ministry of Education had to address safety issues in both
prototype schools to rectify omissions in their design. The Ministry also designed and distributed
brochures for a safe use of the schools.

Weighing the above, Bank supervision performance is considered as moderately unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: moderately unsatisfactory

The ICR rates the overall Bank performance as moderately unsatisfactory because most of the project
preparation gaps were satisfactorily addressed by the MEC during implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating at the lending stage: moderately satisfactory

The project preparation was executed by line staff from MEC complemented with technical assistance
from the MEC's PCU. The political context provided needed stability of the technical counterpart teams
that prepared, and then implemented Phase I until the change of government in August 2008.

The Bank team interacted with highly qualified technical counterpart teams, most of which were also
involved in the implementation of the previous Bank-financed project in education (MECES, Ln. 39410 ­
PY) and thus familiar with Bank-financed operations. These teams had clarity about the key issues
affecting secondary education as well as with respect to the relevant interventions to address them. In
addition, these teams were very receptive to the recommendations provided by international experts that
attended various thematic workshops during the preparation cycle.

On the downside, the MEC/UCP teams responsible for the various components tended to work in
isolation, precluding the needed coordination among project components, as was the case with the

  Because of the replicability of the model, the maintenance cost and funds availability to fund the increased cost
per school, the number of prototype schools was reduced from three to two in December 2006.

prototype school buildings explained before. Another weakness that surfaced during project preparation
concerns the alternative secondary education activity which was included in the design without a
thorough conceptualization by the MEC/PCU.

Weighing the strengths and the weaknesses at the preparation stage, the ICR rates the Government
performance during the preparation stage as moderately satisfactory.

Rating at the implementation stage: moderately satisfactory

The Executive and Legislative branches of the GOP were fully supportive of this project until August
2008, at which time a new elected government assumed responsibility. The loan was signed on September
10, 2003, about one month after Board approval. The Paraguayan Parliament approved the loan about
nine months after the signing which is a remarkably short time for Paraguay. In addition, Congress
approved the regulations to the Teacher Statue enabling teacher certification as intended by the project.

The implementation cycle enjoyed the benefit of a stable administration at both the MEC and the PCU
until the change of government in August 15, 2008. This situation of stability trickled down to the rest of
the frontline units within the MEC involved in project implementation, as well as with the key staff at the
PCU.

On the downside, outstanding repayments by the GOP on another Bank-financed operation not related to
this project (the Eight Highway project) resulted in a 3 months delay in disbursements.

Another GOP shortcoming concerns the lack of Congress approval to MEC's request to replenish
secondary education textbooks and learning materials in the 2008, 2009 and 2010 budgets.

Rating: For the above reasons, the ICR rates the Borrower performance at implementation as moderately
satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: moderately unsatisfactory

This project was implemented by the MEC with support from the PCU. During the entire implementation
cycle there were effective linkages and excellent working coordination between the MEC, in charge of
project's pedagogical-related matters, except the infrastructure portion, and the PCU in charge of the
fiduciary aspects and provision of qualified technical assistance.

There was strong and decisive leadership from senior level officials in the MEC, in particular the Minister
and Vice-Minister of Education and the heads of the following MEC's frontline units which became key
stakeholders in the project's implementation cycle: (i) the General Directorate of Planning (in MEC's
reengineering through improved tools for planning and management); (ii) the General Directorate of
Secondary Education (championing the entire pedagogical scheme); (iii) the General Directorate of
Educational Development; (iv) the Directorate of Evaluation (SNEPE); (v) the General Directorate of
Higher Education (in the Pre and in-service teacher training and accreditation of teacher training
institutes); (vi) the Directorate of Curriculum (in the establishment of technical specifications for the
learning resources and textbooks); (vii) the Directorate of Scientific Upper Secondary (in the alternative
secondary education modality); and (viii) the Directorate General of Administration and Finance (in the
teacher certification and recruitment processes).



                                                    24
The PCU mirrored the stability that was present in MEC during the entire implementation cycle until
August 15, 2008. From loan effectiveness until September 2008, the PCU had only two coordinators.
The tenure of the first one lasted from January 2004 to the end of May 2007, and the second one from
June 2006 until September 2008. This situation benefited the entire implementation process and
contributed to a learning curve, which, in time, resulted in a more consistent financial and physical
implementation pattern. A third PCU coordinator was nominated by the new administration in December
2008 with the task to complete the first phase by December 30, 2009.

The education authorities of the new administration decided to streamline and overhaul the technical staff
at the PCU. With the exception of the PCU's financial coordinator, key PCU staff was replaced by
Ministry of Education personnel. Partly because of these changes, the implementation of some activities,
in particular civil works and the procurement of school furniture and learning goods for the two prototype
schools as well as for the hardware required in the MEC's reengineering process, suffered delays. As a
consequence, the civil works at the prototype schools were completed and the schools partially equipped
only at the end of 2009 (see Annex 2 for further details). This required an exceptional third extension to
the project closing date.

All the supervision missions benefited from meticulous and detailed progress reports prepared by the
MEC/PCU for all the 17 key activities comprised in the 7 project sub-components and 4 components
including the follow up on agreements reached in previous missions.

On the downside there were significant delays in carrying out the procurement processes for textbooks,
construction of the prototypes schools and CDEs and in selecting and contracting the consulting firm to
carry out the reengineering to improve planning and management of the MEC. These delays were partly
caused by the MEC's internal review and oversight processes to ensure transparency in all government
contracts and also to the fact that some procurement processes had to be declared void due to lack of
interested bidders. These delays also resulted in the request by GOP of three extensions to the closing
date, which were authorized by the Bank.

Weighing the strengths and weakness manifested by the implementing agency (MEC/PCU), especially
with respect to the procurement delays and the lack of impact in improving the efficiency of MEC's
management, but more particularly, the delay of ongoing project activities, the ICR rates the
implementing agency performance as moderately unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: moderately satisfactory

According to current ICR rating guidelines, the overall Borrower performance is rated moderately
satisfactory because the ratings of: (i) the government performance at the preparation stage was
moderately satisfactory; (ii) the government performance at the implementation stage was also
moderately satisfactory; (iii) the implementation agency performance was moderately unsatisfactory; and
(iv) the outcome (section 3.2 of the ICR) was rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

(a)      Political support and ownership is a key condition and a good predictor for success. The
stability existing within the MEC authorities throughout the entire lending and implementation cycles (up
to August 15, 2008) created the required conducive environment by limiting shifts in education policy and
implementation strategy and of changes in key implementation players. On the other hand, the revision
and appropriation of the ongoing project by the new education authorities resulted in a temporary delay of
project activities.

(b)      Ensuring implementation readiness conditions prior to negotiations leads to a more effective
and timely physical and financial execution cycle. The delays in physical and financial implementation
experienced by this project, especially in the period 2004-2006, could have been mitigated, had the Bank
team and management ensured appropriate implementation readiness conditions at the time of appraisal,
especially in the case of the acquisition of learning goods, construction of schools and CDEs, the
alternative secondary education modality and the in-service teacher training, just to mentioned some
examples.

(c)      Appropriate results framework is needed to inform the Borrower and Bank management
about progress towards achieving the expected project developmental objectives. First, the number
of outcome and output indicators has to be reduced to only a few ones to facilitate their timely updating,
reduce the cost of gathering and processing information and improve the relevancy of the information
(good practices recommend between three to four outcome indicators and a maximum of 3 output
indicators per project component). Second, there should be connectivity between the stated PDOs, the
outcome indicators being selected and the project design. Third, appropriate attributions should be
ensured to insulate changes in outcome indicators by actions outside the scope of the project.

(d) The logical chain that links project activities and outputs to the project outcomes should be
clear and include all factors that are present in that chain. Even though project outputs ­ which are
under the influence/control of the project - have been achieved the logical chain may have overlooked
other factors that are important to produce the desired project outcomes. Even though outputs have been
achieved the desired outcome may not achieved due to incomplete logical chain.

(e)      Cost-benefit analysis is required during the design of a project to avoid the inclusion of cost-
ineffective interventions - like the prototype schools - and have the appropriate technical arguments to
debate design options.

(f)     Complex project designs are likely to delay the physical and financial implementation
progress. The original project design included too many dimensions (17 different key activities packed
in 7 sub-components and 4 components), whose effective and timely addressing became an issue
throughout the entire implementation cycle. This would have required an early restructuring to simplify
the design based on the implementation progress evidence on the ground.

(g)     Local stakeholder participation is important to improve quality and efficiency at the school-
level. Ownership of the improvement process by stakeholders involved in deciding and implementing
their own interventions is a necessary, although not sufficient condition for effective change. Despite that
no impact evaluation was undertaken on the effect of the PEIs, PSPs and ACEs, it has been proven
elsewhere and documented internationally, that community mobilization in a conducive and decentralized
environment greatly contributes to facilitate the implementation of quality and efficiency measures.
Furthermore, if school principals that are natural leaders facilitate this local participation process and
participating teachers have most of their teaching load assigned to one particular school, the impact in the


                                                    26
envisaged changes are even stronger. This conducive environment was not present in a significant number
of the participating secondary schools in the project.

(h)     The choice of targeting approach is relevant for equity, transparency, program ownership
and effectiveness. The scholarship scheme is a good example of: (a) a targeted intervention that was
directed to poor secondary education students; (b) an operation that included transparent selection criteria
and was accountable to society; (c) a cost-effective investment as proven by the impact evaluation carried
out and reported accordingly in the sector work; and (d) a sustainable activity as proven by GOP's
decision to make this a regular program within MEC's annual budget.

(i)      Piloting in a small-scale prior to scale up contributes in the identification and addressing of
implementation obstacles when introducing new paradigms, especially in entrenched systems, like in the
case of the scholarship scheme.

(j)     Impact evaluation included at the onset of project implementation and monitoring are
needed as a means to correct course if it becomes necessary. They also provide appropriate information
to test alternative mechanisms, prior to scaling-up. The scholarship program is a good example.
Unfortunately, for reasons already explained, the leadership program, the in-service teacher training and
the school-community based strategies were not assessed with respect to their possible contribution to the
attainment of the project's PDOs.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

1. Borrower/implementing agencies

(i) What the project proposed to accomplish

The project design aimed to achieve improvements in the education system efficiency, in the quality of
education and in increased access, providing financial and technical resources for a set of strategic
initiatives. The objectives were defined in line with the following: (a) improve education system
management; (b) improve secondary education quality; and (c) expand access to secondary education.

(ii) What was achieved and what was not achieved - main causes

In terms of coverage, the enrolment rate increased significantly from 44 percent to 53 percent in the 2001-
2006 time period. However, this increase is still insufficient. The persistence of internal efficiency
problems in the education system, the worsening of socio-economic conditions of the students, and the
insufficient supply of education services are some of the main barriers to expand access to secondary
education.

With respect to learning quality, SNEPE results showed limited improvements in education achievement
for secondary students. Even though the project design included actions to improve learning quality, the
delayed implementation and the lack of coordination of these actions does not allow estimating the impact
of the interventions yet.

Some factors affected project implementation, including among other the following: delayed in
implementation, problems with the original design, exchange rate variations, expansion of textbooks
provision to the three grades in secondary education (10, 11, and 12), financial management, use of the
loan's availability balance, under-estimation of the costs of the civil works, change of government, etc.


                                                    27
(iii) Lessons learned

Although the goals for components and subcomponents have been achieved and, in some cases, the
results have been greater than expected at appraisal, some lessons have been learned from this experience
that can be useful for future projects:

1. The construction of a clear, articulated and concrete logical framework for the project, with objectives
   and results and impact indicators. The logical framework should be constantly supported by the
   monitoring and evaluation system to sustain continuous decision making and the introduction of
   adjustments during implementation;
2. The importance of having technically qualified and stable staff in the MEC line units involved with
   the implementation of the project. The staff should be committed to achieve the objectives for each
   activity in the project and should be accountable for its results. This way project sustainability would
   be technically guaranteed through the human resources capacity available at MEC. Staff should have
   access to updated information about the project budget to improve its efficiency, rationalization in the
   usage and optimization of financial resources; and
3. The intervention in the third cycle of the basic education (grades 7 ­ 9) is crucial to increase coverage
   in secondary education, one of the project's goals.

(iv) Relationship MEC/PCU (Program Coordination Unit) with the Bank

1. The World Bank's Team and technical staff working for the project were open to continuously
   evaluate the implementation progress;
2. Even though the relationship MEC/PCU with the Bank was in general satisfactory, the
   implementation of project activities and their effectiveness to achieve the envisioned goals were
   affected by local rules both at the MEC, the central level and the Minister of Finance; and
3. Finally, the lack of staff stability in the key areas of the PCU created delays in the implementation of
   the planned project activities.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

This section describes the outputs of each of the four components, seven sub-components and 17 key
activities included in the original project design as well as the sources of financing. Two cost tables are
presented to substantiate the story provided in the ICR: (a) the documented expenditure by component
and by source of financing at appraisal and at the time of the closing of the loan; and (b) the documented
expenditure by category and by source of financing at appraisal and at the time of the closing of the loan.

Component A ­ Improved tools for planning and management of the education system. According
to Table A2.1 below, this component estimated to cost US$8.86 million (US$8.52 million from the loan
and US$0.34 million from GOP), ended up documenting expenditures amounting to US$8.08 million
(US$6.81 million from the loan and US$1.27 million from GOP), 91.2 percent of the total estimated at
appraisal. This slight financial shortfall is mainly explained by the significant delays in implementing a
more limited version of the management re-engineering of the MEC as well as the pre and in-service
teacher training models developed by the project and the unsatisfactory attainment of the social
communication activities. The following is the assessment of the 7 key activities included under this
Component A.

Enhancement of macro and micro-planning. The implementation of this activity under Component A is
rated satisfactory. The project was able to contribute technically, although not financially, to the
implementation of a competency-based screening and selection process of new teachers that has been
institutionalized in MEC since 2004. This scheme has provided transparency and accountability into the
hiring of new teachers for the public school system.

In addition, the statistical management information system, as well as the micro-planning (school
mapping) units in the central MEC and all the UDEs in the country were strengthened, including the
provision of the required training for the staff. All the educational statistical data was validated. As a
consequence, MEC is able to produce on an annual basis a timely and reliable educational statistics of the
entire country disaggregated by different concepts. The official statistics for the school year 2008 is
available, and a preliminary version for the school year 2009 is ready. This information is key for the
decision-making processes. In addition, updated school-mapping information, to balance the supply of
available school capacity at all levels of education with the projected demand for services, is available for
the entire country.

Management re-engineering. The management re-engineering process financed by the project was
envisaged as the new tool to enable a more effective management of the education sector in the entire
country linking in an articulated and timely fashion the personnel and financial resources and student
certification management information systems. The target set at appraisal for this process was to have
this system designed, validated by the MEC's key stakeholders (Dirección General de Talento Humano
and the Dirección General de Administración y Finanzas) and fully operational in the central MEC and
all its supervisory coordination units of the city of Asuncion at the closing of the loan. This target was
partially accomplished. By late 2009 the system was designed, validated and set in motion in only two
areas of central MEC (the Dirección General de Administración y Finanzas and the Dirección General de
Talento Humano), but not in the supervisory coordination units of Asuncion. It is expected to have the
system fully operational in the central MEC and all the supervisory coordinations of the city of Asuncion
during 2010.

The ICR identified three main reasons for this shortfall - considerable delay in selecting and contracting a
qualified consulting firm, limitation on the availability of project-related financial resources and the


                                                     30
arrival of new authorities that reviewed the procurement process for the acquisition of a server and
required computers for almost 7 months after taking charge of the MEC ending canceling this intended
purchase.

It took almost three years after Board approval to complete the selection process for a qualifying
consulting firm in 2006 through an international competitive bidding process. Unfortunately, the selected
firm backed out at the last moment due to a refusal by the MEC to a request of the firm to renegotiate the
price after the selection process was completed. It seems that the consulting firm underbid its pricing to
win the competition and then tried to renegotiate the price once it was selected. A decision was then made
by the Borrower, and agreed with the Bank, to offer the contract to the firm that came second in the
selection process. This new consulting firm signed the contract with MEC in March 30, 2007. By
December 31, 2009, the development of the system had been completed and validated in two areas of the
central MEC; (ii) a provisional Data Center had been established for the validation of the system; (iii) the
migration of the old data base to the new system had been completed; and (iv) all the procedural and
organizational Manuals were completed, revised and approved by MEC.

In addition, the reallocation of loan proceeds to cover significant increases in the civil works category of
expenditure, the appreciation of the Guaraní on a US dollar-based loan with expenditures in local
currency and a higher than expected cost for this key project activity as compared to the projected costs at
appraisal, limited the availability of resources to acquire the required hardware to implement the re-
engineering process and pilot it in the central MEC and the city of Asuncion. An international
procurement process launched by the outgoing administration in late July 2008 to acquire the server and
computers to validate and the implement the system was declared void in November 2008 by the
incoming administration (mostly for political reasons but arguing that none of the bidders satisfied the
eligibility criteria). MEC ended up supporting the validation process with limited existing hardware
(server and computers), far short of the amount required by the project design.

The ICR has therefore no factual evidence concerning how this envisaged re-engineering scheme is going
to be used to achieve the stated objectives of increased managerial efficiency, effectiveness, opportunity
and transparency through a more effective articulation of the various management information systems.
Accordingly, and balancing the achievements with the shortfalls, especially the purposeful stalling of an
ongoing procurement process, the ICR ranks the accomplishment of this line of activity as moderately
unsatisfactory.

Construction of CDEs. As explained in section 1.6 of the ICR, although it was not made explicit in
Schedule 2 of the LA, during the implementation cycle, the Bank agreed to support the construction of 5
CDEs out of the 8 considered by the MEC in the Departments of Caacupé, Caazapá, Concepción,
Encarnación and Filadelfia. All the CDEs, with the exception of the one in Caazapá, have been
satisfactorily completed and received by MEC, although with significant delay with respect to the
contracted timetable. By December 31, 2009, the construction firm in charge of Caazapá had not been
able to comply with the observations made by the fiscalizadora (on-site supervision) preventing the MEC
to consider this work as completed. For this reason and the delays incurred in the completion of the other
CDEs, the ICR ranks this activity as moderately satisfactory.

Design and approval by MEC of an accreditation system for pre-service and in-service teacher-training
institutes and a certification system for MEC professionals, administrative staff and teachers. The ICR
rates this activity under Component A as satisfactory as it timely achieved and surpassed its expected
targets set at appraisal. This activity comprised two models. The first model to accredit and certify
teacher-training institutes was completed and approved by MEC under a formal Ministerial Resolution
(number 24,237) dated November 14, 2007. An Operational Manual was completed and approved by
MEC. This model is currently being applied in 20 teacher-training institutes. The National Agency for

                                                    31
Evaluation and Accreditation of Higher Education (Agencia Nacional de Evaluación y Acreditación de la
Educación Superior) has been charged by MEC as the official accreditation institution.

The second model to assess and certify professional educators was also completed and approved by MEC.
An Operational Manual has also been completed, approved and disseminated by MEC. These were the
targets set for this activity at appraisal and as such they have been attained. Furthermore, and despite the
political complexities, at the time of the writing of the ICR, this model is being applied to teachers of
basic and secondary education, albeit that the process is moving much faster with the basic education
teachers than with the secondary education teachers.

Both activities have been institutionalized under a recently created General Directorate for Teacher
Professional Development (Dirección General de Evaluación de la Carrera Magisterial recently renamed
Dirección General de Desarrollo Profesional del Educador).

The pre and in-service teacher training activity financed by the project surpassed its expected target set at
appraisal. The pre-service teacher training design (in the areas of basic and social sciences, Spanish,
Guaraní and mathematics) was finalized and approved by MEC and introduced in 13 training institutes,
way above the target included in Annex 1 of the PAD (30 percent of the official training institutes
meaning 5). This design aims at modifying the traditional subject-base pre-service training for secondary
education teachers to one based on areas/competencies to conform with the education reform that
modified the curriculum to one of learning areas. A total of 260 students (20 per institution) started their
pre-service training in the second semester of 2008 and are expected to graduate in the second semester of
2010.

Despite the achievement of the target, the ICR detected several weaknesses with the above-mentioned
model that need to be addressed urgently by MEC. By and large, the teacher trainers that are supposed to
deliver this model in the participating teacher-training institutes have very little or no experience at all
teaching the new secondary education curriculum (based on learning areas), because some of them have
never taught at secondary schools or have taught under the dated subject-based curriculum. The
likelihood that this new model might be somehow disconnected to the realities of secondary schools is not
minor. For this reason, these teacher trainers were provided additional training beyond the 240 hours
already delivered by the model (360 hours for reinforcement and 600 in the curricular area of interest).
The model urgently also requires a reality check through on-site follow up to ascertain if trained teachers
are applying the training received in their classrooms and assess if the model really addresses teaching
demands in secondary schools.

This activity also included in-service teacher training (locally called reconversión or plan transitorio) to
update secondary teachers that were prepared under the dated subject-based curriculum into the current
area/competency-based curriculum. There are different training models developed under this project
activity. One, covering 240 hours, was initially provided to about 178 teacher trainers working in the new
pre-service teacher training described in the paragraph above, followed by two more reinforcing training
of 360 and 600 hours each. Other training models combining a face-to-face classroom modality with
distance education included: (i) one comprising 1,300 hours benefiting teachers familiar with the area of
their teaching but lacking teaching pedagogical skills (about 12 percent of the total universe of teachers);
(ii) another, comprising 1,800 hours for teachers not familiar with the area assigned to them to teach in
secondary schools, conforming about 85 percent of the total universe of teachers; and (iii) one comprising
2,300 hours for specialized educational technicians working in secondary schools (about 3 percent of the
total universe). At the time of writing this ICR, about 1,730 teachers are undergoing the reconversión
scheme in any one of the three modalities described above. In addition, this activity also provided
training to 240 teachers and technical staff in the use of the secondary education textbooks acquired and


                                                     32
distributed under the project. A total of 34 teacher-training institutes are participating, of which 20
benefited with CRAs acquired under the project.

The ICR notes several shortcomings with this in-service teacher-training model. First, the dropout rate is
high in the order of 17 percent due to the following reasons (just in the last semester of 2009 about 10
percent of the participating teachers dropout from the training). Teachers do not receive any financial aid
for transportation to and from the in-service teacher-training sites, some of them located far away from
the participants' home and/or school of work. The long duration of the training models which oscillate
between 1,300 and 2,300 hours distributed in weekend classes. Training is provided during the weekends
disadvantageously competing with the teachers' free time. There is no field verification if trained
teachers are in fact changing teaching practices. Out of the 36 modules required by the in-service teacher
training only 12 have been completed at the time of writing this ICR.

Despite that these activities achieved or over-achieved their stated targets, the ICR rates this activity as
moderately satisfactory mainly because there has not been a field verification to ascertain if the in-
service teacher training model financed by the project has really achieved its objectives of changing
teaching practices and improving the teaching quality of secondary education teachers attuned to the new
area/competency-based curriculum.

Expansion of the student performance assessment system (SNEPE) for secondary education in the areas
of language, mathematics and critical thinking. The ICR considers the implementation of this activity
under Component A as highly satisfactory. In 2002, SNEPE established a learning assessment baseline
data to gauge future quality improvements based on the findings of the 2001 measurement. However this
baseline measuring learning on a content-based curriculum was not going to be comparable with
subsequent measurements measuring learning on a competency-based curriculum. Accordingly, a
decision was taken, and agreed with the Bank, to replace this baseline with the findings of a measurement
undertaken in 2006 on a sample basis of about 13,000 second grade secondary students of 378 secondary
schools (public and private, urban and rural) including the 100 project schools with PEIs. This
measurement will be comparable with the one to be carried out at the end of 2010 and then again in 2014.

An analysis on the determinant factors of learning was carried out with the 2006 baseline. Under SNEPE,
the MEC has installed some initial, although still insufficient capacity to continue writing and validating
test items, administering the tests, processing and analyzing the field data and synthesizing the findings to
support decision making-process in MEC. Finally, SNEPE has been institutionalized by the incoming
education authorities under the Dirección de Evaluación de la Calidad Educativa (DECE) depending of
the Directorate General of Planning within the MEC. Finally, at the time of the writing of the ICR, MEC
had just completed the validation of a testing instrument to be administered to all the graduates of grade
12 at the end of 2010.

Leadership program. This activity achieved its stated target set at appraisal ensuring that 98
professionals of MEC out of 100 that started completed their leadership program in two qualified
universities selected for this purpose following Bank procedures ­ the University of San Andres in
Buenos Aires, Argentina and the Alberto Hurtado of Santiago, Chile. The participants were grouped into
5 thematic areas: education policy (23 participants), education management (24 participants), learning and
learning resources (24 participants), learning assessment (18 participants) and curriculum (11
participants). Even though the project assumed that this activity was going to be evaluated before the
closing of the loan to ascertain working changes and possible short-term impact of these graduates in
improving the effectiveness of the MEC, the envisaged evaluation was never carried out. Accordingly,
the ICR does not have any evidence to measure the effectiveness and impact of this activity, beyond the
fact that 98 out of 100 professionals completed their program and that some of this graduates are currently
holding high-level positions within the current administration in MEC.

                                                     33
Field visits carried out during some of the last supervision missions highlighted that, by and large, the
hindering working context of these graduates has remained largely unchanged once they were reinserted
to their original jobs after completion of the leadership program. Under this situation is very likely that
the hindering constraints prevent these graduates from influencing changes in the education sector. The
ICR is of the view that, unless proven differently, the impact of the leadership activity has not been very
significant and rates it as moderately satisfactory.

Implementation of a national education communication plan to reach a diversity of stakeholders. The
ICR rates this activity as unsatisfactory. Despite having implemented a series of uncoupled tasks,
disseminated materials and carried out workshops and training for about 450 communication facilitators
(dinamizadores comunicacionales) under the project, the ICR could not find any solid evidence that a
social communication system was established to raise public awareness and garner greater support for the
education reform. Opposite to these original targets set at appraisal, the ICR is aware of some press and
TV releases during the implementation cycle criticizing some of the investments financed under the
project, in particular the prototype secondary schools.

Rating component A. Weighing the achievement as well as the shortfalls fully described above, the ICR
rates the overall implementation of this Component A as moderately satisfactory.

Component B ­ Secondary School Improvements. According to Table A2.1 below, this component
estimated to cost US$8.40 million (US$7.57 million from the loan and US$0.83 million from GOP),
ended up documenting expenditures amounting to US$7.68 million (US$6.75 million from the loan and
US$0.93 million from GOP), 91.3 percent of the total estimated at appraisal. This financial shortfall is
explained mainly by the transferring of financial resources from the category of goods under Component
B to civil works under Component C and by the drastic appreciation of the Guaraní preventing the
procurement of the science textbooks and other learning equipment. The assessment of the 4 key
activities under Component B follows.

Quality-learning inputs for secondary education - textbooks. This activity is rated by the ICR as
satisfactory. The project acquired and distributed about 547,000 textbooks of language (Spanish,
Guarani and English), mathematics, art and physical education for secondary education students attending
the three levels11 of about 1,757 public secondary schools as well as 45,000 teaching guides. Even though
the original design only included textbooks for the first grade of secondary education a decision was made
during the implementation, supported by the Bank, to extend the acquisition for the second and third
grades. This accomplishment becomes an historic landmark in the Paraguayan education history, as it is
the first time that secondary education students are provided with free textbooks. The expected life of the
textbooks acquired under the project is of 5 years. Alongside this distribution, the project carried out a
random sample follow-up of the use of these textbooks and teaching guides in the classrooms. The
preliminary findings showed an appropriate utilization of these learning resources by both teachers and
students.

The procurement process for textbooks for basic sciences, including 6 titles (two for physics, two for
chemistry and two for natural sciences) was declared deserted because the bidders did not satisfied the

11
  The first two levels of secondary education and some courses of the third level are common for all the students in
secondary education. Starting in the third level, secondary education branches into an academic stream and a
technical stream. The former prepares students for their continuing education in universities, while the latter
prepares for entry into technical colleges and/or technical tertiary institutions. The project only financed textbooks
of the first two levels and the common areas of the third level, expecting that under additional financing outside the
project, the stream-specific ones for the third level could be also procured under technical and pedagogical
specifications set for by the MEC.

                                                         34
expected technical specifications. Accordingly, the MEC developed the prototypes for these textbooks
under local resources outside the project. Lack of financial resources has prevented the MoPE for
printing these science textbooks. However the prototypes are available in the MEC's web portal. On the
downside, the Paraguayan Congress did not approve in the 2008, 2009 and 2010 budgets the MEC's
request for additional textbooks for secondary education.

Quality-learning inputs for secondary education ­ CRAs. This activity is rated by the ICR as
satisfactory. This project activity included the establishment of CRAs in targeted secondary schools,
including the prototype ones and in 20 selected teacher training institutes. The project provided the
required rehabilitation infrastructure of 74 spaces (14 new spaces constructed and 60 rehabilitated), four
more than the original design (the CRA in the third prototype school that was not constructed was
canceled). The project also financed the acquisition of a set of learning resources for each CRA, including
video-cassettes, TVs, computers, educational videos, books, camera, tape recorder, projector, maps.
There were four sets of learning materials depending on the size of the secondary school and/or the
training institute, being the largest set the one to be allocated to the two prototype schools. About 220
teachers (facilitators) were trained in the appropriate use of these CRAs. However, the ICR notes that for
about 30 percent of the CRAs, MEC has not yet authorized the position of CRA facilitator. In addition,
none of the CRAs include a security system to prevent against likely theft of the learning equipment.

Quality-learning inputs for secondary education ­ science laboratories. This activity is rated by the ICR
as satisfactory. The first international procurement process for the acquisition of 25 science laboratories
to be allocated to same number of targeted secondary schools was declared deserted. A second
procurement process for the acquisition of 24 science laboratories (the one of the third prototype school
was canceled) was started mid-2007 and the laboratories were installed in 22-targeted secondary schools
and the two prototype schools towards the end of 2009. About 1,000 operational manuals for the use of
these laboratories were prepared and distributed to the benefited secondary schools. There was an effort
during the latter part of the implementation cycle to articulate the use of textbooks, CRAs and science
laboratories in the benefited schools.

Management community-based strategies. The ICR rates this activity under Component B as moderately
satisfactory for the following reason. This activity was initially implemented in a disjoint fashion having
school stakeholders developed their PEIs and PSPs and ensuring that their ACEs were fully active
through separate and independent tracks under one technical coordinating group within the MEC/PCU.
Towards 2007, and resulting from persistent Bank recommendations during diverse supervision missions,
an effort was made by the MEC/PCU to correct course and integrate these three originally uncoupled
tasks into a more systemic and articulated approach through the establishment in each participating
secondary school of an Institutional Management Team (Equipo de gestión institucional ­ EGIs)
conformed by the school principal, two representatives of the school teachers, two of the parents and two
of the students. Under the EGI scheme, the school's PEI became the instrument that ordered and guided
the educational discussion among school stakeholders. EGIs became active in the 100 targeted secondary
schools with an approved PEI. The project financed the development and implementation of 100 PEIs
and 100 PSPs and supported 600 ACEs.

The project files reflect that the diverse Bank supervision missions attested to the fact that the
effectiveness and relevance of this activity was heavily dependent on two factors - the leadership of the
school principals chairing the EGI and the percentage of teachers with a significant time of their daily
teaching load allocated to the same school. In effect, participating secondary schools with natural leaders
chairing their EGI got more mileage out of their PEIs with respect to their contribution in attaining some
of the PDOs, in particular the one concerning increase enrollment, retention and completion rates in the
secondary level. Likewise, this synergy was also present in schools having a smaller percentage of the
so-called "taxi-teachers."

                                                    35
This activity was thought in the original project design as an appropriate instrument to enhance
community participation in the co-management of the school, improve the attitudinal climate among key
school stakeholders as well as the communication spaces, and contribute to achievement of the PDOs.
The underpinning assumption was that effective PEIs, relevant PSPs and active ACEs would become
necessary, although not sufficient conditions, to have participating secondary schools improve their
quality and efficiency-related performance. Although not refuting this key, and certainly proven
elsewhere assumption, the ICR found no systematic and documented evidence, beyond some anecdotic
one, to prove that this was the case in Paraguay under this project. As reported by the MEC/PCU, schools
with PEI increased their secondary education enrollment from 28,747 to 28,952 students in the period
2005-2007 implying an average annual growth of 0.4 percent while dropout decreased about 3.6 percent
in these schools in the same period. However no information was made available as to changes that
might have also occurred with comparable secondary schools without a PEI, thus no inference can be
made by the ICR about the impact of the PEIs on enrollment and retention. Another analysis made from
the findings of the SNEPE baseline of 2006 show that were no significant differences in learning
outcomes between schools with and without a PEI.

The assumed contribution of the PSPs and ACEs to the achievement of some of the project's PDOs is
even less clear to the ICR as no solid documented evidence to that effect was found.

Rating component B. Weighing the strengths and weaknesses described above, the ICR rates the overall
implementation of this Component B as satisfactory.

Component C ­ Mechanisms to Provide More Equitable Access to Secondary Education. According
to table A2.1 below, this component originally estimated to cost US$7.80 million (US$ 6.82 million from
the loan and US$ 0.98 million from GOP), ended up documenting expenditures amounting to US$8.83
million (US$7.80 million from the loan and US$1.03 million from GOP), 113.21 percent of the total
estimated at appraisal. The overspending in civil works mainly explains this difference. The following is
the assessment of the three key activities included under this component.

Scholarships. The ICR rates the implementation of this key project activity as highly satisfactory for the
following reasons. It achieved its stated goal of providing 4,500 scholarships to poor students in
secondary education. It was a targeted and transparent activity ensuring that only poor students in the
lower income-decile distribution received the benefit strictly following selection criteria and procedures
agreed with the Bank. It is an activity that was evaluated and the findings recorded in the sector work
mentioned elsewhere in the ICR. The findings attest to the fact that it was a cost-effective intervention.
The project financed the technical capacity build-up for MEC to manage the provision and monitoring of
the scholarship scheme. Finally, GOP has continued to provide scholarships to poor secondary education
students entering first grade. In addition to the accumulated 4,689 provided by the project in the 2004-06
period, the MEC has provided from its own financial resources 4,518 in 2007, 3,000 in 2008, 10,060 in
2009. This activity has been financially, institutional and technically sustained by the Borrower even
before the closing of the loan. The average amount of the scholarship has remained almost the same of
about US$261.40 equivalent per year per student.

Alternative Secondary Education (Educación Media Abierta ­ EMA). The ICR rates the implementation
of this activity as unsatisfactory for the following reason. At the time of Board approval, there was no
conceptual design of this alternative, and as a consequence, neither and operational description. For
almost three years after Board approval, the MEC and the PCU were conceptually struggling to
implement an alternative option under the advice of a non-qualified consultant lacking sufficient expertise
on this topic. By the end of 2006, the MEC started implementing EMA under an incorrect pedagogical


                                                    36
paradigm,12 with no teaching modules and printed material yet developed, nor appropriate staff trained.
About 600 out-of-school youngsters between the ages of 15 and 19 years old demanding secondary
education were initially enrolled in this option in 20 secondary schools of 4 Departments (Caaguazú,
Central, Cordillera and San Pedro) and Asunción during the second semester of 2006. At the time of the
writing of the ICR, active enrollment had decreased to 172 out of the initial class of 600 students and the
number of original schools to 17. Of this leftover enrollment, 76 students graduated in December 2009 ­
January 2010 period (more than 3.5 years after they started and longer than the school-based modality
requiring only 3 years). The remaining 96 students are likely to graduate during 2010. The improvisation
of a technically and operationally poorly-defined option was the main culprit of this significant dropout
rate. During the June 2007 supervision mission the Bank team strongly recommended against the
extension of this ill-defined model to a sixth Department (Chaco), recommendation that was followed up
by the authorities.

A qualified international consultant was retained by MEC to help the local team significantly modify the
entire approach to better address the needs of the out-of-school population intended to be served. Some
modules were prepared and tested along their evaluation guidelines; staff was selected and trained. The 15
curricular units comprising the 3 modules of this alternative modality (5 units per module) as well as their
corresponding evaluation booklets have been developed and printed. There are 60 trainers participating
in this modality. MEC has decided to temporarily suspend this option after the remaining students
graduate from this modality. The ICR is of the view that this modality has resulted in a cost-ineffective
alternative.

Prototype schools. The ICR rates the implementation of this activity as moderately unsatisfactory for
the following reasons. The ICR is of the opinion that this activity should not have been included in the
project design. As shown in the sector work, other alternatives included in the project design ­ like the
scholarships ­ resulted to be more cost-effective to increase and retain enrollment to secondary education,
especially benefiting poor students. Furthermore, during the several supervision missions, the Bank team
attested that smaller secondary schools, holding a maximum of about 500 students and with about one
sixth the square meters of the prototype schools were improving access and retention, and their learning
scores registered in the SNEPE baseline were above the average. A cost-benefit analysis done during the
preparation stage could have provided some clues to justify the inclusion of other alternatives and reject
the prototype schools path.

Prior to the launching of the procurement process to select a qualified construction firm, the pedagogical
areas of MEC, in particular the General Directorate of Secondary Education, the General Directorate of
Educational Development and the Directorate of Curriculum, objected to the prototype's architectural
design included and appraised in the PAD claiming that it was not attuned to the requirements of the
education reform in progress. Accordingly, the design was modified from 3,700 to 6,600 square meters
(78.4 percent increase in square footage) to serve about 750 students per shift in two shifts (for an
accumulated enrollment of 1,500 students per school) and the allocation to the civil works category of




12
   The pedagogical model of the alternative secondary option reviewed by the December 2006 Bank supervision
mission was in essence an extrapolation of the school-based secondary education curriculum. This option was
considered by the mission as inappropriate to address the needs of the out-of-school population and reflected this
opinion in the corresponding Aide-Memoire (paragraphs 50(a) to (d)). There was no modular structure, expecting
these students to attend classes of long duration, going against their time availability. There was no prior recognition
of learning acquired thus everybody had to start from the very beginning. The content was too academically and not
based on competencies to be acquired by the students at the end of each learning cycle.

                                                          37
expenditure of the loan increased from US$3.8 million to US$4.81 million, with Bank management
approval (26.6 percent increase).13

The December 2006 supervision mission alerted about the risk that, even in the event of completing these
schools on time, and targeting them to benefit mostly poor students living in their catchment areas, it was
going to be very unlikely for the GOP to replicate these prototypes elsewhere in the country, and difficult
to appropriately maintain them at the closure of the loan (paragraph 47 of the corresponding Aide-
Memoire). On average, it was estimated about 2 percent of the total cost for annual maintenance, once
the infrastructure started wearing out, implying for the prototype schools about US$50,000 per school. As
a consequence of this significant change, the Bank team objected to the construction of 3 prototype
schools, and the one in Fernando de la Mora, presenting more complicated construction challenges, was
eliminated from the project along its learning goods requirements.

The procurement process was thus delayed. The construction of the school in Luque started on April 16,
2007 and the one in Caaguazú in April 23, 2007, almost 4 years after Board approval. The issue of
construction oversight by a third qualified party (fiscalizadora) for these two large projects, satisfactory to
the Bank, was not resolved until the end of 2007. As a consequence, the Bank did not authorize eligible
disbursements against this category of expenditure from April to November 2007, thus delaying further
the implementation progress. In February 2008, part of the ceiling of the Luque school amounting to 5
percent of the total construction square footage collapsed and the construction was halted for several
months until a structural review presented its findings and responsibilities to fix the problem were
determined and agreed upon among the key stakeholders (MEC/PCU, the designing consulting firm, the
construction firm and the oversight firm).

The May 2008 Bank supervision mission detected serious safety issues in both prototype schools that
were not addressed in the original design included in the PAD nor in the modified design that was
procured. No protecting railing was considered in the staircases connecting the four floors of each school.
There was a significant likelihood of a student or teacher fatality as a consequence of somebody
accidentally falling in the building's staircase shaft. Addressing these safety issues demanded a
reallocation of the now limited loan proceeds. In addition, the drastic fluctuation of the local currency
against the dollar, the construction price increases, especially of cement and steel and the under-
estimation of unit projected costs, had adverse effects on timely decisions on the utilization of available
loan resources.

The prototype school in Caaguazú was completed at the end of 2008 and is functioning since February
2009 at minimal capacity (16 percent) with 245 students in two shifts (133 students in first grade and 112
in second grade) with a total of 19 teachers. The CRA, the computers and the science laboratories were
made functional at the start of 2010 school year. The civil works of the prototype school in Luque were
completed by December 2009. This school is operating at minimal capacity with 146 students in first
grade (9.7 percent) with 15 teachers. MEC has expressed its intention to complement the utilization of
these under-utilized premises with teacher training, education research and community-related activities.

The new education authorities have let the Bank know about their annoyance concerning the construction
of these two prototype schools, seen by them as "white-elephant projects" not meriting the financial
investments allocated to them. They have voiced their criticism publicly in the press. As mentioned
before, the reputation risk for the Bank is high. The challenge now is to have these two prototype schools


13
   This increase also required augmenting the counterpart funding from the original US$0.38 million to US$0.55
million (44.7 percent increase). Adding the loan proceeds with the counterpart funding, the total allocation for the
civil works category of expenditure jumped from US$4.18 million to US$5.36 million (28.2 percent).

                                                        38
functioning at maximum capacity as soon as possible and to target their utilization to better serve poor
secondary students and the community in the area of influence.

The existing potential to fully exploit these two schools in the near-future to best address the PDOs makes
the ICR rate this activity as moderately unsatisfactory instead of unsatisfactory.

Rating component C. Weighing the highly satisfactory rating for the scholarship scheme, with the
unsatisfactory ratings for the alternative secondary option and the moderately unsatisfactory rating for the
prototype schools, the ICR rates the overall implementation of this Component C as moderately
unsatisfactory.

Component D ­ PCU. According to table A2.1 below, this component originally estimated to cost
US$1.2 million (US$ 1.09 million from the loan and US$ 0.11 million from GOP), ended up
documenting expenditures amounting to US$2.28 million (US$1.44 million from the loan and US$0.84
million from GOP), 190 percent of the total estimated at appraisal. The increase was partially caused by
the operating costs that went from 310,000 estimated at appraisal to 530,000 at the time of writing the
ICR (71 percent increase) to cover PCU staff, office rent, office materials and supplies, transportation and
communication expenses for 30 months longer than expected at appraisal.14

The ICR highlights the effective working articulation existing between the PCU in charge of the project-
related fiduciary aspects (procurement and financial management) and the selection and hiring of required
technical assistance financed by the loan and the MEC, through the Vice-minister, in charge of the
implementation of all project-related substantive aspects. The only area that escaped the effective and
timely oversight of the Vice-minister and the PCU was the civil works sub-component, whose first
coordinator (selected following Bank procedures) ended up acting as a free agent directly accountable to
the Minister of Education. This was also another, among many reasons, that resulted in a moderate
unsatisfactory implementation of the civil works financed under the project. This coordinator resigned
before the change of government.

This component included two additional activities ­ monitoring and evaluation and project management.
The implementation of the monitoring and evaluation is a mixed story. On the upside, there was an
evaluation of the scholarship scheme whose findings are explained elsewhere in the ICR and detailed in
the sector work referred to in Annex 9 of the ICR. The PCU timely provided updated physical and
financial implementation progress information and prepared extensive and detailed progress reports prior
to the start of every supervision mission.

On the downside, the project was not able to contract impact evaluation studies of other key activities of
the project, like inter-alia, the leadership program, the in-service teacher training and the community-
based strategies. Despite the findings and recommendations made by a qualified consultant on the design
of a more comprehensive, crosscutting, relevant, reliable and timely monitoring system to follow up on
inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes beyond the ones described in the paragraph above and inform
with respect to the achievements of stated final and intermediate goals, this system was not fully
developed, less implemented.

Another management shortcoming was the lack of proactivity of the PCU Coordinator and the financial
specialist, letting in many occasions, especially mid-2007 onwards, to very shortsighted reactive decisions

14
   According to the PCU records provided to the ICR, the number of full-time and part-time consultants paid under
this component where: (i) 30 in 2004; (ii) 49 in 2005; (iii) 109 in 2006; (iv) 117 in 2007; (v) 64 in the first semester
of 2008; (vi) 45 in the second semester of 2008; (vii) 24 in the first semester of 2009; and (vi) about 10 from July
2009 onwards fully paid by counterpart resources.

                                                          39
hindering a timely implementation of key project activities, especially concerning procurement.
Ironically, this lack of strategic vision by the PCU coordinator will generate a serious disconnect between
the need to timely acquire learning goods and services and ensuring the availability of authorized loan and
counterpart resources to proceed. For example, the 2009 project budget requested by the PCU coordinator
of US$1.5 million was about half the required financial needs. Accordingly, about US$1.2 million
equivalent of loan proceeds will not be disbursed at the closing of the loan.

Rating component D. Given the strengths reflected by the achievement of several of the project
activities fully described elsewhere in the ICR for which the PCU was a significant contributor and the
weaknesses described above, especially lack of strategic managerial approach from mid-2007 to the
closing of the loan, the ICR rates the performance of the PCU as moderately satisfactory.

According to table A2.1, the total project cost estimated at appraisal was US$26.5 million equivalent,
corresponding US$24 million equivalent from the Bank (91 percent of the total) and US$2.50 million
equivalent from the GOP (9 percent of the total). At the time of the closing of the loan, the total
documented expenditure amounted to US$27.11 million equivalent (102.3 percent of the appraised total),
corresponding US$22.80 million equivalent from the Bank (95 percent of the appraised total) and
US$4.31 million equivalent from the GOP (172.4 percent of the appraised total).

The under spending in Component A against the appraised estimate (91.2 percent) is explained by: (a) the
delay in having the MEC's reengineering completed and the shortfall in the amount of hardware, in
particular the required server and computers, that the project could not acquire for having the MEC cancel
the procurement process at the end of 2008; (b) the reallocation of loan proceeds from this component to
the construction of the two prototype schools; and (c) the limited budget authorized for 2009 which was
not attuned to the project requirement for this particular year. The slight under spending in Component B
against the appraised estimate (91.3 percent) is explained by the acquisition of one less science laboratory
and CRA than the total included in the original design and the no acquisition of science books. Despite
that one prototype school was dropped, the increase in the allocation of resources to the civil works
resulted in a real spending of Component C 13.21 percent above the appraised estimate. The significant
overspending in the management of this project against the appraised estimate (190 percent) is an
indication that the management of this project was far from efficient.

The table A2.2 above indicates relevant overspending against the appraised estimates in civil works
(156.7 percent), consultants (171.6 percent) and operating costs (170.97 percent) and under spending in
goods (73.15 percent) and training (78.9 percent). Spending in scholarships mirrors the appraised
estimate. Due to the little amount allocated to the socio community activities their overspending does not
really alter the big picture neither the explanation that follows.

The ICR has fully explained elsewhere the reasons of the overspending in civil works, consultants and
operating costs as well as the under spending in goods. The significant delays in having started the
implementation of the pre-service and in-service teacher training partially explains the under spending in
the training category of expenditure.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)

The Net Present Value (NPV) was US$3.8 million and the estimated Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
was 15 percent, considering a 10-year time horizon since the beginning of the project. The estimated NPV
and ERR for a 20-year time horizon since the beginning of the project were US$ 25.4 million and 33
percent, respectively. The Cost-Benefit Analysis was re-estimated to calculate the NPV and the ERR
using end of the program actual values.

The Cost-Benefit analysis in the PAD considered the following costs and benefits:

    1. Benefits



    1.1     Benefits due to higher enrollment: The higher number of secondary graduates expected from
            the scholarships, the new schools built, and the alternative secondary program would increase
            the number of graduates and, therefore, increase their future earnings streams.
    1.2     Benefits due to quality improvements: The program was expected to increase quality and
            efficiency at the secondary level (reducing both repetition and dropout rates). This increase in
            efficiency would generate savings in recurrent costs at the secondary level.
    1.3     Potential savings due to re-allocation of students: The strengthening of the Ministry of
            Education's Planning Unit and the strengthening of the leadership and managerial skills of
            the educational system leaders were expected to make a more efficient allocation of students
            across schools in the education system. This re-allocation would increase the number of
            students per section, which in turn would reduce the Teachers' Salaries Budget (no
            replacement of the teachers who retire).


    2. Costs



    2.1     Capital Expenditure: Included in the PAD were investments and expenses financed with the
            IBRD loan (US$ 23.27 million).
    2.2     Recurrent Expenditure: In the PAD this included the government's financial contribution to
            the program (US$ 10.13 million).
    2.3     Forgone Income: The income that the new secondary education graduates would have
            received if they would have worked instead of attending school.
    2.4     Incremental Expenditure due to higher enrollment: The decrease in repetition and dropout
            rates in secondary education would generate savings (as mentioned in benefit 1.2 above) but
            would also increase current expenditure, for example, the Teacher's Salaries Budget.

These benefits and costs for the 10 year scenario are summarized in Table 1 below.

The Cost Benefit Analysis was re-estimated to calculate the NPV and the ERR using end of the program
actual values. The model remained the same as in the appraisal; however the following changes were
introduced due to the end of program actual values:15

     1. The number of graduates was adjusted to reflect the lower number of graduates students due to
        the construction of two prototype schools as opposed to the three included in the original CB
        analysis and the lower coverage of the alternative secondary program. As mentioned he number
        of scholarships met expectations (9,000 students). This change decreases the benefits due to
        higher enrollment in the model, and therefore decreases the NPV.
     2. The reduction in Teachers' Salaries Budget was not as successful as expected. Based on
        budgetary information it was estimated that the reduction in Teachers' Salaries Budget was
        approximately 20 percent of one originally included in the PAD's estimates. This change
        decreases the NPV.
     3. The capital expenditure was reduced from US$ 23.7 million originally included in the PAD to
        US$ 22.8 million which was the actual financial information at the end of the program. This
        change will increase the NPV.
     4. The recurrent expenditure (government's financial contribution) was reduced from US$ 10.13
        million originally included in the PAD to US$ 4.0 million which was the actual financial
        information at the end of the program. This change will increase the NPV.
     5. The opportunity cost (foregone income) was lower than the one originally included in the PAD
        because of the lower number of new graduates. This change will increase the NPV.

Table 2 presents the detail of the calculation using a 10 year time period. The estimates indicate a
negative NPV of US$ 1.4 million and a revised ERR of 8 percent. Under this scenario (10 years) the
project could not be considered a good social investment. However it is important to highlight two
aspects. First, the Cost Benefit Analysis model used at project preparation did not quantify the benefits
associated with a more educated labor force. These benefits may have two types of effects: (i)
productivity and growth effects above the direct income increases that beneficiaries are receiving, and (ii)
lower risks of unemployment that more educated people face. Additionally, intangible benefits were not
included (e.g. aesthetic appreciation, better health, and better voting behavior and social behavior that
research has linked to increases in education). If these benefits would have been quantified and included
in the analysis at appraisal the expected direction of the effects would be an increased NPV and an
increased ERR.16 Second, a longer time horizon would change this result. For example, using a 15 year
time period since the beginning of implementation would make the project to break even using end of
program values and considering a 20 year time period the estimations indicate a revised NPV of
US$600,000 and a revised ERR of 11 percent.17

   The average promotion rate for the last three years of secondary education was 83.8 percent in the year 2000. An
increase of 10 points in the average score of a standardized test was estimated to increase the promotion rate by 5
percentage points, generating savings in recurrent costs. According to the Government information, the average
score of the standardized test increased in 10 points from 2001 to 2008 (from 44 points to 54 points) and the
promotion rate for secondary education also increased as expected (from 83.8 percent to 88.8 percent, 5 percentage
points). Therefore, the benefits due to quality improvements did not change in the revised analysis.
16
   The analysis conducted in this report did not make an attempt to value these benefits.
17
   The selection of the time horizon is an option of the analysis but it is expected that the benefits of these
intervention are closer to 15 years since the beginning of the implementation of the project rather than the 10 year
considered in the PAD.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

                            MEC's Contribution to the ICR - Summary

1. What the project proposed to accomplish

The project design aimed to achieve improvements in the education system efficiency, in the
quality of education and in increased access, providing financial and technical resources for a set
of strategic initiatives. The objectives were defined in line with the following: (a) improve
education system management; (b) improve secondary education quality; and (c) expand access
to secondary education.

2. What was achieved and what was not achieved - main causes

In terms of coverage, the enrolment rate increased significantly from 44 percent to 53 percent in
the 2001-2006 time period. However, this increase is still insufficient. The persistence of internal
efficiency problems in the education system, the worsening of socio-economic conditions of the
students, and the insufficient supply of education services are some of the main barriers to
expand access to secondary education.

With respect to learning quality, SNEPE results showed limited improvements in education
achievement for secondary students. Even though the project design included actions to improve
learning quality, the delayed implementation and the lack of coordination of these actions does
not allow estimating the impact of the interventions yet.

Some factors affected project implementation, including among other the following: delayed in
implementation, problems with the original design, exchange rate variations, expansion of
textbooks provision to the three grades in secondary education (10, 11, and 12), financial
management, use of the loan's availability balance, under-estimation of the costs of the civil
works, change of government, etc.

3. Lessons learned

Although the goals for components and subcomponents have been achieved and, in some cases,
the results have been greater than expected at appraisal, some lessons have been learned from this
experience that can be useful for future projects:

    (a) The construction of a clear, articulated and concrete logical framework for the project,
        with objectives and results and impact indicators. The logical framework should be
        constantly supported by the monitoring and evaluation system to sustain continuous
        decision making and the introduction of adjustments during implementation;
    (b) The importance of having technically qualified and stable staff in the MEC line units
        involved with the implementation of the project. The staff should be committed to
        achieve the objectives for each activity in the project and should be accountable for its
        results. This way project sustainability would be technically guaranteed through the
        human resources capacity available at MEC. Staff should have access to updated
        information about the project budget to improve its efficiency, rationalization in the
        usage and optimization of financial resources; and
    (c) The intervention in the third cycle of the basic education (grades 7 ­ 9) is crucial to
        increase coverage in secondary education, one of the project's goals.

                                                50
4. Relationship MEC/PCU (Program Coordination Unit) with the Bank

   (a) The World Bank's Team and technical staff working for the project were open to
       continuously evaluate the implementation progress;
   (b) Even though the relationship MEC/PCU with the Bank was in general satisfactory, the
       implementation of project activities and their effectiveness to achieve the envisioned
       goals were affected by local rules both at the MEC, the central level and the Minister of
       Finance; and
   (c) Finally, the lack of staff stability in the key areas of the PCU created delays in the
       implementation of the planned project activities.
