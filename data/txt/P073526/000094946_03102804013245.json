This\n            environmental assessment looks specifically at the potential\n            environmental adversity resulting from the construction of\n            schools, mainly in marginal urban areas of Asuncion, and the\n            districts of Fernando de la Mora, Luque, Caaguazu, and\n            Ciudad del Este, and suggests the following mitigation\n            measures. Engineering designs should carefully consider\n            adequate sewage treatment, and drainage systems to avoid\n            water pollution, and public health hazards. Construction\n            debris, and wastes should be appropriately stored in covered\n            tanks until final disposal at selected landfills, in\n            accordance with the country's regulations. This should\n            be the contractors' responsibility, stipulated through\n            precautionary clauses contained in the bidding documents.\n            Likewise, the contractor shall be responsible for the\n            installation of protective barriers, contouring the\n            construction sites, so as to minimize air pollution, and\n            noise disturbances. Traffic safety measures, such as road\n            signals, and/or access roads/detours signs, should be\n            established following the standard national, and\n            international traffic safety measures. Deforestation should\n            be avoided as possible, while re-vegetation practices should\n            follow once the construction phase is completed."}, "docdt": "2003-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
