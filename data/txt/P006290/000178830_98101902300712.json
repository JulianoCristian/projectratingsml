the program for\n            the expansion of the power subtransmission and distribution\n            systems during the years 1978 through 1981 of three public\n            electric power utilities in the South and Southeast of\n            Brazil: Centrais Electricas de Minas Gerais S.A. (CEMIG),\n            Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina S.A. (CELESC), and\n            Espirito Santo Centrais Eletricas S.A. (ESCELSA). The\n            utilities' overall program, of which the project forms\n            a part, will provide the facilities required to serve the\n            expected loads in the respective utilities' service\n            areas, mostly related to industrial growth. The program will\n            also be instrumental in making public service electricity\n            available to about 62,000 new low-income urban consumers and\n            in connecting about 48,000 new rural consumers. The project\n            also includes the acquisition of communications and control\n            equipment for CEMIG, and about 80 man-months of consulting\n            services for CELESC and ESCELSA for supervision of\n            construction of 138 kV facilities and for preparation of\n            bidding documents."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
