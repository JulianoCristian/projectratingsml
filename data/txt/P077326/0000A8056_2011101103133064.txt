                         participatory decisionmaking at the village, Kum Banh, and district levels.

                         government level to support participatory decision-making at village and district levels. The participation of local government officials in district decision meetings has risen to 70%,

                         An evaluation of the utilization rates and overall satisfaction rates of such infrastructure as well as of the capacity-building efforts are currently under way for incorporation in the
                         implementation completion report (ICR). Delays in the completion of these two final evaluations mean that outcome data for a number of performance indicators specified in the
