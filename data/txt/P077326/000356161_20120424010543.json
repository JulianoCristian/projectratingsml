         outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: poverty targeting requires clearly\n            defined frameworks and monitoring. The initial problems and\n            the time taken to identify and resolve the poverty targeting\n            approach suggest that future operations will benefit from\n            clearer design targets, stronger indicators, improved\n            assessment and closer monitoring. The lesson from the Lao\n            experience is that this trade off can be justified given the\n            specific poverty reduction objectives, the intention to\n            reach villages in remote mountainous regions and the need to\n            'protect' the participatory and multi-sector\n            demand-driven approach-all of which would likely have been\n            compromised if the project had been delivered through\n            centralized, top-down line departments without the\n            experience, capacity for outreach or commitment to innovate.\n            More rigorous qualitative analysis and experimental\n            fieldwork, especially in relation to voice and engagement,\n            and capacity building should be conducted as the project\n            proceeds, with far increased budgets and efforts to appoint\n            skilled consultants that have a track record elsewhere."}, "docdt": "2012-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
