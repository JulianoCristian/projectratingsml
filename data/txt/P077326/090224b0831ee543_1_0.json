Lao is trying to graduate from least-developed\n            country status and join the ranks of middle-income countries\n            by 2020. But in a country that includes more than 47\n            different ethnic groups and in which 70 percent of people\n            live on less than 2 dollars a day, particularly in remote\n            rural areas, poverty alleviation programs needed to put\n            local people in the driver\u2019s seat to make headway. PRF\n            empowered the poor, women and ethnic minorities in rural\n            villages to assess their own needs and priorities, and built\n            capacity for them to plan, built and managed local\n            infrastructure in a decentralized and transparent manner.\n            The priorities based on community requests were safe water\n            supply, access roads, primary schools, health clinics,\n            irrigation systems and village markets. As a result, more\n            than 900 villages have access to clean water, 460 schools\n            and 40 health clinics have been built in remote villages,\n            2,000 kilometers of rural access roads have been upgraded,\n            70 bridges have been built, and 1,900 training sessions in\n            infrastructure maintenance and usage and vocational skills\n            were provided to participating villagers"}, "docdt": "2009-09-29T04:31:05Z"}
