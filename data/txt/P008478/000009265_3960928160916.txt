MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL BANK OF HUNGARY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF HUNGARY
FOR A FINANCIAL SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the National Bank of Hungary for US$66 million equivalent, to help finance a
financial system modernization project, is submitted for approval. The proposed
loan would have fifteen years maturity with five years grace and carry thte Bank's
standard variable int2re,st rate.
2.          Background.   The financial system in Hungary has evolved rapidly
since the establishment Of the uwo-tier banking system in 1987.  The system
consists of a banking system--comprising the central bank, fifteen domestic
commercial banks, se-en specialized financial institutions, and four joint
venture banks with foreign participation--, a nascent securities market, four
insurance companies, and the social security system. As part of overall economic
liberalization, the Government has also embarked on a major reform of financial
policies, institutions and instruments. Management of monetary and credit policy
is now by indirect instruments, deposit and lending interest rates are
increasingly market based, banking services for households and enterprises are
being integrated, and foreign exchange operations are being decentralized. A
new Central Bank Law is expected to be approved in '990, while a new Banking Law
is under preparation to permit its approval in the fourth quarter of 1990. The
new Banking Law would establish a comprehensive framework for bank operations
in Hungary, and would strengthen the banking supervisory function as well as the
prudential regulations for banks. Recent corporate legislation has facilitated
the development of the incipient securities market, and a new Secarities Market
Law has been approved in January 1990.
3.          The agenda for deepening and expansion of the financial sector
involves actions in two broad areas, namely: (i) policy actions to improve
efficiency of mobilization and allocation of financial resources; and (ii)
modernization and strengthening of the regulatory framework and institutions of
the financial system. Policy issues in the first area have been addressed in
the industrial sector adjustment loan (ISAL) approved in June 1988 and will be
deepened under a proposed SAL, including the maintenance of a positive real
refinancing rate by NBH, and steps to reduce subsidies on housing finance to
permit the maintenance of positive real deposit rates for households, which will
allow the further integration of the household and enterprise banking sectors.
Shortcomings in the second area include the weak policies and procedures of the
banks, obsolete banking technology and infrastructure, and indications of weak
loan portfolios of the major banks.   The officially reported quality of the
portfolios of some of these banks is likely to be overstated due to inadequate
prudential regulations with respect to interest accrual, loan classificat,on and
provisioning standards, and lending concentration by borrowers and sectors. A
poor accounting and auditing framework, coupled with weaknesses in financial
skills and related training capacities, further constrain financial system
development. The project would help to address these institutional weaknesses.
In line with the sequencing of the Government's reform agenda in the financial



- 2 -
sector, the phasing of the modernization program would progress from the banking
sector to other areas such as the securities market, housing finance, and social
security. The project would support the first phase of the medium-term action
program in this area.
4.          Country Assistance Strategy.   Since lending to Hungary began in
1983, the Bank's country assistance strategy has focussed on supporting Hungary's
program of reform and structural adjustment to make the economy more efficient,
flexible, market-oriented and competitive in convertible currency markets. In
recent years, this strategy has been implemented mainly through a series of
hybrid loans for industrial restructuring, combining quick-disbursing funds to
support institutional and policy reform, and investment funds to support
restructuring at the enterprise and subsector levels. Investment loans in other
s'zctors have also supported implementation of the reform, as well as improvement
in enterprise efficiency. Following the adoption by the Government in 1987 of
a medium-term program of stabilization and adjustment to correct imbalances
created by economic deterioration, the Bank stepped up its support to the reform
through the above mentioned ISAL. That loan, combined with an IMF Standby in
1988, provided crucial external support to strengthen the Government's increased
reform and adjustment efforts.  Regarding the financial sector, the Bank has
worked with the Hungarian authorities to analyze the development constraints and
priorities in a collaborative review of the sector.   The preparation of the
review formed the basis for the policy dialogue on the major issues affecting
the development of the banking system and securities markets in the context of
the policy matrix agreed under the first and second industrial restructuring
projects as well as the ISAL.  The roles of the Bank and IFC in Hungary have been
complementary and, with regard to financial sector reforms, collaborative.  In
the context of the project, the Bank and IFC have worked together closely in
providing advice on the further development of the securities market.
5.          The  Bank's  assistance  strategy  will  continue  to  support  the
Government in carrying out its adjustment efforts. It will address medium to
long term constraints to sustainable growth, assist in developing institutional
capacity in line with systemic reforms and help ensure Hungary's continued access
to external financing. This strategy will be implemented through both adjustment
and investment lending operations.
6.          Rationale  for  Bank  Involvement.    In  the  context  of  project
preparation, the Bank Group has made considerable contributions to the
development of the regulatory framework and supervisory functions of both the
banking system and securities markets.   It has been actively involved in the
preparation of the scope of the proposed new Banking Law, including the related
prudential banking regulations, as well as in preparing the new Securities Market
Law.  The Bank has further developed with the Government the framework for a
detailed review of the portfolio condition of the major Hungarian commercial
banks and for a follow up program of financial restructuring. The Bank has also
carried out a critical analysis of the institutional capacities of the major
banks, on the basis of which tailor-made action programs were developed for each
bank. Continued Bank involvement would help ensure the timely implementation
of the recommendations, which would help to accelerate restructuring at the
enterprise level by inducing financial discipline and making available investment
resources based on stringent economic and financial criteria.   It would also



benefit onlending of Bank funds by these banks in the eleven ongoing Bank
operations in agriculture, industry, and technology development. The Bank has
also been working actively with the Government in its review of accounting and
auditing practices, and has largely been instrumental in initiating the important
reform program in this area, now under way.
7.          Project Objectives.   The project would support the modernization
and strengthening of the Hungarian financial system, and thereby improve its
ability to mobilize and allocate financial resources efficiently. Specifically,
the project aims to help: (i) provide a modern legislative, regulatory and
supervisory framework for banking and securities markets; (ii) strengthen the
operations of the domestic banks by improving their management policies,
procedures and capabilities as well as their long-term financial viability;
(iii) develop the data processing infrastructure for the banking system; (iv)
develop the market for issue and trading of securities; and (v) improve the
transparency and reliability of accounting information of enterprises and
financial institutions.
8.          Proiect Description.  The modernization of the Htngarian financial
system is expected to be a medium-term process. The proposed coverage of this
first operation in support of the financial system would focus on the priority
areas during the initial period, namely the strengLhening of the banking system
as well  as  the  establishment  of necessary  condition   for  the  efficient
development of the securities market. The project would cover the needs in these
areas in the coming two years (mid-1990 to mid-1992), and would support: (a)
technical assistance for strengthening of the legislative framework, regulations
and supervision of banking; (b) strengthening of the participating banks; (c)
development of banking infrastructure; (d) technical assistance and training for
development of the securities market; and (e) modernization of the Hungarian
accounting  and auditing  framework  to  international  standards.    Technical
assistance, which accounts for more than 30 percent of the loan, would support
consulting services of financial experts, advisors, and training specialists.
The balance of the loan would be disburse(. against procurement of information
technology systems necessary for the modernization of the financial system.
9.          The first component would provide technical assistance to help
finalize drafting of the new banking law, including important new prudential
regulations for banks regarding capital adequacy requirements, liquidity
requirements, classification of loan portfolios, provisions for doubtful loans,
suspension of interest accrual, limits on ownership concentration, auditing and
reporting requirements, and powers to restructure ailing banks.  The component
also would help strengthen the capacity of the State Bank Supervision Agency,
including its organization, procedures and manuals, information system, and
training.
10.         The second component would support the participating. banks in the
development and implementation of action programs in the areas of institutional
development, information technology development, and financial strengthening.
In the area of institutional development, the programs would include assistance
to develop for each bank: its policy statement, including institutional role and
strategy; organization structure; functional areas such as credit and risk asset
management, financial management, and internal audit; internal policies and



- 4 -
procedures;  and human resource  requirements  and training.   Based on such
institutional development programs, and on a medium-term automation strategy for
each bank, the project would support the imp_ementation of automated management
information systems, including the introduction of systems at the head offices
and a few selected branches.   As mentioned earlier, despite the apparently
healthy financial position of the banks, the reported quality of their portfolios
is likely to be overstated. Strengthening of the banks' financial position under
the project would, therefore, in the first instance involve the carrying out of
detailed audits, by qualified auditors, of the portfolios of three of the major
banks (BB, CCB and HCB) in the first half of 1990. To the extent that the audits
would reveal that the solvency of the banks might be threatened as a result of
the necessary adjustments to their portfolios and financial positions, the
Government has agreed to take an active role in the development of a strategy
and action plan for financial restructuring of the banks, including their
recapitalization, where necessary, for which burden sharing arrangements would
be developed as part of the plan.   Each bank would also manage its future
business along agreed financial performance indicators.
11.         Detailed programs for institutional strengthening have been developed
for four of the major Hungarian banks (Budapest Bank, Commercial and Credit Bank,
Hungarian Credit Bank, and National Savings Bank).   In the case of National
Savings Bank, NSB and the Government have agreed to adopt measures to permit the
bank to operate as an autonomous financial institution. These measures include
taking by June 30, 1990 all steps required by NSB and the Government to transform
NSB into a joint-stock company, and a guarantee of a minimum intermediation
spread of 3.0% on NSB's housing finance operations given the administered nature
of the rates  on  its housing  finance  assets.    In addition  to the above
participating banks, a line of credit allocation has been made to allow for the
participation of other banks based on the following eligibility criteria: (i)
preparation of an institutional development program and related implementation
arrangements; (ii) satisfactory current and projected financial performance of
the bank, and future management of the bank taking into account agreed financial
performance indicators; 2nd (iii) annual audits of the bank's financial position
along international standards, executed by qualified external auditors.
Financing of studies by the banks and development projects with costs below
US$300,000 equivalent would follow simplified eligibility criteria. Six of the
smaller banks have already indicated their intention to participate in the
project alongside the four major banks.
12.         The third component for development of banking system infrastructure
would  support:  (i)  the  further  development  of  the  recently  established
International Training Center for Bankers (ITCB) to meet the technical and
management skills needs of the banking system; (ii) the implementation of a
national payments clearing center (so-called GIRO center), which would be used
for inter-bank clearings, for calculation and reporting of inter-bank
indebtedness, and for financial reporting to the NBH and regulatory bodies; and
(iii) the development of a comprehensive information system for NBH to enable
improved internal operations, and facilitate monetary policy formulation and
management.
13.         In support of development of the securities market in Hungary, the
fourth component involves a technical assistance program--jointly developed by



the Bank and IFC with the authorities--which will focus on: (i) establishment
of the State Securities Supervisory Board; (ii) establishment of a stock
exchange; and (iii) review of the remaining constraints to securities matket
development and preparation of a program to address these.
14.         Finally, the fifth component would support the Government in the
implementation of a two-year program to modernize accounting and auditing
standards and practices in Hungary. Under the program, accounts of enterprises
and financial institutions would be prepared, presented and audited along
international standards from 1991, and a program of professional development
would be initiated. The project would support the necessary foreign advisory
and consulting assistance to support the Government in this area.
15.         Onlending to the participating institutions and the Government would
be based on a refinancing facility in NBH, which would also be responsible for
overall project coordination and for monitoring the use of the loan.   To
facilitate implementation, an on-site advisory unit was established in January
1990, for which foreign advisors would be used and supported by the project.
Procurement and the selection of consultants will be based on Bank guidelines.
The establishment of a revolving fund of US$5.0 million (about four months of
estimated average Bank loan disbursements) and retroactive financing of up to
US$5.0 million (7.6% of the Bank loan) are recommended. A breakdown of costs,
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Details on procurement methods
and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Hungary are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8200-HU, dated April 6,
1990, is also attached.
16.         Agreed Actions.  Signing of subsidiary loan agreements between NBH
and the State, the four major participating banks, and the GIRO center, and of
the agreement with ITCB for carrying out its part of the project, is proposed
as a condition of Bank loan effectiveness.   At negotiations,  the following
salient agreements were obtained from the Government, NBH, and the participating
institutions: (a) presentation of a satisfactory draft Banking Law including
related prudential regulations to Parliament by end-1990, for approval; (b)
implementation of the two-year reform program (1990-91) for accounting and
auditing, including presentation of a satisfactory draft Accounting Law to
Parliament by September, 19^0, for approval; (c) execution of the special
portfolio audits of the three major banks, and based on the outcome of the
audits, development by the Government of an action program at the latest by end-
1990, to maintain, as necessary, the capital adequacy of the banks, including
by possible recapitalization of the banks; (d) measures to permit NSB to operate
its housing finance business with a minimum 3.O0 intermediation spread, and
completion of necessary steps by NSB and the Government by June 30, 1990, to
enable conversion of NSB into a joint-stock company; (e) implementation by the
banks of agreed institutional development plans; (f) execution of yearly
financial audits of the banks by qualified external auditors along international
standards; (g) eligibility criteria for non-appraised banks to participate in
the project, as referred to in para 11, and (h) procurement using Bank
guidelines.



17.         Benefits.  Through the improved operation of the banking system and
securities market, the project would contribute to a better mobilization of
financial resources and a higher financial savings rate in Hungary, as well as
an improved allocation of resources to productive activities along efficiency
and profitability criteria and thus enhance the restructuring of the real
economy. The stronger legislative, regulatory and supervisory framework as well
as the institutional development and audits of the banks will help instill
greater financial discipline and prudence among the banks and thus protect their
solvency as well as the interests of depositors. The training of financial staff
under the project would contribute to significant skill building and human
resource development in the financial sector. The improvements in accounting
and auditing will significantly ameliorate the transparency and reliability of
Hungarian financial data, a necessary condition for having modern enterprise and
financial sectors.
18.         Risks.   The main risk that may affect the strengthening of the
financial system is the uncertainty of the impact of the Government's ongoing
economic reform program on the viability of borrowers and hence on the future
solvency of the banks and the prospects of a securities market. The improvement
of prudential regulations and the banks' policies, supported by the project,
would help address this risk. Another project implementation risk concerns the
uncertainty about the pace at which thorough institutional development can be
carried out given the unfamiliarity with modern financial techniques and the
shortage of qualified financial personnel in Hungary. To this end, the project
would support detailed evaluation of the training needs of the participating
institutions, and the design and implementation of realistic training programs
to meet  those needs.    A third risk concerns  possible delays  related to
procurement of data processing systems which may require special export licenses
from Western export authorities. To avoid such delays, technical specifications
of such systems will be reviewed for comp_iance with export requirements, and
additional safeguards have been built into procurement procedures.   Also,
possible but unlikely delays in procurement of some items would not delay or
otherwise affect the implementation of the other components.  Finally, in the
event that procurement of slightly less-advanced technology becomes necessary,
the affected component of the project would remain viable. A further risk that
the new Government to be appointed after the March/April 1990 elections may not
fully agree with the objectives and scope of the project, is considered to be
limited given the general consensus among the major political parties on the
general direction of economic reform and the non-controversial nature of the
project with its institution building focus.
19.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
