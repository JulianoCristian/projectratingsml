{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Financial System\n            Modernization Project (FSMP) for Hungary were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, project sustainability was\n            likely, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: development of the financial sector is a long-term\n            process. It was not possible to import wholesale proven\n            Western banking practices into a transition economy with\n            little banking culture. The banks and supporting\n            institutions needed to move through the different stages of\n            development to grow into mature institutions. The\n            institutional strengthening of the banks is an important\n            element for successful development of the banking sector.\n            However, attention must be paid to both the institutional\n            and policy environment, starting with actions to strengthen\n            the institutions and appropriate attention to good\n            governance. While some of the credit for the successful\n            transformation of the financial sector belongs to the\n            project, it is impossible to say how much would have been\n            achieved without the parallel effort to improve the\n            governance and privatization of the banks. Thus the\n            Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL)\n            played an important role in complementing the institutional\n            development objectives of the FSMP. The combination of the\n            two operations resulted in a real synergy for development of\n            the financial sector. Delays in project implementation\n            underscored the complexity of automation components, and the\n            under-estimation of time required to execute them.\n            Furthermore, it would appear that banking automation is an\n            area not well suited to Bank lending, particularly lending\n            to private banks, as Bank procurement guidelines do not\n            match accepted private sector best practices. In addition, a\n            clear automation strategy, prepared to respond to the\n            business needs of the bank is also important. Automation in\n            the face of changing frameworks proved costly."}, "docdt": "1998-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
