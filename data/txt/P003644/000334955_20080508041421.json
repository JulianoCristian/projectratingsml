          the risk to development outcomes is rated substantial, and\n            the performance of the Bank and the borrower is also rated\n            as satisfactory. The main lessons learned from the project\n            is as follows: (i) successful resettlement must be\n            adequately funded and funding must be reliable, as both can\n            be jeopardized if the resettlement budget competes with the\n            construction budget in a project, especially if cost of\n            either is higher than anticipated; (ii) resettlement\n            programs must ensure that people can regain control of their\n            lives immediately, thus no one should be moved until\n            resettlement sites are fully constructed and outfitted and\n            the means for livelihood are in place; (iii) information and\n            transparency were critical for gaining trust and obtaining\n            ownership, in both the overall program and the\n            resettler-host community agreements, which set the\n            foundation for positive long term relationships; (iv)\n            achieving successful resettlement with real development\n            requires at least two different sets of skills and\n            competencies, which an implementing agency should have\n            available from the beginning; (v) the Bank needs to find\n            ways to allocate funds to allow continued supervision of\n            projects that have critical and unresolved safeguard issues;\n            and (vi) the scope and budget of a resettlement and\n            development program needs to be updated periodically to\n            encompass the dynamism of communities and ensure that\n            adequate funding is available to meet the legitimate,\n            changing needs of affected people."}, "docdt": "2007-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
