The International\n            Development Association's (IDA's) identification\n            and preparation of the project was deficient. Significant\n            portions of the physical components are still incomplete and\n            very limited institutional improvements are evident. The key\n            lessons learned include: a) projects should focus on a\n            limited set of objectives that are within the\n            Government's ability to manage; b) where a follow-on\n            project is prepared, it should be appraised after the\n            lessons from the first operation are evident; c) projects\n            affected by severe changes in the broader context, such as\n            civil war or serious economic decline, should be reassessed;\n            d) donors should finance distinct components, as parallel\n            financing would put individual components at less risk than\n            under co-financing; and e) continuity of IDA staff and good\n            record keeping are necessary to successfully supervise a project."}, "docdt": "1999-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
