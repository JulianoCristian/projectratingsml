SECOND URBAN DEYELOPMENT PROJECT
Credit and Protect Summarv
Borrow.rt         Republic of Djibouti
Beneficiaries:   Ministry of Public Works, Urban Development and Housing
(MPWUH); District of Djibouti (DD); Land Office(LO);
Sociati Immobilière de Djibouti (SID); and Caisse de
Developpement de Djibouti (CDD).
hmounts           SDR million 7.8 (US$11.2 million equivalent)
Terffls           Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity
Cofinancints      CCCE, MDC, OPEC Fund and EEC
Prol ct
Ob1ectivest       The proposed project is designed to asslst the Government
in implementing its strategy for the development of the
urban sector in Djibouti and specifically tos
a) strengthen the policy-making framework and the
coordination and planning capabilities of the Government
in the urban sector for efficient management of urban
investments;
b) help make the urban setting more efficient and more
attractive, enhancing Djibouti's role as a regional
center for services, finance, and transit;
c) increase the absorptive capacity of key institutions
responsible for urban management;
d) iimprove the urban environment and living conditions in
Djibouti;
e) improve the land tenure system and clarify the
legislation governing public property and land
ownership;
f) enhance cost recovery practices, the revenue base of
urban sector agencies, and study the prospects for a
sustainable and non-distortionary housing finance
scheme; and
g) review the extent to which decentralization may be
beneficial in Djibouti.

tiora:    The proposed project would include the following
componentes (a) Old Wards. R habilitation of ro-da and
dra±nage works sad improvemert of vater supply and
*iectricity distribution networku in Wards 1, 2, and 71
construction of an cff-site drainage system in Wards 1 to
6g and preparation of detailed studies for Wards 7bis,
Djebel, and Ambouli; (b) Balbala. Development of 3,600
serviced plots including the construction of two markets;
construction of primary notworks in future extension areas;
and rehabilitation of the old conter and rumbering of the
existing blocks and plots; (c) Salines Ouest. Development
of 228 serviced plots on the Salines Ouest site owned by
Sociaté Immobilière de Djibouti; and (d) Institution-
Buildinz. Technical support including staffing, training,
studies, and equipment for the Ministry of Public Works,
District of Djibouti, LO, SID, CDD, , and the Project
Mana&ement Unit (PMU).
,ments     The project would improve drainage, sanitation, and other
physical conditions for about 80,000 people in the city of
Djibouti. No activities in the proposed project are
expected to create significant adverse environmental
effects. The physical, health, and socio-economie
conditions of the urban population would be greatly
improved by the upgrading of urban infrastructure and
provision of such services as garbage collection and
maintenance of drainage canals. These combined actions
wuuld significantly reduce the health hazards resulting
from unsanitary conditions in project areas.
tes        The project is expected to consolidate the basis for
sustainable urban development begun under the First Urban
Project and strengthen urban institutions in Djibouti. The
proposed project would help expand job prospects and
improve the living conditions for the low-income dwellers
of the Old Wards and Balbala. Through the adjustment of
urban policies, the project would enable the Government to
transfer responsibilities to appropriate institutions and
mobilize resources for the sector.
The main risks arise from: (i) weaknesses in managerial and
technical capacity of the implementation agencies, and (ii).
the poor economic situation of the country and potential
social instability, which may delay improvements in policy
reforms and cost recovery. To reduce the first risk to
acceptable levels, strong emphasis would be placed on
technical assistance and training in all urban agencies.
As to the second risk, the project would have a positive
contribution to the Djiboutian economy mainly through
promotion of construction activities and employment.

StCOND URbAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
M. TR SECTORs MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT AD 'JRBAN SECTOR
A.  BEcktround and Macroeconomie Settint
Backzround
1.1       The Republic of Djibouti is a small country of 23,000 km2 vith a
harsh climate, arid land and à rugged topography. More than 602 of its
population, e*timated at b-tw en 400,000 and 450,000, live in Djibouti City.
Tho natural rate of population increase and the Sain through immigration
result in à growth rate of &bout 62 annually. Forty percent of the
population is under 15 years of age, and only 22 is older than 60.
1.2       Djibout!'s resources and development prospects are quite limited.
Agriculture is almost nonexistent because of the severe shortage of arable
land and vater; a few pastures support limited livestock activitios.
Fishing and industry are poorly developed. Service activities are
concentrated in Djibouti city and are centered on the seaport, the railroad
to Ethiopia, the international airport, commercial and financial establish-
ments, government administration, and the French military base which is the
largeet source of economic and coumercial activity, accounting for about a
quarter of GDP.
1.3       Between 1978 and 1982 GDP growth averaged 3% per annum in real
terms, and GDP par capita was estimated at about US$400 in 1982. Houever,
between 1984 and 1987 GDP appears to have declined by an average of 2.7
percent per annum.
1.4       Djibouti periodically redefines its economic goals in a basic
statute ("Loi d'Orientation"). According to the latest loi d'orientation,
approved in 1982, the country's economic objectives are the following: (a)
to develop Djibouti as an important international financial, commercial, and
shipping center; (b) to reduce poverty in urban and pastoral areas; (c) to
decrease food and energy dependency; and (d) to promote industrialization.
To achieve these goals, Djibouti is giving priority to: (a) developing human
resources, including providing basic education for children and specialized
etucation and training for adulte; (b) increasing agricultural and
industrial investments; and (c) improving the investment climate to attract
both nation.l and foreign private investments.  At the same time, the
Government recognizes the need to maintain strict budgetary discipline. A
nev basic statute is currently being prepared, and is expected to be issued
by the and of 1990.
Macroeconomic settinz
1.5       For lack of adequate data, a precise picture of the macro-economic
situation of Djibouti cannot now be determined. It remains clear, however,
that the economy is fragile and dependent on transfers from the exterior
and, despite an open economic environment, receives little investment.



1.6       Djibouti in apparently clouding it. GDP and population figures to
soeurs its classification ts an LLDC In any event, lte poverty, &cant
resource base snd 40S literacy rate, make lt clearly a poor country, with
primary activities representing approximate.y 42 of GD?, .econdary
activities 192 snd tertiary activities (services) 702.
1.7       Tne Djiboutian economy is fairly open to the exterior, banking and
comerce take place with practically no restrictions, and historically there
ha& been little or no inflation, othar than that associated with int*r-
national inflation and currency fluctuations. The Djiboutian Franc (FD) is
pegged to the US dollar.  While free acceas  to foreign exchange markets is
allowed, local currency is tssued in response to the dollar value of the
foreign exchange that entera the Bank of Djibouti. Therefore, Crante for
both dev-lopment assistance and budgetary support from the exterior, have a
m_netary and a demand expansion effect.  The effect on growth han been
m'.,-r, iiowever, because of the strong dependence on imports, doubling of
public settor employment between 1981 and 1988, low national savinga with
limited investment, and wages that are high compared with those of competing
developing economies, despite the low qualifications of the labor force.
Linktes wvith the Urban Sector
1.8       Gros. domestic investment is estimated at slightly les. than 202
of GDP. It is dominated by public investments (602). The productive
private sector accounts for only 15% and households for the rest. The lov
figures for the private sector result from the sizeable short-term deposits
it holda in the international banking system, an allocation of resources
away from the local economy in response to its fragility.
1.9       The Public Investment Program (PIP) for the three-year period
1989-91 amounts to US$180 million, with about US$27 million earmarked for
housing and urban development. The largest share of the PIP spending,
approximately 48%, is allocated to infrastructure and energy. Social
sectors and urban development absorb 28%, leaving nearly 20% for directly
productive activities. The second urban project amounting to US$45.5
million (disbursed over six years), would represent about 84% of the
government program in the sector for the period 1991-1997.
1.10      The urban population growth in Djibouti City stemming from
internal migration and refugee flows has led to a high population density,
shortage of adequate infrastructure, and relatively high prices for low-
quality housing.  Response to the demand for improvements is slow.  h city-
state'. *conomic structure concentrates most economic activities in an urban
area.  Transfers from the exterior in the form of salaries to expatriate
personnel generate a stable demand for services. Activities related to
transport to neighboring countries, and light processing industry, mostly
for the local market, complete the main sources of employment in Djibouti.
Thus Djibouti's make-up as a high-cost economy, with rising unemployment
and a largely unnet demand for urban services, can be readily discerned.

a. Sector PolIcy Initiatives
l.l      SBime by fer the greatest part of the country's population and the
bulk of Lte «onomic *ctivity are concentratsd in the Djibouti urban are«,
urbaa devolopaont ocevpies a crit±eal position in national polictes for
.conomic and social development. Since independence In 1977, avarenesa of
it. importance ha. besn growing. The eity of Djibouti has h&d to become à
city in the true *onse of the t.rm, developing an lncroasingly efficient
economy based on regional transportation and services. In turn, resources
thus generated are needed to improv: economie infrastructure and the living
conditions of its entire population. This role demande good urban
infrastructure and services, for the provision of which thé handicaps to b.
overcome are significant, and the regional competition is likely to be
intense.
1.12      About two thirds of the country's population live in Djibouti
city.  Expatriates and a few high-incoie Djiboutians remain in low-denaity
areas north of the commercial center and in military compounds *round the
city. The "Old Wards' of the inner city, by contrast, art deneoly
populated, vith about 652 of the city's population. In the overcrowded
parts of the city, people live in poor conditions and are malnourished.
Thoir situation is not helped by the significant amount of the hous-hold
budget typically spent on khat, the chewing of which is an important social
pastime.
1.13      Several yoars ago the government, taking advantage of a favorable
financial situation and support from bilateral and multilateral assistance
agenci s, embarked on a rehabilitation of urban infrastructure and initiated
measures to reverse the decay of certain wards of the city. An Urban
Development Master Plan (UDMP) was adopted in 1983 and a Sanitation Master
Plan in 1986. Major sanitation works were carried out and the vater-
production and power-generation facilities were strengthened vith Af ican
Development Bank (ADB) assistance. A sewerage system and a modern treatment
plant vere completed (with water recovery for irrigation).
1.14      The firat Djibouti urban development project (DUDP) marked an
important phase in the implementation of the UDMP, especially for the
rehabilitation of the Old Wards and the integration of the Balbala squatter
settlement into the official city.  Nevertheless, the service levels for
potable iater and electricity, and especially sanitation, remain low outaide
the residential quarters and the main centers.  Extension of the networks to
previously neglected neighborhoods is therefore required, together vith the
rehabilitation of the existing network.
1.15      Land management.  The first project was instrumental in
establishing security of land tenure, not only in project areas but also in
other areas. Previously, most of Djibouti's population lived under the
"provisional occupancy permit" delivered by the District Chief and allowing
people to occupy land temporarily, but not to build houses with durable
materials.  The firat DUDP introduced a cost recovery mechanism which vas
successful.  This cost recovery was carried out through the "amicable

trsansferf systeu conaisting oe a est of procedures aiming at transferring
ownership of the State land ln Old Wards and Balbala to ladividuals after
payment for the plots vas made. The proceecas of plot sales are deposited La
the Urban Development Fund (WDF).  However, the officially designated prices
at which these transactions take place must be increased, so that th.y more
closely reflect market values This would be a condition of credit
effectivenens (para. 6.3 (b).
1.16    Up to the prosent, these improvements in the land tenure statue of
Djibouti citizens have been confined largely to the Ol Wards. In tho
>utlying district of Balbala, the land romains unrogistered but provisional
cose.upancy permit. are *till issued, on the grounds that the population
cannot pay the coss of formal transfor and that many householde affected by
road realig-nmnts or demolition in the Old Wards cannot be relocated
elsewhere.  Oreparation studies undertaken for the proposed project yielded
a more accurate picture of capaclty to pay in all areas of the city. The
results have been taken into account in the nev official land prices
(Annex 18) which vary by noighborhood and income levels.  The first step in
extending secure land tenure to the low-income neighbourhoods of Balbala is
to rmgister the Balbala servlced plots *s being owned by the State. This
step is a condition of crodit effectivenesa (para. 6.3 (a).
1.17      AloO under the proposed project, specific shortcomings in the
existing land legislution and regulations providing for amicable transfers
vould b. remedied. A draft land code for urban aroas vas reviewed during
negotiations and its *nactment vould be a condition of effectivenoes (para.
6.3(d). The main problems which are to be addressed are: i) the updating
of land legielation, particularly ln urban areas, and 2) amendment of the
amicable transfer law regarding construction materials and time limit for
reconstructing houses on Old Wards plots.
1.18     Maintenance.  The government is concerned with establishing
effectsive institutions to improve the maintenance of infrastructure and
housing, especially that constructed under the first DUDP. It has stated
its intention to proceed with measures contained in the Organic Laws
promulgated in the early years of independence, but never applied: the
creation of small municipal governments within Djibouti city.   This
approach may turn out to be vell suited to Djibouti, bu'. more analysis is
required to determine if, for example, these municipal governments would
have the resources to cope with the major problems of urban management. The
proposed project therefore would support a stsdy of the options for
municipal organization (see para. 3.7).   In the meantime, there continue to
b. pressing maintenance needs that must be met. Under the proposed project
AFVP, a French NGO, vould coordinate the participation of city residents in
hoalth care, road maintenance, improvement of dwellings, and other
maintenance operations under the supervision of precinct-level auth-rities
(chefs d'arrondissement).
1.13    Housinx and Housinx Finance.   The first urban project contained a
modest line of credit to finance housing construction and improvements in
the vardt in which infrastructure was being upgraded. This line of credit
was quickly taken up. Some occupants who could not get loans nevertheless

resources a'vtlable into houslng.  The government has reclived UNDP
assistance for formulating an overall housing policy. The etudy undertaken
vith UNDP financing, as vell ts the preparation study for the proposed
project, have confirmed -.ho suitability of current approaches to housing
construction and security of land tenure, nd has explored the relationships
betwten the financial sector and the production of houaing. Hovever, no
*tudy has as yet gonc into depth on how a housing finance systen would work
in practice.
1.20   The proposed project would finance such a tochnical study of
alternatives (savings-for-housing systems, contractual sàvingt, term
transformation by banks, *tc.), so that an effective housing finance policy
can be formulated. Draft terme of reference for *uch a *tudy àre in Annex
14.
1.21    Sector Policy.   The Planning Department, which reporte to the Prime
linister, has launchod the preparation of a general lw on *conomic
management (Loi d'Orientation 1990-2000) that vould update the existing
version approved in 1982 (se. also para. 1.4). The objective of this 1lw Ls
to outline the framework of the Djiboutian economy for *ach sector,
ivcluding housing and urban development, up to the y-ar 2000. Cost
recovery, management of urban services, maintenance and other sector policy
issues ère described in the draft policy statement on the housing and urban
sector, which was reviewed during negotiations. A start has *lso been made
in the formulation of a sector investment program. The third 'Three-Year
Action Program" recently prepared by the Ministry of Public Works, Urban
Development, and Housing (MPWUH) outlines the ministry's activities and
projecta and presents capital and recurrent expenditures anticipated for
1990-92. This marks the start of a priority sectoral investment program,
which would be updated each year in consultation with IDA.
1.22   Secondary Towns.   Despite their small size, secondary tcwns in
Djibouti may play important roles in settling the semi-nomadic population
groups and migrants from neighboring countries. During project
implementation a study would be carried out to assess the economic and
social functions of such towns and the infrastructure needs associated with
these functions (ses Annex 14).

C. Urban Institutions
Ministrv of P'blic Works. Urban Plannint and Housine (MPWUH)
1.23    MPWUH has responsibility for formulating urban planning and housing.
policy. This ministry manages publie property (roada and service networks)
in the Djibouti urban area, and since 1982 has also been responsible for
maintenance of urban streets. A presidential decree of January 1990 further
expanded this mandate to inelude maintenance of drainage canals, sidevalks,
and publie squares. Law 103-AN 90 of February 13, 1990 outlines a nev
organizational framework of the ministry (see Annex 16!, under whieh more
resources should be assigned to the Infrastructure Maintenance Division of
the Directorate of Publie Works. It has been agreed in principle to
decentralize, but for the near future the effective responsibility for urban
development vill remain vith MPWUH.
1.24    Buildina Permits.   MPWUH approves building permits, whieh are thon
issued by the District Chief. Because of its strong technical inclination,
it has set high standards for housing construction, and service provision.
However, in the Firet DUDP a simpler building permit proceadure vas
introduced in the Old Wards and Balbala for construction using permanent
materials or conversion of temporary dvellings into permanent housing.
Under this procedure it became acceptable to furnish a rough layout plan and
a brief description and estimate of the vorks, rather than more complicated
and costly data, to obtain the permit. The proposed project vould simplify
the process further, largely by reducing several high technical standards,
and also by extending the use of the simplified permit to the city as a
whole. The specific amendments to the presidential decree on building
permits has been discussed at negotiations. Ratification of this decree is
a condition of effectiveness (para. 6.3 (b».
Coordination of Urban Prolects and Programmina of Public Investments
1.25    An Interministerial Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, vas
established to oversee the First DUDP and the Project Management Unit (PMU)
responsible for its implementation.   The Government has decided to extend
the scope of the Interministerial Committee, in an operational sense, to
include all other projects in the urban sector, and from the policy
standpoint, to include guidance on policy formulation in urban development,
urban planning, and housing. This extension of povers is a logical step.
MPWUH would provide the secretariat of the Interministerial Committee. The
secretariat vould play a technical role, of gathering information on the
sector, preparing projects for the Zommittee's approval, and coordinating
with the Planning Department of the Prime Minister's Office.
District of Diibouti (DD)
1.26    Djibouti is divided administratively into five districts, one of
which, the District of Djibouti (DD), includes all of Djibouti city, the



- 7 -
ualler centers of Art& and Damrjot., end à large  mount of rural land
(about 500 b 3 La a1l). DD La not à municipality but a sub-national
administratil umit under the Mlinistry of Interior. The District Chief, who
ad4o4atets teh City of Djibouti es vell as the rest of the District, in
therofore the reprosentative of the central Government. DD dons not have
financial autonomy or a formel budget, but relies on discrotionary transfers
from thé Treasury. Responsibilities of DD include police and emergency
services, doliverance of permit. and authorisations, solid vaste collection
and disposal, end cleaning of *treete. The Technical Services Department of
DD handles solid vaste collection and street.cleaning, the fees for which
art collected by the State and paid directly into the Treasury. The DD
organization chart is presented in Annex 16.
1.27     Capacity for management and maintenance of urban services existe
mainly at the arrondissement (precinct or yard) level. The five
arrondissements of DD presently have modest means allocated to them by the
District Chief. The proposed project vould strengthen their capacity
through provision of equipment, assistance to DD itself in internal
organization, training, use of efficient management tools (such as
budgeting, inventory and  lnvestment controls, and cost accounting), and
organisation of maintenanoe at the local lvel.  In this manner the
arrondissements *hould be better *ble to manage and maintain roads,
drainage, and such public facilities as markets, schools, and primary health
care centers.
Decentralization
1.28      The population of the Djibouti urban area is two thirds or more
of the country's total po?ulation. No local government, elected or
appointed, is in charge of the city, thus no clearcut division can be made
btwveen national and municipal responsibilities in urban management.
Administration of the city is the responsibility of the Ministry of the
Interior, acting through the District Chief, but the planning, execution,
and financing of infrastructure and other urban facilities are handled by
national agencies, primarily the MPWUH and the Finance Ministry.
1.29     The principle of creating municipalities, however, goes back to the
basic 1977 legislation organizing the Djiboutian State (Ordonnance 77-060 PR
of November 23, 1977 and its implementing decrees) (see also para. 1.18).
According to this lav, municipal governments, as "basic territorial
subdivisions in which the *ecnomic, cultural and social development of the
national community' vould be reflected, vere to be established. Djibouti
city vas to be divided into four municipalities corresponding to the four
arrondissements then in existence. These municipalities vere to be given
legal and financial autonomy and assigned extensive powers, but for an
unspecified initial period vere to be administered by special delegates
appointed by the Government.
1.30    Recent government directives announce its intention to re-launch the
"municipalization" process and establish the four municipalities in Djibouti
city. It is not clear, however, how much autonomy any local government can
and should have, how it will relate to the central authorities, and what the



-8-
role of DD *hould b-. For exemple, the basic 1977 luv prohibits any
territorial subdivision from mergins with others to form 'a union,
confaderatio@, *a-embly or coalition. If neede common to saveral
municipalitics indicate the necessity of à single entity, this *ntity muet
b. managed by an agency reporting to the Minister of thé Interior. To
clarify thesa issues, thé project would support à comprehensive study of the
inctitutional framework for decentralization and its impact on *xisting
ministries and agencies, especially DD (se. Annex 14).
The Land Office (LO)
1.31      The LO is under the authority of the Ministry of Finance.  It vas
str-ngthened under the firat DUDP and vas responsible for implementing the
amicable transfer procedure for plots in the Old Wards and for project cost
recovery through the proceeds of plot sales and related fees.
This procedure does not, however, cover the plots that the District Chief
still avards under provisional occupancy permits in Balbala, outside the
bouadaries of the urban area.  The proposed project voultd enure that
Balbala is integrated in the amicable transfer system and cost recovery is
extended to all urban areas of the city.
The Urban Develooment Fund (UDF)
1.32     The Urban Development Fund (UDF) was established as a Treacury
account in 1985 under thé first DUDP.  It has evolved into an institution
supporting the recycling of the funds invested in the first DUDP's land
development and housing credit operations.  Proceeds from the amicable
transfer transactions in the Old Wards and Balbala under the first DUDP have
been deposited into the UDF. Despite some delays in implementing the wards
investments and the cost recovery procedures, the resources obtained under
this fund have exceeded DF 150 million (US$850,000), making it possible to
finance critical additional works in Ward 6 under the first DUDP. The
Fund's total resources can be expected to exceed DF 700 million by 1995.
This growth has been made possible by the LO's efforts to move forward with
transfers of land ownership from the State to individuals. Annex 10 shows
the breakdown of plot sales and projections of cash receipts up to 1995.

Office Matio 1 de l'Eau de Dlibouti (ONED) and Electriciti de Dlibouti
1.33    The water and electricity authorities are public enterprises placed
under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry.  Th.y have benefited from
loans for developing their production resources (new boringe for vater,
completion of two tranches of the Boulaos termal pover station) a vell as
for expanding and rehabilitating their networks. Their production
capacities are pres.ntly able to keep pace with consumption. A study
carried out under the first DUDP confirmed, however, that vater tariffa are
inadequate.   The changes being proposed are as followat
Water tariff Structure
Existlnz Structure                 Proposed Structure

Minimum billing       30m3                             20 m3
Increases in ONED tariffs and adjustment of the tariff structure are
a condition of effectiveness of the proposed project (para. 6.3 (c)).

The Financial Svstem and the Caisse de Divelo>,ement de Dilbouti (CDD)
1.34     The finncial sector in Djibouti consiste of the central bank (BND)
and five comrcial banka.  CDD, a nonbank financial intermediary, vas net
up to mobilise external resources and institutional savinge for the ben-flt
of small- snd mtdium-sized firms. An additional objective ls to finance
housing construction.
1.35     Th. Djibouti Franc (FD) is freely convertible to the US dollar, and
trade in foreign exchange is unrestricted.  The financial sector has had
available to it large volumes of savinga that exceed the absorptive capacity
of the country's economy (see Annex 11); in 1989 alone, the commrcial banks
received about DF 70 billion (US$ 394 million) in deposits of which DF 42
billion vas placed on the international markets. Housing, however, has not
been a major placement for these banks, which consider the guarantees for
housing loans insufficient and the risks too great.
1.36     CDD vas established in January 1983 as a publie corporation vhose
capital in held by the State (51%), the CCCE (142), the Europ-an Investment
Bank (14%), and local commercial banks (21%). Itt statutes expressly
empover it to make loans for housing construction, provided that such
lending does not take up more than 40% of its own funds or represent more
than 30% of loans outstanding. Although the guarantee req-irements imposed
on borrovers are very restrictive (guarante. commitment by a publie
official), loans for housing have grown rapidly. CDD has been able to
borrow for this purpose at below-market rates from national publie savings
institutions (Caisse de Privoyance Sociale).
1.37     In the study of housing finance mechanisms supported under the
project (see para. 1.19), the role of CDD will be given special attention.
Major issues to be addressed include CDD's internal organization to
administer housing loans and its ability to transform savings into housing
loans on non-subsidized terms.
Sociéti Immobilière de Diibouti (SID)
1.38    SID is a mixed company formed in 1956 to construct and manage
housing for wage-earners. Present shareholders are the State, the CCCE, and
the French Government.  Until 1975, SID received financing on liberal terms
from its minority shareholder, the CCCE.  With this financing lt built 2,120
dwellings, of which 1,340 have been sold under lease-purchase contracts; it
still owns the remaining 780. SID has undertaken no new construction since
the CCCE financing ended, even though its own funds would have been
sufficient for the purpose.  Under the first DUDP, SID was responsible for a
small housing development at Salines Ouest. Although the results were
reasonably good (all 176 plots serviced and 106 houses constructed), the
experience showed that SID would benefit from a more focused role in land
development and servicing, leaving the financing to others.
1.39    A reorganization of SID to this end is in progress and should be
nearly complete by the end of 1990. This process includes the sale of some
assets, rehabilitation of the assets (mainly apartment buildings) SID will



retain, *nt tr:asfer to the State of road sand otcer infrast=gcture once
those syst _ ar robebblitated and the customer accouats settled. Nev
statutos hg" beae draeted to enable SID to deepen its involvement ln rosl
estate proi@on and site development. These statutes have been *pproved by
the SID oard ntd are currently being revi ewd by the Government.
Assurances vero obtained Lt negotiations on further internal streamlining of
SID managemat and on redefinition of its role (para. 6.1(e)>.
D. Previous Bank Involvement in the Sector
1.40      Direct Bank Group involvement in Djibouti's urban sector began
vith the f ist DUDP (Credit 1518-DJI), approved in Septmber 1984.  The
project's main objectives vert to increase the absorptive capacity of key
agencies by providing staff training, *quipment and an appropriate framework
for the management of urban investments; to improve the living conditions of
the urban poor in Djibouti; and to introduce more rigor ln cort recovery
prectices, vith special .mphasis on improving the revenue base of the urban
agencies and recycling recovered project funds. The first DUDP led to a
significsnt improvement of Djibouti's urban management and environment,
fully met its dev-lopment objectives and proved instrumental in assisting
the Goverm nt in the preparation of its policies for developing the sector
vith the help of other donors.
1.41      The first DUDP significantly improved the situation of Old Wards
3, 5, and 6 by upgrading and constructing nev roadt and a drainage system.
This decreased the risk of flooding and improved garbage collection and
hygiene. In Balbala the construction and upgrading of roads, construction
of a market, and provision of public lighting under the first project has
changed the ares significantly. Balbala nov attracts many people from other
parts of Djibouti City. Despite cost overruns and delays in implementation,
the Salines Ouest component provided 176 plots, of which 106 have houses.
On the institutional f-ont the first DUDP introduced s land tenure system
alloving temporary occupants to own land through the amicable transfer
procedure snd cost recovery system, under which the beneficiaries of the
amicable transfer operation pay for the plots acquired. One of the
accomplishments of the first DUDP vas to sensitize government and donors to
sector issues and to the need for a comprehensive policy framework and
efficient institutions to manage urban growth.
1.42      The main study for urban policy development was carried out
by UNDP-UNCHS in 1988 (Eliments pour une Politique de l'Habitat et du
Développement Urbain). This study was done by the same team of consultants
who did the preparatory work of the second DUDP under IDA financing. The
Government han used the UNDP-UNCHS study as a basic document ln drafting its
lave snd policies for the urban sector.
E.  Rationale for IDA Involvement
1.43      Given the role of Djibouti city, where most of the country's
population is concentrated, it is important to help the goverriment improve
its urban sector policies and enhance the capacity of urban institutions to
contribute to future growth. In a city-state such as Djibouti, an urban



- 12 -
project la the beat available vehicle for making a significant impact on a
large sgment of the population, under conditions of scarce investment
resources and ltmit.d potential in agriculture and other sectors.
1.44      The investments considered under the project are economically
justified and represent timely responses to pressing social needs. The
proposed project vould deepen policy reforme introduced under the firet
project, particularly concerning land tenure and coet recovery. It would
also continue the building up of institutions to allow a sustainable
development of the ueb-n sector in Djibouti.  The firet project was
successful in draving support from other donors for the reform of urban
policies. Thus, the role of the IDA has been fundamental to the design,
preparation, and foeus of the second DUDP.  The cofinanciers' response for
the proposed project is largely explained by the succeas of the firet DUDP.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Genesis eand Preparation
2.1       The government made a request to the Bank on October 30, 1988 to
help with the preparation of a second urban development project in Djibouti.
The project as envisioned by the Government would build on the first urban
project, helping the government to define sector policies, strengthen urban
institutions, improve cost recovery mechanisms, rehabilitate the Old Wards,
and provide, in Balbala and Salines Ouest, plots with basic infrastructure.
2.2       The government requested US$500,000 for an advance under the
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) on February 21, 1989, which IDA approved
by a letter dated April 7, 1989 for an amount of US$400,000. The purpose of
the PPF was to finance two major studies necessary for the preparation of
thé project.  The first study aimed at clarifying institutional aspects
while the second focused on the feasibility and the detailed design of thé
project. An appraisal mission to Djibouti in June 1990 was carried out
jointly with the FAC and CCCE. The project was prepared in close
collaboration with other cofinanciers--the EEC and the OPEC Fund.
S. Prolect Oblectives
2.3       Building on the experience acquired in implementing the first
urban project, the proposed project would assist the government in carrying
out its urban strategy and consolidate the basis for sustainable urban
development.  The proposed project would fit within the overall strategy for
improving Djibouti's key economic infrastructure that the Bank and other
donors have agreed to finance. Specifically, the project is designed tos
(a)  strengthen the policy-making framework and the coordination and
planning capabilities of the government in the urban sector for
efficient management of urban investments;
(b) help make the urban setting more efficient and more attractive,
enhancing Djibouti's role as a regional center for services,
fir.ance, and transit;
(c) increase the absorptive capacity of key institutions responsible
for urban management;
(d)  improve the urban environment and living conditions in Djibouti;
(e)  improve the land tenure system and clarify the legislation
governing public property and land ownership;
(f)  enhance cost recovery practices, the revenue base of urban sector
agencies, and study the prospects for a sustainable and non-
distortionary housing finance scheme; and



- 14 -
<g) review the *xtent to which decentralisation may be boneficial in
Djlboutl.
C. Project DRecrliDtion
2.4       The project will include the following components, described ln
detail in Annex 2.
Old Warda
2.5       The project would provide protection from flooding in all low-
lying ar-as and improve access to these densely populated and low-income
settlements. The proposed actions would benefit all the wards but w$il be
particularly centered on Wards 1, 2, and 7 (64 ha., 34,000 inhabitants).
Th.y would includes
(a) Rehabilitating and paving or stabilizing streets, constructing a
drainage system and a sewerage network and improving the vater
supply distribution network in Old Wards 1 and 2;
(b)  R.habilitating and constructing streets and drainage network and
extending the water supply and street lighting networks in Old
Ward 7;
(c) Improving the primary drainage systeom and constructing new storm
water collectors off-site in Old Wards 1 to 6; and
(d) Preparing final design for works in Old Wards 7bis, Djebel, and
Ambouli.
B;albala
2.6       The project would improve living conditions in Balbala and would
assist in planning future extensions to respond to the increasing demand for
serviced plots and to avoid the spread of squatter settlements. It would
includet
(a) Developing sites and services for 3,600 plots (with a surface area
of 105 to 160 e2), which includes provision of roads, water
supply, electricity, public lighting and construction of two
markets;
(b) Staking out and clearing of primary roads on future extensions;
(c) Constructing roads and drainage in the old center; and
(d)  Putting up street names, plot numbers and traffic signs in the
built-up area.

Salines Ouest
2.7       Sites and services development would be financed under à joint
venture vith th. Sociata Immobiliere de Djibouti (SID). This dev-lopment
vould comprise 228 plots (with à surface ares of 104 to 160 m2) and include
streets, drainage, water supply, sew.rage, electricity, and *treet lighting
networks.  SID's contribution would include the land and the cost of the on-
site infrastructure.
Institutional Support
2.8       The second urban development project would continue the
strengthening of the urban sector institutions that was launched in the
first project.  Technical assistance and training still form an important
part of the second project and represents about 352 of its total cost.
French Cooperation (MCD) would finance on a grant basis more than 502 of
th-se costs. MCD is using the second urban project as a vehicle to use its
technical assistants in Djibouti more efficiently and prepare for their
phasing out. Technical assistance is necessary becaus. of insufficient
training and the lack of higher level Djiboutian staff.  The support
components adopted would be the following:
(a)  Ministry of Public Works, Urban Development and Housing (MPWUH)
2.9       The project includes plans to provide the sanitation subdivision
(Djibouti Roads and Urban Utilities Division) with maintenance and operating
equipment, to restore the existing pumping stations, to improve the data-
processing equipment of the infrastructure maintenance division, and to
finance technical assistance for sanitation service ojerations, urban
planning, and site deveiopment operations. The technical assistance would
also include the preparation of the Public Investment Program for the
sector.
(b) Land Office (LO)
2.10      The LO (Service des Domaines) would continue to be strengthened
during the second project, with the chief objective being to speed land-
tenure regularization and cost recovery in all urban areas and those
undergoing urbanization. A second objective would be to improve the
legislation and regulations on amicable transfers and adjust the transfer
prices and fees payable. The project would finance an expansion of the
LO's premises, equipment, one technical assistant (2.5 years) and a local
training program.  The first project financed the operating cost of the LO
which helped make it a successful agency. This funding would be phased out
after the first two years.
(c) "Société Immobilière de Djibouti" (SID)
2.11      In resuming its activity, the SID will shift '.ts emphasis to site
development and real-estate promotion. The project would provide a
technical assistant in administration and finance and a highly qualified



- 16 _
technician for uetting up new operations, once the institution's
reorganasation has been accomplished. SID would pay part of the coat of
thèse techaical assistants.
(d)  Th. District of Diibouti (DD)
2.12      A significant institutîonal strengthening of the District
of Djibouti i. envisaged for consolidating household garbage collection,
extending this service to Balbala and ensuring the maintenance of the
equipuent.  The aim ls to partially renew and complets the technical
services' vehicle fleet, to improve the district's workshop bases 2, 3,
and 4 (additional premises, a truck shop, a grease pit, and a fence) and at
the dump location (shed, water tank, office, and hookups).  Thre-  technical
assistants would be provideds a financial manager (for four years), a garage
chief and an engineer.
(a)  Assistance to financial authorities
2.13      Staff to be provided under the project includes a specialist in
savings and housing finance (four years). Depending on agreement to be
reached vith the parties concerned, this expert would be awsigned to the
Presidency, the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank (BND), or the Office
of tha Prime Minister. The specialist's objective is to identify local
savings capacities for funding a housing policy scheme and to determine how
it should be implemented. (See draft TOB in Annex 14).
(f)  "Caisse de Daveloppement de Dlibouti" (CDD)
2.14      The project proposes to make available to the managing director a
technical adviser responsible for administrative and financial management
(two years). A second technical assistant would be added once thé
specialist responsible for designing the housing finance system makes
sufficient progress to enable CDD to open a department specializing in
housing loans.
(g)  Assistance bv the "Association Francaise des Volontaires du
Progrès" (AFVP)
2.15      The AFVP (a French NGO) would put a team of four junior
technicians, supported by a more experienced leader in the PMU, to work in
one or two wards rehabilitated during the first project. The team would
assist the 'chefs d'arrondissement" and groups of residents, in conjunction
with the "health committees," in infrastructure maintenance and help
applicants in upgrading and constructing their homes.
(h) Prolect Manaaement Unit (PMU)
2.16      The Government has decided that the PMU for the first project
should continue to coordinate implementation of the second project. It is
recommended to recruit a Djiboutian deputy to the project director and to
finance out of project funds an adviser to the project (2.5 years) together



- 17 -
with all the PMU's operating expenses for the duration of thé project.
Annex 2 provides details on the P?U"* organization and budget.
D. Cout estimates
2.17      The total cost of the project is estimated at FD 9.17 billion
(US$45.5 million), of which US$30.7 million, or approximately 671,
represents the foreign *xchange componont. Base cost estimates are
expressed in prices as of June 1990. This cost includes refinancing the IDA
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of USS400,000, approved in October 1989
for project preparation.
2.18      Co0t estimates of works vere based on final designs for improving
infrastructure in Old Wards 1 and 2 and on preliminary designJ for other
componento. All cost estimates for civil works and equipment are based on
recent bid prices and quotations propared under the first urban development
project.
2.19      The Government would exempt the project from taxes and dutils;
this vould be considered as a Government contribution (USS6.1 million). The
full cost of relocating the population affected by thé project (307
householda) is included as a Government counterpart contribution (US$0.4
million).
2.20      The project cost estimates are broken down by component, by year,
and by cofinanciers in Annexes 3 and 4, and are summarized below by
component and by type of expenditure.

2.21         The rate used for physical contingencies  for works assessed on the
basis of final design in the Old Wards, and preliminary design in Balbala,
is 10%. l.he same rate has been applied for equipment and consulting
services. Physical contingencies of 15% have been added to base cost for
works e3timated on the basis of preliminary designs in the Old Wards. No

physical contingencies vrte allowed for technical assistance and training.
The total atant of physical contingencies, US$3.03 million, representa 8.2S
of total base coat.
2.22      Price contingencies have been added to base cost plus physical
contingencies. Price contingencies for local currency expend&tures are based
on domestic inflation estimated at 5.5% per year. For foreign currency
expenditures, price contingencies were based on recont estimates of
international inflation--3.6% a year from 1990 until the end of the project.
Price contingencies are estimated at 15.8% of total base cost.
E. Financinx Plan
2.23      The proposed project would be flnanced mainly through the
folloving credits and grants
(i)  IDA credit of US$11.2 million

III. ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
A.  Proiect Implementation
3.1       Arrangements for project implementation make use of existing
institutions and are similar to those in place during implementation of the
first urban project.  The second urban project vill remain under the
responsibility of the Interministerial Committee comprising the Prime
Minister (Chairman), the Director of the President's office, the Minister of
Finance, the Minister of Public Works, Urban Planning and Housing (Secretary
of the Interministerial Committee), the Minister of the Interior and the
Minister of Industry and Industrial Development.
3.2       The Project Management Unit (PMU) created in the first project
under the authority of the Interministerial Committee will continue to
coordinate project implementation. ,he PMU will have a staff of nine
people: a PMU director, a deputy director, an adviser, two accountants, and
four support staff (two secretaries, a clerk, and a driverlmessenger).
Appointment of the PMU director and his deputy would be made after
consultation with the IDA and is a condition of credit effectivenees
(para. 6.3e). The role of the PMU will be to program project execution,
ensure liaison among the executing agencies, authorize payment for project
expenses, administer technical assistance, and provide for monitoring and
overall supervision of the project. This would include supervising the
resettlement program and preparing consolidated project accounts, quarterly
reports, studios, audits, and the project completion report. Annex 16 shows
the organization charts of the agencies involved in project implementation
and the assignment of responsibilities for the project components. Annex 6
sui-arizes the project implementation schedule.
3.3       From the operational point of view the State is the owner of all
infrastructure with contracting responsibilities, except for the Salines
Ouest component (maître d'ouvrage). The Project Management Unit (PMU) is
the coordinating agency for the whole porject (maître d'ouvrage delégué).
The execution responsiblities of the project (maître d'oeuvre) would be
carried out by the following agencies:
Land clearing      : Ministry of Public Works, Urban Planning and
Housing (MPWUH)
Topography         s MPWUH

B.  Technical Assistance, Training, and Consulting Services
3.4       Because of the limited number of trained personnel in Djiboutian
institutions, the project includes substantial technical assistance. Part of
this will be provided by consultants and consulting firms and part by the
French Ministry of Cooperation and Development (MCD) under a Franco-Djiboutian
agreement to be signed before effectiveness of the project.
The following table summarizes the distribution of these advisers by agency:
IDA      MCD      CCCE       Total
DD                              3                   3

TOTAL            5         7         2        14
3.5       To reduce the need for assistance as quickly as possible, the project
would include training in Djibouti and short-term and long-term training abroad
and fellowships  (mainly in France, with MCD financing).   The short-term
training is intended mainly to round out staff qualifications, in particular
for senior staff. The long-term courses and fellowships are to be used for
training or recruiting personnel to replace the technical assistants and to
complete the staffing chart in accordance with an agreed plan (see Annex 17).
The total number of technical assistants in the sector would decrease because
of the redeployment of some of the MCD technical assistants in the project.
3.6       Consulting  firms  or  individual  consultants  would  provide  the
engineering services for preparing detailed designs and works supervision
on terms acceptable to IDA andlor the other donors.
C. Studies
3.7       Some  studies  to be carried  out under  the project  have been
identified. These studies, in preparation for future actions in the sector,
are as follows (Annex 14):
-   Study of the impact of decentralization on the organization and
financing of the District of Djibouti;
-   Study of the secondary towns and of the updating of the Djibouti
Urban Development Master Plan;



- 22 -
Study of the establishment end impl.mentation of a housing finance
syste-;
_ Study of household budgets and savinge behavior in the Djibouti
metropolitan area relating to housing and it. extensions;
-  Annual audits of the project executing agenclas (PMU, SID and
CDD).
- A lump-sum amount has been set aside for studies not yet
identified.
D. Resettlement
3.8       Implementing the project vill require a resettlement program vith
a total cost of about FD 71 million. The families that would have to be
relocated (about 200 in ward 7, 20 in ward 1 and 2 and 87 in Balbala) vould
have priority in roceiving grants of plots to rebuild their houses.
Families vith a land title would also receive an indemnity to rebuild th-ir
houses. Families affected by realigwment of their plots (about 500) who
hold land titles vould also receive an indemnity. A r-settlement plan vas
received by IDA and found to be satisfactory.
E. Procurement
3.9       Contracts for civil works (USS2.7 million), including site
preparation, roadt, and on-site drainage in Old Ward 7, would be awarded
after prequalification, on the basis of International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) and in accordance with the IDA's guidelines. A preference of 7.5I
would be applied to bide from domestie civil works contractors.
3.10      Contracta for supplying trucks and heavy equipment to the District
and the Department of Sewerage of the MPWUH (US$1.8 million) vould be
awarded on the basis of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) '.n
accordance with the Association's guidelines.
3.11      Contracts for simple or small works of low cost, not likely to
attract foreign contractors (US$1.4 million), would be awarded through Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB). The contracts vould be advertised locally but
would also be open to foreign bidders, following local procedures acceptable
to the Association. These contracta would cover works in the old center of
Balbala, off-site infrastructure in Salines Ouest, and improvements of
the District's workshops, the pumping stations and the LO.
3.12      Light vehicles and office equipment for the District, MPWUL, LO,
and PMU (US$0.4 Million) valued at more than US$10,000 will be purchased
through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB). Foreign suppliers are eligible
to participate, following local procurement procedures acceptable to the
Association. Office equipment, furniture and supplies valued at less
than US$10,000 would be purchased locally after obtaining at least three
quotations.

3.13       The Association'* guidelines vill be uaed for the selection of
consultants for technical assistance (US$2.6 million), training (US$0.5
million) and con.ulting services (US$1.2 million).
3.14       Other contracte financed by CCCE, MCD, OPEC Fund, EEC, and SID

3.17      Th. achedule of credit disbursements, given in Ann.x 5, is ba« d
on the disbursement profile for the firet urban development project (Cradit
1518-DJI), *xcept that it has been adjusted to reflect disbursement for the
initial deposit in the *pecial account and r.financing of the PPF. Ail
diabursements vill be made against normal documentation submitted to the
Bank, except disburs.ments against op.rating costa and *ligible expenditurae
for contracte valued *t US$20,000 équivalent or less which vill be made
under *tatements of expenditures (SOE). Supporting documentation for
th-se vould be retained by the PMU and made available for r.view by the
Association during supervision. Thé closing date would be December 30,
1997.

3.19      A special account (revolving fund) in US dollars would be
established in a commercial bank with an initial deposit of US$500,000. The
special account opening balance is to equal three months of IDA
disbursements from the proceeds of the proposed credit.
G.  Supervision, Evaluation. and Monitorinz
3.20      The PMnU's director, deputy director, technical assistant and
financial officer would be responsible for monitoring the progress
in achieving the project's objectives. The PMU would also supervise the
studies for future action agreed upon under the project (see para. 3.7).
3.21      IDA would devote about 85 staff-weeks to supervision over the six-
year implementation period (see Annex 8). This staff time would be



- 25 -
concentrated muanly in the first thrae yearu end vould then diminish as sos
activities wlnd don and the PMU and exacuting agencies Sain more management
experience.  Although attention would ba given throughout the period to the
progrest of the opacifie program described in this report, emphasis would
be placed on the sectoral expenditure programs. That is, supervision would
be concerned more with implementation of a consistent end justified three-
year expenditure program for the sector (to be submitted annually for IDA
review by October 31), than with implementation of the specifie actions
identified. Staff required for supervision include a financial analyst, an
economist, and a municipal engineer, and inputs will be needed from
specialists in land management, housing finance, and urban planning.
3.22      The PMU would prepare progress reports each quarter on the
physical, financial, and socio-economic aspects of the program (see
Annex 9). These reports would review the performance of implementing
agencies, present key indicators of progress in fulfilling program goals,
and identify and recommend solutions for major problems. A project
completion report would be prepared and sent to the IDA within six months
of the close of disbursements (see Annex 9).
IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Cost Recovery and Replicability
4.1       The cost recovery measures adopted have been designed to make the
charges to be borne by households commensurate with their ability to pay and
with the benefits they receive. A main objective of the project is to
strengthen the existing cost recovery system and extend it where possible.
Project costs proposed to be recovered under the project are the followings
-    Old Wards (on-site and off-site costs)
-    Balbala (on-site costs, including for water and electricity)
-    Salines Ouest (on-site and off-site costs)
-    Water (Old Wards, Salines Ouest, Balbala:  off-site costs only)
-    Electricity (Old Wards, Salines Ouest, Balbala:  off-site
costs only)
4.2       The cost recovery provisions extend those applied under the first
DUDP (see Annex 15). Old Wards and Balbala costs would be recovered by the
LO through amicable transfers, fees, and sales of plots. The SID would
recover all costs for Salines Ouest operations from the beneficiaries.
On-site costs for water and electricity would be charged to beneficiaries
through ONED and EDD tariffs for the Old Wards, Salines Ouest and Balbala.
Other off-site costs related to Balbala and institutional support are not
considered recoverable and they would be absorbed by the Government and
donor community. About 55% of the project financing would be provided on a
grant basis and the remaining 45% would be on concessionary terms.
4.3       It is expected (see table below) that about 45% of the project
costs would be recovered directly from beneficiaries and about 5% would



- 26 -
ba recovered indirectly through property, garbage, aeverage taxes and clarket
feas.  Thee toxes and faes are paid through the genaral budget because
thore ls no uincipal authority to collect them.  To achieve this objective
plot prices must be increased. Specifie proposals have been discussed at
negotiations, and their enactment is a condition of effectiveness (para. 6.3
(b) and Annez 18).
4.4        A mechanism Was set up in the first DUDP for replicating actions
undertaken and recycling the funds recovered dtrectly (through the UDF) and
funds recovered from other projectu in the urban sector. The government
would use the UDF for preparation and design of future urban projecta. This
would thus establish a clear means of replicating the results by
establishing priorities for development of future sites and providing
funding for detailed designe and development of other urban activities. A
breakdown of cost recovery i suummarized in the table belows

4.5        The Government would contribute about US$7.3 million, of which
US$1.1 million would come from the SID for Salines Ouest operation and about
US$6.2 million from the general budget.
B. Financial ManaRement
4.6        A main weakness of the urban institutions is their inability to
manage their finances efficiently and to mobilize resources. An analysis of
the SID and CDD financial statements (Annex 11) shows how poorly the
finances of these institutions are managed.



- 27 -
(L)  SID ha. &a&et* of *bout US$9.5 million, of which 75Z are ln cah
deposlted in the banking aystem. Cash La 8enerated priimarLly from
cash inveatmant and not from land developm.nt or housing
oparations. The SID ineurs losses on its activity, but la largely
compensat.d by its interest *arned on cash deposited. The SID
n eds to implement adequate internal control systems for the fixed
*asets and accounts receivable. It is important that SID (after
15 years of inactivity) become a real angine for urban development
and begin to use its personnel and its cash efficiently. A
reorganization of SID is underway (approved by the Board of
Directors' meeting of June 1990), in which a close look vill be
taken at its activity as a whole and particularly its assets, lts
customers, its daily operations and its long-term strategy.
tii)  The financial situation of CDD is more critical.  Of lts assats
and portfolio, 68% are financed by loans primarily from local
institutions. CDD has been accumulating losses since its
inception. These losses amounted to FD 158 million, at Decamber
31, 1989--46% of its share capital. CDD is a development bank
working in all sectors, with an important share in housing. The
main problems facing CDD are (i) its policy for all sectors (Li
particular on housing credits); (ii) its level of funding
(mobilization of resources); and (iii) its management capabilities
in administering its portfolio and looking for viable projecta
that would turn CDD into a profitable institution. An agreement
on the roles of both the CDD and the SID was reached during
negotiations (para. 6.1 (e)).
4.7       The District of Djibouti is not financially autonomous, but
receives all its funds from the central government.  The DD annual operating
expenses are about FD 500 million.  It has 550 employees of which 475 work
in the Technical Services Department (garbage collection and street
cleaning). Investment expenditures amount to about FD 44 million. Annual
receipts from DD activities (market fees, vehicla taxes, garbage tax, and so
on) are in the range of FD 250 million each year. As noted in para. 1.27
the project would introduce new management techniques to help DD operate
more efficiently. The project would also help increase the revenues
generated by DD (garbage collection and market fees).

C.  Affordabilit
4.8       A 1989 housahold income survey in Djibouti shows the following
income distribution in Djibouti City (including the Old Wards and Baibala)t

Average                               150,000
4.9       The affordability test assumes that the project costs for the Old
Wards and Salines Ouest and for on-site costs in Balbala would be recovered
in full.  Water and electricity costs are not included in the affordability
calculations except for Salines Ouest, where SID would recover from it.
customers the full cost of its plots and the on-site portion of Balbala
costs. It is also assumed that proceeds from the sale of plots or amicable
transfers are paid over two years:

4.10      The affordability test is based on cumulative household incomes
in Djibouti city. But income levels vary greatly from one area to another
(Plateaux, administrative center, cités, Old Wards and Balbala). The lowest
incomes are in Balbala (an average FD 36,000/month), and about 752 of its
inhabitants can afford Balbala plots.

D. Flow of Funds
4.11      The government would make the proceeds of the IDA credit and of
other contributions available to the implementing agencies either as grants
(IDA, EEC, MCD, and OPEC Fund) or as loans (CCCE for the water component). In
addition to a project advance eccount in local currency to be managed by the
Ministry of Finance, a special account in foreign exchange will be established
at a commercial bank for the IDA credit.  All project expenditures must be
authorized by the PMU.
4.12      Project costs recovered from the bei.eficiaries (see para. 4.1) would
be collected by the LO and deposited in the existing Urban Development Fund
(UDF) to be reinvested in future urban programs. Annex 10 summarizes the flow
of funds of the project and the financial situation of the UDF.
E. Accounting and Auditing Requirements
4.13      Separate project accounts will be set up for all executing agencies
: MPWUH, DD, LO, CDD, SID, UDF, ONED, EDD and PMU. Consolidated accounts will
be maintained by the PMU for expenditures on all elements of the project. The
PMU will adopt an accrual accounting system.
4.14      All implementing agencies will be required to prepare financial
statements of project transactions shortly after the close of the government
fiscal year.   Auditors' opinions on the PMU, SID, UDF, and CDD financial
statements and the project transactions would be prepared by independent
auditors satisfactory to the IDA and submitted to the government and IDA within
six months of the end of the government fiscal year. The auditors' opinions
will be required to contain a special reference to SOEs (para. 3.17),
confirming that the claimed expenditures were used for the purpose intended.
The audit report of the PMU will include a separate analysis of the use of IDA
funds under the special account. The first audit would cover fiscal year 1991.

V. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. JustificatLon
5.1       Proliminary or detailed engineering cost estimates and
quantifiable benefits provide clear economic justification for all physical
compononta of the project. Willingness to pay for improvements to the urban
environment vas c'-%firmed in the first urban project and is incorporated in
the cost recovery mechanisms (paras. 4.1 to 4.5) and in quantifying the
benefits of the project (Annex 12). The components show a combined economic
return of more than 22%, with each showing a rate of return of more than
20%. Other components, such as institution-building and studies, are
justified by the qualitative analyses of the advantages and improvements
they vill help bring about. The evaluation of the physical components is as
followss
ERR
i)   Old Wards                                            20%
Old Ward 7, 1, and 2; Drainage in Old Wards 1 to 6
ii)  Balbala                                              302
3,600 plots, primary road network,
Old Center of Balbala, street signs
iii) Salines Ouest                                        29%
5.2       The economic evaluation of the Old Wards includes as costs the
engineering studies for Old Ward 7bis, Ambouli, and Djebel, and the
investments for drainage works collecting the effluent of Wards 1 to 6,
for a total of about US$4.5 million. The cost of the studies is US$0.12
million. The drainage works will serve a broader area than the wards
financed by the project. But investments required by the project need to
be evaluated as part of it even if they serve a broader area. The economic
rate of return of the Old Wards component without these investments is more
than 30%.
5.3       The evaluation of the project is linked to and depends on the cost
recovery mechanisms described in paras. 4.1 to 4.5. The recovery of capital
costs and of part of the recurrent costs associated with the physical
components of the project, such as maintenance, justifies the 20-year life
of the investments.
5.4       The project benefits quantified are increases in property values
and resulting increases in rental potential, which in Djibouti amounts to a
direct, measurable benefit. For the Old Wards, an increase in density has
been considered as well, since the improvements in access and drainage wili
increase the desirability of an area close to the city center. Important
benefits have not been quantified, such as the improvement of the urban
environment and health conditions as a result of eliminating stagnant pools

and reducing the rlak of floodu, benefita already demonstrated by the firet
urban project. The project vill affect employment significantly, not only
during 1mple_ntation but beyond, as the resources racovered are recycl-d.
This recyclilng vill benefit the urban area through the Urban Development
Fur.d and the lncreased employment associated with the hi8her level of
economic activity.
B. Risks and croposed remedies
5.5       The main project risk relates to the extent to which colt recovery
and recycling of funds may actually take place and policy reforms necessary
to the continued development of the sector are adopted. Thé development of
managerial skills and sound management practices and the replication of
successful solutions have been assured in designing the project vith
adequate technical assistance.
5.6       Project design and conditions addresa the sources of risk and
their possible effect on the project. Technical assistance, a major
training effort, and reorganization of institutions responsible for the
urban sector address the need to secure sustainability and replicability of
actions taken under the project, accounting for 352 of project funding.
Project conditions on the other hand respond to the need for acceptable cost
recovery mechanisms.
5.7       In view of the substantial role given to technical assistance and
institutional strengthening under the project and the conditions introduced,
the remaining risks are deemed acceptable, because (i) reliance on increased
goverrmnent spending was avoided in the financing plan of the project; (ii)
the French bilateral agency as agreed to finance a substantial technical
assistance and training program; and (iii) the project addresses the
reactivation of one of the sectors key to the development of the Djiboutian
economy, will have high visibility, and has received strong support from the
government of Djibouti.
5.8       A risk analysis has been performed (Annex 12). It shows that the
project has a probability higher than .95 of having an economic return
greater than 10%.
5.9       A sensitivity analysis assuming a 25% reduction in benefits and a
15% increase in project construction costs was performed (Annex 12). It
shows rates of economic return of 14.4% and 18% and suggests that acceptable
rates of return upon completion of the project are to be expected.
C. Poverty Alleviation Aspects
5.10      The project is expected to make a strong contribution to poverty
alleviation. Services for low-income populations and their access to them
are to be improved, and the risk of flood damage will be substantially
reduced. The improvement in the quality of urban life will be made
sustainable over the long term through cost recovery.



-32 -
5.11      la geunral, all inhabitants of the rehabilitated varda, vwhether or
not they live on upgraded streets, vill benefit from the improved drainage.
The 34,000 inhabitants in Wards 1, 2, and 7 have been disadvantag.d. But
the second project, which will benef$t about 152 of the city's 45,000
householde, vLll reach a larger proportion of households vith incomes belov
the median for the city, most of whom are renteras
5.12      Other direct benefits to the poorer population grovpe include the
employment effects of the project, which would increase the incomes of poor
households. And the critical mass of the project will allow, through the
application of recovered funds, future urban improvements similar to those
financed under this project. This procesa should continue to alleviate
poverty beyond the project implementation period.
D.  Environmental Aspects
5.13      The physical components of the project vill improve the urban
environment. The rehabilitation of the Old Wards, the improvemente to
drainage and flood control, the rehabilitation of the Old Center of Balbala
and the additional connections to the water distribution network, combine to
decrease stagnant pools of domestic effluents, flood damage, poor accest to
piped vater, and lack of sanitary services to the homes of a large part of
the urban population.
5.14      The rehabilitation of Wards 1, 2, and 7 under the project would
have effects comparable with those of the works carried out in the first
project. The impact on the urban environment of improved roads (usable by
public service and emergency vehicles and for garbage collection) and better
disposal of rainwater and waste water into the sewers would be considerable.
The better public hygiene and oti;r positive effects will extend beyond the
resident population of these wards, since the area of rehabilitated wards Ls
growing. The second urban project includes measures to increase residents'
avareness of sanitation issues in conjunction with the health committees
already established in the Wards. The AFVP (see para. 2.15) would also
assist the committees Ln gathering data about health and environmental
issues.
5.15      The development of Balbala (3,600 plots) will ease the pressure on
land and housing in the Old Wards, where crowding is severe, with 500 to 600
persons per hectare. Sanitation will be better on the slopes of Balbala
(despite the difficulty of digging cesspits there) than Ln the Old Wards,
which are so low that cesspits go down to the groundwater.
5.16      More generally, developing the drinking water supply will help to
reduce the spread of waterborne diseases.

DJIBOUTI
Second Urban D.v.lopm.nt Prolect
PRIME MINISStR                                 REPUBLIC OF DJIBOUTI
RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING                       UNITY - EQUALITY - PEACE
AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT
SECTOR POLICY STATEMENT
As a result of the studios and works carried out in the context
of the preparation and execution of the Firat Urban Devolopment Project,
together with various other studies and specifically the one undertaken vith
UNDP-HABITAT assistance in order to formulate a housing policy, the
Government is nov in a position to outline a dynamic and equitable murban
policy' that in consistent with the means of the Djiboutian State and
householdt, and capable of meeting the population's legitimate aspirations
for better living standards and aiso the development and progresa goals of
the Government of the Republic.
In view of the very severe handicaps imposed on our *conomy by
geographic circusatances and demographic growth, no more than a slight
increase in average household income, and accordingly in State resources,
can be predicted. This policy will therefore have to be implemented on the
basis of these resources supported by temporary external assistance that vill
have to be managed with optimum efficiency.   Neither would anything be
accomplished if the necessary investments were made but then allowed to
rapidly deteriorate because no parallel provision is made to ensure proper
operation and maintenance.
1. Participation and Decentralization
Being aware of the necessity of transferring responsibility for this
(and other) purpose to the populations directly benefited by the improvements
and maintenance services in the wards, the %-..vernment is promoting represen-
tative local management, first at the level of modestly sized units -- the
Municipalities -- and for clearly delimited functions and then, as soon as
experience warrants, on a larger scale and for more complex and extensive
functions. The resources needed for the normal exercise of the responsibi-
lities thus progressively entrusted to the local level vill of course be
furnished to the managers of these units.
However, responsible community life requires a learning process, and
the inhabitants' participation in the management of their environment should
not be limited to payment of an obligatory levy. In an economic situation
such as that of Djibouti, a contribution in kind and in labor is essential
to offset the low level of household incomes, in order to ensure maintenance
at least cost of the infrastructure already in place and to facilitate the
implementation of new investments. All conceivable formulas for community
participation must be tried out in order to determine the ones that are most
acceptable and productive in our society.



Page 2 of 8
2. Public ProDerty
la the contest of the establishment of local management authorities,
and as these develop and progreus. the Governmnt also proposes to clearly
define the allocation of public property -- currently consisting solely of
that owned by the State -- among the different authorities. together vith
assigrment of the accompanying responsibilities, so as to remove any sources
of ambiguity, duplication or conflicts of competence, and also to better
match the expenses and resources of the different parties.
3. Land Lexislation and Management
Adoption of land legielation favorable to investment is the
prerequisite for rapid grovth of savings by households and the different
parties involved in economic activity. While respecting traditional family
or tribal customs and practices regarding landholding where the requirements
for development do not render any immediate change necessary, the Government
accordingly proposes to introduce some order into the inherited logislation
and to update Djiboutian land lav.
Rational and transparent management of land resources nd security
of private land occupancy are the essential preconditions for progress iz
urban planning and in living standards in general, as regards both improve-
ment of housing  nd development of public services.  The rehabilitation of
the old vards of the city has made it possible to undertake, at the cost of
much painstaking vork, regularization of the old provisional occupancy
permits in the form of amaicable transfers. and to initiate a process of
renovation of the dvellings nd of their sanitary facilities. It vould be
absurd to create nev neighborhoods of a nature that vould, at some later
date, pose the same probleme.  Without making any changes in exceptional
measures that vere justified by past situations but should nov be
increasingly rare occurrences, the Government intends to impose a regular
land management system and to limit, in the future, to a minimum and cases of
manifest urgency any development operations carried out outside of the rules
and control of the Service des Domaines.
4. Cost Recovery
As a general rule, and whatever the source of the funde or the
financial terms set by the donor, it is understood that vith regard to
production and transfer of building plots the full amount of the cOSts
involved ia readying these plots is to be recovered, in one vay or another,
through the selling prîces and appropriate fees or taxes, so that the
resources can be recovered as quickly as possible for nev operations.
In principle, the cost of the development of the sites, vith service
levels compatible vith the incomes of the households settled on them. is
payable by the beneficiaries and vill be recovered through the sale of the
plots (or the *redevance domaniale').  The same must apply to the cost of
putting in the primary roads (vhich should not exceed 15Z of the cost of
developing the sites), until such time as local taxes generate sufficient
revenue. Extensions of primary vater and electricity systemi. on the other
hand. which are justified by projected billing receipts, should be financed



- 37                          Annei 1
Page 3 of 8
by the public agencies (EDD, ONED, OPT) out of their own funds or by means of
borrovinge. The Urban Development Fund (UDF), established to receive the
fuads recovered from the first Urban Development Project, vill function in
the same vay for all similar operations, whether the monles concerned are
derived from transfers or from the *redevance domaniale. 
5.  PropramminR of Urban Investments
The considerable volume of investments planned in the second Urban
Development Project vill make it possible to advance beyond the ad hoc
operations phase and to institute a genuine continuous programming of urban
investments that meets the foreseeable demand and is consistent vith total
public investment, in order to ensure as regular as possible a volume of
works, which is an essential condition for developing solid constructionand
public vorks sector appropriate to the country's needs, and for obtaining
better and less varying prices.
6. Mobilization of Savings and Flnancinz of Housing
Rehabilitation of infrastructure and regularization of inherited
land-tenure situations form a prerequisite for improvement of housing, but
are not sufficient in themselves. A housing financing policy is necessary.
The population of the Djibouti agglomeration spends about DF 2.5 billion per
year on home building or improvement, hence on average oaly just over DF 1
million per nev dwelling.  This volume could be appreciably increased if
access to credit vere easier and credit vere granted more readily based on
the capabilities of the different categories of households. The experience
vith the small loans (DF 500,000) provided under the Urban Development
Project shows that the population found them very attractive, but the
guarantee requirements are too restrictive for this scheme to be developed
further.
National savings, public and private, have so far exceeded the
economy's financing needs, meaning that relatively ample financing i8
available for housing provided these savings are properly gathered,
remunerated and channeled.
The Governmont proposes to make the CDD the special instrument for
mobilizing and utilizing savinge for the benefit of the housing sector. To
this end, CDD statutes vill be amended to enable it to gather and stabilize
household savinge. A significant proportion of institutional savinge will
also be entrusted to it while its own or concessional resources vill, if
possible, be increased to enable it to offer commercial banks attractive
placement opportunities, contain the cost of its resources, consolidate
housing loans at a rate close to the market rate, establish a savings and
loan system for housing, and progressively expand its clientele to include
households vith modest but steady incomes.
At the sume time, in the interests of these candidates for amall
loans, the emergence of associations, cooperatives and mutual societies for
housing vill be actively encouraged so that they vill be able to serve as
intermediaries betveen the CDD (or the banks) and these candidates, and
provide them vith assistance or guarantees. Vithin the CDD, these different



- 38-                          Annez 1
Page 4 of 8
categories of loans vill ho managed separately f rom those to small and medium
enterprises and industries, to prevent any undue transfer of possible
advantages from one category to another.
7.  Recommencement of Activity b? the Société Immobilière de Dtibouti (SID)
SID, for its part, is going to di-nose of the old housing properties
owned by lt, after minimum refurbishing, ln order to reconstitute its own
resources and start neo serviced plot and home ownership operations aimed at
a clientele that normally has the necessary funda available -- thanks in
particular to CDD loans, has been correctly identified by means of market
studies and is targeted by a dynsmic marketing policy.
8. Construction Sector
The numerous studies made of the possibilities for manufacturing or
utilizing ^local^ materials have not unfortunately borne fruit, essentially
on account of the small uize of the market.  Nevertheless, owing to the
foreign  exchange  outflove  and  the  loss  of  employment  caused by  the
importation of cement nd various materials and articles for construction
purposes, there are grounds for pursuing -- if the housing financing policy
significantly increases demand -- promotion of locally manufactured materials
(lime, baked-clay bricks or blocks, hardware, etc.).
Significant progress is also possible in measures to increase the
durability or stability of structures, improve comfort or reduce costs. Work
in these directions vill be encouraged. Finally, the construction standards
-- especially the seismic protection rules -- applied to amall buildings push
coste beyond the reach of low-income purchasers. These regulations muet be
amended to bring them botter into line vith the risks involved and to
recognize construction in light materials as a durable solution suited to
Djiboutils special conditions.

Prolect Completion Report
3.        The Borrover vill prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR) to be
submitted to the Association not later than six months after the closing
date.
4.        The primary objective of the PCR is to reinforce the self-
evaluation capacity of the Borrover and the Association's operating
departments and to facilitate dissemination of lessons learned through
the project. The PCR vill examine and assess:
(a) the performance by the Borrover and the Association of their
respective obligations under the Credit Agreement and whether the
Association could have been more helpful;
(b)  the results that can be expected f rom the project, as compared vith
expectations at appraisal, and whether the original expectations
vere realistic; and
(c) vhether in retrospect the project vas vorth doing or could have
been done better.
5.        For those components of the project for which a rate of returm vas
estiated during appraisal, the PCR should contain a revised estimate of the
rate of return of the project and analyze the reasons for physical or
economic deviations. However, the revised rate of return calculation should
be as simple as possible and should absorb only a minor portion of the time
devoted to the preparation of the PCR. Relevant information supporting this
analysis should be included as an annex.

Second Urban Development Project
Benefits Estimation and Economic Rate of Return
General
1.0       The economic evaluation of the physical vorks financed under the
project has considered a 20-year life span for all of them. This estimation
is conservative, since the rehabilitation of the Old Wards and the new lots
of Salines Ouest and Balbala are vorks vith a much greater permanence. But
the mainri-nance of urban streets and drainage works necessary to justify this
economic life is assured by a cost recovery system and by a major technical
assistance effort under the project. Accordingly,    the   economic  life
considered in the evaluation is a reasonable estimation of the permanence
which, as minimum, can be expected from the project's physical components.
2.0       The costs of the project are based on final engineering costs for
the most part, as shown in Annex 3. For the economic evaluation, costs net
of taxes for all procured goods under the project have been considered.
They have been referred to as base costs throughout this report, and do not
include contingencies.   The effects   on the economic evaluation of the
project of possible variations in project costs are shown below in the
presentation of the sensitivity and risk analyses performed.
3.0       The project benefits quantifiable in this case are the increases
in the stream of rental values of the properties upgraded by the project.
The advantages to this measure of benefits are several in the case of
Djibouti, since the situation vithout the project vas determined straight-
forwardly by field surveys. These also allowed an estimation of the
elasticities of rental values to improvements in the urban space from the
data obtained from neighborhoods included in the First Urban Project.
Furthermore, rentals are r.ot controlled or distorted in Djibouti and are a
good representation of the market value of the improvements performed.
Estimation of Prolect Benef'ts
4.0       The estimation of benefits vas performed as followss
CLn- [(ItIPI+l)' -11 * Ln
Where:
CLn  -  the rental differential for year  n
It   -  nev  investments in the site
PI   -  initi&il value of the housing stock
a    -  elasticity coefficient
Ln   -  rental value for year n

5.0       The investments under the project increase the desirability of
the areas concerned. The value of the elascicity coefficient reflects the
characteristics of each. site such as the degree of integration with the
city, the proximity to the central bussinese district, the protection against
the risk of flooding, and the possibility of further densification. The
elasticity coefficients estimated for the project components are as follows:
for the Old Wards 1.8, for Salines West 1.5, and for Balbala 1.2.
6.0       The realization of the benefits of the project has been estimated
to lag behind the investments and be proportional to the rate of completion
of each component. The following table gives a summary of the costs and
benefits estimated for the project. All figures are in millions of FD.

Economic Evaluation
7.0      Based on the information presented above, the economic rate of return
of the physical investments of the project is 22Z . The Old Wards have a rate
of return of 20.2Z, Salines West 29.3Z, and Balbala 29.9Z. These estimates
have not attempted explicitly to include shadow rates for labor or foreign
exchange. Shadow coefficients of about .67 for labor and more than 1.1 have
been estimated for Djibouti. but the data on which they are based does not
allow one to consider them as firm estimates. Accordingly, the likely
variability of project costs and benefits vas addressed by means of an
extensive sensitivity analysis and a risk analysis.
8.0      Sensitivity Analysis.  A broad measure of the sensitivity of the
project's economic returns to variations in cost/benefit data indicates that
a 25Z reduction in project benefits reduces the economic rate of return of
the project to 14.4Z; and a 15Z increase in project construction costs
reduces economic returns to 18Z.   A more expansive sensitivity analysis
is shown in the table below, indicating the levels of project costs
corresponding to variations in benefits and different rates of return. It
clearly shows that it would take strong departures from initial estimates of
both costs and benefits for the rate of return to be unsatisfactory.

Note that the firet year benefit is defined as the net benefit in the first
year that construction is finished, divided by the total construction cost
for the particular rate under consideration.
9.0      Risk Analysis.   That the variability  in project parameters  is
predictable as to the possible sources of the variability itself, but not as
to the magnitude of the departures from the initial estimates, calls for a
further measure  of project  exposure,  if any.   The need  to obtain an
indication of how likely an adverse project outcome may be leads into a risk
analysis of the project. The table below shows the data used in performing
such risk analysis.    The costs  of each component have  been  taken as
independent random variables distributed according to normal distributions.
The mean of each of them vas taken to be 10Z higher than the initial
estimates, and the standard deviation was taken as equal to 20Z of the



- 78 -                         Annex 12
Page 4 of 5
initial estimates. The variability cf the benefits vas also conservatively
estimated since they are treated as independent. normally distributed random
variables vith means at lOZ below initial estimates and standard deviations
equal to 10Z of the initial estimates. The number of samples taken was 400.
The mean for this sampling for the economic rate of return of the project may
differ from the initial estimation of the rate of return, since it reflects
the incorporation of information and judgments that could not enter
explicitly in the evaluation at the outset. For instance, the incidence of
subsurface rock formations at Balbala, if generalized, would increase the
costs specified for the component beyond the estimates, works in the Old
Wards may face overruns as in the case of #6 in the First Urban Project
and s0 on. This is recognized as a matter of course in the presentation of
project cost data in the form of physical and price contingencies, and risk
analysis allovu for its incorporation into the economic evaluation of the
project.  Similarly, the benefits side, clearly and well defined as it is,
may show over the 20 years of project life important variations, such as
economic conditions that may affect adversely property values in the city or
a reversal in the population increases due to immigration.   These are
expressed in the risk data used in this case.

10.0          The results of the risk analysis indicate a mean of 16.6Z for
the econoic rate of return of the project, &rd a standard deviation of 4.12.
The table below shows the frequency distribution and the cumulative
probability distribution for the economie rate of return of the project.
It shows that the probability that the economic rate of return of the project
viii exceed 102 is about 972.   Furthermore,  the project has about 202
probability of exceeding an economic return of 202. Therefore, the project
is likely to show mn acceptable rate of return, albeit somewhat below the
initial estimates.

Benefits not Quantified
11.0      The benefits of the project that have not been quantified are the
increased accessibility to urban services as a result of street openings
(Balbala). and realignment (Old Vards), lesser risk of flooding, and the
inducement to   improve the quality of housing as a result. Although the
effects of some of these improv-¶ents are expressed in rental values, there
is an element of dynamization of the process of home improvements that is
quite separate and not reflected in the increases of rental valves.
Similarly, the impovements in garbage removal and elimination of stagnant
pools made possible by the project represent benefits in improved public
health conditions that have not been captured explicitly in the analysis.

- a pattern of sparse and irregular rainfall, the year-to-year
average being unmeaningful, with exceptional rains of over 200 mm
in 24 hours (in April 1989), for which it is impossible to
calculate a statistical period of return;
-  absence of constant surface flow in the Ambouli river, which is
also subject to flash flooding; and
- natural vegetation interspersed with thorny locust trees.
(b)   a site, occupied or in the process of being occupied, with such
unfavorable features as:
-  large areas barely above the average tide level, in some spots
belov it, occupied before infill and consequently difficult to
drain, vhich vere subject to flooding from the Vadi Ambouli
before construction of the protective dike, and which are still
exposed to rising rainvater levels on their watershed, where the
vater table is very close to the surface; and
- bamaltic areas vhere it is difficult to construct networks or dig
cesspits that are moderately permeable.
2.       These severe natural conditions are not mitigated by an economy
strong enough to overcome the resultant disadvrantages. Production of local
building materials or materials for use in civil vorks is nonexistent, and
studies have not come up vith any justification for new production. House-
hold incomes are low and hardly adequate to allow spending large sums on
modes of construction offering protection from the heat and rain.   Many
dwellings are even built of scrap materials (metal, plastic, and cardboard).

3.       The national budget funds available are insufficient to permit
installation befor. occupancy of anything more than a minimal infrastructures
many houa.. art riot connected to the potable vater supply (if they vwre,
vater would have to b. rationed), and mont could not be connected to a
wastevater disposal system. The appearance of squatter settlements made up
of temporary housing, without proper street layouts (Wards 6, part of Ward 7
and Ambouli, and old Balbala), has further aggravated the general situation
since 1960.
4.       The  particular  conditions  affecting  the  settling  of  Djibouti
represented, and still represent, an additional handicap for the urban
environment:   some of the immigrants come from neighboring countries,
Ethiopia and Somalia, whence they arrived under different types of pressure,
generally penniless and often in a deplorable physical state. Other free-
moving migrants are semi-nomads (pastoralists) who are unprepared for urban
life and have never built a fixed or permanent dwelling.
A Multiplicity of Serious Consequences for the Urban Environment
5.       This  combination  of  unfavorable  natural,  economic,  and  human
conditions has not been conducive to the creation of a salutary urban
environment.   These conditions have created risks and deplorable living
conditions for individuals and the community.
6.       In the low-lying areas of the city (the Old Wards allocated under the
provisional occupancy permaits, which authorized the construction of temporary
housing only), the absence of vital infill prior to construction means that
torrential rains, combined with the overflow from the Wadi Ambouli, and the
high tides cause periodic flooding.  The floods drive people from their
homes, drowrn some, and result in substantial, but avoidable, material losses.
And the temporary structures age rapidly and soon become tumbledown, while
people who circumvent the prohibition on permanent building materials put up
badly constructed buildings.
7.       In these same low-lying areas, the drainage system is inefficient
because there is little slope to the land, flows change direction with the
tide, and detritus accumulates at the bottom of the collectors, where it
hardens during the dry periods and later blocks runoff.  Before the first
DUDP, in the as yet unrehabilitated wards, secondary roads generally had no
runoff and were sometimes below the level of the outlets:  wastewater and
detritus would stay there, and still does, multiplying the potential sources
of disease.  Seepage from the cesspits, which are dug into the ground without
any linin6 or leakproofing,  runs into the water table and pollutes it.
During flooding, the cesspits are also flooded, and the surface water comes
into contact with human excrement.
8.       Because of its rocky slopes, Balbala is not suited for well or
latrine digging, and people tend to relieve themselves in the open air on the
periphery, especially to the right of the Arta road. This area has become a
veritable dumping ground, with the resident population increasing from 20,000
to 60,000. Since the cost of laying underground water pipes is double what
it is in the rest of the city, this encourages the retaining of standpipes

Page 3 of 5
and the truck±ng in of vater, togtther with the use of dubious r-ceptacles in
which the vater ia loft uncovered in the open for long periodu.
9.       The health situation in the city is disturbing.  Infant mortality is
high, though it has dropped a little over the past four years (144 per
thousand compared with 200 per thousand in 1986). Diarrheal diseases still
account for a high proportion--more than 13%--of deaths. Malaria, endemic in
the neighborhood of the Wadi Ambouli despite the temperature, reached
epidemic proportions in 1989.   But above all, the health conditions of
the foreign immigrants give cause for concern:   42% with malaria (6,500
immigrants a month), the majority going to D4ibouti and its poor neighbor-
hoods. Overcrowding (600 inhabitants per hectare) facilitates propagation of
different diseases, and people's ignorance in these matters makes preventive
measures ineffective.
Impact of the first DUDP
10.         There is no question that the first DUDP has improved the
situation in the rehabilitated wards, and even t.hroughout the city as a
whole. Qualitatively speaking, this improvement in substantial. Repaira to
the roads and construction of a storm drainage system, even if it in open and
als used for domestic wastewater, have effectively lessened the amount of
standing vater. Improved access allows better garbage collection and greater
hygiene enforcement, even though not all the roads are usable by vehicles.
Pleased with these improvements, the people have rapidly adopted more
hygienic behavior, sweeping roads and gutters and not allowing refuse to pile
up. Overall, the foci of germ proliferation and fermentation have decreased.
This local improvement can help reduce disease propagation. In Balbala, the
substantial changes made have completely altered the situation in the old
centers water supply and garbage collection have broken the earlier pattern
of neglect and its effects.
11.         But it is risky to claim that the general improvements in sanita-
tion are directly linked to the results of the first DUDP. The reduction of
infant mortality is more broedly to be ascribed to the vaccination campaigns
conducted over the past  few years:   56% of the urban population was
completely imunized by early 1989 and 75% by February 1990.  The malaria
epidemic resuited from the exceptional rains and floods of 1989.  Epidemio-
logical data are inadequate and not sufficiently broken down to allow
identification of the neighborhoods treated or quantification of the positive
consequences of the first DUDP.
12.         On the other hand, the negative consequences need to be mentioned.
First, the raising of the pavement and stormwater gutters was not systema-
tically followed by a raising of the yards and floors of the houses. This
led to at least a temporary increase in the number of cases where water no
longer flowed naturally tO the outside. The cesspits have not improved, and
many of these, which were in the roadway, have had to be removed. Construc-
tion of better managed blocks has, in some cases, displaced the problems to



- 83 -                         Annex 13
Page 4 of 5
the poriphery of those ira&i. The reosettling of the many households *ffected
by the nw  laignents, and then by the demolition of part of Ward 6 in
Balbala, vithout any prior stepe to provide alternative iccommcdation, ha.
increased population pressure on an already poorly managed *re& (see para. 8
above). Rates of diarrheal disease, parasitosis, and malaria are higher here
than elsewhere. The dike on the right bank of the Wadi Ambouli is surely
going to lead to more frequent flooding on the left bank.   And, in the
absence of a sewerage system, the surface drainage of wastewater from Balbala
cannot fail to increase pollution of the river bed and the market garden
wells.
Im,act of the Second Proiect
13.         To the extent that the second project is a continuation, in new
wards, of the first, its positive effects will simply be added on to those
already achieved by the firat DUDP. A more than proportional impact can even
be expected, as and when a larger percentage of the population as iffected.
Construction of a wastewater disposal system in Wards 1 and 2, justifîed by
a higher income level and a larger number of hookups to the vater supply
network, will make it possible to eliminate the cecspits dug down into the
water table and their negative impact. Changing the dimensions of the main
interceptor sewers should facilitate stormwater runoff and further shorten
the time needed for the wards to dry out following a storm or a flood.
14.         The development in Balbala of 3,600 plots, not all developed to
the same level, but made easily improvable by the installation of suitably
sized main supply lines, should lead to a rapid increase in the number of
households directly connected to the drinking water supply. This will make
it possible to limit the number of standpipes and tank truck deliveries.
Rules need to be established for maintaining standpipe sites, anci experiments
in private management of such facilities should be conducted. the first DUDP
has changed the image of Balbala in people's minds, and plot holders there
will probably be considerably less disadvantaged than the immigrants or slum
dwellers who preceded them.   The number of requests for hookups to the
electricity system and the widespread digging of cesspits in the rocky ground
are a sign that the new inhabitants' health and attitude to sanitation are
going to be different.
15.         Strengthening the District's garbage collection services, financed
by the Project, will facilitate more frequent and more widespread collection,
reducing the length of time that the garbage remains in the wards.  The
location of the Doudha dump and plans for improving its management will
Leduce the possibilities of garbage-related pollution:  the dump is far from
the inhabited areas, the grcundwater from which drinking water is pumped is
more than 30 meters deep at that point, with intervening impermeable strata,
and the new tubewells are located more than 2 km upstream. The additional
resources available for maintaining the sewerage network, and the technical
assistance assigned to Public Works, should reduce breakdowns and their
effects on wastewater removal.



- 84 -                         Ann.x 13
Page 5 of 5
16.         Folloving on from the experience of the firet DUDP, the Project
includes *a NGO oporation in the varda to familiarist the inhabitanta vith
hygiene and road and gutter maintenance and to help them org&nize the
necessary plot infill vorks (and reconstruction of their dwellings).  An
intensive effort should be made in this context to promote the construction
of fixed, leakproof cesapits and an emptying system, to limit pollution of
the nearby water table.
17.         Upon project completion, there will still be some Old Wards that
have nict ben rehabi'itated (unlesa accolerated recovery miakes 4t possible to
contemplate a supplementary tranche), but these will be the neighborhoods
least subject to poor protection and drainage (Wards 7bis, Ambouli, and
Djebel). The pressure of the demand for building land will be felt in the
areas located beyond the limits of the 1983 Master Plan, and in particular in
areas where the water table is protected. The project plans, before 1995, to
update the Master Plan so as to identify the protective measures and, if
necessary, reinforce them, and to provide the best possible guidelines for
future urban development.
Recommendations
18.         To ensure better management of Djibouti's urban environment, lt
will be necessary to monitor the effects of the operations carried out and to
take more precise and reliable measurements of the local and overall health
and sanitation situation, particularly in terms of epidemiological data, se
far nonexistent.
9.         Greater attention needs to be paid to the dissemination of
different modes of eliminating human excrement. These need to take household
resources into account, but must also, in the Old Wards, be designed to
ensure better hygiene and be located far from the water table (leakproof
cesspits or chemical latrines).   In Balbala the methoda must be more
hygienic, less likely to pollute the environment, and less costly (raised
cesspits with horizontal spreading). Steps also need to be taken to improve
standpipes and their sites.
20.         A study of the possibilities of providing potable water to a
future urban area of 400,000-500,000 inhabitants and of the conditions for
protecting the corresponding resources should be undertaken at the time the
Djibouti Urban Master Plan is revised.
21.         The project should devote some eeicn te developing plantings,
particularl> in the disadvantaged wards.

DJIBOUTI
Second Urban Development Project
A. Termas of Reference for the Establishment and
Implementation of a Housing Financing System
1.       3Under the 'housing loansw component of the first DUDP. loans of
about $9,700 each vere granted to finance approximately 100 SID housing
unita, and 288 samall lump-sun loans of $2,800 each (DF 500,000--initially
DF 240,000) vere granted to improve housing in the vards rehabilitated under
the Project.  The corresponding Project funds vere onlent, in the form of
subloans, to SID and CDD for subsequent recovery. For CDD, the funds vere
made available for 12 years, vith a one-year grace period. at an interest
rate of 6S. CDD made 12-year loans to the beneficiaries, vith one year of
grace and at 82 interest. After initial delays in getting the program under
vay, due in part to the time needed to set up a Loan Committee and for that
Committee to establish the loan terms, the small loans vere rapidly
disbursed.   CDD, as Project executing agency, managed the loans as an
activity on third-party account, that is, for the account of the Project.
It established separate accounts for the operating costs related to this
activity, which it did not regard as part of its normal business operations
because of the excessively high costs of managing the loans relative to the
amounts involved. CDD today estimates that its outcome from this operation
vas negative, despite a contractual payment of a 52 commission (DF 7
million).   Moreover, no arrangements vere made for the operation to be
continued, after exhaustion of the Project funds, out of CDD's own resources
or using funds obtained on the local financial market.
2.        Thus, if the housing loan component of the first DUDP is to be
continued, two conditions need to be met at the institutional level:
(i) domestic resources need to be mobilized to guarantee stable and adequate
financing of a realistic and consistent policy geared to the true housing
situation and to actual household incomes, and (ii) guidelines need to be
established for managing the funds thus made available and for lending to
applicants.
3.        The overall economic and financial data are known.  The studies
carried out in connection vith the first and second DUDP have accumulated
data on demand, and CDD's experience provides a good vorking base. Thus no
further analysis is needed. What is necessary is to identify approaches and
to embark on a pragmatic and prudent line of action. It has therefore been
agreed that the best way is to assign two experts on a long-term basis to the
Director of the Central Bank (BND) and to the Director of the Caisse de
Développement de Djibouti (CDD), to vork from vithin and assist the local
officials in establishing choices and operating procedures in a medium-term
atrategy.

Page 2 of 8
Mobilization of Domestic Resources
4.        The expert assigned to BND vill be required to assess the capacity
of Djibouti's financial system to attract regular savings, and to determine
what share of those savings could be earmarked for the housing financing
policy. and on what terme.
5.        To that end, the expert will evaluate the savings prospects, for at
least the next ten years, of the principal collectors of savings, namely the
banking system and the savings institutions (Caisse de Prévoyance Sociale.
insurance companies), in terms of prudent economic prospects for the same
period.
6.        In liaison with the institutions concerned, he will analyze the
conditions governing collection of savings and alternative procedureqi for
using those savings, vith a viev to arriving at a mutual agreement on the
amounts that could reasonably be channeled into housing financing. first over
the short term and then in the longer run; the conditions governing such use
of savings within Djibouti's financial context and their conversion into
medium- or long-term credit; and the price of the resource and the interest
of the collectors in intervening as operators.
7.        He vill prepare a strategy for mobilizing domestic savings to
the benefit of the housing sector, classifying those savings into different
types, with their timetables and the timetable for setting up financial
circuits and rules for their utilization. This strategy vill need indicators
of the situation and components of the national financial situation and
measures designed to prevent the continuation of any action when no longer
justified by the circumstances.
8.        Finally,  he vill make  suggestions,  in  agreement  vith  BND's
management, on possible legislative or regulatory provisions that vould favor
the rational development of housing financing or reduce the risks to the
country's financial system.
9.        A housing policy consistent vith real needs cannot be based on
external financing, because of the volume of resources needed and the non-
productive nature of foreign exchange used to finance housing construction.
Developm1nt of Housina Credit
10.       Subject to the necessary precautions, the development of housing
credit is a powerful means of developing household savings and consolidating
the national financial system.  CDD is making good progrese along those
lines, and the purpose of providing it vith assistance is not to advise it to
take ill-considered rieks, but to help it develop activities of this kind.
il.       To that end, the expert assigned to the Director of CDD vill not
start vork until the partners in the domestic financial system are satisfied
that the prospects for setting up housing financing mechanisms are
sufficiently clear and favorable for CDD to take the necessary steps tO



- 87 -                         Annex 14
Page 3 of 8
participate in the vigorous implementation of this financing, and that
consequently  the  creation  of  a  specialized  department  vithin  the
establishment is or vill be justified.
12.       The expert vill then assess the prospects for developing housing
credit vithin Djibouti's economic and social context. in light of CDD's
experience. This analysis vill take very careful account of the conditions
governing the provision of guarantees, having regard to the financial
situation of the households and the actual conditions in which mortgage or
other guarantees would come into play, should the need arise, and taking
account of the targeted clientele.
13.       He  vill  simulate  several  levels  of  activity  for  a  future
specialized department, looking at both the overall volume of lending and
a breakdown by unit volume, estimating the necessary resources, operating
costs, possible margins, and costs to the department to be set against the
crodit as a bat*k commission, vith a breakdown of that commission by borrower
category.
14.       ge vill offer suggestions on organization of the housing loans
department. staff hiring procedures, and any training requirements (or the
measures to be taken if a department of this kind is not justified, at least
for certain levels of activity).
15.       Finally, with the approval of the CDD's Director, he vill suggest
possible legislative, institutional, or regulatory measures designed to
promote the development of housing credit, vithin CDD or vithin a more
general framework, including the setting up of a guarantee fund, amendments
to CDD's statutes to authorize it to receive savings deposits, propose
financial instruments, and so on.
B. Termes de référence de l'étude sur l'impact de la
municipalisation sur l'organisation et le
financement des services du District de Djibouti
Exposé des motifs
16.       Les textes organiques de 1977 posent le principe de la crdation de
Municipalités ccze Ocollectivités territoriales de base au sein desquelles
s'organise et ne diversifie le développement économique, culturel et social
de la coimauté nationale  et fixent les conditions générales de leur
autonomie et de leur tutelle, y compris s'agissant de la mise en place
'd'organismes communs éventuels.
17.       Les  décrets  de  1978  et  1979  ont  précisé  les  'attributions,
fonctionnement et administration' de ces collectivités, arrêté leurs limites
géographiques, et désigné les 'membres des délégations spéciales' en
attendant des élections municipales.   Ce dispositif ne s'est pas révélé
viable et la municipalisation a dl être suspendue.

Page 4 of 8
18.       Les  autorités  supérieures  de  la République  de  Djibouti  ont
manifesté leur intention de reprendre cette réforme, eu égard en particulier
i la croissance de la capitale, qui compterait en 1990 près de 250 000
personnes et des problémes de gestion et de participation qu'une telle taille
de ville requiert.
19.       Il est entendu que cet effort de décentralisation sera conduit de
façon très progressive ce qui implique, si l'on se réfère aux textes
antérieurs, que les futures Municipalités auront, dans un premier temps d'une
durée non fixée, une autonomie très modeste et en conséquence seront soumises
a une tutelle très étroite de la part des services du Ministère de
l'Intérieur.  Quoiqu'il en soit, la direction devrait étre donnée et il
importe, en dehors de toute considération de politique, d'esquisser des
étapes possibles d'une telle réforme, dans le contexte spécifique de Djibouti
et pour ce qui concerne au moins les aspects techniques et administratifs.
Objet de l'étude
20.       L'étude vise à
(a) répertorier les taches de gestion actuellement exécutées par les
services du District, qui est une administration territoriale de
l'Etat, dans ses act4vités de gestion de l'agglomération de
Djibouti, dans les domaines des services techniques et de
l'administration;
(b) évaluer les évolutions prévisibles ou souhaitables de ces taches,
indépendamment de leur dévolution à une structure ou une autre,
puis en fonction d'hypothèses de dévolution des taches à diverses
structures, en intégrant si nécessaire des tâches exécutées
aujourd'hui par d'autres structures que le District;
(c)  élaborer  deux  ou  trois  types  d'organisation  des  services
nécessaires pour la bonne exécution des taches répertoriées, dans
une perspective de décentralisation très progressive et de façon à
faciliter la mise en oeuvre de cette décentralisation par étapes;
(d) établir les coQts actuels et les coùts d'objectif du fonctionnement
des services considérés, dans les différentes hypothèses de
répartition de compétences;
(e) examiner l'origine et les modalités de couverture actuelle des
coùts de fonctionnement des services existants puis fournir des
recommandations sur les voies et moyens de recouvrer ces coûts aux
différentes étapes d'organisation reconnues précédemment et selon
les répartitions de compétences retenues.

21.       A CET EFFET, le consultant, dans un premier temps s
-    procédera à une analyse des activités du District, séparant ce
qui relève normalement des attributions de l'administration
territoriale dans le cadre du Ministère de l'Intérieur de ce qui
relève normalement de la gestion urbaine de Djibouti et de ce qui
relève de la gestion des autres centres urbains du District (Arta,
Wea, Damerjog ...) et analysera les conditions, moyens et coûts
d'exécution de ces taches;
-    procédera de même pour les taches exécutées par divers autres
organibmes et services de l'Etat pour les besoins de la gestion de
la capitale;
-    procédera de même pour les tâches exécutées par les arrondissements
actuels de Djibouti (qui sont en pratique des délégations du
District), y compris, le cas échéant, pour les services rendus à
travers la participation en nature ou en travail de la population
locale;
-    dressera un tableau général des activités ainsi analysées et en
fournira une présentation comptable, sous la forme d'un "budget
municipal'.
22.       Dans un deuxième temps, le consultant fera des projections à 5 et
10 ans des activités et des ressources et emplois, en personnel et en moyens
financiers. Il développera des perspectives et recettes et d'origine de ces
recettes de façon à équilibrer les dépenses et dégager, dans la mesure du
possible, une capacité d'investissement au moins égale à 1OZ du budget.
23.       Dans un troisième temps, le consultant élaborera, en liaison avec
l'administration du Ministère de l'Intérieur, plusieurs scénarios de la
répartition, évolutive dans le temps, des tâches et compétences, y compris en
matière de collecte de ressources (impôts, taxes, redevances, produits du
domaine ...) et leur associera des Budgets équilibrés.
24.       S'agissant en particulier des actuels 'Services Techniques", qui
regroupent leu onctions de collecte et traitement des ordures ménagères et
des actirités diverses (garage administratif, études et entretien de
bitiments ...) le consultant isolera les fonctions, dans une perspective de
gestion par objectif (produit) et d'une éventuelle sous-traitance de
certaines fonctions à des concessionnaires ou exploitants privés.
2S.       Le rapport final rassemblera les infrrmations recueillies,  les
études faites et fournira des recommandations quant à l'évolution de
l'organisation des services et du recouvrement de leur coût dans le cadre de
budgets ou de comptes d'exploitation prévisionnels.
26.       Le consultant élaborera les organigrammes correspondants, décrira
les profils des principaux postes requis et dressera un plan de formation
permanente du personnel en place ainsi qu'un plan de recrutement de cadres
techniques ou de gestion, cohérent avec l'évolution des tâches et
compétences.

C. Terme of Reference for the Study on Household Budgets,
Savings, and Behavior in Regard to Houcing
27.       Recause there are no reliable recent data on the population of
the Djibouti metropolitan ares, the study had to make do with updating the
results of old censuses and surveys to quantify the components of the second
DUDP and provide economic justification for the proposed investments.
Because of the size of the demand, the disparities between estimates and
actual figures are of limited consequence.  But it vill be impossible to
adjust the urban policy set in motion by the projects unless better demand
statistics can be made available, vithout having to vait for a third DUDP.
Those statistics muet characterize demand in quantitative terme (number of
households, size of households,  income level).  They must aima show the
savings capacities of the households and their behavior in regard to housing,
because these are recently urbanized people in a country where nomadism still
existe and part of the population is recent or temporary immigrants. If it
is not possible to carry out an exhaustive census, it vill be necessary to
take samplings to establish average values and breakdowns.
28.       The best kind of sampling base would be a recent photo or one taken
for this purpose. The consultant vill need to provide rational justification
for the counting unit used (plot, compound, building), nd its relation to
the population unit (household, cohabitants). The information sheet filled
out by the enumerators must be carefully prepared to facilitate collection of
the reasonable maximum of pertinent data and should be tested before the
survey is launched.   Without aiming for the reliability of a budget-
consumption survey, vith repeated visits to the householdt, the information
on  income  will need  to be  thoroughly  cross-checked  against  data  on
consumption expenditure and capital expenditure, if appropriate. Care must
be taken to ensure that numerous sources of infoLuMal or nondeclared income
have been at least plausibly estimated, through cross-checking against
various interhousehold transfers.
29.       Because data on savinge capacities represent an important part of
the knowledge required, they should receive particular attention and be
obtained through the use of appropriate methodology. Housing expenditures,
rents and capital expenditure, and the behavior of urban householde should
al80 be cross-checked againot an appraisal of housing activities, comparing
supply and demand on that market (rents and other tenant incomes, investment
in housing nd ovnership of the housing stock, housing production and
activities of the construction industry, and so on) so as to provide a global
and intelligible picture of the housing sector.
30.       To take advantage of the dynamic of a survey conducted in the
capital city, it vill be expanded to cover several secondary centers (Ali
Sabbieh, Obock, Tadjoura, Dikhil, Atar).

D.  Terme of Reference for the Pro1ct Identification in
S-condary Cities and Updating of Dlibouti Master Plan
31.       Almoat all the country's urban population is concentrated in the
Djibouti urban areas   250,000 inhabitants out of a maximum of 290,000.
Of the secondary urban centers, two are amall towns--the old ports of Obock
and Tadjourah--and the others are administrative centers in the interior
(Ali Sabbieh and Dikhil, the former also baing on the Djibouti-Addis-Ababa
rail line).  The largest of these centers, Ali Sabbieh, has some 20,000
inhabitants. It cannot therefore be expected that development of these amall
urban centers will relieve the growth of the capital. But it is important
to be concerned with them, both to settle the populations and to provide
supervision and direction for the national territory--perhap3 even to create
some poles of activity for the coastal contera.  The Government therefore
wanted the second Urban Project to apply some of its resources to identifying
actions to be taken in those centers, if only to demonstrate the Government's
interest in them and not to aggravate their sense of lagging behind the
capital.
Secondarv Centers
32.       Some secondary centers have already been the subject of urban
planning studies, and in any case the preparation or updating of such
documents should not entail a great deal of work.  The main focus of the
study should therefore be to seek out projects or actions that could improve
the living conditions of their present inhabitants, to make room for an
additional population identified on the basis of the role of the center in
the country's population settlement process, and to facilitate trade and
urbanization.
33.       T;e study will comprise:
-    an analysis of the present situation, supported by the household
income and behavior survey already referred to (see page 90),
geared toward determining the living conditions of the majority of
households, availability of basic services (access to water,
electricity, education, health, and so on);
-    a diagnostic study of community facilities of an economie nature
(markets,   slaughterhouses,   cold-storage  facilities,   fishery
facilities, and s- on); and
-    a diagnostic study of the operation of urban services  (infra-
structure maintenance, garbage collection and treatment, and so on)
and the funding mobilized for those purposes, together with the
material and human resources involved.

34.       Proposals vill talce account of the experience of the first DUDP and
preparation of the second in Djibouti in connection vith cost recovery and
regularization of land-tenure, vith a view to promoting implementation of a
national pclicy and accelerating the process of transferring innovations in
urban management. To this end, arrangements vill be made to keep the local
authorities informed of the progress of the projects in Djibouti.
Djibouti Master Plan
35.       In parallel, the Djibouti Master Plan, established in 1981-83. wili
be updated. The area's population following the second DUDP should be close
to 350.000 inhabitants, compared with 150.000 when the plan was originally
prepared.  Thanks in part to decongestion of the Old Wards, the deseloped
area will probably occupy almost the entire area of the Plan. But vith the
growth of Balbala, areas that formerly were considerably farther avay than
the unoccupied land in Balbala, to the south of the airport, for example,
will become competitive in terms of distance, while they are more favorable
because of their topography and soils. The need to protect the water tables
from which the city's drinking water is pumped vill not be a major
constraint, because the wells are located quite far out to avoid
contamination with salt from the sea. In any case, the future of the land
lying beyond the limits of the 1983 Plan should be reexamined and determined
by the year 2000.
36.       Moreover, attention needs to be paid to the impact on the progress
of urban development of the Urban and Housing Development policy deriving
from the Urban Projects.   It will certainly be necessary to update the
regional economic context vithin which the city and its major infra-
structures--the port, railroad and airport--should be defined. Lastly. for
an urban area of 700,000 inhabitants--expected by 2020, or earlier if the
growth rate continues to exceed 32 per annum -- water supply will pose a
severe problem.
37.       Using the results of the household income and behavior study, the
updating work vill thus involve:
-    a land occupancy map as of the starting date of the study (1996);
-    an analysis of the urban economy and the regional economic context;
-    an estimate of the impacts of the Urban Projects and of the Urban
Development and Housing Policy currently in effect;
-    a graph  representing  the main  thrusts  of  the  proposed urban
development and the major constraints, natural or man-made,
affecting urban development, on the same scale as the 1983 graph;
and
-    a report justifying the approaches adopted and the recommendations
made .o the authorities and the departments concerned.

DJIBOUTI
Second Urban Development Project
Note on Cost Recovery
1.       The first DUDP instituted a cost recovery system based on several
methods:
- direct sale of new developed plots (SID Salines Ouest);
- amicable transfer, for cash, of plots in the vards rehabilitated by
the Project, at a price based on the value of the land and of the
works executed, but not explicitly taking account of past
investments;
- an annual fee for plots whose holders do not apply for a transfer,
set at 10 times the transfer price per m2, representing recovery of
the transfer price in 10 years (average 100-m2 provisional occupancy
plot), which has also been budgeted for and not paid over to the
UDF;
-  proceeds of the land tas (built-on and non built-on land). improved
as a result of strengthening of the Project; and
- repayment of housing loans to CDD and SID.
2.       The last of the above-mentioned methods is not applicable under the
second DUDP.
3.       The start-up of the first DUDP vas somewhat delayed, and it cannot
be said that the system set up has become fully operational. Subject to this
reservation, it seeme that transfers vill take place more slowly, and perhaps
in smaller numbers, than expected. Measures need to be introduced to give
potential candidates greater motivation for requesting transfer: payment in
two or three installments and confirmation that the transferee will not have
to commit hiaself to any development, even less any development in
"permanent materials, which could certainly give rise to hesitation.
4.       But transfer prices need to be updated.  And, for Wards 1 and 2.
account muet be taken of the additional cost of construction of the vaste-
vater disposal network (DF 2,000/m2 over 7,000) apart from the higher cost of
the other services (DF 5,0001m2 against DP 3,400 in Balbala), comparable to
DF 9,000 in Salines Ouest.   Services are better in Salines Ouest but
everything needs to be done, including the infill works.  If the transfer
price is raised, will the fee also rise? One might say that it is already
too high in relation to the transfer price, but this does not encourage
people to apply for transfer.

5.       Ronce the Consultant's proposal to define a "commercial' price as one
that vill bring in the maximum revenue and can be lover than the cost price,
taking into account a price that vill be affordable for 50Z of the households
installed, and finally arriving at a compromise. It is difficult to opt for
an artificial price that vill be hard to justify and which vill constitute an
unfortunate precedent for a cost pricing policy.  Applicants for amicable
transfers are not occupants of the yard, however, but holders of the earlier
provisional occupancy permits, whose incomes are not really knovn, and for
whom it is Impossible to calculate an affordable price.
6.       Lastly, the amicable transfer system is applied to all the wards,
rehabilitated or not, as is the fee, so that the revenue obtained bears only
a vague relationship to the operations being carried out.  Will those who
have already obtained an amicable transfer be asked to pay it back, in Ward
7, for example?  Or else, vill action be taken in that ward to raise the
transfer price and the fee at the time of constru^tion? Is this being used
as a means of encouraging transfers? Is it possible that all transferable
plots vere transferred before the start of the vorks in Wards 7tis, Ambouli,
and Djebel?
7.       Steps are being taken to reabsorb the provisional occupancy permits,
vhich at firet involved some 100,000 inhabitants--nov l20,000-130,000--but
the same number of plots (densified between 1982 and 19891), vhich should not
increase much.  Therefore, is it not a good idea to evaluate the general
recovery level or the balance betveen expenses to be involved in Icompleting
the rehabilitation* <already quite vell known) and the receipts over 10, 15,
or 20 years from the time the system is set up?
8.       One could then estimate that 50 percent of the plots vill have beer.
transferred over the 10-year period, apart from the vorks, and that the
others vill be subject to the fee, so that the annual revenue vill be:
-  1i10 of the transfer price for 50Z of the surface area + a share of
the fee, starting at 90Z, then reaching 50Z of the area at the end
of the 10 years. It vill be noted that the proceeds of the fee are
higher than those of the transfers.
9.       Thus, if the foe romains 10 times the transfer price for an average
plot of 100 m2, or 0.1 times the transfer, the revenue vill go from 0.05 +
0.09 - 0.14 times the transfer price to 0.10 times this price, and the 10-
year total vill be abeat 0.12 times the transfer price x 10 years - 1.2 times
the transfer. If the fee is reduced proporttonally to 5 times the transfer
per m2, the resault vill be between 0.095 and 0.075, and overall 0.085 times
the transfer price.
10.      Applied to Varda 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, vhere the cadastral survey
has been done and which together cover 650,000 m2 (65 ha), of which the
transferable half measures 325,000 m2, vith a transfer price of DF 1,700 per
m2, the potential annual revenue vould be DP 77.4 million. It vas 27 + 33 -
DP 60 million in 1988, the fee recovery rate, for the first year, having been
only SO, which viil be corrected and vould produce a total of DF 77 million.



- 9S3-                         Anne% 15
Page 3 of 3
11.      Applied then to all of the vards (177 ha), including 88 (880,000 m2)
traisferable hectares, the average annual revenue is calculated at DF 209.4
million, vith a price of DF 1,700, and at DF 369.6 million, with a price of
DF 3,000 per m2, giving a cumulative 10-year total of DF 2.09 or 3.69
billion. If the fee is kept at its present level and drops to five times the
transfer price per m2, the cumulative income for a price of DF 3,000 per m2
remains DF 2.61 billion.
12.      However, account must still be taken of the time needed to set up the
system throughout the entire city, perhaps four or five years.

DJIBOUTI
Second Urban Development Proiect
Trainins Program
1.          Djibouti's civil service and parastatal sector severely need
qualified staff, despite efforts since independence to increase the number
of university graduates and develop vocational training. both locally and
abroad.   The second DUDP is thus obliged to install large numbers of
technical assistants to strengthen the institutions involved in project
execution and must rapidly introduce new and efficient practices in urban
administration. The Project's technical assistance component provides for 12
technical assistants to be assigned to the seven institutions or departments
concerned,  as vell as an adviser to assist  the chief of the Project
Management Unit.
2.          To rapidly reduce the need for foreign professionals, one of the
Project's goals is to ensure that replacements for the technical assistants
are available at the end of Project implementation.   It vill develop a
training program targeting the posts and qualifications required--largely
based on the French bilateral assistance program forming part of the Project
--either directly or through the Djiboutian vocational training agencies that
are themselves receiving technical assistance.
3.          Each assistant position comes with a long-term study fellovship
to enable a high school graduate (bachelier) to go abroad during the Project
for a cycle of study long enough to bring him to a level comparable to that
of the technical assistant he is to replace.   Thirteen fellowships vill
thus be financed, for the account of the Djiboutian Government, and the
replacement plan, the hiring of candidates, and the choice of subjects of
study will  be a component of the technical  training  agreement.   One
requirement vill be that recipients of such training work for the Government
for five years after completing the training.
4.          à substantial package of internships abroad, equivalent to 24
three-month intermships and five 10-month courses, will enable the Djiboutian
civil se-vants mnd officials working for the government departments or
institutions involved in the Project to compare experiences.  They will be
able to acquire better professional reflexes by working in similar services
abroad and possibly to obtain supplementary specialized training.   The
internships vill thus be reserved for employees with suitable basic training
who are expected to be long-time occupants if the posts for which they are
qualified.

5           Simple one-on-one replacement of Project technical assistants
vill not suffice, because they muet devote a large part of their time to
vorking on tasks for which they have no aidas. The Project thus includes .a
component for the training of mid-level professionals.  The corresponding
training courses vill be held in Djibouti, at the Centre de Formation
Administrative (CFA) for administrative staff, and at the Centre de Formation
Professionnelle du Bitiment et des Travaux Publics (CFPBTP) for technicians.
6.          Because there is a particularly heavy demand for mid-level
professionals in the housing and public works sectors, the French technical
a3sistance service and MPWUH set up the CFPBTP to offer in-service training
to vorks supervisors and draftsmen (Construction and Civil Engineering). The
Center gets it8 teachers from the French Eccle Nationale des Techniciens de
I'Zquipement (ENTE-France), and its operating expenses are covered by the
n .'onal budget.   Internships are organized in the country's public and
p&rastatal sectors and in the enterprises. Candidates are recruited during
the last three years of secondary school.  The first class of 12 foremeI and
12 topographers graduated in 1989.  A second class of 13 foremen ana 10
topographers is being trained.
