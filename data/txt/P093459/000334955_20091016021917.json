          Armenia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            amount of a development project objective (DPO) need not be\n            large relative to the fiscal program of the government in\n            order for it to provide a useful vehicle for the dialogue\n            between the Bank and the government and for facilitating\n            implementation of the government's program. In the case\n            of the Armenian PRSCs, they were very useful for these\n            purposes even though the credit amounts were only about 2\n            percent of overall government expenditures. Indeed, some\n            Armenian observers of the PRSC process commented that the\n            dialogue related to the PRSC was more 'honest and\n            productive' than the previous Structural Adjustment\n            Credit (SAC) dialogue simply because the government had much\n            less need for the money. Hence, the amounts of DPOs should\n            be based on judgments about the relative efficacy of this\n            form of budget support versus investment lending by the\n            Bank. The Bank should encourage governments to assume full\n            responsibility for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for\n            DPO outcomes as an integrated part of its overall M&E\n            system. This would enhance the understanding that the DPOs\n            are the government's program, not the Bank's. In\n            the case of the Armenia PRSCs, the Bank did this to some\n            extent but perhaps could have done so more effectively. The\n            timing of DPO appraisals and approvals need to be usefully\n            synchronized with the government's budget cycle. In the\n            case of Armenia, this means appraisal before September, when\n            the government needs to know its likely revenues."}, "docdt": "2009-09-21T00:00:00Z"}
