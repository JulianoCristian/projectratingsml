                                       I. INTRODUCTION


1.       The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit-I1 for Armenia i s designed to
build on the progress achieved under PRSC-I that was extended inNovember 2004. The
program o f poverty reduction support credits i s anchored on an ambitious Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), publishedby the Armenian authorities in late 2003,
laying out a comprehensive program stretched over a decade for sustaining high rates o f
growth and directing public resources sharply towards fighting poverty. Central to this
strategy are improvements in core public sector functions and higher investments in
human capital and in infrastructure, whilst macroeconomic stability is to be maintained.'
From the range o f interventions proposed in the PRSP, the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), endorsed by the Bank's Board o f Executive Directors in June 2004,
focused on three areas that best fit the Group's comparative advantage and complement
the activities o f other donors: (i)       promotion o f private sector led growth, through raised
efficiency inpublic services and strengthenedcompetition; (ii)                re-orientation o f growth to
fighting poverty, through accelerated job creation inthe private economy, modernization
o f the rural economy, and effective social protection systems; and (iii)              reduction o f non-
income poverty, through education, health and infrastructurereforms.

2.       The CAS identified a program o f PRSCs as the central instrument for supporting
policy and institutional reforms in these key areas. The proposed three year program o f
PRSCs, totaling US$60 million equivalent, i s rooted in the three objectives described in
the CAS, and i s designed around four themes that each encompass several sectors:*

              consolidatingmacroeconomic discipline and strengthening governance

             sharpening competition and entrenchingproperty rights

             mitigating social and environmental risks

             modernizing the rural economy

4.      The first theme o f consolidating macroeconomic discipline and strengthening
governance recognizes that a continuation o f Armenia's exemplary macroeconomic
performance over the past seven years i s necessary to underpin high rates o f growth.
Moreover, governance reforms that cut across budget, fiduciary, revenue raising, and
public administration institutions and sectors will improve the climate for private sector
investment, remove important opportunities for corruption, and enhance revenue
mobilization.

5.      The second theme o f sharpening competition and entrenching property rights -
cutting across trade, utilities regulation, property and contract law, banking and capital
markets, and rural sectors -- addresses the key weaknesses in the competition
environment.     Armenia needs to reduce costs and sharpen its competitive edge by
complementing its highly liberal regime in trade in goods with liberalization in key
services and by consolidating its impressive reforms in state owned utilities. Inaddition,
entrenching property rights through provision o f a legal framework for secured
transactions, by instilling confidence in the banking sector, and by developing insurance
markets is essential to secure growing rates o fprivate investment.

6.      Social and environmental risks - the third theme - that cuts across education,
health, social risk management and environmental protection sectors - are designed to be
mitigated by a program o f reforms directed at raising both the share o f public spending
devoted to these sectors and the quality o f spendingthrough changes intheir composition
and institutional reforms, notably inthe private provision o f health and pension services.
The resulting strengthening o f human capital and reduced risks for sustainable
livelihoods innatural resource use will greatly assist inthe reductiono fpoverty.

7.      Interventions in the rural economy -- the final theme - that cut across the
agriculture, non-farm incomes, and infrastructure sectors - are intended to modernize a
lagging sector o fthe economy and one inwhich the impact o f growth on poverty needsto
be further strengthened. Greater predictability and sustainability in public services in
rural Armenia i s expected to strongly benefit the fight against poverty.

8.      The expected development outcomes and the monitoring indicators for assessing
performance under these themes are contained inAnnex 111.

                  11.     POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT

PoliticalBackground

9.      Armenia's birth from the fragmentation o f the Soviet Union took place at a time
o f severe economic difficulty exacerbated by natural disasters and energy shortages as
well as by an armed conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the territory o f Nagorno-
Karabakh. In recent years, it has attained political stability - a key factor behind the
impressive growth and reform achievements (see below).            Presidential and national
assembly elections took place in early 2003 with the emergence o f a stable coalition
government, though not one without the usual stresses associated with a multi-party
coalition. The government i s firmly committed to the reform program underlying its

                                             5


PRSP, has a sound record o f performance, and parliament still has a life o f nearly two
years to implement the measures agreed to under the remainder o f the PRSC program.
The government has sought to engage the population actively in the design and
implementationo fthe PRSP, and, more recently, of its anti-corruption program as well as
o f the design o f public investments to be financed by a large donor assisted program, the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), which i s expected to start disbursements in
2006.

10.     Armenia enjoys political stability in a volatile region, but the political climate is
not free o f tension, with opposition parties boycotting parliament since the 2003 elections
on grounds o f alleged electoral fraud. Current social tension may be fed by continuing
high rates o f unemployment (survey data suggest unemployment ranges at around 20
percent o f the labor force, whereas registered unemployment i s closer to 8 per cent) and
by poverty, especially inprovincial cities. A package o f constitutional reforms intended
to broaden democratic practices by increasing the role of the national assembly, to
strengthen the judiciary, and to lead to an election (as opposed to the current nomination
by the President) for the mayor o f Yerevan (the capital contains about one-third o f the
nation's population) was put to a referendumat end-November 2005 and approved by an
overwhelming margin. However, international observes reported irregularities in the
voting process.     Rule o f law, civic participation, and electoral fairness will remain
important indicators indonor support decisions.

11.     Armenia's borders with two o f its neighbors with which it shares the
overwhelming portion o f its frontier, Azerbaijan and Turkey, are closed. The unresolved
Nagarno-Karabakh conflict also acts to keep tensions high and restrict regional
cooperation. This imposes costs on the economy, with the main surface trade link being
rail and road connections with Georgia and its Black Sea ports. The closed borders also
increase the importance o f aviation services in the economy.           The re-opening of
communications and trade links with Azerbaijan and Turkey, if and when it occurs, will
raise the potential rate o f growth significantly, particularly as Armenia lies at a hub o f
linkages between the Middle East and the Caspian Sea states, on the one hand, and
Turkey and Europe, on the other.

Economic Background

12.     The Armenian authorities carried out a successful stabilization and structural
reform program following the hyperinflation, fiscal crisis and severe economic
contraction immediately after independence in 1991-93.             Trade and prices were
liberalized, the legal framework for a market economy was established, most small and
medium-sized enterprises were privatized, and the government intervention in the
economy was considerably reduced. Macroeconomic stability was maintained, inflation
kept low, structural reforms were carried out successfully, and economic recovery began.
Despite being a landlocked country with few natural resources, implementation of
economic reforms contributed to an average growth o f 5.5 percent per year during 1994-
2000. Nevertheless, rapid growth had a small impact on overall poverty (though a
significant one on extreme poverty) in the period till the opening o f the new century,

                                            6


largely because insufficient progress in improving the business environment and
weaknesses in the rule o f law, fair competition and rampant corruption blunted the
incentives for investment and formation o f private companies. From early 2001, the
government shifted emphasis to improving business environment and promoting exports,
thereby creating the conditions for an acceleration o f growth inrecent years (Table 1).

Recent Economic Developments

13.     Economic growth accelerated during 2001-2003 rising from 6 percent in 2000 to
an annual average o f 12 percent inthe 2001-03 period. Growth continued at 10.1 percent
during 2004 driven by significant contribution from construction, agriculture and service
sectors.   While the diaspora and other donors continued to finance much o f the
construction through grants, investment in tradable goods and exports has contributed
increasingly to growth in recent years. Following eleven years o f continued growth, at
the end o f 2004, Armenia had recovered its pre-transition GDP level. Inflation fell from
8.6 percent at the end o f 2003 to 2 percent inDecember 2004 as a result o f tight monetary
policy and nominal appreciation o f the national currency despite a relatively higher pace
inthe first halfofthe year drivenby higher food prices.

14.     Fiscal consolidation continued in2004. While taxes remained at the 2003 rate o f
14 percent o f GDP, social expenditure targets in 2004 were attained due to higher direct
tax collection from profit tax, simplified and presumptive taxes, and personal income tax.
Tax collection innominal terms increased by 17.4 percent in 2004 as compared to 2003.
Fiscal deficit excluding grants improved by 2 percent o f GDP between 2003 and 2004.
The deferral o f an expected grant in the 2004 budget, however, resulted in a somewhat
higher deficit including grant of 1.7 percent o f GDP compared with 1.5 percent in 2003.
The deficit was fully financed through external financing.

15.     External sector has registered an encouraging performance with exports
diversifying, and export markets shifting from the CIS to EU countries over the last
several years. Exports o f precious stones and metals have accounted for more than half
of total exports. There was however a slowdown in diamond processing activities in
2004 which, given its significant share in merchandise exports, resulted in total exports
declining by 4.7 percent despite the rapid growth o f 13 percent innon-diamond exports.

16.     This also resulted in some changes inthe direction of trade away from diamond-
trading partners. The current account deficit improved from 6.8 percent in2003 to about
4.7 percent o f GDP in 2004. Gross international reserves remained at the equivalent o f
four months o f imports and the nominal exchange rate appreciated sharply in U S dollar
terms reaching an average rate o f about 530 drams to the dollar. The country's external
debt indicators improved in2004, with debt/GDPratio declining from 39 percent in2003

to about 33 percent in 2004. External debt service as a percentage o f exports declined
from 12.5 percent in2003 to under 10percent in2004.

17.     The economy continued its strong performance during the first ten months o f
2005 with GDP growing at 12.2 percent, driven mainly by private sector construction
activity, agriculture, and transport and communication sectors. A good harvest and
continued appreciation o f the dram has lowered the inflation to a period average o f 0.8
percent in the first ten months o f 2005. Fiscal performance remained strong during the
first ten months o f 2005 with tax revenues increasing by 22 percent to 14.6 percent o f
GDP. With under-execution o f expenditures, the fiscal deficit remained at 1.5 percent o f
GDP in this period. On the external sector, exports and imports showed high growth
rates o f 33 percent and 29 percent respectively, and the external current account balance
and debt management strategy have remained sound.

Medium-Term Economic Outlook

18.     Economic performance i s expected to remain strong in the medium term with
annual GDP growing by 11percent in2005 and about 6 percent during2006-2009 (Table
1). Real GDPgrowth i s projected at 7.5 percent in 2006 and a gradual slow down over
the medium term from the very highrates o f the recent past as "catching up" effects are
assumed to wear off.       The growth outlook i s based on the assumption that the
Government will be able to maintain its strong track record on reforms and economic
management, and that Armenia will continue to attract large volumes o f capital transfers
through the MillenniumChallenge Corporation (MCC) and private foundations, and will
maintain foreign direct investment at current levels in relation to GDP. As a robust
private sector is expected to lead much o f the medium-term economic expansion, the
Government reform program as reflected in the PRSP will continue with measures to
further improve the business climate and enhance investor confidence, promote exports,
and advance financial sector reforms. On the basis o f continued structural reforms and
external funding, the investment to GDP ratio is expected to increase from 25.5 percent
in2005 to 28.5 percent of GDP by 2010, with the private sector accounting for most o f
the increase.

19.     A continued appropriate monetary and fiscal policy is expected to contain annual
inflation at below 3 percent andfiscal deficit within 2-3 percent o f GDP in the medium
term.     Improving revenue mobilization will remain a major task confronting the
Government to attain the PRSP revenue targets and to finance priority social and
infrastructure expenditures. In this respect, the Government will continue to address
deficiencies in the tax and customs administrations, especially in the areas o f excisable
goods, VAT, personal income, profit and property taxes.

20.      Trade flows are expected to increase rapidly at rates higher than GDP with
average exports and imports growth o f 12 and 11 percent respectively during 2006-2010.
As a result, the current account deficit is projected to remain above 4 percent of GDP
over the mediumterm. Official and private capital inflows will remain a major source o f
financing. The Government has submitted a request inthe amount o f 175million dollars

                                                   9


to the MCC and its recent membershipto the Asian Development Bank has increased its
access to concessional borrowing. The medium-termeconomic outlook is likely to be
affected by global and regional economic trends. Armenia has so far been relatively less
affected by the recent high energy prices due to its appreciated currency, as well as its
relatively diversified sources o f electricity supplies. Nonetheless, there would be spill
over effects o f the high price o f oil and likely higher price o f gas and their impact not
only on the Armenian economy but also on Russia which i s expected to remain both a
major investor and export market.

21.     Armenia's external debt profile has improved considerably in the last few years
due to successful restructuring arrangements and strong export growth. The net present
value (NPV) o f external debt to exports is estimated to fall from 60 percent in 2005 to 52
percent in 2010, while its corresponding debt service as percent o f exports o f goods and
services i s estimated to halve from 6 percent in2005 to 3 percent in2010.

Debt Sustainability Analysis

22.     An updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)' considers Armenia to be at low
risk o f debt distress with all debt indicators well below the relevant country-specific
thresholds. Stress tests suggest that although debt indicators are sensitive to changes in
macroeconomic assumptions underlying the DSA, Armenia will remain at low risk even
underless favorable conditions. (see Annex IV).

23.     Notwithstanding the continued robust growth and fiscal position o f the economy
inthe last four years, the DSA's baseline scenario is built on a relatively conservative set
o f assumptions including (i)    real GDP growth o f 5 percent per year over the period 2008-
12, and 4 percent thereafter; (ii)      average inflation o f 3 percent, (iii) deficit o f 2.9
                                                                                fiscal
percent o f GDP through the PRSP horizon o f 2015, and 2.3 percent o f GDP thereafter;
(iv) steady increase inthe openness o f economy leading to a gradual improvement inthe
current account balance over the projection period; and (v) a shift away from highly
concessional forms o f external financing towards increasingly more expensive domestic
borrowing.

24.     Under the baseline scenario, Armenia's debt outlook remains manageable. The
net present value (NPV) o f total public debt to GDP i s estimated to increase from 23
percent in 2005 to 31 percent by 2025 while the NPV o f external public debt would fall
steadily from 15 percent o f GDP in 2005 to about 8 percent by 2025. The net present
value o f debt to revenue, and the debt service to revenue ratio remain relatively stable
throughout the projection period. Inrelation to exports, the NPV o f debt i s projected to
decline fiom 60 percent to 25 percent, and the debt service to exports ratio to fall from
around 6 percent in2005 to 2 percent by 2025.

25.     Alternative scenarios have been developed to assess the sustainability o f
Armenia's debt under varying levels o f success with domestic policy efforts and external

  The DSA which covers total public sector debt was undertaken jointly by Fund and Bank staff, in
consultation with the Armenian authorities, inSeptember 2005. See Annex IV for details.

assistanceresulting in less favorable macroeconomic circumstances. Stress tests indicate
that Armenia's debt outlook i s particularly sensitive to adverse external or domestic
developments which underscore the growth outlook and/or export performance.
However, even in these scenarios, Armenia's debt outlook remains manageable through
out the period with all indicators below thresholds.            The NPV o f debt even under a
combined scenario o f lower GDP growth and higher primarybalance as compared to the
baseline i s estimated to remain within 40-45 percent o f GDP by 2025. While these debt
indicators remain below the risk thresholds, they show a gradual increasing trend which
requires attention and underscores the importance o f sound macroeconomic policies and
continuedimplementationo fthe reformprogram to prevent the risk o f debt distress.

                              111.      POVERTYINARMENIA

Trends in Poverty

26.     Inthe 1980s, poverty in Soviet Armenia is reported to have been virtually non-
existent. The end o f the decade, however, saw poverty increase sharply as the 1988
earthquake, the break-up o f the Soviet Union, and the Nagorno-Karabakh war cost many
people their livelihoods. The war also brought an influx o f refugees, adding to the ranks
of the poor.

27.     Although economic growth resumed in the mid-1990s' poverty did not begin to
fall until the end o f that decade. By 2004, all measures o f poverty and extreme poverty

                                                     11


had declined significantly compared to their levels in 1998/99 (Table 2).6 Extreme
poverty fell considerably faster than did overall poverty.

28.     The causes o f the sharp fall inpoverty over this five-year period can be found in
sustained growth at rates indouble digits percent per head over this period, an increase in
employment; a growth inreal wages, including wages inthe public sector; a real growth
in social transfers, particularly pensions and social assistance; a steady growth in
remittances from Armenians leaving and working abroad, especially in Russia; and a
decrease ininequality. Yet, despite these remarkable results, poverty inArmenia remains
highandit shouldcontinue to top the Government's policy agenda.

29.     Poverty profile estimates for 2004 indicate that the profile o f the poor has
stabilized over time. There are no gender differences in poverty risk. Children under
five years old, followed by children 6-14 years old face higher than average risk o f being
poor and very poor. In contrast, adults 46-60 and elderly over 61 years o f age, faced
lower than average poverty risk. Less educated were more likely to be poor. Landless
and those with small land holdings face higher than average poverty risk. The
unemployed face a very highrisk o fpoverty.

30.     Factors identified as being closely related to poverty were as follows: (a)
household demographics: the larger the share o f children under five years old and elderly
inthe household, the lower the consumption(per adult equivalent); the overall size ofthe
household reduces consumption as well; (b) migration: the presence o f migrantmembers
substantially increases consumption implying the importance o f remittances for
improving households' welfare; (c) education of the household head-the                         higher the
education level o f the household head, the better off the household; (d) the gender of the
household head-female          headed households faced higher poverty risk; (e) labor market
status of household members: households with higher share o f employed members had
higher consumption per adult equivalent; and (0 access to land and possession of
livestock these had a positive impact on householdconsumption.

31.     Employment i s a crucial determinant o f poverty inArmenia. The unemployment
rate remains high (though it has fallen somewhat) despite the accelerating GDP growth.
Newjob creation has yet to fully compensate for the volume o f labor shedding, which has
taken place as a result o f the transition process. Preliminaryestimates based on the labor
market modules o f the 2004 and 1998/99 rounds o f the ILCS, indicate that there was
significant increase in employment rates and decline in unemployment rates over
1998/99-2004. Employment rate increased from 42.9 percent to 50.6 percent over the
observed period, while unemployment rate dropped by 38 percent, from 26.6 percent to
19.3 percent. Across the regions, improvement o f the main labor market indicators has
been most pronounced in urban areas, particularly in the capital city o f Yerevan which
also experienced the highest reduction inpoverty incidence.




  The incidence of poverty is the share o f poor people in the population; the poverty gap indicates how far
below the poverty line poor households are; and the severity of poverty captures inequality among the poor.

                                                    12


32.     The health o f the population deteriorated after the economic collapse, but since
2000 there have been indications that conditions are beginning to improve. While data
problems make definite conclusions difficult, government figures indicate that under-five
mortality fell from 25 per 1,000 live births to 19 per 1,000 live births between 2001 and
2003.7 Access to basic education i s good, with a net enrollment rate o f 92 percent in
2001. In contrast, the net enrollment rate in secondary schools is only 61 percent, and
even lower for the poorest quintile (52 percent). Boys are particularly likely to drop out
because o f problems both o f supply (poor quality o f teaching), and demand (low
expectations o fjobs after completing education).

              IV.       POVERTY REDUCTION-OFFICIAL STRATEGY
                                    AND IMPLEMENTATION

TheStrategy

33.     InNovember 2003, the Armenia PRSPwas presentedto the Executive Boards o f
the Bank and Fund. The Boards and the staffs of the Bank and the Fundfound the PRSP
to be a comprehensive poverty reduction program that had beenprepared through broad
participatory processes within the government (at both national and regional levels) as
well as with civil society and the donor community.* It contained an extensive analysis
o f the causes of poverty and the challenges faced; a comprehensive strategy with short
and long-term perspectives; and a set o f priority public actions, evaluation plans, costing
o f programs, and a financing scenario. In January 2004, the government approved a
PRSP Implementation Action Plan, in close consultation with various stakeholders.
Armenia's PRSP was also well-aligned with the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). The government has begun preparation of a second progress report and is
periodically reporting to the Bank on progress. Armenia i s also beginning to prepare a
new PRSP, which is expected to be completedin2006.

34.     Thepoverty diagnosis in the PRSP candidly discussed the factors that contribute
to highlevels o f poverty inArmenia, analyzing the role o f recent economic and structural
policies inreducing poverty. Key poverty determinants were found to include territorial,
seasonal, age differences as well as the size o f families, their education level and
vulnerability. Children, women, and rural populations with limited access to education
and health services are the most deprived.

35.     Aspolicypriorities, the PRSP identifies five themes for action:

        0   Promoting sustainable economic growth through macroeconomic stability and
            private sector development;
        0   Enhancing human development and improving social safety nets;




7Other sources indicate higher figures, but also show positive trends.
 See Armenia - Joint Staff Assessment o f the PRSP (October 20, 2003).

                                              13


        0   Implementing prudent fiscal policies and reforming the tax system;

        0   Improving public infrastructure; and

        0   Improving core public sector functions.


36.     Armenia's PRSP recognizes that macroeconomic stability and continued
improvements in the business environment are essential to sustaining growth, job
creation, and poverty reduction. Output growth in the past was found to have not been
accompanied by sufficient employment generation because the business environment had
not been supportive enough for new entrants.         In this regard, the PRSP places an
appropriate emphasis on supporting the development o f small and medium-size
enterprises. Further improvements inthe business environment also hinge on progress in
the governance and public resource management reforms and on strengthening the
banking system.

37.     The switching of budgetary expenditures towards activities that have a high
impact on poverty reduction i s the key policy change proposed in the PRSP; and
expenditure adaptations are beingembodied inthe mediumterm expenditure frameworks
and in annual budgets presented to parliament for approval (for details, see below). In
addition to sectoral expenditure shifts, a sustainable reduction inpoverty can be achieved
only if the consistent improvements seen in transparency, public resource management,
prioritization and sequencing o f reforms, and capacity building are built upon. Indeed,
the PRSP recognizes the importance o f good governance for poverty reduction, which i s
a contentious area, given entrenched corruption in public services, where tenacious
reform efforts are required.

38.     In education, the PRSP establishes that ensuring quality of education and
enhancing its accessibility are essential for economic growth and poverty alleviation.
The proposed strategy to improve the conditions o f teachers and upgrade their skills and
realign the education system to the needs o f the information technology sector is
essential. Inthe health sector, the PRSP focus lies on increasing accessibility to essential
health services. The PRSP also recognizes that additional budgetresources, intra-sectoral
reallocation, and improved efficiency o f the health system will be needed to achieve this
objective.   The PRSP emphasizes the importance o f improved maternal and child
healthcare and suggests measures to achieve the Millennium Developments Goals
(MDG), which are eminentlyachievable.

39.     The PRSP pays particular attention to social risk management programs.             It
recognizes social insurance and social assistance as key elements o f the poverty reduction
framework. Targeted cash family poverty benefits-one        o f the most successful poverty
alleviation programs in the region remains a major pillar o f the safety net. The PRSP
envisages a range o f measures aimed at further improving the administration o f these
benefits, including better monitoring and evaluation, more streamlined appeal procedures,
and a more active role for territorial centers inproviding social assistance that reaches out
to the poorest. The PRSP also envisages a change in the targeting mechanism for the
family poverty benefit from proxy-means to income-based eligibility testing.

                                                   14



40.     The PRSP correctly identifies the critical role o f the energy, water, irrigation,
and transport sectors in the country's development prospects. Good progress has been
made in these areas in recent years but more remains to be done. In the energy sector,
reforms should shift to quality standards. In the irrigation sector, reforms will include
increases intariffs for bulk and end-users to attain greater cost recovery. Drinkingwater
tariffs will also need to be increased gradually to attain cost-recovery levels and
mechanisms need to be designed to mitigate the adverse impact o f such increases on the
poor. Inthe transport sector, the reorganizationand financing o f the road sector needs to
beurgently addressedand road sector financing put on a sustainable basis through greater
reliance on user charges.

41.     On environmental protection, the PRSP focuses on management o f forest
resources; prevention o f land degradation; management o f water resources; and
hazardous industrial waste. Policies on environmental assessment are being developed
and anational forestrypolicy hasbeenprepared with wide participation.

    MDG                                      Prospects of Achievement by 2015
Halving the   Likely. This target is projected to be more than achieved by 20159. The economy i s currently on
level of      track to significantly reduce poverty throughout the country. Growth over the past seven years
poverty       has averaged 6 percent per capita per annum and nearly 10 percent per annum over the past three
              years. Over the 2005-08 period, growth i s projected at 6 percent per head per year, provided
              macroeconomic stability continues and Armenia deepens its structural reforms by addressing the
              unfinished reform agenda as described inthis project document.
School        Likely. This target is likely to be achieved with ease. Net enrollment currently stands at about 95
enrollment    percent. The main challenges ineducation are to improve quality through curricular and textbook
              reforms, extend education services to encompass pre-school, enhance tertiary and vocational
              education standards, develop skills more responsive to the needs o f the market place, and reshape
               spending composition to more efficient ends.
Child         Likely. Child mortality has been falling and this target can be achieved within the MDG period.
mortality     Consistent with the PRSP, the budget provides for a doubling o f health expenditures inrelation to
              GDP within ten years and a shift in expenditures towards primary health, with an emphasis o n
              child health (0-5 years) and obstetric health care. One quarter o f the reduction i s planned for the
              2004-06 period through an emphasis on child respiratory diseases and diarrhea.
Secure        Likely. Achieving this target in both urban and rural areas will require policy reforms, charges
drinking      and meteringto cover current costs including O&M, and investments to improve access in urban
water         areas and quality in rural areas. The proportion o f the population served by the centralized water
              supply network will have to rise from 71 percent in2000 to 86 percent by 2015. The investment
              costs associated with new pipes and associated infrastructure as well as with reduction o f water
              losses will be met only in part from the budget and will require significant donor financing, only
              some o f which has been identified. Access to the Millennium Challenge Account provides an
              opportunity for completing the financing required for this purpose.




 The PRSP foresees a halving o f the year 2000 level of poverty inthe year 2011.

42.     The targets and intermediate indicators presentedinthe PRSP are selective, well
identified, and consistent with the MDG. Expected performance with respect to key
MDGtargets is giveninBox 2.

Implementation

43.     In April 2005, a PRSP Progress Report (PRSP-PR) was circulated to the
Executive Boards o f Bank and Fund that provided results o f the PRSP implementation
from August 2003 to end-2004. A Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) on the PRSP-PR
concluded that Armenia has had a successful first year o f PRSP implementation inwhich
most o f the targets were met or exceeded and which was marked by a high level of
consultation and participation.     The PRSP-PR provided evidence o f stronger than
anticipated poverty reduction and economic performance, improvement in the labor
market, and a number o f other accomplishments, particularly in fiscal policy and social
service delivery. The PRSP-PR also indicated that progress had been made on many
issues raised in the previous JSAN, including on improved monitoring and evaluation,
participation, and aligning the budget process with the PRSP. Progress toward the main
objectives o fthe PRSP i s described below:

(i)     Promotingsustainable economic growththrough macroeconomic stability
        and privatesector development

44.     Sound progress has been made toward the overall poverty reduction goal. The
PRSP-PR provides a detailed poverty update and attributes the drop inpoverty to double-
digit economic growth, the increase in labor income, and the increase in social transfers
through a well-targeted family poverty benefits program. The JSAN found the poverty
update to be o fhighquality.

45.     Macroeconomic stability has been maintained and economic growth exceeded
targets. The labor market has shown signs o f recovery, although more remains to be
done to improve the business environment. The PRSP-PR reported that labor income
rose significantly and the official unemployment rate declined marginally in2004. Good
progress was made in strengthening creditor rights, clarifying procedures for collateral
registration and foreclosure, and enforcing commercial contracts. Surveys o f business
enterprises also show a reduction in the reported time to complete the business
registration process, in the cost o f registration, and in the time required to receive a
business license. The JSAN noted, however, that ensuring fair conditions for competition
and equitable treatment from customs and tax authorities remain problems.

(ii) Implementingprudentfiscalpoliciesandreformingthetaxsystem
46.     Substantial improvements were seen infiscal policy, although much remains to be
done.   Medium-TermExpenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) were introduced for 2004-06
and 2005-07, with active participation by the line ministries and the MTEFs were
integrated into the annual budgets o f 2004 and 2005. Fiscal policy has remained sound.
The PSRP-PR presents evidence o f switching expenditures toward activities with high

                                            16


impacts on poverty reduction. The JSAN urgedthe government to continue reform o f tax
and customs administrationto ensure sustainability o f fiscal reforms.

(iii)  Enhancinghumandevelopment and improvingsocial safety nets

47.    Spending in the social sectors increased and good progress is being made in
implementing systemic reforms.      Ineducation spending as a percent o f GDP rose from
2.2 percent in 2002 to 2.7 percent in 2004 and satisfactory progress was made in the
school rationalization program and increasing teacher salaries and training. In health,
spending as a percent o f GDP rose from 1.2 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 1.3 percent in
2004, although this fell short o f the 1.5 percent PRSP target. The government also
adopted measures to raise quality in social spending. In social assistance, measures to
further improve the administration o f the targeted cash family poverty benefits program
were introduced, including better monitoring and evaluation and a more streamlined
appeals procedure. In social insurance, the government made satisfactory progress in
introducing individual accounts in the pension systems, improving collection o f social
insurance contributions, and increasing pensions.          The government also began
implementingthe state pension law that envisages stronger links between pensions and
contributions.

(iv)   Improvingpublicinfrastructureandmodernizingthe rural economy

48.     Goodprogress has been made in infrastructure and rural development, although
stimulating moreprivate sector involvement and reducing rural poverty remain concerns.
The PRSP-PR reported good progress being made on improving energy efficiency,
developing irrigation systems, and increasing the budget for road construction.          The
government has also begun moving toward sustainable tariff structures in water and
energy, and has completed a diagnostic study on rural infrastructure services. The JSAN
stressed the need for the government to clarify policies and the role o f private sector
participation inrural infrastructure. Moreover the JSAN suggested that further efforts be
made to analyze the role o f agriculture in reducing rural poverty, including examining
crop insurance, the functioning o f land markets, and the use o f land as collateral in rural
areas.

               V.      THE PRSC-SUPPORTEDREFORMPROGRAM

Introduction

49.     As noted, the three-year reform program supported by the PRSCs is anchored in
the PRSP objectives and action plan and has been developed through extensive
consultation with civic society. The PRSP consultation process is being institutionalized
and will continue to be active. The relationship between the major PRSP policy priorities
and the PRSC-supported program are illustrated below (Table 3). The Bank initiated its
PRSC support for a select sub-set o f policy and institutional actions developed in the
PRSP in line with its comparative advantage and at the request o f the authorities a year
ago. The thrust and the content of the PRSC-supported three year reform program
remain unchanged. As discussed below, there has been continued satisfactory progress

                                                17


with the implementation of the PRSC-I program,                     full compliance with the
implementation of all PRSC-I1 actions (with the exception of slower than expected
progress in customs and civil aviation), and PRSC-I11policy actions that were set out a
year ago have been reaffirmed with modifications where necessary to reflect
developments. The expected development outcomes are provided inAnnex 111.

50.     Public expenditure environment. The PRSC will disburse IDA funds to budgets
that have been developed in line with the medium term expenditure framework.            The

                                              18


quality o f public expenditures continues to be raised through several channels. First,
through the PRSC1-supported program, large increases in salaries o f public sector
workers, especially in education and health, took place to bring salaries closer to
comparable civil service salaries, to attract qualified staff, to reduce incentives for
informal payments by service users, and to enhance service quality.                 Second,
expenditures will shift towards non-salary components once this adjustment is complete.
Third, subsidy expenditures have fallen sharply with energy sector reforms, and are
projected to fall further with the achievement o f cost recovery in irrigation. Fourth, the
share o f domestically financed capital spending will rise in the medium to long run,
although a burst o f donor-provided assistance such as the MCC may reduce this share in
the initial years. The sharp fall inthe fiscal burdeno f debt service (Table 1) over the rest
o fthis decade provides the roomto increase capital spending.

51.     Moreover, improvements in public expenditure management institutions and
practices detailed in this document will also raise the quality o f public spending. The
Bank's public modernization project, with its focus on institutional reform, will also help
to ensure that the public expenditure environment will remain a sound one.

52.     The PRSC supported reform program continues to aim at achieving a balance in
expenditures that are pro-growth and those that are pro-poor. In the former category,
measures intended to sharpen competition, raise standards in governance, and entrench
property rights remain prominent in PRSC 11; while in the latter, measures to diminish
social and environmental risk and develop farm incomes and rural infrastructure will
continue to benefit the poor, and also strengthenthe productive base o f the economy.

53.     Developments under PRSC-II.         Armenia's performance with respect to key
(trigger) policy and institutional reforms in the context o f its commitments under PRSC-

54.     Key policies during PRSC-111. Armenia has a creditable record o f economic
stability, as noted in the opening sections o f this Program Document. Over the medium
term, the macro-economic program underlying the PRSP calls forfiscal deficits in the
range o f 2% to 3 percent o f GDP, Le., what can be financed by concessional borrowing
from IDA and other donors and from highly limited volumes o f domestic debt issues as
the authorities try to develop a capital market for long term debt. Such domestic debt
will be used to finance long-term capital investments. Monetarypolicy is intended to be
geared to keeping inflation low and the exchange rate regime would be a floating one.
The external debt burden is low and i s projected to fall in relation to domestic output
over the mediumterm. By the standards o f CIS or o f emergingeconomies, the economic
record is remarkable and the medium term outlook robust. Armenia could expect to
attain creditworthiness for IBRD lending and for judicious commercial borrowing for
highreturnprojects over the medium term.

55.     Major policy challenges. Nevertheless, the authorities have to remain vigilant to
the major sources o f vulnerability to economic performance. Challenges over the near to
medium term arise from two sources: keeping inflation in check (even though current
inflation i s very low) and the narrowness o f the fiscal base.              In recent past, bank
intermediation has deepened with rapid growth in monetary and credit variables.
External inflows      - investment, remittances - have been significant.              Against this
background, dangers to inflation would arise if domestic liquidity i s allowed to grow too
fast. To bear down on inflation, particularly in the face o f large projected external
inflows, the authorities will need to hold a prudent monetary stance and to develop
monetarypolicy instrumentsdesigned to sterilize external inflows. It will be important to
maintain a flexible exchange rate system, recognizingthat, ina rapidly growing economy
with productivity gains, the dram will appreciate in real terms. Intervention should be
limitedto smoothing short runvolatility inthe exchange rate.

56.     The narrowness o f thefiscal base and insufficient reliance on direct taxes leads to
lack o f balance in the tax structure and to a mobilization ratio that i s too low to fund
priority social expenditure needs. Changes in tax policy to enhance the role o f direct
taxes" and in tax administration to reduce tax arrears, ensure minimal evasion and fair
treatment o f all taxpayers will go a long way to stabilizing the fiscal base.                  Any
temptation to relax on tax reforms against a background o f large donor grant inflows
should be resisted.

scope for hrther actionon indirecttaxes is small.

                                             24


57.     Questions also arise as to the capacity o f the economy to efficiently absorb a
large volume of external grant funds flow from the MCC and other sources. The
projected inflows o f the order o f the equivalent o f 2 percent o f GDP will not be
inconsistent with macro-stability provided the monetary and exchange rate stance i s as
discussed above, the import content o f the counterpart to grant financing i s high (as
would be the case for energy and other infrastructure capital spending), and domestic
spending (e.g., on salaries) is controlled. Macroeconomic challenges will also arise if
grant financing is used to substitute for domestic revenue mobilization or if it leaks into
public consumption - these would pose a danger to fiscal sustainability over the medium
term.

58.     There i s a concomitant need to ensure high quality in public expenditures
reforms, for example in education and health (described later). A strategic approach to
capital spending based on an overall public investment plan that explicitly makes sector
choices i s also necessary, particularly inthe context o f the M C C disbursements.

59.     The budgetfor 2006. In line with the 2006-08 MTEF targets, the recently
approved 2006 budget aims at a large improvement inthe tax to GDP ratio: 15.1 percent
against an estimate o f 14.3 percent for 2005 and 14.1 percent in 2004. The 2006 budget
envisages total revenues of 15.9 percent o f GDP (compared to 16.2 percent estimated for
2005 and 15.6 percent actual outcome for 2004) as non-tax revenues are projected to fall
sharply and total expenditures of 18.8 percent (compared with 18.5 percent anticipated
outcome for 2005 and 17.2 percent actual out-turn for 2004). The projected deficit o f 2.9
percent o f GDP i s a modest rise from 2.4 percent expected deficit in 2005. The deficit
will be almost equally financed by borrowing from domestic market and concessional
loans provided by the IFIs. These projections are based on revised 2006-08 MTEF
outlines adjusted for most recent macroeconomic developments. The budget indicates
that around 9 percent o f revenue increase envisaged in 2006 results from improved tax
administration.

60.     The expenditure plan in 2006 reflects government priorities to increase resource
allocation to high priority social sectors, infrastructure, and public administration areas.
Inparticular, the 2006 budgetenvisages 20 per cent increase in spending for each ofthe
three social sectors (health, education, and social protection) over the 2005 to improve
efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure inreducing poverty. Moreover, about
one-fourth o f the budgeted expenditures are to finance investment needs to rehabilitate
and develop the necessary infrastructure inagriculture, water, road and energy sectors.

Strengthening Governanceand the Fight Against Corruption

61.     Over the past few years, the record on governance performance has been mixed.
According to the 2006 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
(BEEPS), the perception o f corruption as a constraint to doing business in Armenia i s
lower than the averages in CIS and ECA countries. Just 10 percent o f firms surveyed in
Armenia said that they frequently paid bribes, compared to over 25 percent in CIS
countries and 20 percent inthe ECA region. However, in several areas, there has been a

                                                 25


disconcerting increase in the perception o f corruption in Armenia. While only 5 percent
o f firms reported frequent unofficial payments to deal with taxes and tax collection in
2002, for example, this had increased to 18 percent in 2005. Other areas in which a
higher proportion o f firms reported having to frequently pay bribes were obtaining
government contracts; dealing with customs/imports, dealing with courts, and obtaining
business licenses and permits.          According to Transparency International's 2005
Corruption Perception Index (CPI), Armenia ranks 88th out o f 159 countries surveyed,
which compares well to the CIS group. There has, however, been a slight deteriorationin
Armenia's CPI, from 3.1 in2004 to 2.9 in2005.

62.     Since end-2003, the authorities have been implementing an official anti-
corruption strategy and three year action plan. Principal measures have included
legislative changes (such as penalties for corruption), tax and customs administration
reforms, reforms in the judiciary, and higher public financial audit standards with
increased parliamentary oversight. Further, in January 2004, Armenia joined the Group
o f Corruption Fighting Countries (GRECO) and an assessment o f Armenia's legislative
framework was         conducted.       In June 2004,        Armenia also        adopted OECD
recommendations on eliminating corruption intransitional countries and OECD has been
monitoring progress inimplementingthese recommendations.

63.     The official strategy is generally sound and consistent with the Bank's
recommended best practices on combating corruption.           l2 It  includes key public sector
management reforms; actions to build a competitive private sector; measures to address
political and public accountability; and efforts to increase civil society voice and
participation.   Gaps, however, still remain.          Further specificity in measures will be
essential and effective monitoring mechanisms need to be developed. Sustained, high
level commitment to advancing the agenda i s also critical to realizing the desired
outcomes. The Government plans to update the Action Plan during the first halfo f 2006,
to include a second stage of measures to improve the transparency o f public sector
management and fight corruption. Tracking progress with the anti-corruption agenda will
remain a key part o fthe dialogue with the Bank over the medium term.

64.     The government has implemented an important governance measure through the
introduction o f electronic (digital) signatures and the legal acceptance o f electronic
documents and signat~res'~.This reduces the interface between public officials and
individuals or companies, diminishes the role for the exercise o f discretion and corruption
opportunities, besides increasing efficiency within the public sector and the economy as a
whole. The parliamentrecently passed a Law on Electronic Document and Signature and
the government has now issued the necessary secondary regulations. The benefits o f this
measure would be reinforced by the government's strategy on e-procurement, which will
furtherdiminishopportunities for corruptionduringpublic procurementtransactions.

65.     Thefour major areas of reform in public administration which are supported by
the PRSC program have been selected by the government for the expected impact o f

  See, for example, "Anti-Cormption inTransition 2", (ECA Region, World Bank, 2004), Box 4.1.
l3Matrix, 1.2.

                                               26


reforms on diminishing corruption, easing the burden o f mal-governance on business
activity, and raising the quality o f public services - tax administration, customs
administration, irrigation and drainage, and fiduciary functions o f the government.

66.     Strengthening tux admini~tration.~~        Despite steps taken in the recent past to
strengthen tax administration - introduction o f tax manuals, identification numbers, an
information website, revisions to the criminal code and to audit practices - tax
administration represents a serious impediment to the efficient raising o f revenues, to
probity in government and to business activity. The three key reform actions to be
supported by PRSC have been chosen on the basis o f the expected impact on the criteria
outlined above - efficiency, probity, and business impact.

67.     The large taxpayer unit reform. Under PRSC-11,the large tax payer unit (LTU)
was strengthened to administer about 300 taxpayers.          The unit's audit capacity has
improved through mergingthe central audit department into LTU, the number o f days to
conclude an audit has been increased and additional reforms are being introduced. In
2005, tax administration approved an actionplan -to be implemented during PRSC-III-
-which focuses on legislative initiatives to facilitate effective tax audits and to
development o f personnel, institutional and administrative infrastructures in support o f
LTU.     The implementation plan introduces an annual audit plan based on risk
classification, priorities and targets. Other additional measures, such as periodic
publication o f the list o f 300 large taxpayers, change inthe management practices greatly
helped to increase the productivity o f this unit. During 2004 the large taxpayer unit
ensuredabout 58 percent o ftotal actual tax collection, whereas duringthe first 10months
o f 2005 this ratio rose to 73 percent.

68.     Introduction o f self-assessment. Under PRSC-11, the government adopted a
strategy for the introduction o f a self-assessment tax system and its phased
implementation in May 2005.          Through self-assessment, direct contacts between tax
collectors and taxpayers will be reduced or eliminated and timely tax payments fostered.
The program implementation i s on track. DuringPRSC-111, self assessment system will
be implementedand the large taxpayer unit further strengthened in accordance with its
actionplan.

69.     Improving tax practices through reduction in arrears. Since 2004 the government
has made efforts to amortize the stock o f VAT refund obligations to exporters. The
program agreed between authorities and the Bank envisaged no buildup in fresh arrears
and a reduction in the stock in line with quantitative targets supported by PRSC-11. At
the beginning o f2005 the outstanding overdue amount to exporters was 5.4 billion AMD.
Duringthe first ten months o f 2005, the tax administration has managed to repay a total
o f 14 billion AMD leading to a reduction o f old V A T arrears to only 0.6 billion AMD.
The government i s committed to achieving its target o f 20 billion AMD of
reimbursementof VAT claims by the end o f 2005. The government has also reduced the
stock o ftax arrears owed to it by 12 billion drams inthe first ten months o f 2005, thereby
exceeding the agreed target with IDA o f 8 billion drams. The tax administration will

continue adherence to good practices on V A T refunds and collection o f tax arrears during
PRSC111.'~

70.      Strengthening customs administration.'6Though various structural
improvementshave taken place incustoms administration under PRSC-II- salary
increases to attract higherquality and honest staff, information outreach, modem
software -the systemis plaguedwith inefficiencies, clearance procedures remain
archaic, and a highdegree o f discretion inservice provision exists. All survey data point
to customs practices as a major impedimentto governance and to an efficient business
environment. The reform program introduces transparent and swift procedures destined
to facilitate trade while safeguarding revenue collection inlinewith established
international good practice.

71.      Implementation o f self-declaration and direct trade data input (DTI).      Under
PRSC-11,the authorities had commitment themselves to introducing DTIfor all imports.
Inthe event, given slowness and a certain unwillingnessto embrace institutional change,
this objective was not achieved. Inits place, the authorities instituted a pilot scheme for
D T I in late 2005, covering 5 per cent o f imports by declaration and 12 per cent by value.
The authorities stated that as experience was gained through the scheme, institutions and
practices would be adapted to implementD T I on a wide basis. Moreover, a pilot would
help to reduce the risk to revenues o freforms. The pilot implementation o fD T Ifacilities
has initiated a systemic change away from the intimate involvement o f customs officials
at the declaration validation stage, where opportunities for discretionary behavior are rife.
The system has the capability to provide for immediate validation and assessment o f
acceptable declarations. When these pilot reforms are consolidated and extended, the
direct interface o f traders and customs brokers with customs officials will be practically
eliminated.     Under PRSC-111, the authorities have undertaken to expand the pilot.
Specifically, the authorities have committed themselves to extending DTI by April 1,
2006 to the major customs houses o f Ararastian and Zvarnots, thereby obtaining import
coverage o f nearly 80 per cent, and to maintainingthese reforms thereafter.17

72.      Selectivity o f customs control. The system used today is not risk-based; and
genuine green channel selections are practically nil outside the pilot. Reform measures
will reduce discretion and lower business costs by permitting the use o f risk-based
ASYCUDA system to determine selectivity o f control. Under PRSC-111, through the
introduction o f the ASYCUDA selectivity module at all networked customs locations and
the adoption o f a green channel (Le., release without any checks subject to criteria
determined by customs), it will be possible to give automaticity and predictability in
clearance o f goods.

73.      Post-control audit functions. To support the above reforms whilst safeguarding
revenues, it will be necessary to establish risk management systems and practices and to
strengthen skills in the post control audit unit o f customs.         The government has

strengthened the Post Clearance Audit (PCA) unit in customs by increasing its current
staffing and byproviding training.

74.      Improving governance in irrigation and drainage."         Given the importance o f
irrigation for growth o f agriculture, efficient public administration in irrigation and
drainage i s o f particular concern. Under PRSC 11, the government merged state-level
responsibilities for irrigation infrastructure and drainage systems under a single central
agency, the Water Resources Management Committee.                Authority to manage the
irrigation system (mainly secondary and tertiary canals but also some primary canal) was
also devolved to 53 regional Water Users Associations (WUA). This transition from
centralized management i s proving to be successful, with subsidies that are being directly
allocated to W A Sfalling and fee collections rising significantly. Surveys acknowledge
better operation and maintenance (O&M) of the system managed by the W A S . The
government has expressed it willingness to proceed with critical further steps in
enhancing the management and financial Performance o f W A S . These arrangements
will bemaintained under PRSC111.

75.      Improve public financial management functions. The reforms are directed at
achieving greater budget transparency and accountability, improving budget planning and
expenditures; and strengtheningthe public procurement system.

76.       Budget management."            Under PRSC 11, reforms focused on (i)improving
budget classifications and public sector accounting and reporting standards, (ii)
introducing program budgeting, (iii)reducing fiscal risk by strengthening financial
management and reporting by the State Non-Commercial Organizations (SNCOs), and
(iv) strengthening institutional arrangements for internal and external audit. The PRSC-
I11agendawouldcontinueto buildonthese achievements.

77.       Budget classification and public sector accounting and reporting standards. The
government is advancing well in its initiative to improve budget classifications,
accounting and reporting standards, and envisages basing the 2008 budget on GFS 2001
principles and progressively introducing IPSAS accounting standards inthe public sector.
The action plan on "Implementation o f the Cash basis IPSAS and transition to an accrual
based full IPSAS" has beenadopted; furthermore, the Ministry o f Finance has developed
a new comprehensive chart o f accounts, compliant with GFS 2001 classifications and the
cash basis IPSAS. Detailed implementation manuals have also been introduced, which
will facilitate initial implementation o fthe new chart o f accounts inJanuary 2006. PRSC
I11would support the government program inthese areas as well as the new initiatives in
ensuring performance reporting and adjusting budget execution practices in pilot
ministries to comply with program budgeting requirements.20 The government also
envisages preparing a strategy to introduce system o f staff performance appraisal to
support a meritbasedwage and bonus system.2'

78.      Internal audit. Government is also progressing well in adopting internal audit
structures and under PRSC-I1 developed a detailed action plan to implement the 2005-
2008 internal audit strategy. Some o f the plan's actions have been carried out in a
satisfactory manner. Inparticular, a separate unit has been established in the ministry o f
finance to develop an internal audit methodology and satisfy internal audit training and
certification requirements. This entity reflects the type o f central structure encouraged
under the EU's internal controls model. The ministry o f finance has also taken the
important step o f settingup a department, which under PRSC-I11will focus on assessing
the quality o f internal audits undertaken in line ministries, and o f internal audit
arrangements inplace inthese ministries (rather than conducting inspectionsitself).

79.      State non-commercial enterprises (SNCO). These entities emerged from recent
decentralization reforms in the social sector, in which a large number o f budgetary
institutions in education, health and cultural sectors were granted autonomy and left the
Treasury financial accounting net. The creation o f SNCOs implied an ex ante loss o f
control by Treasury on commitments and expenditures and also, in the absence o f an
adequate financial reporting system, an expost lack o f supervision and control. Under
PRSC 11, a comprehensive reporting system for NCOs was introduced and a strategy to
apply sanctions for those in non-compliance with financial reporting was developed.
Given the diversity o f SNCOs, legislative changes are requiredto clarify and establish
their status (public, private or business entities), alter the budgetary classification o f their
resources (subsidy/transfer for public and business NCOs, and to goods and services for
entities considered private), and to adopt the appropriate type o f financial reporting and
controls for them.22These actions would be supported by PRSC 111.

80.      Other measures. Additional reforms relate to program budgeting,23where the
government continues to build on steps taken since the 2003-04 budget to introduce
elements o f social sector program budgeting through collection o f information on
program descriptions and performance indicators. The government adopted a time-bound
action plan to pilot program redefinition in pilot ministries and intends to extend this to
all budget agenciesby the 2008 Budget.

81.      Improving public procurement systems.24 The public procurement system
remains highly centralized, with considerable potential risks o f reduced transparency.
During PRSC 11, Armenia has significantly improved the public procurement system,
which i s being decentralized slowly, and transferring public procurement to the line
ministries. All procurement above certain level i s coordinated and carried out through
the Ministry o f Finance and Economy.              The State Procurement Agency (SPA)
representatives cannot act as bid evaluation committee members, although they are
responsible for organizing the process. The members o f the evaluation committees are
comprised from the line ministries staff.

82.     The government has already established aprocurement website where most o fthe
legislative documents, official procurement bulletin and other state procurement are
posted. An e-catalogue comprised of a list o f 13,000 items (goods, works and services)
has been created and i s on the website. The catalogue also contains the process for
vendor registration.   Under PRSC 111, the government will create an e-procurement
system and a unified automated procurement system which include e-purchasing and e-
tendering.

Expected Results

83.     National output i s projected to grow by 30 percent over the 2004-07 period, with
income per head approximating $1400 in constant 2004 dollars. Inflation i s expected to
be kept below 3 percent (end o f period basis) throughout 2004-07, consistent with fiscal
deficits in the 2-3 percent o f GDP range, on the basis o f tax revenues rising from the
equivalent o f 14 percent o f GDP in2003 to 16 percent o f GDP in2008.

84.     Key institutional outcomes are expected to be the attainment o f international
standards incustoms control, the adoption o f GFS 2001 budget classifications and IPSAS
cash basis standards in all ministries, budget execution reports to contain both financial
and nonfinancial performance indicators, staff performance appraisal system in
implementation inpilot ministries, ,the internal audit system being fully in place inpilot
ministries,   non-commercial     organizations    complying    with financial     reporting
requirements, and electronic procurement introduced.

         Theme 2: SharpeningCompetitionandEntrenchingPropertyRights

85.     The private sector - amounting to 84 percent o f GDP today - has been the
locomotive o f stellar growth over the past near-decade. The maintenance o f growth at
the potential rate o f the economy over the medium term will require corresponding
growth in private investment.      For this to occur, private investors will have to be
convinced that they can expect to earn commercial returns given the resources invested
and risks taken. Improved confidence in the credibility o f property rights and the
predictability of the regulatory regimes are core to this: success in these areas should
allow the cost o f capital fall to international levels.    Improving the efficiency and
effectiveness   of   key services      such   as   aviation,  road    transport,  railways,
telecommunications, and in continued reform in public utilities continues to be a high
priority along with addressing the remainingconstraints to business.

Competition

86.     There remains a serious lack o f competition in some sectors o f the Armenian
economy, particularly in sectors that relate to imports and distribution. Excess regulatory
and administrative costs and inspection are still major problems. The authorities have set
inplace the basic elements of a regime to protect competitive processes throughout the
economy via the Commission for Protection o f Economic Competition.

                                              31


          (a) Liberalization in key services

87.       Liberalization incivil aviation. For a landlocked country and particularly one that
i s subjected to closures o f its two principal borders, the quality and price o f civil air
services i s a critical element o f economic competitiveness. Technical improvements in
aircraft efficiency and new business models such as low-cost-carriers (LCCs) have
dramatically lowered prices in economically de-regulated aviation markets. In contrast,
the government has operated a restrictive civil aviation policy (e.g., by discretionary
control over the frequency and type o f foreign air services, by requiring some foreign
airlines to enter into agreements with Armenian firms in regard to sharing o f increased
services before the increased services can be permitted to be operated, and by not
permitting airlines intermediate and beyond rights). Activity has recovered inthe recent
past, but prices remain highand air service connections greatly limited.

88.      Under PRSC 11, the Bank recommended the immediate adoption o f an Open
Skies policy which would have eliminated economic entry restrictions on a bilateral and
reciprocal basis. The Bank noted that the agreement with Armavia would have to be re-
negotiated to permit this. However, the authorities expressed the wish to move much
more cautiously in liberalizing civil aviation services as they considered such an
approach more likely to lead to a sustained and low risk development o f the air services
markets.      Moreover, the government's agreement with Armavia may constrain the
authorities' ability to fully liberalize air services until the agreement expires in 2013.
Nevertheless, appreciation o f the benefits o f a more liberal policy has grown and the
government has adopted a policy statement incorporating a more liberal and flexible
stance to civil aviation services, including a simplification o f procedure^.^^          This
statement, which will be published for consultation with interested parties, specifies a
reporting and review process that should allow the policy to be steadily improved as the
government becomes more comfortable with liberalization and finds opportunities for
reform consistent with the Armavia agreement.26

89.       Under PRSC 111,the government will have adopted and be implementing a more
liberal civil aviation service policy that allows services to be increasingly to be provided
based on commercial assessments o f the customer demand. With continued highrates of
economic growth it i s likely that air services will generally continue to be expanded. Ifa
more liberal policy i s effective international experience would suggest that the air
services market should grow faster than the economy. The quality o f the services interms
o f connections, frequencies and seat availability should also improve and fares should
reduce on average. The annual review o f the policy would provide the basis for a
continuation o f the policy dialogue and identification o f further steps inthe liberalization
process.

90.       Improving efficiency in railways.        Railway services suffer from serious
inefficiencies -- poor service quality, low speed, and non-transparent and non-flexible
tariff-setting practices as well as costs associated with dilapidated infrastructure -- to the

26 Letter of Development Policy, para 20.

                                              32


detriment o f competitiveness.        The company suffers from the dominance o f non-
commercial factors inits operation, lack o f clear delineation inpolicy-making, regulatory
and management functions, and related lack o f incentives for improving efficiency and
profitability. A study currently being conducted i s directed inter alia at proposals to
adopt modem governance practices.

91.      Under PRSC 11, the government took a decision in 2004 to accord managerial
and operational autonomy to the railway company by severing its reporting requirement
to the ministry o f transport and to constitute an independent board o f directors
representing a cross-section o f society that will ensure that the company was run on a
commercial basis by appointing high quality management teams and holding them
accountable for performance. Inthe event, the government appointed a board with some
independent representation, but with a government majority and under the chair o f the
minister o f transport.     This is, therefore, only a modest step towards improved
governance. Under PRSC 111, the authorities have committed themselves to adopt a plan
o f  railway     restructuring,   satisfactory  to IDA, which       would   enhance    the
commercialization, transparency and accountability o f railway operations, and promote
private sector parti~ipation.~~

         (b) Regulatory reform in state owned utilities2'

92.      The utility sectors have undergone extensive reforms inrecent years, and there is
today extensive private sector participation. The Public Service Regulatory Commission
(PSRC) has established a direct contracting mechanism between the power distribution
company and the generators and service providers and ceased the license o f the state
electricity wholesale company thereby greatly `enhancing the transparency of the power
sector operations.     Under PRSC 11, the PSRC has made considerable progress in
improving utilities regulatory framework by: (i)   adopting service quality indicators and
monitoring system for the electricity and drinkingwater sectors, (ii)  publishingquarterly
financial performance o f regulated drinking water and electricity companies, (iii)starting
quarterly internet publication o f the financial performance o f the regulated irrigation
companies and (iv) adopting market rules on trading rules, independent audit, and
dispatching. Under PRSC 111, a deepening o f institutional development in the PSRC is
envisaged to assist the Commission in the effective delivery o f its statutory duties and
functions.29

93.      Increasing   competition       in telecommunications.30      Telecommunications
infrastructure and services are currently one o f the least developed in the CIS. The 15
year monopoly initially granted to the private investor, Armentel, in 1998 has stifled the
development o f competition. A mobile services competitor has entered the market with
some improvement in services as the monopoly has been replaced by a duopoly. During
PRSC-11, a new telecommunications law has been enacted and a modem regulatory

fkamework is being drafted that would allow for progressive licensing o f additional
service providers consistent with the government's agreement with Armentel and tasks
the PSRC with telecommunications regulation.

94.     Under PRSC 111, the PSRC plans to develop a new telecommunications sector
regulatory policy 31toguide the implementationo f the new legislation and the deliveryby
Annentel o f its obligations under its license, given the agreement with Annentel. The
regulatory policy statement should be clear about the objective o f the maximum possible
competition given the Armentel license, address pro-actively the right to license a third
mobile telephony operator in 2009 and also indicate the objective o f full liberalization
and de-regulation o f the market when the Armentel agreement expires in 2013.This
should be accompanied by a clear implementationplan accompanied by a timeline for the
liberalization including the proposed allocation o f the property rights in the necessary
radio frequency spectrum. This would allow private firms interested in being the third
mobile operator in 2009, for example, to commence their planning now and would also
increase the pressure on the incumbent service providers to improve their performance.

Entrenching Property Rights32

95.      The chief deficiencies inthe area o f property rights stem from weaknesses in the
enforcement o f collateral - a factor that has hobbled the development o f the financial
sector and raised the cost of capital for firms. PRSC I1supported government reforms to
reduce cost o f capital for firms and increase the level o f intermediation in financial sector
through improvement of property rights and increasing the confidence and governance in
the financial system.

96.      Secured    transaction^.^^      The authorities have made significant progress in
legislating to enhance creditor rights environment and stimulate the mortgage market.
Legislation covered the areas o f (i)     civil litigation and enforcement, (ii)
                                                                               mortgages, and
(iii)compulsory enforcement o f collateral which include amendments to criminal, civil
and land codes and procedures -- civil procedure, compulsory enforcement, public
auction, and appraisal activity.         The authorities have also initiated work to further
develop the pledge registry software for movable assets, and developed a registry guide
for movable property. Despite these efforts, the use o f pledge registration for movable
assets as yet remains weak.            Under PRSC 111, the government intends to sustain
implementation ofthe improved secured transaction^.^^

97.      Bankinn                At the request o fthe authorities, FSAPupdate assessmentwas
conducted;36 it found the banking sector to be well capitalized, liquid, and profitable.
The assessment also included a review o f banking supervision capacity using Basel Core

Principal (BCP). Furthermore, the assessmenthighlightednecessary improvements inthe
areas o f risk management, corporate governance o f banks, banking resolution, external
audit, and protection o f supervisors.     Supported by the PRSC I1 program, the CBA
developed an action plan based on the FSAP recommendations, and has already
implemented a number o f measures, including amendments to law on bank and banking,
approved by the Parliament in October 2005, which include regulations to improve
corporate governance and resolution o f banks. The law strengthenscorporate governance
by providing for (i)   improved definitions and limitations on transactions among related
parties, (ii)the ability o f the CBA to take action where a bank's organizational structure
would impede prudential supervision, and (iii)requires approval o f the shareholders'
meeting on large transactions involving transfers of assets and requires that the
transactions be conducted at market prices.         Under PRSC 111, the efforts o f the
authorities - principally the central bank - shift to implementation o f the corporate
governance laws. Furthermore, to ensure the continued stability o f banking and capital
markets, the authorities will institute a unified supervision regime.37The government has
decided to implement unified regulatory system from 2006, with abolition o f security
exchange and insurance inspectorates and moving their responsibilities under the
auspices o fthe central bank.

98.      Insurance market^.^'     The insurance sector in Armenia highly underdeveloped
relative to its potential and compared with those in other CIS countries. During PRSC
11, the authorities adopted the newly developed prudential regulations (assets and
liabilities valuation and maturity; insurance capital and solvency margins; justification o f
insurance premium tariffs; reinsurance and maximum & minimum limitations; reserve
requirements; and investments) as well as reporting forms and guidelines for the
insurance companies. Under PRSC 111, the authorities will ensure compliance with the
new regulations, moreover, minimum capital requirement for insurance companies will
be raised and an actuarial system will be e~tablished.~~The authorities believe that the
proposed unified supervision regime would benefit the insurance industry as well.

Expected Results

99.      The improved competition environment will be evident ina sharp fall intransport
costs in aviation and rail services and in quality gains in utilities services in line with
quantitative indicators set as minimum service quality standard for frequency and
duration o f available service. A new telecommunication policy statement is planned
which would provide pre-conditions for the entry o f a third GSM operator in Armenia.
The entrenchment of property rights is expected to lead to an expansion o f financial
intermediation with increases in credit extended (as costs and risks associated with
secured transactions fall) and in deposit mobilization by banks (as confidence grows). A
near four-fold rise ininsurance activities i s expected over a three year period.

                    Theme3: MitigatingSocial and EnvironmentRisks

100.    Despite the recent strong gains inpoverty reduction, vulnerable population groups
continue to require well-designed social protection programs and key medium term
challenges lie in ensuring adequate fknctioning o f the public pension program and
providing for choice inthe pension system. The second generation reforms in education
and health focus on ensuring rising quality o f service provision, aiding human capital
formation in high pay-off areas such as early childhood education or an attack on non-
communicable diseases. The mainstreaming o f environment factors into sector policy
formulation and re-shaping policies to reduce degradation and reduce the vulnerability o f
the poor to natural calamities lie at the heart o freducing environmentalrisks.

Improving Social Protection and Social Risk Management'

101.     The steps taken in the recent past, supported by PRSC 11, to focus social
protection system on the most vulnerable and to improve efficiency and affordability -
the replacement o f a fragmented system by a proxy means tested cash family poverty
benefit; significant rise inresources to finance this benefit; adoption o f a pension reform
strategy; and various administrative reforms - have greatly heightened the effectiveness
of the social protection system in assisting the poor and vulnerable cope with economic
and social hardship. The family poverty benefit i s a well-targeted and administered
benefit.     The PRSC 111-supported reform program envisages a range o f measures,
including commitment to a significant shift inbudgetaryoutlays for social protection that
would substantially enhance the ability o f the system to alleviate poverty alleviation
through improving service delivery and buildingup monitoring and evaluation capacity.41

102.     Safety nets: Family poverty benefit i s extended to 15 per cent o f the population,
and has risen substantially in real terms since 2003. During PRSC 11, the government
decided to differentiate the benefit amount based on the degree o f poverty and the
targeting formula was fine tuned to take into account findings o f the 2004 Integrated
Living Conditions Survey. Two laws (the Law on Social Support and the Law on Social
Assistance in Cash), regulating the social assistance in Armenia have been submitted to
Parliament.

103.     Under PRSC 111, the policy focus will remain on the family poverty benefit as the
most important poverty alleviation tool through: (i) rise in budgetary allocation; (ii)
                                                        real
further differentiation o f the benefit amount according to family social parameters; (iii)
regular annual review o f the targeting formula, so as to allow for improvements in the
benefit targeting efficiency and effectiveness; (iv) continued monitoring and evaluation
of the program's poverty impact; and (v) further improvements inbenefit administration,
including staff training and improvements inthe management information system.

104.     Pensions. During2005, average monthly labor pensions continued to increase in
real terms and advances were made in the system o f individual record keeping that i s


40Matrix 3.1.
4'Letter o f Development Policy, paras 35 and 37.

                                               36


necessary for income-related pensions. Under PRSC 11, the Law on Private Pension
Funds was drafted. An inter agency working group led by the Ministry o f Labor and
Social Welfare was established to examine options for the structure and financing o f the
pension system. The options and corresponding calculations (with an analysis o f welfare,
fiscal and financial market consequences) should serve as a base for the discussion and
adoption o f a strategy inthe first half o f2006.

105.     During PRSC 111, the focus will be to: (i)adopt the law on private pension
insurance and implement the action plan to develop the supervisory and regulatory
capacity within the unified supervision structure; (ii)   develop and adopt pension system
strategy; and (iii)  continue real increase in average pensions, so as to ensure that public
pensions play adequately its role as a poverty protectioninstrumentinthe old age.42

Raising the Quality of

106.     The completion rate for primary school in 2003 was around 110 percent with
access to compulsory education defined by the net enrollment rate equaling to 83.8
percent for 2002.        The quality o f general secondary education remains an issue,
particularly for rural areas. In tertiary education, enrollment i s high relative to other
countries at this level o f GDP per head, at 38 percent, but equity and accessibility to
professional education are issues.        Moreover, since independence, enrollment in early
childhood development has fallen by 32 percent. Under PRSC 11, a substantial increase
inthe public spendingineducation has occurred. However, although the lion's share of
spending has been appropriately directed to the general education sector, much o f this
increase has gone to increased teacher salaries (increased from extremely low levels).
About 90% o f education expenditures are now spent on salaries and administration. The
government has achieved significant reforms towards efficiency and effectiveness.

107.     The school rationalization prom-am.       During PRSC 11, teacher salaries have
increased by 65 percent. The government has not reached the MTEF planned 15.1
studentkeacher full time equivalent (FTE) ratio, but the student teacher ratio figures vary
greatly from school to school. At primary levels student teacher ratios are 21/1. It is at
the upper general school levels inparticular that the studentkeacher ratios are inefficient,
and an overall indicator masks differences between small rural schools and larger urban
schools. It is still an urgent task to seek new approaches inmaking the general education
system more efficient.         Under PRSC 111, although the decline of the school-age
population will make firther immediate efficiency gains difficult, it is envisioned that the
rationalization o f general education will continue through ensuring appropriate
studentkeacher ratios in larger schools that have more than 300 students. Inaddition it is
plannedto consolidate and separatehigh schools from general schools. A continuous real
increase inteacher salaries i s planned as well. Inan effort to ensure the continued rise in
the appropriateness o f education spending, the government will review the per capita

financing formula, which i s now in need o f adjustment to reflect the needs o f small
schools. It is hopedthat this will contribute to the increase innon-salary expenditure^.^^

108.      Earlv childhood education.            Under PRSC 11, a policy on early childhood
development has been adopted by the government and a new law has been passed.
Standards for service provision for early childhood education have been drafted. These
efforts are crucial to set the stage for good program design. Under PRSC 111, standards
for early childhood education will be approved and implemented. It i s expected that
some communities will implement pilot programs designed to provide quality cost
effective services targeting the most vulnerable families.                This initiative is critical in
order to provide a good environment for children to be ready to learninschool.

109.      Tertiary education. Under PRSC 11, in tertiary education, the government has
started the gradual introduction o f new financing mechanisms by adopting a new policy
on scholarships and stipends, taking into account both merit and social status. Initial
discussions on a student loan scheme and adjustments to the stipend system have been
undertaken to ensure greater access to higher education by poor students. The
government has indicated its commitment to change by signing the Lisbon accord45on
higher education reform in May 2005. In addition it is proactively working with the
Council of Europe and donors to provide resources to universities to meet the Bologna
standards46.The PRSC I11program will specifically address two reform challenges that
l i e ahead: (a) developing sustainable mechanisms for financing institutions and students;
and (b) expanding the course credit system. Planned reforms in financing institutions
will improve transparency and efficiency o f spending. The government will develop a
three-year plan for implementing these higher education reforms as well as expanding the
course credit system and progressing further on the development o f a student loan
~cheme.~'

Controlling Risks in Health48

110.       The post-transition drastic drop in public spending on health care caused health
facility use to be one-third o f that in countries with similar epidemiological profiles.
Health care utilization i s significantly tilted against the poor and the rural dweller. In
2004, public expenditures on health care accounted for 1.5 percent o f GDP, a rate that i s
lower than the corresponding average GDP share for lower income countries (2.5 per
cent). The challenge for Armenia i s to provide adequate financial protection for the poor
so that they could access health services when needed. To do so would require increased
public funding and better targeting.

 111. Under PRSC 11, reforms were directed at enhancing accessibility and quality o f
health services, especially for the poor, by increasing spending in real terms on a

sustainable basis (with significant part o f the increased resources being devoted to raises
in the reimbursements given to service providers to better cover the cost o f services,
thereby reducing the need for informal out-of-pocket spending by the patient), intra-
sectoral reallocation o f resources towards more cost-effective care modalities (such as
primary health care), and through optimization and efficiency improvements in the
hospital sector. The reforms also encompass strengthened governance o f the health
system; supporting legislation i s currently underpreparation.

112.    Rationalization and management reforms in hospitals. Oversupply o f hospitals,
contracted by the state to provide impatient services to population, causes inefficient use
o fpublic resources and results inunequal access to services and their low quality. Under
PRSC 11, the government continued successful implementation o f a hospital
consolidation program inYerevan.49 The number o f hospital contracts in 2004 decreased
from 124 to 118; this i s in line with quantitative program targets agreed between the
Bank and authorities. During PRSC 111, a consolidation o f the hospital network across
the country to reach the productivity benchmarks set for the hospital system by 2009 will
be supported.

113.     Primarv health care (PHC).          Chronic under-funding o f the network o f rural
ambulatories and urban policlinics that provide primary health care results in uncatered
needs o f the population for essential health services. Under PRSC 11, the strengthening
o f the primary health care system as an effective and affordable alternative for hospital
care was achieved by (i)      completion o f the training o f family physicians and nurses to
ensure coverage for the entire population with family medicine teams; (ii)hrther
improvements in provider payment mechanisms to increase incentives for provision o f
quality care by PHC; and (iii)        integration o f outpatient specialist services with hospital
services and with social care providers. With the PRSC I11support, the government will
adopt policies to define the scope o fpublicly-funded healthcare services.

114.     Private insurance. While the economic and employment conditions are not yet in
favor o f mandatory health insurance, the government has explored options for voluntary
health insurance. Under PRSC 11, the government' developed draft options on private
insurance to cover certain health risks and/or population                  Further support inthis
area, to define a framework for voluntary health insurance would be provided under
PRSC 111.

115.     Non-communicable diseases (NCD) are the leading causes o f morbidly and
mortality in Armenia. Eventhough the life expectancy inArmenia i s among the highest
inthe CIS countries, the morbidly/mortality rates from NCDs have been increasingover
the last years, creating a serious public threat. Under PRSC 11, the government has
developed a draft national strategy on combating the NCDs which provides the analysis
o f current situation and outlines the priority measures to be taken at various levels o f
health care services provision. DuringPRSC 111, the government will address the public

and through an adequate provisiono fpublic resources inthe health care b ~ d g e t . ~ '

Reducing Risks in Natural ResourceManagement for Sustainable Li~elihoods~~

116.      The main sources o f environmental vulnerability consist o f deteriorating forest
stock, inadequate water supply and solid waste services, pollution o f water resources,
urban air pollution, significant soil erosion, increasing vulnerability o f the rural
population to natural hazards, threats to biodiversity, and limited access to water and
sanitation to the poor in rural areas. The country's forest resources, in particular, have
been put under increased pressure for fuel wood, non-forest timber products, and grazing
and hunting.

117.      Reforming and building solid environmental planning and enforcement capacity
in environmental institutions remains a challenge. The government is continuing its
systemic efforts to reverse natural resource degradation, focusing on forests andprotected
areas.    While the legislative framework for environmental protection has improved,
institutional and administrative deficiencies have led to weak enforcement and low
environmental compliance. Although current legislation recognizes the public's right to
participate inthe decision-makingprocess and have access to environmental information,
systemic lack o f effective implementation o f these principles weakens the credibility o f
environmental enforcement agencies.

118.      Environmental impact assessment. The ministryo f nature protection has adopted
an action plan to develop the legislative framework for environmental impact assessment
and supervision. Key steps include adoption o f the Law on Environmental Supervision
(2005); adoption o f the Law on Damage Calculation to Fauna and Flora (2005); adoption
of the new Law on Environmental Expertise; and definition o f the categories o f activities
subject to environmental review.           While the legal framework for environmental
supervision has improved, implementation still remains weak due to the lack o f
regulatory instruments and human capacity. Both private and public sector capacity to
conduct accurate and transparent environmental impact assessments i s still evolving.

119.      National forestry policy. Supported by the PRSC-11, a national forest policy and
strategy was adopted after wide public participation. The policy identifies rehabilitation
of degraded forests and protection o f existing forests as a highpriority for Armenia. Its
objectives are to develop a framework for long term and sustainable management o f
forests; implement institutional and legal reforms for sustainable forest management; and
introduce international forest management, certification and evaluation standards. Key
actions under PRSC I1 included submission o f the Forest Code to Parliament and
significant     progress in developing the restructuring plan for the forest company,
establishment o f illegal logging and timber removal monitoring systems.

120.     Illegal logging.  While illegal logging i s largely associated with firewood for
household heating among the rural poor, illegal commercial timber use is also
widespread.     With support o f PRSC-11, a national action plan for combating illegal
logging was approved and broad public discussion has been initiated to increase public
awareness on the need to combat illegal logging and introduce the public to the scale and
scope o f interventions required to prevent illegal logging.       These efforts are being
complemented by investment projects in rural areas, such as gasification o f villages. A
system for monitoring illegal logging and forest removal/exploitation was established
under PRSC 11. During PRSC 111, policies to control illegal logging and monitoring
forest removal will be further developed and targets will be agreed with IDA by March
2006.53

121.     Community forestry. The new Forest Code, and supporting regulations on forest
management that were developed under PRSC I1 will enable participation o f rural
communities inthe management o f forest resources inorder to help increase local access
to forest resources and reduce pressure on forests as communities gain the capacity and
rights to manage local forest resources. Local communities will be given specific rights
over forest management decisions and sustainable harvesting, based on agreements
betweenusers and the forest authority.54 The state will retain its role as a regulator and
will specifically deal with externalities associatedwith the use o f forest or forest land.

Expected Results

122.     Improvements in the social risk protection framework are expected to lead to
coverage o f at least 70 percent o f poor households to receive the family poverty benefit.
There would also be a reduction in the leakage o f resources allocated to the poverty
benefit going to non-poor, brought about by greater differentiation o f benefits and
changes inthe targeting formula. Average pensions are expected to rise by 58 percent in
real terms between 2003 and 2008. The continuation o f rationalization and quality
enhancement programs in education and health i s expected to result in sharp rises in
expenditures perpupil or per patient, the attainment o fhigher service provision standards,
and greater access for the poorer segments o f population.            Legal and regulatory
frameworks for the private provision o f pension services and health insurance will be in
place. Environmental risks will be reduced through sustainable community forestry
programs being in place, and a reduction in illegal logging through the agreed targets
with IDA.

                       Theme 4: Modernizingthe RuralEconomy

123.     The rural sector in Armenia saw significant changes in the years after
independence and was characterized by: (i)    high levels o f urban to rural migration, with
agriculture acting as a social safety net; (ii)
                                              collapse of the agricultural produce and agro-
processing industry supply chains, particularly the FSU marketing infrastructure and
input supply sources; (iii)the break-up o f large commercial farms into subsistence-

oriented small-holder farming, and (iv) low productivity, high under-employment, and
increased pressure on cultivatable land.      In recent years, growth in commercialized
farming has begun to recover following new investments, restructuring by privatized
processors, and some foreign direct investment. While grains and other low value
subsistence crops still account for over half o f total output, production o f value added
crops (fruits, grapes, and vegetables) is increasing. Risingmilk yields over the past half
decade also indicate a gradual recovery in the livestock sector, which saw a particularly
sharp decline during the transition (due to breed deterioration, decline in productivity,
and collapse inintensive management practices).

124.     Agriculture continues to be a core component o f the national economy and
poverty reduction strategy. It retains its function as a social safety net and accounts for
the livelihoods o f some 500,000 people, which i s nearly half o f total formal employment
and three times as many people as the sector employed prior to independence. Key
challenges are to increase productivity and raise farm incomes; further develop the agro-
processing industry, which i s a key source o f markets for agricultural produce and off-
farm employment; and encourage development o f other commercial activities in rural
areas.

Stimulating Farm Incomes

125.     The reform strategy supported by PRSC-I1 i s anchored in securing farm
productivity gains.      Small farms can be highly efficient, but require access to
productivity-enhancing inputs and technologies that also promote sustainability of land,
water, pasture and forest resources. Effective market links for small farmers - to service
providers and input suppliers, to traders and to the processing industry, and, to financial
service providers are essential for achieving these gains.

126.     Productivity enhancement. The main areas for reform are strengthening the de-
centralized advisory services system, improving access to planting material, and
strengtheningthe management o f the country's irrigation infrastructure and investments.
The government is committed to developing a sustainable and well-functioning
agricultural advisory system to help farmers improve their productivity, quality o f
production, and market access. To this end, with the support o f the PRSC I1program,
the government adopted a framework for agricultural extension, research and education
and i s expected to proceed with its implementation during the PRSC 111. The
government has secured appropriate funding through the state budget for the advisory
system and i s also facilitating cost recovery by regional Agricultural Support Centers
(ASC) to cover a portion o ftheir

127.     Seeds law. The Government has made significant progress inregulating the seed
market and reduced uncontrolled seed imports and multiplication. Duringthe PRSC 11,
the Seed Law was approved and seeds certification procedures have been adopted, which
provide an adequate legal framework for development of the seed sector and are in line
with the requirements o f OECD seed schemes and the EU's seed and planting material

regime. With an appropriate legal framework inplace, under PRSC 111, the govemment
will continue to develop supporting regulations to ensure that seed certification
procedures are fully im~lemented.~~

128.     Food safety standards. Meeting food safety standards in a cost-effective way i s
essential for Armenian producers and processors to improve their competitiveness in
export markets as well as meet increasing domestic consumer preferences for food
quality standards that match standards set by imports. The government has an important
public role to play in supporting skills development, providing advisory services in
meeting food safety standards, and developing an appropriate legislative framework that
allows development o f adequate standards without imposing excessive costs on the small
and mediumenterprise sector. UnderPRSC 11, the government developed an action plan
to harmonize legislation and developing standards, and established a working group to
implement it. PRSC I11 will further support the Government in its commitment to
harmonizing its food safety legislation inline with European regulations, and in
establishing a clear timeline for adoption o f supporting regulations and a new food safety
laW.57


Developing Rural I nfra~tructure~~

129.     One o f the legacies o f the Soviet Union i s an extensive, and now decaying,
network o f rural infrastructure -- roads, telecommunications, water, and energy.
Throughout the transition period, minimal recurrent expenditure on the networks has
taken place, with a deleterious impact on their condition.          The problem has been
compounded, as in many cases, by the absence o f clear lines o f ownership and, hence,
responsibility for the different levels o f networks. The outcome is a broad mix of
network quality, ranging from a small proportion o f networks in a reasonable condition,
usually reflecting the capacity o f the local community for self-governance, to those which
are completely ineffectual. Despite receiving substantial financing from donors, there is
a high rate o f failure among rural infrastructure interventions. This is because they are
generally implemented at a local level, independently from similar, or previous,
initiatives inthe same or other areas o fthe country - a fatal defect innetwork activities.

130.     Infrastructure reforms.      The improvement o f rural infrastructure is recognized
explicitly by the government as a key element for rural poverty alleviation, acting as a
catalyst for development and enhancing access for rural communities to a broad range o f
essential social and commercial services. On the basis o f a diagnostic study prepared
under PRSC program, the government developed and initiated to carry out a rural
infrastructure strategy in order to address key reform actions necessary and take
maximum advantage o f the limited available resources. During PRSC 11, an inter-
sectoral working group, chaired by the deputy minister o f territorial administration,
prepared a time-bound action plan o f reforms in rural roads, drinking water, irrigation,
energy and telecommunication sectors emphasizing universal access, clarification o f

ownership and private-public partnerships, and the Public Service Regulatory
Commission (PSRC) developed quality standards for rural infrastructure services and
mechanisms for monitoring their quality.           The Action Plan implementation will be
supported by PRSC-I11 and with additional financing from the M C C investments and
through donor and private foundation programs. The government has taken initial steps
to implement the action plan;59 it will accelerate the implementation o f the action plan
and will pay special attention to: (i)     classification o f communities according to clearly
defined criteria, (ii)definition o f universal access concept and development o f adequate
financing mechanisms, (iii)    delineation o f ownership and operational responsibilities, and
(iv) introduction o f simplifiedstandards andnew technology for rural infrastructure.

Expected Results

131.    A rural economy on the path of modernization will see, by 2007/08, an
acceleration in productivity growth and cost recovery in areas served by extension
services and an increase in farmers access to advisory services and using recommended
practices. Farm output will benefit by raised standards in seed quality, and with the
development of food safety standards, share o f agricultural products tested and certified
would significantly rise.     The shift in emphasis in infrastructure services to the rural
economy with associated tilt in donor financing will result in a convergence o f quality
standards inutilities throughout the country.60

                   VI.       IMPACT OF REFORMS ON POVERTY^^

132.     The analysis suggests that sustaining high rates o f growth will remain decisive
factor for continued poverty reduction in Armenia with macroeconomic stability and
reforms stimulating private investment being the central part o f the Government's
poverty reduction agenda. The government can affect the poverty reduction in two main
areas: (i)  reforms that sustain and diversify sources o f growth, including the measures that
encourage incomes of the poorest households, and (ii)reforms that strengthen public
transfer programs and improve public sector delivery. An attempt has been made to
review the potential links of the PRSC supported programs to the poverty reduction and
simulate the PRSC supported reform impact.

 133.    Armenia needs to generate growth in excess o f 5 percent annually to be able to
cut poverty to 25 percent and reduce extreme poverty to 2.6 percent by 2010, assuming
broadly unchanged income distribution.

134.       The key variable underpinning poverty reduction projections is private
consumption, which i s projected to grow by about 5 percent a year between 2006 and
2010. Assumingthat households inall parts o f the income distribution benefit uniformly,
poverty i s projected to fall from 34.9 percent estimated in 2004 to 25 percent in 2010, or
by about 0.3 million people. This impliesa yearly decline o f around 7 percent or a cut in
the poverty rate o f close to 2 percentage points every year for the 2005-2010 period
(Table 5).

 135.      Growth will continue be channeled to the households through multiple sources
increasing both factor and non-factor income. Strong growth in factor income from both
labor and capital will be accompanied by consistent improvement in public transfer
programs. The country will also continue to depend on remittances but to a lesser extent
as the foreign direct investment as well as portfolio investment as opposed to the private
transfers will become more important drivers of economic growth. Domestic savings will
continue to grow. Such multiplicity o f income sources will benefit various types o f
households and resulted inbroad based poverty reduction as well as reduce the economic
vulnerability o f Armenian population.

                               VII.      THE BANK GROUP STRATEGY

Lessons Learned

 136.      The main sources o f lessons from the recent past are: (i)the implementation
completion report of the Fifth Structural Adjustment Credit (SACS) Project (2004); (ii)
OED's Country Assistance Evaluation (2004); and (iii)the region's CAS Completion
Report (2004).            Key lessons that arise and are reflected in the design o f the PRSC
program are:


           0     The need to pay more explicit attention to ensuring broad access to the
                 beneJits of growth, given some disparity between high growth and poverty
                reduction.          The PRSC operations are built upon strengthening the
                transmission channels o f growth to poverty reduction (the linkages between

                                             45


           poverty and policy actions are discussed above; see also Annex 4).
           Furthermore, the AAA agenda, including studies o fthe labor market, has been
           geared precisely towards growth-poverty linkages.        Recent data show a
           substantial narrowing o f the gap betweengrowth and poverty reduction.

           Best results were achieved when IDA was able to exploit the synergies
           between well-sequenced analytical work and lending and when it was able to
           leverage other donor support. The PRSC actions are based on economic and
           sector studies as well as policy work underlying sector operations, e.g., in
           competition policy, trade in services, efficiency and equity effects o f possible
           changes in the tax system, social protection, education, health, rural
           infrastructure, the agriculture sector reforms. The Bank has actively sought to
           assist the authorities obtain donor financing (e.g., the Millennium Challenge
           Account) and technical assistance. In PRSC-supported activities, Armenia
           has benefitedfrom a number o f donor trust funds, notably the Japanese PHRD
           grant. Donor policy advice and technical assistance complementarities will
           remain vital to the success o f the PRSC program throughout the next three
           years.

           Monitoring instruments and incorporating feedback play a vital role in the
           design and implementation of an effective reform program. The design and
           implementation o f the reform program benefited substantiality from the use o f
           monitoring instruments. The Government closely monitored and evaluated
           prior adjustment operations through periodic surveys and assessments. This
           M&E process significantly improved the effectiveness o f supervisi.on and
           provided insights for the design o f structural reforms, which are supported
           underthe PRSC.

Linkages to the CAS

137.   The PRSC program i s closely aligned to the CAS, inboth substance and timing.
The objectives of the Bank Group's FY05-08 CAS for Armenia are to help: (i)         promote
private sector growth by strengthening the financial sector, improving public sector
management, and reducing infrastructure bottlenecks; (ii)  makegrowth more pro-poor by
improving the labor market, promoting a more dynamic rural economy, and making
social assistance more effective; and (iii)reduce non-income dimensions o f poverty
through better access to education, health and basic infrastructure services. The PRSC
program supports each o f the above objectives through policy reforms that complement
the IDA project portfolio and is synchronized with the FY05-08 CAS cycle. The PRSC
program i s also aligned to the MTEF for 2005-07 and i s closely coordinated with the
IMF's PovertyReduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).

138.   Other features o fthe CAS that are embodied inthe PRSC program are:

           Maintenance of the reform momentum. Presenting credits to the Board
           only upon complete fulfillment o f actions agreed between the authorities and

                                            46


           the Bank and o f triggers for subsequent PRSCs helps (i) incentives for
                                                                    provide
           continued reforms; (ii)guard against slippages; and (iii)condition future
           PRSCs to the buildup o fresults from policy and institutional actions taken.


        0  Promotion of government and societal ownership. The PRSCs help build
           strong ownership of the reform agenda by fostering an extensive consultative
           process within the government, the private sector, and civil society inorder to
           ensure wide societal ownership.


        0  Monitoring of the policy and institutional environment. The PRSC
           program represents a central vehicle for supporting and monitoring country
           performance in key policy and institutional areas. If Armenia makes further
           improvements in public sector management - as measured by a strong
           Performance inraising the tax to GDP ratio, satisfactory progress with reform
           o f the civil service (being addressed by the IDA-public sector modernization
           credit), and advanced reforms in education and health sectors (being
           addressed in the PRSC-supported program) -- it will improve its standing in
           the IDA perfonnance-based allocation system and become eligible for
           potentially higher IDA allocations inFY07-08.


        0  Establishment of potential IBRD creditworthiness. PRSC supported
           reforms are also closely linked to potential IBRD lending towards the end o f
           the current CAS cycle ifcreditworthiness is attained. Qualification for IBRD
           lending would require, inter alia, sound macro-economic performance,
           sustained progress in economic, fiscal and financial reform, improvements in
           the business and financial climate leading to steady private sector growth, and
           reduced reliance on preferred creditors to satisfy financing needs. Preparing
           the way for IBRD lending is particularly important given Armenia's rapidly
           rising income per head, which could lead to a blend(IDA and IBRD) status in
           the next CAS period.

Linkages to Other Bank Operations

139.    There is a strong complementarily between the PRSC program and the Bank's
lending activities (Table 6). The PRSC program and the Bank's lending portfolio are
mutually reinforcing. For example, the Judicial Reform Project supports the PRSC goal
o f strengthening governance and enhancing the investment climate by helping establish
an independent, accessible, and efficient judiciary. Conversely, the PRSC supports
achievement o f Public Sector Modernization Project and the Judicial Reform Project's
objectives by strengthening the institutional capacity to implement reforms in internal
and external audits and electronic procurement.           Likewise, the PRSC sharpens
competition and enterprise property rights, thereby adding to the effectiveness o f the
Enterprise Incubator and Investment and Export Facilitation Projects, which are
addressing important constraints to private sector development.      In strengthening the
mitigation o f social and environment risks, the PRSC program provides the incentives
and means for policy reforms and rationalization in institutions in education, health and

                                               47


social protection, and inenvironment - thus complementing the investment operations in
these sectors which provide resources for capacity building. Similarly, with regard to
modernization o f the rural economy, the proposed PRSC provides the policy reform
support for a number o finvestmentoperations inthese areas.

Linkages with Analytical and Advisory Sewices

140.     Following best practice from the past, the preparation o f the PRSC program has
been informed by a range o f economic and sector work, including the country economic
memorandum (2005), growth study (2002), the public expenditure review (2003), a range
of sector work, and Bank analysis o f the PRSP and the associated MTEF. The current

                                               48


and near term AAA program includes a Programmatic PER on current budgeting, health
and infrastructure and a note on customs administration, which support the PRSC pillar
on macroeconomic management and governance.                  A civil aviation Study, business
surveys, and a FIAS update support the pillar on competition and private sector
development. Inthe social sectors, an updated poverty analysis, a study on labor market
dynamics, a social protection study, and a review and assessment o f the family poverty
benefits will support the human development pillar. A rural economy strategy study and
a rural infrastructure study will aim to further progress inmodernizing the rural economy.
The Bank's analytical work will be central to the policy dialogue, monitoring policy
design, and defining the policy details o f the subsequent PRSC. AAA work that supports
components o f the PRSC program is summarized inTable 7.

Linkages to Partners

141.    Inthe context o fthe preparation and implementation ofthe PRSP, the government
has developed an active role in coordinating the large number o f donor programs. The
highdegree o fdonor support for the PRSP is notable; bothdonor technical assistance and
donor financing i s framed in the PRSP context. For example, proposals being currently
developed for MCC funding are based on the PRSP.

142.    The IMF PRGF, approved by its Executive Board inMay 2005, supports growth
andpoverty reduction objectives through measures aimed at strengthening public finance,
maintaining a monetary policy consistent with price stability, and supporting financial
sector development. The PRGF-supported program is consistent with the PRSP and the
PRSC and i s on track. The Executive Board considered the first review o f the PRGF on
November 15, 2005, thereby making available a disbursement o f SDR3.28million and
bringing the accumulated disbursements to SDR6.56 million (28 percent o f the total
PRGF). The IMF further supports the PRSC agenda through a variety o f technical
assistance and analysis activities, particularly intax and customs administration.

143.    UNDP has a program helping the government develop systems to monitor
development results. It also assists inimproving delivery o fpublic services at central and
local levels, including governance, judicial reform, local government strengthening and
improvement o f social protection administration.               UNICEF is assisting with the
development o f pre-school education. A variety o f other UNagencies support PRSC and
other Bank project activities in the areas of environmental management, renewable
energydevelopment and inprimary and public healthprograms.

                                             50


144.    USAID focuses primarily on public sector management and private sector
development. To improve central government functions, a major program to improve tax
and customs administration, and to strengthen the bar and judiciary; improve public
sector accounting; improve the transparency o f national accounts, and strengthen the
payment and accounting systems for healthcare are under implementation. USAID i s
helping private sector development improving access to finance and improving the
capacity o f small and medium sized enterprises, and i s currently designing a program o f
additional support to private enterprise. Both USAID and MCC are strongly supportive
of Bank objectives o f improving the financial strengthand sustainability o f electricity and
drinkingwater utilities and the country's irrigation system.

145.    The EU provides financial assistance for macro-economic management, as well
as technical assistance to improve public administration, particularly tax and customs
administration, and has detailed programs to help improve local government in two
marzes (counties). The EUhas a private sector development program, and also operates
a Food Security Program, which essentially offers technical assistance to the Ministry o f
Agriculture. DfID focuses on major programs on public sector reform and on integrated
regional development intwo marzes. It has supported both the PRSP and MTEFprocess,
including through initiatives to develop marz level poverty reduction strategies inthe two
poorest marzes. KfW routes funds through the central bank to support micro-finance
lendingby four commercial banks and is also assisting inthe provision o f drinking water
intwo major cities.

146.    In summary, the Bank is the lead partner on the governance agenda, with two
key bilaterals (UK, US) and the EUplaying an important role. The Bank shares with the
Fundresponsibility for advice on macroeconomic policies and structural reforms intaxes,
as well as in financial sector reforms, where USAIDhas also been prominent. The Bank
is also the lead advisor on reforms in sharpeningcompetition, helping devise policies on
liberalizing trade and utility services, removing barriers to investment and enterprise and
developing creditor rights. The Bank i s also the leadpartner insocial sector reforms, but
in certain aspects of these reforms the UN agencies have played a notable role as has
DBD. In the dialogue on environment and the rural economy, the Bank has forged
partnerships with Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) (forestry), US
government agencies (agriculture), EU (food security), IFAD (irrigation policy) and UN
agencies (crop development, crisis management, and work for food programs).

                            VIII. THE PROPOSEDCREDIT

Description of the Operation

147.    To implement reforms underlying the PRSP, a series o f three annual PRSCs, all
single tranche operations, will support policy and institutional reforms o f the PRSP. The
third will be presentedto the Board upon satisfaction of the policy action measures that
have been identified and are presented in Annex 2 and in the letter o f development
policy.

                                           51


148.   The proposed credit will support measures to expand the public provision o f basic
education and health, and will improve equitability o f access to those services, especially
for the poor.    It will also expand employment opportunities and increase incomes,
through reforms to strengthen the business environment for private sector development
and improve competitiveness,       promote the shift to a more specialized and
commercialized agriculture, broaden the reach o f the financial sector and the services it
offers, and promote the development o f internal market access and Armenia's
internationaltrade.

149.   The second PRSC prior actions for Board approval have all been met, with the
noted modifications to the conditions inthe areas o f customs reforms and liberalization o f
international aviation services. The PRSC supported program and triggers for Board
presentation o f the third PRSC have been identified and are elaborated in the letter o f
development policy and in the policy and institutional reform matrix underlying the
operation. The matrix and letter o f development policy provide a coherent and unified
framework for coordination o f different ministries and agencies. They also provide the
government instruments for continuous development o f policy reforms and institutional
measures and monitoring implementation progress and the Bank instruments to conduct
policy dialogue with the government.

Credit Administration

150.    Borrower, Credit Amount and Tranching. The Borrower will bethe Republic
o f Armenia. Upon effectiveness o f the Development Credit Agreement, expected in the
first quarter o f 2006, the proposed single-tranche credit o f SDR14.1 million (US$20
million equivalent) will be made to the Republic o f Armenia, represented by the Ministry
o f Finance and Economy (MOFE). Provision o f a legal opinion by Armenia that it has
followed its laws and procedures for the ratification o f the credit agreement, will be the
effectiveness condition. The proposed credit will be on standard IDA terms, including
40-year maturity and a 10-year grace period. Over next year, one additional PRSC i s
envisioned to support implementation o f the PRSP.

Fiduciary Arrangements

151. The Bank has extended knowledge o f the country's Public Financial Management
(PFM). Public Expenditure Reviews of 2002 and 2005 have provided recommendations
to improve the budget management system. A Country Financial Management
Assessment (CFAA) was prepared in2004. The report notes the impressive achievements
in the period since independence, and supports the ambitious plans to further improve
budgeting, accounting, and develop modem treasury and internal control systems. The
CFAA also urges the government to reinforce its oversight o f the public financial
management reform effort as a key condition to succeed with this ambitious program.
The CFAA also concludes that managers in all sectors and levels o f the administration
need to be better informed about the key components o f the new public financial
management reforms (PFM), including budgeting, accounting and reporting, and internal
and external audits. CFAA has noted the significant commitment o f senior government
officials to reform the basic systems o f financial accountability. At this time the CFAA
assesses the overall fiduciary risk as significant, with further efforts and capacity building
requiredinorder to institutionalize these reforms.

                                             56


152.    A Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR) was finalized and disseminated to
the Government in October 2004. The Government confirmed its commitment to
implement the CPAR Action Plan, specifically in the areas o f (i)improvement o f
legislative framework and strengtheningcapacities, (ii) procurement decentralization, and
(iii)introduction o f system o f electronic procurements. Since that time the Government
has made certain progress in the initial implementation o f the CPAR action plan. In
particular, a new Law on Public Procurement was enacted on January 1, 2005 which has
decentralized procurement to the line Ministries. The website o f the public procurement
Authorized Body has been established (www.procurement.am) which provides
information on biddingopportunities and contract awards. Draft Government Decree on
implementation o f e-procurement has been prepared and commented by the Bank for
further improvement. The technical assistance for introduction and implementation o f
the e-procurement program i s beingprovided through a combination o f support under the
World Bank IDF grant on public procurement, World Bank PSMP project, support from
USAID and other donors, and in light o f experience with e-procurement in other
countries.

Disbursement and Auditing Arrangements

153.    The Bank will disburse the Credit which will be deposited in the MOFE's US$
account in the Central Bank o f Armenia, this account being available for budget
financing. The Borrower shall ensure that upon deposit o f the proceeds o f the Credit into
said account, an equivalent amount will be credited in the Borrower's budget
management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank, that is: the MOFE's budget
account will be credited with the dram equivalent at the official exchange rate within 30
days. The foreign exchange proceeds o f the proposed PRSC will be sold by the CBA or
heldinreserves, inaccordance with the objectives o fmonetarypolicy.

154.    The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign
currency account and credited to the budget management system. If, after the proceeds
are deposited in the CBA account, the proceeds o f the Credit are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Development Credit Agreement, the Bank will require the
Borrower to promptly, upon notice from the Bank, refund an amount equal to the amount
o f said payment to the Bank. Amounts refundedto the Bank upon such request shall be
cancelled. The administrationo f the Credit will be the responsibility o fthe MOFE.

155.    The IMF conducted a safeguard assessment in 2002, which was updated in 2005
with the IMF-monitored plan to deal with identified control weaknesses agreed to be
implementedby the Central Bank o f Armenia (CBA). Ingeneral, the procedures used by
the CBA for sales o f its foreign exchange are viewed as transparent and the safeguards
have beenrecognized as being adequate. The CBA adopted the IAS in 1996 and has been
audited by internationally recognized auditing firms.      The independent audit o f the
Central Bank's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 was
conducted by Grant Thornton International (France), and clean (unqualified) opinion was
issued on the those financial statements.

                                            57


156.    Considering the Bank's knowledge o f the public finance management systems
and the ongoing improvements o f these systems, considering the recent positive
assessment of the CBA made by IMF, and the previous audit o f deposit account under
PRSC-I was unqualified and acceptable to the Bank, no audit will be necessary o f the
deposit account. The closing date o fthe proposed credit will be June 30,2007.

157.    Implementation. The government continues to take the lead in preparing the
PRSC policy matrix and will coordinate its implementation along the PRSP
Implementation Action Plan approved in January 22, 2004, in close consultation with
stakeholders, civil society, trade unions, business groups, NGOs, the Church, local
governments, and the donor community.         The Ministry o f Economy and Finance i s
responsible for coordinating the government's inputs and actions from all the relevant
ministries and agencies inimplementingthe PRSC action plans. Several working groups
will review, prepare, and follow up on implementationo f the action plans and timetables.
The government will closely monitor and evaluate through periodic surveys and
assessments implementation o f the PRSC in the context o f the overall monitoring o f the
PRSP process, usinga set o fperformance indicators.

Environmental Aspects

158.    The PRSC supports several policy and institutional reforms in the environment
and forestry sector by focusing on environmental supervision, national forest policy,
combating illegal     logging,   establishing  community      forestry, and institutional
restructuring in the forestry sector. Key government policies and programs that are
addressed through the PRSC cover (i)    environmental impact assessment and supervision
and (ii) policy and institutional reforms in the forest sector. These actions are partially
supported by the ongoing Natural Resources Management and Poverty Reduction Project
(NRMPRP), which aims to support sustainable natural resource management in
mountainous areas o f Armenia, where degradation o f natural resources is reaching a
critical point. Actions under the PRSC are expected to have a substantial positive impact
on environmental management. Key environmental risks in the country are expected to
be reduced by creation o f community forestry programs and reduction o f illegal logging,
and improvement inwater supply.

159.     The impact o f PRSC supported forestry reforms in Armenia i s likely to have a
substantial impact on sustainable livelihoods. Forests serve as the safety nets for rural
population. Forests served as safety net during the period o f harsh economic and energy
crises in early 1990s.Wild food and fuel-wood were by far the two most important forest
products harvested from forests. After the crises, the commercial timber harvest
continued to be the major challenge for the forests. The over-exploitation o f forests
continues, which will result in considerable negative impact o f sustainable livelihoods in
Armenia. To avoid degradation o f its already scarce forest resources, Armenia must
maintain efficient forest management institutions. The Government is committed to
rehabilitation and sustainable management o f forests as affirmed by its commitment to
PRSC actions, increased forestry budget allocations, and progress toward institutional
reforms.

Risks

160.   The proposed credit i s subject to several risks. First, government capacity and
willingness to implement reforms that have been demonstrated over PRSCs Iand I1will
have to be maintained; moreover, there i s some risk o f reform fatigue as the reform
agendabegins to enter into difficult terrain (for example, ingovernance and infrastructure
reforms). Capacity is being strengthened through reforms and by the active engagement
of donors; and the President o f the Republic as well as the government continues to show
determination inimplementingthe PRSP program. The wide participation through which
the PRSP was prepared an d is being updated and the continuing involvement o f civic
organs inits implementation offer some protection against reform fatigue; inaddition, the
authorities have stepped up the local dialogue, explanation and dissemination to
stakeholders and civil society, especially inrural areas.

161.   A second risk relates to exogenous economic shocks reflecting reduction in
worker remittances, export earnings, remittances by the Armenian diaspora, or a
substantial energy supply or commodity price shock.         Shocks could also stem from
natural disasters or result from instability in the non-oil segment o f international
commodity markets. Clearly, each will have to be addressed in its own way, possibly
necessitating a change in the content o f future PRSP updates and the use of other Bank
instrumentsas envisaged inthe CAS.

162.   A final risk arises from regional instability.       Clearly, Armenia's continued
economic progress i s linked to growth and neighborly cooperation with adjacent states,
two o f which provide critical energy and transport links. A resolution o f the Nagorno
Karabakh conflict and an opening o f the borders with two neighboring states would raise
confidence in economic prospect.

OF THEPRIME    MINISTER
      REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA




                                                                        Annex I


      Letter of Development Policy
           Republic of Armenia


                Dear Mr Wolfowitz,

       1.       The Government o f the Republic o fArmenia continues to carry out its medium-
      term economic reform program aimed at reducing poverty, lowering inequality and
      making progress inhuman development. The Government will build on its successful
       achievement o f poverty reduction and implementation o f economic policy, and in the
      medium-term sustain higheconomic growth with low level o f inflation. T o achieve this,
       the Government will ensure full commitment to the objectives o f sustaining
       macroeconomic stability, structural reforms and liberal economic policies.

       2.       The government remains fully committed to the reform measures supported under
       the first Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC), as specified inthe Letter of
       Development Policy o f October 18, 2004. Inthis Letter, we describe the implementation
       progress o f PRSC2-supported reforms and express our firm determination to undertake
       the PRSC3-supportedreformprogram, which is rootedinour Poverty ReductionStrategy
       Paper (PRSP).

                            Implementation of Poverty Reduction Strategy

       3.  `    As reflected inour PRSP and inits first and second progress reports for the period
       August 2003 to end-June 2005, sustainedpovertyreduction remains the mainpillar o f our
       economic strategy. Given the Government's commitment to broadparticipatoryprocess
       inpreparationandimplementation of the PRSP, we approved the PRSP implementation
       action plan, and made considerable advances inmonitoring and evaluation o f the plan, as
       well as integration of the PRSP priorities inthe Medium Term Expenditure Framework
       (MTEF)and the annualbudgetprocess. We have achieved stronger than anticipated
       poverty reduction, economic performance and social service delivery. At the same time,
       we recognize a number of areas where greater efforts will be required for their resolution,

includingfurther improvement o f the business environment, continuing to implement tax
and customs reforms, deepening social sector reforms to raise quality of services, and      i



strengthening rural development and provision o f infrastructure and social services.
These and other poverty reductionmeasuresconstitute our core reformprogramthat is
beingsupportedby IDA through its second and thirdPRSC and the IMFPoverty
Reductionand Growth Facility (PRGF).

                                 Macroeconomic Stability

4.      We are pleasedto note that in2004, the economic results achieved inArmenia
outperformed the PRSP and 2005-07 MTEFtargets. Real GDP increased by 10.1
percent, inflation was 2 percent andcentral government fiscal deficit was confinedto 1.7
percento f GDP. At the end o f 2004, Armenia recoveredits pre-transition real GDP level.
The strong economic performance has continued duringthe first ten months o f 2005, with
GDP growth o f 12.2percent and an average inflationrate o f 0.8 percent comparedwith
the same periodthe previous year. We expect the positive economic trendto continue in
the remaining months o f2005 with economic growth amounting to around 11percentby
the end of the year. We are confident that this positivetrendwill continue inthe
medium-tern with real growth o f at least 7.5 percent, inflationrate o f up to 3 percent in
2006, and an annual growth o f at least 6 percent and inflation rate o f up to 3 percent for
2007-08.

 5.     With World Bank and IMFsupport, we intendto maintaina strong track recordo f
reforms and economic management inorder to sustain gross investment at a level o f over
 26 percent o f GDP inthe medium-term. Since a robust private sector investment will
play a major role inthis process, we are determined to continue placing a highpriority on
 the development of a more dynamic and competitive private sector, andparticularly
 promoting a better business climate, improving the level and efficiency o f social sector
 expenditures, as well as reducing corruption. We will continue to give a central position
 to private sector development and export promotion as the main drivingforce for
 sustainable growth. We plan to maintain the current account deficit at about 4 percent o f
 GDP, while keepingthe CBA's gross external reserves at a level o f not less than four
 months o f import cover.

 6.      Based on 2006-08 MTEF,the 2006 budgetprepared by the Government and
 approvedby the Parliament places a highpriority to improving revenue mobilization to
 finance poverty reduction expenditures. We aimto have more focused approaches to
 strengtheningtax and customs administrations, and achieve an increase o f 0.6 percentage
 points intax revenues to GDPratio compared with the revised2005 revenue target. As
 reflected inour 2006-08 MTEF, the 2006 budget will allocate increasedresources to
 health, education, social transfers and civil servants' salaries. We will continue to
 implementsuch fiscal policy as a result o fwhich tax revenues will be at about 16.0
 percent o f GDP by 2008. We are confident that, inline with the PRSP and 2006-08         2


                                                2

MTEF, we will be successful inlimitingthe overall annualbudget deficits to a range o f
2-3 percent o f GDP and inconsiderably reducing the quasi-fiscal deficits inthe
infrastructure sector. Armenia's external debt profile has improvedconsiderably in
recent years with the share o f non-concessional external debt declining, thus
strengthening greatly our prospects for creditworthiness. The net present value o f
external debt to exports ratio i s expected to decline from 60 percent in2004 to around 56
percentin2008.

                        ImprovingTax and CustomsAdministrations

7.       The Government has introduced priority reform measures intax and customs
administrations inorder to address some of the weaknesses intax revenue collection. In
the area o f tax administration, we have focused on three main areas. First, we
strengthenedthe operation o f the LargeTax Payers Unit (LTPU) and improved the unit's
audit capacity by mergingthe central audit department into LTPU. We have increased the
number o f days to conclude an audit and adopted an implementationplanto introduce
additional reforms inthe LTPU. Second, we have made serious efforts to reduce the
stock o f tax arrears and made satisfactory progress inreaching the agreed targets with the
World Bank. Third, we have placed a highpriority upon an assessment o f the nature and
composition o f the stock o f VAT refunds claims to exporters and adopted a quantitative
target to reduce the stock o f VAT refundsowed to exporters. We ensured that no
additional VAT arrears were incurredto exporters.

8.        The Government is determinedto address the remaining deficiencies and
weaknesses inthe tax administrations by focusing on four main areas. First, we plan to
 adhere to the reforms o f LTPU and the implementation o f its action plan. The action plan
 focuses on legislative initiatives to facilitate effective tax audits and to the development
 o f personnel, institutional and administrative infrastructures in support o f LTPU. The
 plan introduces other measures to further strengthen the LTPU's audit functions,
 including introduction an annual audit plan based on risk classification, priorities and
 targets. Second, inorder to reduce direct contacts betweentax collectors and taxpayers
 and foster timely tax payments, we have adopted a strategy for self-assessment o f tax
 system and are determined to implement it. Third, we will buildupon the achievements
 so far inreducing the stock o f tax arrears and aim at making hrther progress according to
 a quantitative plan agreed with the World Bank. We are determinedto support and
 facilitate the work o f the highlevel staff o f accountants and lawyers, to support proper
 collection o f arrears, particularly from the 100largest taxpayers. Finally, we will
 continue our plan o f permittingno build up o f fresh VAT refunds to exporters and adhere
 to the agreed quantitative targets with the World Bank on further reductionof stock o f
 VAT arrears to exporters.

 9.       The Government has taken some key steps instrengtheningcustoms
 administration infour main areas. First, we initiatedimplementation o f the self-         2


                                                  3

declaration and the Direct Trade Input(DTI) facility, with which we reduce the interface
between importers and customs brokers with customs officials and encourage an
increasing number o f customs brokers and companies becoming qualified to use the
computerized self-declaration systems. Although implementation o f the ASYCUDA
systemcontinued, there are deficiencies inthis area andwe planto take corrective
actions. Second, we initiated introduction o f automaticity inselectivity. Third, we
continued to make satisfactory progress instrengtheningthe post-clearance unit.It's staff
and training were increased. Finally, the share o f numberimports declarations with
approved customs value at transaction prices continues to increase. By the endbecember
2005 it will be increased by 5 percent and satisfactory progress will be made inthis area
according with an agreed programwith the World Bank.

10.     The Government plans the following customs administration reforms inthe four
areas mentionedabove. First,the operation o f DTIwill be improved, with automatic
registration, acceptance, and selectivity by the ASYCUDA system. Inthe coming months
we will carry out an assessment o f the impact o f the introduced Direct Trader Input
Facilities and inthe event o f meeting the criteria discussed inadvance, the Direct Trader
InputFacilities will be introducedinAraratian and Zvartnots customs houses from April
1, 2006. Second, introduction o f a green channel based on the criteria agreed with the
World Bank will be continued. For this purpose we particularly plan to introduce monthly
statistics on green, yellow and red channels, violations and identifications and use the
findings o f analysis of these reports both for improvingriskprofiles and extendingthe
systemto other customs houses. Third, it i s planned to further expand the post-clearance
unit and strengthen the capacities o f the unit inorder to increase the efficiency o f
performance o f its statutory functions.

                          ImprovingBudget ManagementSystems

 11.     The Government has strengthenedthe budget management systems and has
effectively integrated the MTEF into the annual budgets to improve the links between
polices and expenditure allocations for 2004- 06 annual budgets. The Government has
made considerable progress in other areas o f development o f the budget management
systemand is firmly determined to deepen its efforts made to date inthese areas.

 12.     On public sector accounting standards, the quality o f fiscal information has
improved. A comprehensive chart o f accounts and reporting standards, incompliance
with the GFS2001 principles, as well as the cashbasedInternational Public Sector
Accounting Standards (IPSAS) with detailed implementation manuals, was developed.
We intendto use the new chart o f accounts inall ministries from January 2007. We also
developed an action plan on implementationo f the cash based IPSAS with specific steps
to transition to accrual basedprinciples and intend to implement it in2005-06.




                                                4

13.     With regardto programbudgeting, the Governmenthas madenotable progress in
introducingthose principles at budget preparation stage by piloting four social sector
ministries (MoLSP, MoES, MoH, and MoC). This has facilitated a more effective
development o f sector expenditure strategies and a closer linkingbetweenexpenditures
and performance indicators. The pilotedministries have redefined program structures
and budget classification to provide an improvedbase for budget allocation. The state
budget law for 2005 reflectedthe budget for MoLSP according to the redefinedprogram
classification. The Government continued this practice and publishedprograms for all
other three pilot ministries together with their program performance indicators i s an
attachment to the Law on 2006 State Budget.The Government i s determined to deepen
reforms inthis area, and will broaden its focus to ensure compliance o f budget execution
and reportingprocedures with programbudgetingrequirements. This will provide an
effective integration o f budgeting, strategic planning, Performance and accountability
issues.

14.      The Government places importance on the policy ofrewarding throughwages and
bonuses for implementation o f which a strategy will be developed. The strategy will
enable to introduce a systemo f staff performance appraisal to support a meritbasedbasic
wage and bonus system.

 15.     The Government made considerable progress infinancial reporting of the State
Non-Commercial Organizations (SNCOs), collected and summarized financial reports on
planned income and expenditures and cash flow o f about 1800 of SNCOs in2004. The
Government also adopted a strategy on sanctions for non-compliance with financial
reporting for SNCOs. The strategy sets out stages for holding liable, which are required
to support the reporting process, and includes provisions for breachingreporting
 deadlines, improper submission o f reports and necessary safeguards for misuse o f public
 resources. We are determined to implementthis strategy and will strengthen the MOEF's
 capacity to improve SNCOs monitoring process, and ifnecessary, to clarify the definition
 o f SNCOs through legislative amendments and establishing an appropriate reporting
 framework, if necessary.

 16.     The Government remains committedto strengtheningthe institutional
 arrangements for internal audits. On internal audits, we have made satisfactory progress
 to implement the action plan to improve internal audits within the executive branch o f the
 government. The MOEF has also strengthenedits focus on internal audits and increased
 its role in evaluation o f the quality o f internal audit arrangements. A separate unit has
 been assigned inthe MOEF to develop the methodology o f internal audit arrangements,
 training and certification requirements. Other measures, including piloting introduction
 o f new internal audit standards and operating procedures are expected to be carried out
 according to an agreed timetable.

                                 Liberalization in Key Services


                                                  5

17.     The Government reformprogramwill continue to focus on a range o f high
priority measures to improve competition inthe Armenian economy, particularlyinthose
sectors involved inimports and distribution. The Government medium-termreform
program continues to focus on strengtheningprivate sector competitionby:


        0   Improving the competition policy;

        0   Improvingpublic sector utilities;

        0   Strengthening competition inrailways, air services and telecommunications
            sectors;

        0   Improving the reliability financial reporting by enterprises; and

        0   Advancing the legislative frameworks for the labor market, electronic
            signature and documentation and standards and metrological system.


18.     Respondingto customer requests, assessments and recommendations by
individual aviation companies on market conditions and prospects, the Government will
adopt a flexible and liberal position. Discussing with the Armenian air carriage company
elements o f liberalizationwill be applied to the foreign air carriage company (e.g. 5th
level liberty) incases, where it i s possible to show expectednet economic benefits for the
Armenian aviation market and Armenia ingeneral.

19.     The same approachwill also be applied inconducting policies for cargo carriage,
moreover, negotiations will be held to attract cargo carriage companies to the Armenian
aviation market and ifnecessary, given the current condition o f cargo carriage we will
also welcome assigned additional cargo carriage companies through liberal arrangements
with and approaches to individual destinations or individual countries.

20.     As long as the contract with Armavia is effective, it is expected that Annavia will
ensure performance on its obligations and the Government will keep the rights provided
to Armavia under the contract. The Government will work with Armavia to ensure
implementation o f future policy.

21,     The Government accepts that the current railway system i s not financially
sustainable and needs substantial investments inorder to become a safe and attractive
means o f railway transportation. A study on railways restructuring has been conducted,
which will provide the Government with ways to increase the financial stability,
commercialisation, transparency and accountability o f railways and attracting private
investment. Upon completion o f the study the Government will weigh restructuring
options and choose one that will enable to bringrailways to sustainable financial
condition through reliable financial projections. This will surely be such a choice, which

                                                                                          A




                                                6

will ensure attractive services to consumers fromcommercial perspective make railway
services more competitive, encourage good management and private sector participation.

22.      Concerningutility reforms, the Public Services Regulatory Commission(PSRC)
has made considerable progress inimprovingutilities regulatory framework by: (i)
adopting service quality indicators for the electricity sector inline with the provision o f
the license agreement o f the power distribution company, (ii)   publishingquarterly
financial performance o f regulated drinkingwater and energy companies, (iii)     starting
quarterly internet publication of the financial performance o f the regulatedirrigation
companies and (iv) adopting market rules on trading rules, independent audit, and
dispatching.


23.      The PSRC will continue filling the regulatory gaps inthe energy, water and
telecommunication sectors, and i s determined to: (i)   safeguardthe appropriate application
o f the introducedquality monitoringsystem inthe energy sector, publishservice quality
data on the Commission's website by the end o f the quarter following the reporting
quarter, conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis (the findings o f which should also
bepublished on the website) and set baseline service delivery indicators, minimum
service quality standards as o f that date inorder to provide clarifications to consumers on
frequency and lengtho f outages; (ii)   develop and introduce forms, for collecting service
quality data from drinkingwater sector companies and define registers for registering
service quality data and ensure their introduction indrinking water sector companies and
publishdata on the Commissions website starting from the thirdquarter in2006 ,(iii)
develop a statement on telecommunications regulatory policy specifying how the
legislation will be implemented inorder to enhance maximumcompetition and take into
account the obligations assumed under the license of Armentel JV. The PSRC intends to
prepare the draft policy statement by the end o f the third quarter o f 2006, and holdpublic
discussions o f the draft, approve the policyandpublishit inthe fourth quarter o f 2006.
WB will make available technical assistance to PSRC to support the process.

24.      With regard to reducingthe regulatory and administrative costs and inspections,
we are determinedto continue our progress. We developed an action planto improve
regulatory environment inArmenia usingthe findings o f the fourth survey. Duringpast
year, we implementeda number o f reforms inline with the action plan including:


     0   adopting the law on electronic signature,


     0   initiating measures to strengthening operations o f large tax payers unit, including
         electronic submission o f tax declaration bytax payers,


     0   eliminating the practice o f the tax authorities forcing or "persuading" companies
         to make advance payments with respect to future tax obligations,
                                                                                            $


                                                7

     0   maintaining adequate consultation with business and civil society in advance o f     *

         tax changes, wherever possible,

     0   streamlining the procedure for obtaining certificates o f origin for exporters,

     0   decreasing the number o f documentation needed for foreign trade operations.


25.       The Government i s determined to continue the progress made so far inreducing
the regulatory and administrative costs and inspections. Inthis context, we have
developed additional measures basedupon the results o f the latest survey, which was
finalized in2004, as well as the FIAS assessment o f administration process in2004.
These measures include:


     0   providing the right'incentives intax and customs administrations to establish an
         effective information exchange systembetweenthe tax and customs authorities
         and strengtheningthe practice o f producing and publishingofficial interpretations
         o f the laws and regulations andmake them available on the web on a regular
         basis,

     0   simplifyinginspectionprocedures according to criteria for selecting taxpayers
         underlying inspections conducted by the tax service so that good taxpayers may
         suffer inspections only if there i s informationabout potential fraud,

     0   ensuringpublicity o f land acquisition procedures and accessibility o f
         information for investors. Community (area) master plans and land usehoning
         schemes have been implemented for regulating issues o f targeted and efficient use
         o f land,

      0  preparing informational brochures for title registration and placing application
         forms on the Cadastre website,

      0  developing standardized application forms and informationbrochures that
         establish clear and transparent rules and regulations for site development
         processes and place the information on the planned website. Developing a new
         master planwith input o f local planning and development, management and staff.
         Developing designguidelines to illustrate the types o f development projects
         desiredinthe city, and

      0  undertaking the next business survey and developing additional recommendations
         for further improvements o f the business climate.

26.      We have increasingly become aware o f the need to develop capacities within the
public sector to systematically assess the impact o f new regulation as it goes through the
policy process. Such efforts must be carried out inparallel with the above-mentioned
initiatives aimed at reducing regulatory and administrative costs inspecific sectors. We
realise that efforts to assure high-quality regulationina coherent andcomprehensive way


                                                  8

i s key to a well-functioning business environment. Firmly embedded in a Regulatory
ReformPolicy, new initiatives would include a strengtheningo f institutions responsible
for preparing and scrutinizing regulation, as well as the adaptation o f tools such as
Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) combined with appropriate training o f officials. We
are determined to embark on such efforts as an integral part o f our ongoing reforms.

27.      We continue to attach considerable importance to adequate financial reporting by
the private sector, and are determined to improve the accounting profession, enhancing
users' knowledge of financial information, and strengtheningthe regulatory system and
the institutionalenforcement capacity. We have developed a concept paper focusing on
four major areas: improving the legal framework, updating the accounting andauditing
standards, training accountants and auditors, and developing relevant qualification. We
established several working groups with representatives from the local Association o f
Accountants and Auditorsof Armenia to develop a strategy and an actionplanbased on
the concept paper. We are determinedto moveforward with the concept paper andwill
introduce the necessary capacity buildingand training to show tangible improvements in
private sector accounting and auditing.

28.      Following adoption o f the law on electronic document and signature inDecember
2004, we adopted a number o f implementation regulations for usingelectronic documents
and digital signatures, approving and managing accreditation centers for certification of
electronic signatures. This has strengthenedthe legal framework inthis area and will
facilitate removing some o f the remainingimpediments to develop e-commerce and e-
government.




                                Entrenching Property Rights

 29.     We recognize that one o f the major challenges facing the Armenian economy is
 the highcost ofbusiness borrowingdue to the considerableriskpremium. This is
primarily due to highspreads betweenthe lendingand deposit rates. This has been due
 mainly to deficiencies inour property rights and weaknesses inthe commercialbanks'
 ability on collateral enforcement. The Government has made considerable progress in
 drafting the necessary legislationto improve the lendingenvironment through
 strengtheningthe procedures for collateral registration and foreclosure and enhancing the
 knowledge o f thejudiciary concerning commercial contracts. Specifically, we have
 adopted amendments to civil code, criminal code, civil procedure law, law on
 compulsory enforcement, and public auction law. Measures will be implemented for the
 development o f system o f title registration on real estate and movable property and
 information management. Inparticular, the Government will develop the necessary

discussing these with the World Bank will start their implementation. This will enable
courts, banks and other stakeholders to make efficient use o f the system.

                      Increasing Confidence in the Banking Sector

30.     The government places a highpriority on enhancing the public confidence inthe
banking sector though improvements inbanking supervision, and corporate governance
of banks. Concerning improvements inbanking supervision, we have developed an
action plan to improve risks management, andto amend the Law on Banks and`Banking.
A long-termplanhas been adoptedinrelationto the sequence of steps to move to Basle
2. The plan envisages actions for 2006 for buildingcredit and market risk management
capacities.

31.     The unifiedsupervision authority will start operations from the beginning o f
2006, for the effective operation o f which an action planhas been developed. The plan
also covers issues related to regulation o f insurance, pawnshop operations and other
important sectors.

32.      The government has taken the initiatives to strengthenthe corporate governance
o f the banking sector. Inthis context, a set o f amendments to the Law on Banks and
Banking was developed inconsultation with the banking community. These amendments
will provide for: (i)improved definitions and limitations on transactions among related
parties, (ii)enhanced capacity o f the CBA to take actions where a bank's organizational
structure impedesprudential supervision, and (iii)   required approval o f the shareholders'
meetingon large transactions involvingtransfers o f assets at market prices. We are
committed to ensuring that the necessary implementingregulations will be inplace and
there will be full compliance with the new law.

                            Strengthening the Insurance Sector

33.      The Government reformprogram accords an important role to development o f the
insurance sector to ensure adequate coverage o f economic and financial risks for
enterprises and households. Although the insurance sector inArmenia i s small, over the
medium-termour plan is to enhance its role inthe economy. We have developed
prudential standards inline with the new law on insurance and have set minimumcapital
requirements for insurance companies. The insurance companies will needto comply
with the prudential standards and are requiredto submit quarterly reporting and financial
statements. Inan effort to improve financial regulatory environment inArmenia, the
government has developed a concept note for transitionto a unified financial supervision.
Inthis context, it is aimedto transfer regulatory and supervisory functions ofthe
insurance inspectorate, pawnshop activities and the security commission to Central Bank
by January 2006. We are making serious efforts to ensure that the transition to the unified

                                                                                            2


                                               10

supervision body is carried out ina manner which will not adversely affect the current
supervisory capacity and functioning o f the financial market.

34.    Inthe short term, we are committedto increasingtheminimumcapital
requirementsfor the insurancecompanies to AMD 350 million, and establish an
appropriate actuarial system. Inaddition, we will ensure full compliance with the newly
adoptedprudentialregulations. Furthermore, the proposedunificationo f financial
regulatory bodies will result inmoving insurance sector into a semi-autonomous form
with reduced government interference and adequate resources to strengthenth6
regulatory body.

               Improving Social Protection and Social RiskManagement

35.    The Government recognizes the importance of an efficient, effective, well
administered and adequately funded social protectionsystemto facilitate poverty
reduction. During2005, as regards our key safety nets program, the family poverty
benefit, we have increasedresource allocation, differentiated the amount o fbenefits,
depending on social situation o fthe families andreviewedthe targeting formula. The
National Statistical office and the Ministryo f Labour and Social Issues staff are
analysing 2004 household survey data. The results o f the analysis will help to improve
the targeting formula further with corresponding changes inthe social assistance policy.

36.    We continue to give a highpriority to development on the pension system.
Development and adoption o f the Private Pensions Law i s one o f our prioritiesas an
important element o f Pension Reform Strategy. Furthermore, we are currently reviewing
our ongoing pension development strategy in the light o f steady economic growth we
have achieved duringthe last 10 years (the existing strategy was adopted almost 7 years
ago). A working group, including government agencies and financial regulators, CBA
and Security Commissionhas developed conceptual approaches to pension system. The
concept note has been agreed by the government andthe working group chaired by the
MLSP i s developing a strategy for the proposedpension system. Following adoption o f
the strategy an actionplanwill be developed and its implementation will start. We planto
complete introduction o f personal accounts o f natural persons inthe pension systemand
buildmanagement o f the state pension system on automated information flows.

37.     The Government remains committedto raisingthe livingstandards o f the poor
and vulnerable groups through improvedbasic infrastructure and social services,
complemented by buildingthe needed infrastructural capacity at the municipal level to
plan and manage public investment s and services more effectively.

38.    The Government has made a strong effort to rationalize the teaching force and to
downsize infrastructure.   Despite an initial impetus on rationalizing staff on rationalizing -
staffthe teacherlstudent ratio may still decline giventhe falling birthrate and the large
number o f small schools inremote areas. There remain significant numbers o f small
schools where the teachedstudent ratio i s quite high. The Government proposes to
emphasize the establishment o f separate highschools to serve upper grade students from
various communities. This will mean that upper grades from general secondary schools
will be amalgamated, providing a better learning environment for senior students and
more effective use o f secondary school teachers. Inaddition, school facilitiesivhich are
underutilizedare now being occupied by other groups such as pre-schools and teacher
centers. The government plans to continue increasing teacher salaries which have
already risen rapidly over the past few years. The per capita financing formula will be
reviewedinorder to ensure that it meets the needs of smaller schools, and to include a
more sophisticated weighting system.

39.     The government will continue to press for higher education reforms, will follow
up to the Bologna declaration, andhas made initiatives to carry out the reform
implementation plan. We will monitor changes to the state subsidy system to see if it
actually reaches to the poorest and will continue reviewingthe possibility for piloting
student loan scheme targeted to graduate students. Universities will also be encouraged
to switch to the course credit system. However, as financing for these reforms i s limited,
the government will seek donor assistance to providethe necessary technical inputsto the
higher education system.

40.     The Government will take steps to develop and approve standards for service
delivery inpre-school education sector.



                                            Health

41.     At present, the design and implementation of amandatory healthinsurance in
Armenia would be premature because o f the prevailing socio-economic and healthcare
labor market conditions. However, the Government has commissioned studies to assess
the socio-organizational, political and financial feasibility o f introducingvoluntary health
insurance.. Once the policy and regulatory framework for voluntary health insurance has
beenadopted, it could eventually help define the scope o fpublicly-funded healthcare
services, thus facilitatingbroadening the range o f financing options andhelpingtargeting
limitedpublic resources for healthcare towards the poor. At the same time, before
embarking on implementation o f the regulatory framework for private insurance, the
government plans to seek advice on international best practice.

42.      The low productivity o f the healthcare system and allocational inefficiencies
within the sector are the mainproblems o f the health sector reforms inArmenia. We          3


                                               12

recognize the fact that oversupply o f hospitals contractedbythe state to provide in-
patient services to population has resultedininefficient use o f public resources, unequal    -
access to services and low service quality. We have embarked upon hospital
consolidationinYerevan inorder to increase the efficiency o f healthsector public
speeding, as reflected inthe declining trendinhospital contracts from 124to 118 in2004.
The government is determinedto take significant steps to further consolidate the hospitals
and attain the productivitybenchmarks for hospital systemby 2009.

43.     We recognize that the non-communicable diseases are the leading caus'es o f
morbidity and mortality inArmenia. Eventhough life expectancy inArmenia i s among
the highest inthe former Soviet countries, the morbidity/mortalityrates onnon-
communicable diseases have beenincreasingover the last few years to become the most
worrisome threat to populationhealth. The Ministryo f Health has developed a national
strategy on combating nom-communicable diseases to address the public health threats
from the con-communicable diseases through development and implementation o f
specific priority programs on con-communicable diseases as well as through allocation o f
adequate public resources inthe health care budget.

   ReducingRisksin NaturalResourcesManagement for Sustainable Livelihoods

44.     The government i s firmly committed to strengtheningits focus on the country's
environmental challenges and has adopted and taken initial steps to implement the forest
policy and national action plan to combat illegal logging. Our reform programhas paid
special attention to the institutionalrestructuring o f the forest sector, adoption o f new
forest code, introductiono f the community forest management, and an improved forest
management planningand implementation. We are planningto establish a new and more
efficient system o f forest management by restructuring the forest institutions and
facilitating their adjustments to the changed circumstances.

45.      On establishing efficient system o fmonitoringillegal logging and forest
exploitation, the government plans to pay special attention to prompt setting-upo f the
monitoring system, its efficient operation and is ready to provide adequate funding. We
intendto establish soundmonitoringindicators to detect illegal forest activities over the
next year inclose consultation with stakeholders.

46.      We consider involvement o f communities inforest management an important step
and are determined to provide forest management rights to communities. We will also
promote community forest management and will ensure that adequate funding i s
 available for pilot implementation inseveral communities. Upon approval o f the forest
 code, we will promptly adopt the community forest related legislation.

47.     The Government has continued its support to the development o f rural areas by
focusing on farm productivity gains to sustain the livelihoods o f those dependent on
farming. Improving the functioning o f the decentralizedrural advisory services i s an
important element o f o w reformprogram andwe have allocated separate budget for such
services from 2006 onwards while at the same time have encouraged self-financing
opportunities for the Agricultural Support Centers (ASCs). The government has paid
special attention to improving the seed legal framework through approval o f a new seed
law and intends to accelerate preparation o f the supporting regulations and by-laws
ensuringthat operation o f the Armenian seedbusiness will stay at an intematidnally
recognized level.

48.     The government has given highpriority to productiono f safe food for domestic
market and compliance with the international food standards inthe export markets. In
this regard, the government has developedan actionplanfor harmonization of food
safety and phytosanitary standards with international standards and Codex Alimentarius
and will continue to give a highpriority to harmonization o f legislation andstandards.
The Government has made significant progress inveterinary fieldby adopting the new
Veterinary Law, with emphasis on private veterinary services, and instreamlining the
public veterinary inspections. The government's mediumterm programplaces a high
priority to improve legal and institutional environment for food safety by adopting a new
Food Safety Law and the supporting regulations.

                               Rural InfrastructureReform

49.     On rural infrastructure, the government developed and initiatedto carry out a
rural infrastructure strategy inorder to take maximum advantage o f the limitedavailable
resources. The Government approved the Action Plan for Implementation o f the Strategy
for Rural Infrastructure. We have taken the initial steps to implement the actionplan,
includingdevelopment o f rural gasification programandassessment o f required
investmentsfor rural gasification. We have done considerable work to ensure safety in
the energy sector, inparticular to establishthe legal framework for ensuringthe safety of
operation o f the gas systemThe Parliament has completed discussions o f the law on
State Technical Supervision inthe EnergySector and EnergyConsumption, a number o f
decrees were adopted by the Government which will support both adherence to gas safety
rules ingas consumption and also the use o f new technologies and modem gas
equipment.

50.     We shall accelerate implementation o f the action plan and will pay special
attention to: (i)classification o f communities according to clearly defined criteria, (ii)
definition of universal access concept and development o f adequate financing
mechanisms, (iii)  delineation o f ownership andoperational responsibilities, and (iv)
introduction o f simplified standards andnew technology inthe rural infrastructure.

                           ProgramMonitoring and Evaluation

52.     We are determined to monitor and evaluate the medium-termreform program to
be supportedby PRSCs through targets andbenchmarks, including those reflected inthe
attached annex to this Letter o f Development Policy. The government plans to make a
comprehensive evaluation o f the progress inthe reform program, within the context o f
the agreed reform targets, during2005-07 to assess the needfor revisedprioriiies. We
are fully committed to implementingeffectively, consistently, and on a timely basis our
economic reform programbasedon the PRSP and as supported under the proposed
PRSC.

               ARMENIA-DEBT                SUSTAINABILITY             ANALYSIS (DSA)~~


1.        Armenia is considered to be at a low risk of debt distress with all debt
indicators well below the relevant country-specific debt-burden thresholds, including
when subjected to stress tests (see Table 1below).

2.        The baseline DSA has been developed on a cautious set of assumptions,
including: i)real GDP growth o f 5 percent per year over the period 2008-12, and 4
percent thereafter; ii)inflation o f 3 percent throughout the projection period; iii)an
overall fiscal deficit o f 2.9 percent o f GDP through the PRSP horizon o f 2015, and 2.3
percent o f GDP thereafter (implying a debt-stabilizing primary balance); iv) a steady
increase in the share o f both exports and imports as a proportion o f GDP, leading to a
gradual improvement in the current account balance over the projection period; and v) a
shift away from highlyconcessional forms o f external financing.

Underthe baselinescenario:

          0   the fiscal position remains sustainable (see Table l a and Figure l).67                    In
              particular, the net present value o f domestic and external public debt increases
              from 23 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 31 percent in2025. Note that this result is
              based on the conservative assumption that the deficit is financed with
              increasingly expensive domestic borrowing.68The net present value o f debt to
              revenue, and the debt service to revenue ratio remain relatively stable
              throughout the projection period, and;


          0   the external debt outlook i s benign(see Table 2a and Figure 2 p 9 Inparticular,
              the net present value o f external debt falls steadily from around 15 percent o f
              GDP in 2005 to just over 8 percent by 2025, the net present value o f debt-to-
              exports falls from just over 60 percent to around 25 percent over the same
              period, and the debt service-to-exports ratio decline from just under 6 percent
              in2005 to around 2 percent bythe endoftheprojectionperiod.




66This D S A was undertaken jointly by Fund and Bank staff, in consultation with the government of the
Republic o f Armenia, in August and September 2005. The D S A has been prepared in line with the interim
guidance on the preparation o f joint Fund-World Bank DSAs for low-income countries. Fund and Bank
staff have collaborated previously on debt sustainability issues, including in the context o f the report on
"Poverty Reduction, Growth and Debt Sustainability in Low-Income CIS Countries," February 5, 2002,
(SMi02134).
67The DSA covers the central government only as other public sector debt i s negligible.
  This assumption also implies that as interest expenditure rises, the primary balance improves steadily.
69T o ensure data consistency, the external D S A covers only public and publicly guaranteed debt. The
authorities are currently considering ways to enhance the coverage and reporting o f external private debt
statistics. According to current data, private external debt totaled U S D 704 million at end-2004.

li Threshold values are basedon the guidelines for low-income country DSAs, inwhich Armenia is
considered to be a strong performer.

3.      The framework for low-income country DSAs incorporates alternative
scenarios and bound tests aimed at identifying the sensitivities o f the baseline
projection to a range o f potential shocks (see Tables 2b and 3b below). Based on these it
can be seen that Armenia's debt outlook is particularlysensitive to i)a lastingshock
to the growth outlook, and ii)a slowdown in export growth. Nevertheless, even in
these scenarios, Armenia's debt outlook is likely to remain manageable. Staff also
considered the possible impact on debt sustainability o f a `significant' fiscal event, such
as assumption by the government o f pension liabilities. Assuming such an event were to
occur in 2010 and cost around 10percent o f GDP, the net present value of public debt to
GDP ratio in 2025 would remain manageable at about 40 percent. While the historical
scenario (which can be considered as a "no-reformy' scenario) also projects debt ratios
below the threshold indicators, the ratios generally continue on an upward trend through
the projection period. This finding underlines the importance of continuing the
process of structural reform, and preserving macroeconomic stability in order to
safeguardthe debt outlook.This is a key lesson from the DSA.

4.      The authorities welcomed the finding that Armenia is at a low risk of debt
distress. Sound debt management continues to be a priority for the government. Since
2001 the Ministry o f Finance and Economy has produced an Annual Report on Public
Debt o f the Republic o f Armenia, covering both domestic and external debt. This
publication reports on the evolution o f debt aggregates and the govemment's debt
management strategy. Looking ahead, the authorities are considering the possibility o f

11Variables include real GDP growth, grow* of GDP deflator (in US. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
21Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
31Exports values are assumedto remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assumini
  an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
41Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
51 Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
61Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

          KEY FINANCIAL SECTORASSESSMENT PROGRAMUPDATE
                                       RECOMMENDATIONS


Monetary operations. (i)        improve local currency liquidity management by increasing the stock
o f dram monetary instruments, and rely less on foreign exchange operations that can contribute to
exchange rate volatility; (ii)     conduct monetary operations more frequently and on a larger scale
with a view to encouraging the development o f deeper and more liquid money markets; (iii)
modify the requirement that a large stock o f T-bills issues to facilitate the CBA's liquidity
management mature by year-end; and (iv) consider a reallocation o f sterilization cost from the
CBA to the budget.

Banking. (i)   continue to rely on compliance-based supervision while shifting toward more risk-
based supervision once the preconditions are in place; (ii)     improve communication between the
CBA and external auditors o f banks; (iii)     amend the C B A law to provide explicitly protection for
bank supervisors from civil liability; (iv) amend Law on Bankruptcy o f Banks and Credit
Institutions to extinguish bank owners' shareholder rights in case o f insolvency; (v) continue
efforts to address corporate governance issues for the banks through legal and regulatory
measures (as outlined in the CBA's concept note) but not through further increases in the
minimumabsolute capital requirement; (vi) enhance monitoring o f macro-prudential risks inthe
banking system; and (vii) implement upward consolidated supervision to monitor banks'
activities vis-$-vis their beneficial owners.

Insurance. (i)    implement the new insurance law with an initial focus on licensing, accounting,
auditing and financial reporting, solvency and technical reserve requirements, and reinsurance;
(ii)dedicate more resources to the supervisory unit to improve staff capabilities including through
adequate training; and (iii)      take steps to ensures successful implementation o f the compulsory
third-party-liability motor insurance.

Corporate governance.(i)          strengthen implementationo f Company Law; (ii)  improve accounting
and auditing practices and financial reporting requirements; (iii)strengthen disclosure o f
beneficial owners; and (iv) strengthen creditor rights and the enforcement inthe court system.

Pension reform. (i)conduct extensive analysis o f options before deciding on a pension reform
strategy, including actuarial projections and issues such as fiscal sustainability, lack o f financial
instruments, and regulatory requirements and responsibilities; and (ii)      consider reforms to the
existing defined-benefit, pay-as-you-go pension system that better link benefits to wages to
improve the perceived fairness o f the system.

       A. FACTORS        CONTRIBUTING TO POVERTY REDUCTION: GROWTH NATIONAL               IN
                                  INCOME AND ITS SPILL-OVER EFFECTS

1.        Strong and almost decade long rise in national income and to a lesser extent,
reduction in inequality have been the two factors that contributed to poverty
reduction in Armenia. Since 1994, Armenia has grown at a remarkable average annual
rate o f over 7 percent and by 2004 its real GDP reached the pre-transition level. In
addition to output growth, private foreign transfers - invested mostly inconstruction - and
remittances have played a key role inraising the national income. Both sources o f growth
in aggregate demand have triggering high induced household income multipliers7' and
produced strong spill-over effects that benefitedmultiplehouseholds.

2.        The poorest in Armenia saw a strongest increase in consumption. Estimates
based on the Armenia Integrated Living Conditions Survey indicate that Armenia has
seen a considerable decline in extremepoverty during 1998-2004. About 21 percent o f
the population or about 0.67 million people have moved out o f poverty in the pastfive
years. About 14.5 percent o f the population or 0.46 million people escaped the basic food
deprivation. This evidence i s consistent with the evolution o f inequality for the period -
the Gini coefficient decreased from a value o f 0.299 in 1998/99 to a value o f 0.259 in
2004 - and indicates that the growth was accompanied by a compression in the overall
structure o f consumption distribution.

3.        Growth has channeled to the households through multiple sources increasing
both factor and non-factor income. Strong growth infactor income from both labor and
capital was accompanied by stable growth in remittances and consistent improvement in
public transfer programs. In fact, household income from all main sources rose in real
terms between 1998/99 and 2004. Factor income remained a dominant source o f
household income for all quintiles followed by income from remittances and public
transfers. Such multiplicity of income sources have benefited various types o f households
and resulted inbroad based poverty reduction inArmenia.

4.        Growth in factor income mirrored growth in output" and was based on large
productivity gains due to structural changes and labor shedding in the process o f labor
rationalization and to a lesser extent to a rise in employment. Survey data point to 17
percent unemployment rate, which i s an estimated 35 percent reduction inunemployment
rate estimated in 1888/99, but it is still the highest unemployment rate registered among
the transition countries. In addition much o f the work force is to be found in low paid
subsistence agriculture, trade, the informal economy and temporary employment. While
demand for additional formal labor had grown slowly, productivity gains secured

7' Itis difficult to accurately assess the distribution o f factor income between wage income, mixed income
and income from capital as Armenian statistical data o n wages include only official wage bill, which
clearly underestimates the real level o f the wage bill.

stronger earnings for current workers with stable employment arrangements with real
wages seeing 50 percent increase between 1998/99 and 2003. Investment contribution to
growth was also considerable and the share o f capital value added inArmenia's GDP has
increased over time. Income from capital has been growing rapidly benefiting those who
owned and/or received the assets at the outset and/or in the process o f economic
transformation. Armenia's recent growth has also benefited from large foreign capital
transfers invested mostly in construction sector, which i s characterized by strong income
multipliereffect both on employment and therefore onhouseholdincomes.

5.        In addition to factor income both public and private transfers have played
important role in boosting the household income in Armenia. Poor rely heavily on
government transfers (pensions, social assistance and other transfers), with this source
representingabout 20 percent o fhousehold income and the third largest source o f income
(after labor income and remittances) in the poorest quintiles. Social protection benefits
have increased inthe past five years inreal per capita terms. Benefits have also improved
in terms of targeting the poorest, with the family poverty benefit system becoming an
effective mechanism for reachingthe poor.

6.        Remittances and other private transfers by far exceed publicly provided resources
inArmenia.72They accounted for more than 10 percent of GDP during this period and
boosted consumption levels, including among the poor, helping to reduce poverty. An
increasingly large number o f households receive remittances reaching 50 percent o f the
monetary income o f recipient households. Remittances have a direct effect on the
recipient households' wellbeing as well as strong secondary multiplier effects for those
who do not receive remittances directly. External remittances comprised large share o f
overall monthly income for households who received them, which suggests that
remittances significantly improved the well-being o f the poorest households and have
been critical for keepingthese quintiles out o fpoverty.


                                B. POVERTY        REDUCTION       CHALLENGES

7.        The progress in economic vulnerability has been less favorable than progress
in poverty reduction. Although current growth pattern has enabled more than 460
thousand poorest households to return their consumption to the pre-crisis level, and
overall 0.67 million people to move out o f poverty it may prove to be insufficient for
sustained poverty reduction in future. Notwithstanding the favorable trend in poverty
reductionArmenia is still characterized by a high incidence ofpoverty. About 35 percent
of the population remains poor. Moreover, even the people whose incomes have grown
above the level o f absolute material deprivation continue to face poor standard o f living.


72 There have been two large waves o f Armenian emigration, at the beginning o f the 20* century and after
the collapse o f the Soviet Union. This reflects the present structure o f the Armenian Foreign Diaspora,
which representsboth types o f internationally recognized migrants: (1) recent emigrants who are relatively
young, have immediate families in Armenia and support their families' incomes from abroad. This source
o f funds mostly finances consumption and i s relatively stable at least over the future 20 to 30 years; from
the pure accounting point o f view this is reflected as net transfers and net-income from abroad; (2) earlier
emigrants, people whose families left about 100 years ago, and who are investing money into their country
o f origin ifthey see investment opportunities there.

Page 3 of 7                                                                               ANNEX VI


Majority of Armenians, have low savings and are vulnerable to fall into poverty in the
event o f shocks. As mentioned above, Armenian growth pattern, with some exceptions,
has not resulted inthe creation o f stable and well-paid jobs and move toward sustainable
employment in labor intensive sectors with a stable future income generation potential.
Armenia still suffers from high unemployment; low labor force participation and low-
productivity employment trap with occasional, informal and low paid jobs and self-
employment, mostly in subsistence agriculture and retail trade and continues to depend
on private transfers and remittances.

8.      In addition prices in Armenia continue to adjust to the international level
and consumption components, especially non-food items in the consumption
aggregate (led by the utility and service price adjustments) are becoming more
costly over time and crowd out other components from the consumptionaggregate
of the poorest deciles. On average Armenian pattern o f household consumption is
similar to the other low-income CIS countries consumption pattern where food
expenditure represents more than two thirds of consumption aggregate. All non-food
components o f consumption saw some increase over the period 1998/99-2004 with
utilities playing a leading role. Shift in consumption categories reflect growth in
household income as well as gradual adjustment o f prices to international levels (Figure
1).

9.       Sustaining poverty reduction in this challenging environment depends on the
ability of the country to overcome structural bottlenecks in the economic transformation
to the market economy and achieve excellence in several directions: (1) it is necessary to
sustain and diversify growth and accelerate the pace ofjob creation by encouraging firm
entry and expansion, through improvements in the investment climate and lowering the
costs o f doing business; (2) it i s essential to protect incomes and public service access
and quality for the poorest through effective social safety nets and public sector
interventions to avoid structural poverty and social marginalization, (3) sustaining high
growth rates calls for increased focus on infrastructure. The Government's Poverty
Reduction Support Program i s designed to address the above challenges. The following

section outlines the policy reform areas supported by the PRSC program and analysis
their link to poverty reduction.

          c.          GOVERNMENT              PROGRAMAND ITSLINKS POVERTYREDUCTION:     TO
    SIMULATING THE POVERTYIMPACT OFARMENIA'S PRSCSUPPORTEDPROGRAMS

10.        The analysis suggests that sustaining high rates o f growth will remain decisive
factor for continued poverty reduction in Armenia with macroeconomic stability and
reforms stimulating private investment being the central part o f the Government's
poverty reduction agenda. The Government can affect the poverty reduction intwo main
areas: (i)     reforms that sustain and diversify sources o f growth, including the measures
that encourage incomes o f the poorest households, and (ii)                                 reforms that strengthen public
transfer programs and improve public sector delivery. An attempt has been made to
review the potential links o f the PRSC supported programs to the poverty reduction and
simulate the PRSC supported reform impact.

11.        Armenia needs to generate growth o fmore than 5 percent a year (at the minimum)
to be able to cut poverty to 25 percent and reduce extreme poverty to 2.6% by 2010. And
all this requires unchanged income distribution; with any worsening o f the distribution,
even higher growth rates would be needed. Setting more ambitious targets o f poverty
elimination would require equitable and sustainable growth at higher rates.

12.        The key variable underpinning poverty reduction projections is private
consumption, which i s projected to grow by about 5 percent a year between 2006 and
2010. Assuming that households in all parts o f the income distribution benefit uniformly,
poverty i s projected to fall from 34.9 percent estimated in 2004 to 25 percent in2010, or
by about 272 thousand people. This implies a yearly decline o f around 7 percent or a cut
inthe poverty rate of close to 2 percentage points every year for the 2005-2010 period
(Table 1).

13.        Nevertheless, by 2010, according to these projections, more than 0.8 million
people or one quarter o f the Armenian population will remain poor. Faster growth could
lead to faster reduction in poverty rates. Sustained economic growth i s hence a crucial
component o f any poverty alleviation strategy.

Page 5 of 7                                                                             ANNEX VI


14.     The recently undertaken CEM for Armenia has found that growth potential is high
in Armenia, based on rising productivity of factor use, but growth prospects are
compromised by poor property rights protection and enforcement, poor competition, and
arbitrary customs and tax administration. The cost o f finance remains high, partly
because o f low domestic savings rates, but, more fundamentally, because o f barriers to
intermediation related to secured transactions and extremely weak corporate governance.
This suggests that inaddition to maintaining macro stability, future growth prospects will
depend on strengthening the framework for competition, lowering the cost o f financial
intermediation and policies to deepen the integration o f the economy to global markets.

15.     Broad reform measures supported by the PRSC, are aimed to overcome these
bottlenecks and include consolidating macroeconomic                    discipline,    strengthening
governance and fighting against corruption, sharpening competition and entrenching
property rights (Themes Iand 11). These measures will stimulate overall growth and will
channel to the households through increasing factor income from both labor and capital.
Growth with trigger high induced household income multiplier^^^ and produce strong
spill-over effects that benefited multiplehouseholds.

16.     The analysis show that the poorest households do not benefit from these
sources of growth directly and need to be supported by additional straightforward
strategythat is most-effectivefor the lowestincome deciles. These policies must either
raise income o f the poorest or lower the real cost o f consumption. Poverty rates are
equally high in secondary cities and rural areas -- in contrast to 1998/99, when poverty
was predominantly an urban phenomenon. A number o f PRSC supported measures on
stimulating farm incomes through adopting a framework for agricultural extension,
research and education and enhancing rural sector infrastructure affect mostly the
enhancement o f revenue in the lowest income deciles and support income o f the poorest
rural households.

17.     The impact o f the PRSC supported measures on the real cost o f consumption i s
mixed partly due to the fact that the relative prices in Armenia have yet to adjust to
international prices. But the program i s aiming to improve long-term outcomes as well as
include the measures that mitigate the short-term social risks.

18.     On average Armenian pattern o f household consumption is similar to the other
low-income CIS countries consumption pattern where food expenditure represents more
than two thirds o f consumption aggregate. More than 60% o f all expenditures are
allocated to processed foods, dairy, meats and vegetables. This includes 16.3% o f
expenditures which represent the retail markups paid as part o f retail consumption and
transportation. The PRSC measures that aim at increased competition will result in
reducing the retail markup and will benefit the poor by allowing the poorest to redirect
some spending from this item to more essential consumption components in the
consumption aggregate.




73Reflects how much a unit-increase inthe demand for a commodity affects household income.

Page 6 of 7                                                                                ANNEX VI


19.     At the same time, the PRSC component on reforms o f the enterprise sector
(Theme 11) aims to increase growth and investmentinthe long term but is likely to have a
negative social impact as it will entail increase in the price o f utilities, which have been
already on a quick rise over the past several years. The poor already saw a
disproportionately higher increase in shares o f utility and transport components than the
rich. Armenia has a large network o f infrastructure services, including power, water, gas,
district heating, and other municipal services, much o f which i s eroding from lack o f
maintenance. Service quality i s low, with large disparities inprovision by income group.
The infrastructure needs o f the poor are unlikely to be met without reform o f the utilities
sector to bring it to a financially self-sustaining basis, which would encourage
maintenance o f viable infrastructure and improvements in service quality as well as
across-the-board increases in the access to utilities, which appear to have a more serious
positive impact on poverty than a negative impact related to utility price increase. Many
households, including many urban households, continue to use dirty fuels such as coal,
wood, and oil for heating, because they lack access to gas and cannot afford, or are not
reliably provided with, electricity. Available survey evidence suggests that the reliance
on solid fuels for heating affects the poor more than the rich (Figure 2) emphasizing the
importance o f increasingthe access to utilities.

20.      The social impact o f utility price increase therefore i s supported by the measures
aimed at mitigating social risks through improving social protection raising quality o f
education and controlling risks in health (Theme 111). These measures will be critical as
according to analysis large share o f the poorest in Armenia will continue to rely on the
public transfers as the only source o f income in the medium-term. The importance of
these measured is further underlined by the fact that the quality o f infrastructure and
public services are poor inthe rural areas and the secondary cities where the poverty level
i s the highest. Official statistics show the decline in utilization o f health care during the
1990s especially for the bottom quintile (Figure 3).

21.     Armenia has maintained its high level o f school enrollment and coverage in the
compulsory cycle. Compared with enrollment, trends in the quality o f education are less
sanguine. Sharply reduced public funding for education after the collapse o f the Soviet
Union has resulted in significant cut-backs in essential services, deteriorating educational
quality and increasing education costs for families. Despite some recent increases in
spending on a real per capita basis since 2002, failure to invest sufficiently in
infrastructure or staff means that the quality o f public service i s not'being maintained.
The poor are particularly vulnerable to rising education costs. This is reflected in low
participation rates by children from poor households beyond compulsory basic education
as well as declining overall scores in student performance. Often, these students tend to
be inschools where the quality o f service provision is marginal, such as rural schools and
schools inthe secondary cities.

 IMFCompletesFirstReviewUnder PRGFfor the RepublicofArmenia and
                       Approves US$4.7 Million Disbursement

The Executive Board o fthe International Monetary Fund(IMF) today completed the first
review o f the Republic o f Armenia's economic performance under a three-year Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion o f the review
enables Armenia to draw an amount equivalent to SDR 3.28 million (about US$4.7
million), which will bringtotal disbursement under the arrangement to SDR 6.56 million
(about US$9.4million).

The Executive Board approved the three-year arrangement on M a y 25,2005, (see Press
Release No. 05/123) for a total amount equivalent to SDR 23 million (about US$32.8
million) to support the government's economic program through 2008.

Following the Executive Board discussion, Agustin Carstens, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, said:

''Armenia's economy continues to perform strongly. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies,
strong external inflows, and ongoing structural reforms have contributed to double-digit
growth, low inflation, and declining poverty in2005. The outlook i s for continued robust
growth in2006, underpinnedby buoyant investmentand remittance inflows.

"The authorities made good progress in structural reforms in2005. They adopted a
comprehensive two-year Tax Action Plan to improve tax and customs administrations.
Two major amendments to tax legislation that reduce exemptions and loopholes have
been submitted to parliament. Moreover, an operational review o f customs i s currently
under way. Steps have also been taken to strengthen banking supervision and improve
corporate governance o f the financial sector. The financial performance o f the energy,
water, and irrigation sector has continued to improve.

"The thrust o f the authorities' economic program for 2006 is to maintain macroeconomic
stability and keep inflation below 3 percent. The Central Bank o f Armenia will continue

Page 2 o f 2                                                                   ANNEX VI1


to focus on maintaining price stability, and to limit intervention in the foreign exchange
market to smoothing out volatility inthe exchange rate.

"The government will also continue to pursue reforms aimed at enhancing growth
prospects and alleviating poverty. Inparticular, structural reforms inthe fiscal area focus
on improving tax and customs administration to mobilize domestic revenues to finance
capital, and social expenditures. As part o f the efforts to improve the business climate,
the government will continue with the implementation o f its anti-corruption action plan.
Financial sector reforms should boost financial intermediation and reforms in the public
utility sector will emphasize improving its services and financial viability," Mr. Carstens
said.

The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low income countries. It i s intended that
PRGF-supported programs will in time be based on country-owned poverty reduction
strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and development
partners, and articulated in a PRSP. This is to ensure that each PRGF-supportedprogram
i s consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social
policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate o f
0.5 percent, and are repayable over 10 years with a 5%-year grace period on principal
payments.
