           Credit for Armenia will support policy and institutional\n            reforms in furtherance of the official Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper (PRSP). The Poverty Reduction Support Credits\n            (PRSCs) focus on four critical reform themes: (i)\n            consolidating macroeconomic discipline and strengthening of\n            governance; (ii) sharpening competition and entrenching\n            property rights; (iii) mitigating social and environmental\n            risks, and (iv) modernizing the rural economy. The first\n            PRSC was extended in November 2004. PRSC-II is proposed to\n            be extended on the basis of policy and institutional reform\n            actions taken as agreed with IDA. Subsequent PRSCs will be\n            made available as the agreed triggers of policy and\n            institutional reforms are satisfied."}, "docdt": "2005-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
