{"cdata!": "The Second Transport Project for Uruguay\n            aims to a) rehabilitate and upgrade elected national roads\n            and bridges to MERCOSUR (the regional agreement between\n            Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Ururguay) standards; b)\n            increase private sector participation in maintaining and\n            rehabilitating national road systems; and c) strengthen road\n            sector management. There are 5 components. The first, road\n            rehabilitation and bridge restoration, reinforces the\n            pavement structures of national roads and strengthens,\n            widens, or replaces existing bridges. Component 2 uses\n            performance-based CREMA contracts (contracts for\n            rehabilitation and maintenance) to rehabilitate and maintain\n            road networks. Component 3, funded by the National\n            Directorate of Highway's (DNV), consists of a contract\n            maintenance program and incremental operational costs of\n            force account maintenance activities managed by field\n            districts. Component 4 caries out departmental maintenance\n            subprojects over the project period in the participating\n            departments. The last component 1) strengthens the technical\n            capacity of the ministry of transport and public works in\n            road financing and user-charge areas, strengthens the\n            DNV's institutional and operational capacity, and\n            transfers technology to and strengthens the maintenance\n            management practices of participants in the Departmental\n            Roads Maintenance program; and 2) improves pavement markings\n            and road signs along highways and implements a pilot program\n            for road safety."}, "docdt": "1998-08-26T00:00:00Z"}
