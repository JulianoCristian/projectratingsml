REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
PORT OF BAR ENTERPRISE WITIi THIE GUARANTEE OF
THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Port of Bar Enterprise, with the guarantee of the Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, for the equivalent of US$44 million to help finance a port proj-
e:t.  The loan would have a term of 25 years, including four years of grace,
withl interest at 8 percent per annumi.  US$5.7 million of the proceeds of the
loan would be relent to the Railway Transport Enterprise, Belgrade (RTE
Belgrade) for the railway part of the project, on similar terms and conditions
to the Bank loan.
PART I - TtiE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Yugoslavia in November 1972; its
report entitled "Tie Economic Development of Yugoslavia" (R74-1) was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on January 2, 1974. An economic updating
mission visited the country in October 1973 and its findings are reflected
in this report. Basic data on the economy are given in Annex I.
Economic Trends and Development Issues
3.        The Yugoslav economy has experience(d rapid growth and significant
structural change during the past two decades. GDP at constant prices in-
creased by about 5.5 percent per year and per capita GDP by over 4.5 percent
per year. Average per capita GNP is estimated at around US$900 (1973). The
nurmber of people engaged in agriculture has decreased both absolutely and as
a percentage of the labor force, while the number engaged in industry and serv-
ices has correspondingly increased.  However nearly half of the labor force is
still engaged in agriculture, most of it on small private farms.  Industry ac-
counts for 23 percent and services for 22 percent of the labor force.
4.        Two imLportant features of the economy have been strengthened by the
recent constitutional changes. Self-management, whereby the means of produc-
tion used by different workers' collectives are given to them to manage, has
emerged as the fundamental right and obligation of every basic unit of orga-
nizedI labor in whatever sector. Second, the responsibility for most important
economic and social policy decisions has been delegated to the Republics and
Provinces. Against this background, Yugoslavia has placed increasing re-
liance on the market mechanism and the opening-up of the economy to inter-
national trade.



5.        The leading role in economic and social development has been played
by the social sector, which includes government, most enterprises and institu-
tions such as libraries, hospitals, theatres and schools, and which accounts
for 85 percent of GDP and employs over half of the total labor force. All
the enterprises and institutions are under workers' self-management and re-
sources are under social ownership. There is a private sector predominantly
comprised of peasant farms (withi a 10 hectare limit on land holdings) and
small enterprises (with a 5 person limit on the number of non-family workers),
mainly in handicrafts, construction, trade, transport and tourism.    In the
past the private sector has been relatively neglected by government policy.
However, the government has lately been devoting more attention to private
farmers with a view to accelerating the growth of agricultural production.
6.        Despite a policy of fostering accelerated growth in the less-
developed regions, major differences persist in the levels of development
among Republics. The more-developed regions are located in the north and
include 65 percent of the population, But even this area includes sizeable
pockets of poverty, particularly in private agriculture. The less-developed
regions are in the south and are generally more mourntainous and less densely
populated. This makes agriculture and transportation more difficult. The
southern regions are rich in minerals, coal and hydro-power generating poten-
tial. The development of these resources has provided the major stimulus for
growth.
7.        Although the economy of the less-developed regions has been growing
at almost the same rate as the more advanced areas, per capita income has
lagged behind because of faster population growth (1,6 percent per year as
compared with 0.7 percent in the more-developed regions). Consequently,
regional inequalities have widened. Average per capita GDP in the less-
developed regions now amounts to abouL J0 percent of that of the rest of the
country. Yugoslavia's development policy aims at reducing regional inequal-
ities by transferring investDment funds from Lihe more advanced to the less-
developed regions. In 1972 these transfers amounted to almost US$300 million,
about one-third of the less-developed regions' total investment expenditure.
8.        In addition to significanit regional income differences there are
substantial sectoral income differences.   For example, per capita GDP in pri-
vate agriculture in Kosovo (by far the poorest region), is just over US$100
or about one-ninth of the national average. Many private farmers there sup-
plement their incomes by working in the social sector but are, nevertheless,
unable to maintain an adequate standard of living. Although incomes in
private agriculture are somewhat higher in other parts of the country, they
remain far below those obtaining in non-agricultural activities.
9.        Thus far the unemployment situation in Yugoslavia has remained
manageable not least because some 800,000 Yugoslav workers have found work
abroad.  But the number of registered first-time job seekers has risen from
146,000 in 1971 to 230,000 early in 1974 (5.4 and 13.7 percent of the labor
force respectively). The Government is concerned about having a large number
of workers abroad and favors a policy of encouraging their return. Moreover
job opportunities abroad may diminish as economic growth in Europe slows down.



- 3 -
Although this trend has not yet taken on serious proportions there is a grow-
ing tendency for workers to return home and a slow down in the number leaving.
This could aggravate the country's unemployment and housing problems.
Recent Developments
10.       Rapid economic growth since 1968 was accompanied by inflation and
balance of payments problems. tMany enterprises experienced financial diffi-
culties primarily as a result of over-zealous investment programs and a lack
of financial discipline. To counter inflation and improve the external pay-
ments position the Government, in 1972 and 1973, adopted measures aimed at
restricting monetary expansion, limiting public expenditure, temporarily
strengthening price controls, reducing the growth of personal income, improv-
ing the financial structure of enterprises and imposing limitations on ex-
ternal borrowing. In addition, to neutralize the inflationary pressure on
the balance of payments, the dinar was devalued by 16.6 percent in January
1971, and again by 18.8 percent in December 1971. Since July 1973 the dinar
has been floating. 1/
11.       As a result of these measures exports increased rapidly in 1972 and
1973 and imports stagnated. Aided by a sharp rise in workers' remittances,
up 36 percent in 1972, the current account showed a surplus of US$415 million
in 1972, the first surplus since 1965. A current account surplus was again
achiieved in 1973 ($210 million). Foreign exchange reserves have risen from
tihe equivalent of about one month's merclhandise imports in 1971, to nearly
5 montlhs at present.  There has been no slowdown in the rate of inflation,
however, and most prices continue to rise at the rate of 15-20 percent per
year.
12.       While the restrictive measures have been successful in improving
the external pavments position and the financial situation of enterprises,
thley lhave reduced economic growth. Real GDP increased by only 4.4 percent in
1972 as against 8.8 percent in 1971; for 1973 real economic growth is esti-
mated at about 5 percent.
13.       The Social Development Plan for 1971-75 proJected an average GDP
growth of 7.5 percent per year in real terms but it is clear that this will
not be realized. Even if economic growth in 1974 and 1975 reached that level,
average growth during the five years would amount to around 6.8 percent, due
to the slowdown associated with the 1972/73 stabilization measures. Given
thie slow population increase this would still be rather high, and would com-
pare well with growth during the preceding five-year period (6.3 percent per
year).
The Energy Sector
14.       On a calorific basis 67 percent of Yugoslavia's energy needs in
1973 were met from domestic sources.   Domestically-mined coal remains an im-
portant source of fuel. Practically all thermal power plants are coal fired.
About 39 percent of the oil consumed is of domestic origin. Yugoslavia gen-
erates more than half of its electricity from hydro plants despite the fact
1/ l; new intervention rate was fixed by the Yugoslav Central Bank on
October 29, 1974 of US$1.00 equal to Dinars 17.23, an effective
devaluation of 7 percent.



- 4 -
that liydro capacity has been developed only to about one-third of its poten-
tial. The shortages of electricity that are emerging are not due to the lack
of lhydro generation potential, coal or oil, but rather to insufficient plant
capacity, delayed construction and a country-wide drought which has reduced
hydropower output. Yugoslavia maintains friendly relations with nearby oil
producers, so that its oil imports are assured.
15.       In spite of Yugoslavia's relatively low dependence on imported oil,
increases in the price of oil are bound to affect the government's efforts
to improve the external payments position. In 1973 oil imports amounted to
an estimated USS259 million, or 5.4 percent of goods and services imports.
For 1974 oil import payments will be of the order of US$900 million, at an
average c.i.f. price of US$100 per m.t. (US$13 per barrel), equivalent to
about 15 percent of imports of goods and services. The impact on the balance
of payments will be to contribute to a substantial current account deficit
in 1974 (estimated at about US*6OV miilion) and later years, instead of the
supluses Yugoslavia has enjoyed recently.
16.       The indirect consequences of the world energy crisis are unclear.
On the positive side Yugoslavia's heavy use of coal and hydropower should
improve the country's international competitive position.    On the other hand
jot) opportunities for Yugoslavs working abroad will diminish as economic
growth in Western Europe slows down. Returning migrant workers would exacer-
bate unemployment and housing problems and workers' remittances, which have
played a dynamic role in the economy, may suffer. Moreover, stagnation in
economic activity abroad could affect Yugoslavia's exports. The rise in the
cost of automobile and air transportation may influence tourism unfavorably,
although it is also conceivable that the country would attract tourists who
would otherwise have gone furLher afield.    Therefore, the tourist sector may
gain on balance. These conflicting trends are being watched carefully by the
Yugoslav authorities and the Bank.
Capital Requirements
17.       Yugoslavia is dependent to a large degree on imported equipment
for its economic development and the country has borrowed substantial amounts
abroad. Gross capital inflows have more than tripled during the last five
years, reaching US$1,250 million in 1973, mostly in medium-term commercial
credit. However, due to rapidly rising amortization payments, an increase
of US$746 million in gross inflows between 1967 and 1972 resulted in an in-
crease in the net inflow of only US$224 million. The growing discrepancy
between gross and net inflows reflects a shlift, following the 1965 Economic
Reforms, from long-term official loans to medium-term commercial credits as
a result of the limited availability of official capital and the liberaliza-
tion of foreign trade and borrowing. The United States, the Federal Republic
of Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the United Kingdom have provided most of
the commercial credits. IBRD, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the USSR
have been the principal sources of long-term official capital.



- 5 -
18.       Until recently it was thought that much of the foreign exchange
needed to finance imports would come from the growth of workers' remittances.
However, the energy crisis and other factors make it doubtful whether this
source will continue to expand at its previous high rate and the country will,
therefore, need to maintain a high level of foreign borrowing. Its gross
long-term capital requirements are tentatively estimated at between US$2.0
and 2.5 billion per year during 1974-79. Around US$500-600 million of this
may be provided in the form of official development assistance from bilateral
and multilateral sources. The remainder will come mainly from foreign banks
and suppliers. Raising such large sums will be a formidable challenge, but
Yugoslavia's success in the past in obtaining the funds it requires from the
capital markets, and its continued good credit standing, give grounds for
confidence that it will be able to obtain the capital inflow required to fi-
nance its development efforts.
Creditworthiness
19.       In spite of the present unsettled international conditions, the
prospects for Yugoslavia's continued economic growth during the next decade
are good. The country's endowment of natural and human resources, its rela-
tively low dependence on imported energy sources, its pragmatic approach to
economic problems and its readiness to undertake institutional changes, com-
bine to give grounds for a favorable assessment of future prospects.
20.       External public and publicly-guaranteed debt outstanding as of
December 31, 1972 was US$1,730 million. In addition there was US$1,820 mil-
lion non-public external debt outstanding. Total (public and non-public)
debt service payments in 1973 were equivalent to 20 percent of foreign ex-
change earnings. With external borrowing projected at around US$2.5 billion
per year during 1974-79, the debt service ratio (public and non-public) is ex-
pected to remain at the same level or to decline slightly to about 19 percent
in 1979. Taking into account Yugoslavia's debt service record and the measures
taken in the past to control balance of payments problems, as well as the pro-
spective growth of production and foreign exchange earnings, Yugoslavia remains
creditworthy for a substantial amount of Bank lending.
21.       MIany of the high priority projects in Yugoslavia have a low foreign
exchange component due to the relatively advanced state of Yugoslav industry
and the competitiveness of Yugoslav contractors. Were the Bank to confine
its lending to the foreign exchange costs of projects, an adequate contribu-
tion to Yugoslavia's external capital needs could be made only by spreading
the lending over a large number of projects, including some of lesser prior-
ity. Therefore it seems reasonable to provide for some measure of local ex-
penditure financing in the Bank's lending program.

PAKR II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN YUGOSLAVIA
22.       The Bank has made 30 loans totalling about US$972 million to
Yugoslavia. Of this amount approximately 50 percent (US$487.4 million) has
been for 11 loans for the transportation sector - six for highways totalling
US$180 million, four for railways totalling US$248 million, and US$59.4 mil-
lion for the Naftagas pipeline loan approved in 1973. Bank lending has gen-
erally concentrated on infrastructure including, in addition to the transport-
ation loans, power (three loans totalling US$135 million), telecommunications
(one loan for US$40 million), and three multipurpose projects totalling US$103
million. Nine loans have also been made for industry, two for tourism and one
for agricultural industries. This would be the first loan for a port project.
IFC has made eight investments in Yugoslavia totalling about US$80 million.
23.       In the last few years delays in loan effectiveness have hampered
project implementation. To some extent delays are inevitable since the clear-
ance of loan documents involves all the Republics and Provinces in every case.
Conditions of effectiveness can rarely be met speedily, regardless of how well
tihe ground is prepared. Yugoslavia has been continually evolving its consti-
tutional process and the approval of a new constitution earlier this year
should facilitate a better understanding of what is required to get project
implementation off the ground quickly. There are encouraging signs of this.
Three of the six loans approved in FY74 have already been declared effective
and disbursements have started under all three of them. But this problem will
continue to be closely monitored by the Federal authorities and the Bank.
Thiere have been delays in the execution of several projects including the
Belgrade-Bar Railway Project and two tourism projects. The Bank has increas-
ed its efforts to deal with these problems through extra supervision and other
missions. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC invest-
ments as of September 30, 1974 and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
24.       The major objectives of Bank lending to Yugoslavia are to accelerate
development in the less-developed regions of the country; to promote agricul-
tural development, particularly in the peasant sector, by providing basic infra-
structure and credit for the financing of farm development, equipment and
processing facilities; to promote structural reforms in major sectors of
the economy tlhrough improved coordination and the strengthening of institu-
tions; and to provide Yugoslavia with long-term external capital and thus
help reduce the country's dependence on short-term external borrowings. These
objectives are basically the same as those which have guided Bank lending in
previous years, but efforts to give special support to the less-developed
regions and the private sector have been strengthened.
25.       Over the next two years loans are envisaged for tourism infrastruc-
ture in Dubrovnik, power generation, agricultural credit, an oil pipeline,
urban pollution control in Sarajevo, highways, two multipurpose (water supply/
sewerage, and power/irrigation) projects and one for railways. IFC is cur-
rently investigating several new investment opportunities to encourage joint
ventures which would provide technical, management and marketing expertise
as well as long-term capital.



- 7 -
26.       Apart from substantial assistance given in identifying and preparing
projects for Bank financing, the Bank is providing technical assistance in sev-
eral areas. A series of regional studies of the four less-developed regions
of Yugoslavia was initiated two years ago and two studies, covering Kosovo and
Bosnia-herzegovina, have been completed. These studies will contribute to
better assessment of development problems and will assist in formulating de-
velopment strategies for these regions. Other current activities include as-
sistance with a study on the Yugoslav capital market designed to help improve
resource mobilization and allocation, and assistance for a training program for
auditors of the Social Accounting Service, which audits all enterprises and
Government activities, including Bank financed projects.
27.       Bank commitments to Yugoslavia have averaged about US$100 million
annually in the last three years.  Although this has represented only a small
proportion of the country's need for external finance, it has been equivalent
to almost one-third of the annual long-term official capital inflow in conver-
tible currencies. Assuming that the level of Bank lending continues to rise
substantially during the next five years, the outstanding debt to the Bank
could rise from about 9 percent of Yugoslavia's total external debt in 1973, to
about 11 percent by 1979. Service on Bank loans as a proportion of total debt
service wotuld increase from about 3 percent to about 7 percent during the same
period.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN YUGOSLAVIA
28.       Topography has influenced the development of Yugoslavia's transport
sector. The main routes have tended, in the past, to avoid the mountains along
the Adriatic coast and to the south. Instead they have flowed north-west to
south-east along the Sava-Danube valley, linking Western Europe to the Balkans.
By the early twentieth century a sound transport system was developing in the
northern part of the country. The sector as a whole suffered considerably
during the second World IJar. Today Yugoslavia has an extensive transport
system including 96,000 km of roads, 10,400 km of railways, 15 airports, 5
major ports and a sizeable network of coastal and inland waterways. 'The roads
and railwavs are the backbone of the transport system, together carrying some
90 percent of the total freight and 95 percent of passenger traffic in 1971.
The maritime transport carried about 10 percent of the total freight.   While
there have been many physical improvements in the sector over the last decade,
,tuch remains to be done.  The railways offer slow service; many of the roads
are still below standard; and port capacity needs to be increased.   In general
the development of transport infrastructure over the last decade has been in-
adequate to meet the rapidly. growing demand for its services.
29.       The economic reforms of the sixties facilitated the decentralization
of policy-making in the sector and the liberalization of the transport industry.
From 1960 to 1970 passenger and freight traffic grew at annual rates of 10 and
7 percent, respectively. While the reforms encouraged growth they brought
about structural changes. Passenger and freight traffic on the roads, bene-
fitting greatly from the liberalization policies, grew at 21 and 20 percent
respectively, while the comparable figures for railways were zero and 2.5



- 8 -
percent. By 1970 the railways' share of the passenger market had dropped
from 67 to 25 percent and of the freight market from 74 to 47 percent. The
decentralization wekened transport administration, coordination and planning.
It also aggravated the difficulties faced by many enterprises in the sector,
especially the railways, in mobilizing funds for investment.
30.       Decentralized management made it difficult in recent years to for-
niulate coherent policies for the sector as a whole.   The policies that are
pursued, such as the freedom of choice by users to select their transport mode
and competition in the market economy among autonomous transport enterprises,
reflect thie prevailing economic climate. More emphasis is currently being
placed on a coordinated approach to the transport sector. In 1971 a Federal
Secretariat for Transport and Comnmunications was established and most of the
Socialist Republics (SRs) and Socialist Autonomous Provinces (SAPs) have since
established similar secretariats, although all these authorities suffer from
a lack of qualified staff.   Under the Ilighways VI loan (Ln. 990-YU), approved
by the lxecutive Directors in May 1974, agreement was reached that the Federal
Goverment would take appropriate steps to coordinate planning and investments
among transport modes.
31.       Bank lending has been concentrated upon priority infrastructure
projects for which funds were scarce.   lncreasirig emphasis is being given
to hlelping those institutions, like the Community of Yugoslav Railways, re-
sponsible for coordination and planning in the sector.
The Ports Subsector
32.       The Yugoslav Adriatic coast, which stretches for about 600 km., in-
cludes some ninety harbors, some of whlich have been active for centuries.
There are presently ten main porLs of which the most active are Koper, Rijeka,
Split, Ploce and Bar. The system is designed, so far as possible, to diversify
access to the sea in more than one Republic. As the coast line is separated
from the industrial and commercial centers to the east by mountain ranges,
the major ports are located near mountain passes which provide access to the
hinterland.  The ten principal ports together handle niore than 80 percent of
tihe seaport traffic. Rijeka, by far the largest port, accounts for 50 percent
of the Yugoslav seaport traffic. Because of their proximity to Italy, Koper,
and to a lesser degrea Rijeka, compete withi Trieste and Venice for transit
traffic from Austria, Czechoslovakia and Ilungary.
33.       During the last decade cargo handled by the ports has doubled,
reaching the present level of 24 million tons per year. Oil imports have
grown considerably faster than non-oil trade. The decline in the relative
importance of the non-oil seaborne trade is partly due to the increasing
share of trade with Western Europe in the total Yugoslav foreign trade pic-
ture, ,ost of which is transported overland. Although port infrastructure
has expanded substantially in the decade, general cargo congestion still
exists, particularly in Rijeka and Koper, due to inadequate handling equip-
ment, insufficient storage capacity and poor coordination with the railways.
One crucial issue in estimating future seaport traffic and port requirements
is the effect of containerization. Overland container rates are competitive



- 9 -
with sea rates and container cargo can be handled with greater time savings
and flexibility by efficient railways and roads. Thus the development of
containerization may encourage more overland transport.
34.       Ports are generally constructed, operated and maintained by inde-
pendent port enterprises in accordance with the principle of workers' self-
management (see para. 38 below). They are free to set their tariffs in prin-
cLple but they do so in practice in consultation witlh other ports.   They form-
ulate and implement their own development plans. Partly due to competition
with other ports, including Italian ports, the principal Yugoslav ports have
tended to be pre-occupied with their own expansion, resulting in a lack of
nationwide coordination of port investments. The principal Yugoslav ports
ihave formed an association which represents the ports in the Council for
Transportation in the Chamber of Economy of Yugoslavia. The association is
a consultative body with no executive functions, and its coordinating role
has thus far been limited to tariff questions. Competition has forced the
Yugoslav ports to keep their tariffs low and they have been unable to generate
sufficient funds to meet their investment needs. Some ports have borrowed
increasingly on short-term and are now facing liquidity problems.
35.       The current five-year development plan for ports (1971-75), pre-
pared by the association in 1971, represents an aggregation of individual
port development plans. The plan calls for an investment of US$116 million,
primarily for a 30 percent extension of general cargo berthage in the ten
principal ports, the construction of a bulk handling installation at Bar and
two minor container terminals at Rijeka and Koper. The plan does not attempt
to provide for the optimization of port development on a national basis (by
estimating the future traffic and defining the facilities required to meet the
traffic). In connection with preparation of the next five-year plan, the ports
are currently considering joint measures to improve coordination in the sub-
sector, including carrying out a ports sub-sector study. The details of the
studv are under discussion among the ports. The study should offer a good
opportunity to conduct a comprehensive review of the development of the ports
sub-sector, which the Bank has urged the Yugoslav authorities to carry out.
However, as the port enterprises themselves have not yet taken a decision, it
w'ould be premature to link the study either directly or indirectly with this
project.
36.       The proposed project would be the Bank's first lending operation in
the ports sub-sector. Two more port projects are planned for later years;
Rijeka and Belgrade. The primary objective of Bank lending for the subsector
is to encourage institution-building and to help finance high priority invest-
ment. An important consideration in the case of the proposed project is its
link with the Belgrade-Bar railway line (Ln. 531-YU), currently under construc-
tion and due for completion in 1976. The expansion of Bar harbor is linked to
the completion of the rail link to Serbia and the central Yugoslav hinterland.



- 10 -
The Borrower
37.       The proposed loan would be made to Port of Bar Enterprise (PBE).
The Enterprise was established as a state agency in 1954, initially to un-
dertake construction of the port facilities at Bar and, upon the comple-
tion of the construction in 1966, to operate the port. Today it has evolved
into an autonomous, self-managing port enterprise, operating one of Yugoslavia's
principal ports on the Adriatic coast, hitherto serving the area within and
around Montenegro. Following the completion of the Belgrade-Bar railway, its
service area will dramatically expand, encompassing industrial centers in
eastern and southern Yugoslavia, and by 1980 the traffic through the port is
expected to have increased fourfold.
38.       PBE is characterized by the normal Yugoslav concept of workers'
self-management. The policy making body is a Workers' Council elected by
all personnel, which appoints the general manager as chief executive. The
enterprise comprises five units dealing with operations, maintenance, con-
struction, administration-finance-marketing and general services. Each unit
has a large degree of autonomy in regulating its own affairs which are co-
ordinated by the Workers' Council. Senior management personnel are qualified
and experienced, but staff at the middle management levels are less experienced.
39.       In view of the proposed expansion of PBE's operations after the
completion of the project, its management has decided to bring its structure
and operating procedures more in line with those of a larger scale operation.
The measures being implemented toward this end will increase the delegation
of authority and more clearly identify operational responsibilities. One of
the immediate requirements is to improve the management information system.
PBE has employed a Yugoslav consulting firm to help improve its accounting
system and is in the process of implementing the consultants' interim recom-
mendations to improve its costing procedures and budgetary control. PBE
has agreed to continue to employ accounting consultants, acceptable to the
Bank, to help complete the implementation of satisfactory cost accounting and
management information systems, including procedures for setting tariffs (Loan
Agreement, Section 4.05 (a)). PBE has also agreed to employ consultants to
help to improve cargo handling procedures and, in view of the planned increase
of labor force from the present 560 to some 1,500 in 1980, consultants to help
devise an appropriate training program in operational procedures (Loan Agree-
ment, Section 4.05 (b)).
PART IV -. THE PROJECT
40.       When the Bank agreed in 1968 to assist in construction of the
Belgrade-Bar railway line (Loan 531-YU), the Federal Government undertook
to begin an expansion program for the port of Bar to cater for expansion of
the traffic consequent upon the completion of the railway line, now expected
in 1976. The proposed project, which would provide for the necessary expan-
sion, was prepared by PBE with assistance from consultants. Following
several Bank missions to help in project preparation, a mission visited



- 11 -
Yugoslavia in January 1973 to review the feasibility study and the project was
appraised in December 1973. Due to delays in finalizing the financing plan,
two follow-up missions were undertaken earlier this year. Negotiations were
held during September 1974 in Washington, D.C. The Yugoslav delegation was
led by Mr. Gavra Popovic, Assistant Federal Secretary for Finance, and included
representatives of the Federal Government, Republican Government of Montenegro,
Investment Bank of Titograd, the Borrower and the Railway Transport Enterprise
(RTE) - Belgrade (the Sub-Borrower).
Project Description
41.       The proposed project represents a four-year slice (1974-1977) of
PBF.'s investment program for 1974-1980 aimed at building the necessary port
capacity to handle the traffic demand after the opening of the Belgrade-Bar
railway. The program envisages an investment in port facilities of US$76.5
million, providing for the expansion of port capacity fourfold by 1980, i.e.
from the present 1.2 million tons to about 5.0 million tons, made up of 3.0
million for dry bulk cargo, 1.5 million for general cargo and 0.5 million
for liquid cargo.
42.       The loan and project are summarized in Annex III and the project is
described in detail in the Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of the Port of
Bar, Yugoslavia" dated November 8, 1974, which is being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors. The project consists of:
(a) Port Facilities
(i) expropriation of and compensation for about 250 houses on
the land to be developed
(ii) construction of a hostel for about 500 single workers and
apartments for about 250 workers with families
(iii) completion of the dry bulk cargo wharf under construction,
construction of two general cargo berths, extension of the
passenger ferry facilities, dredging, and provision of rail-
way facilities, water supply and other services in the port
area
(iv) construction of transit and storage sheds, grain silos and
edible oil tanks
(v) procurement and installation of portal and mobile cranes,
transporter bridges, fork-lift trucks, tractors, trailers
and tug boats
(vi) a program to improve PBE's management, financial control,
and accounting system witth the assistance of consultants
(b) Railway Facilities: construction of reception and dispatch yards outside
the port area, and of sidings for the distribution and marshalling of
wagons outside the customs area.



- 12 -
Detailed design is expected to start shortly before the end of 1974 and the
project construction would begin in the first quarter of 1975. The project
would be completed by December 31, 1977. The dry bulk cargo handling facil-
ities are scheduled to be available in the first quarter of 1976 in time for
operation of the Belgrade-Bar railway. The remaining works would be completed
by the end of 1977, in step with the expected build-up of general cargo traffic.
Project Execution
43.       PBE would be responsible for the execution of the port component of
the project. The overall responsibility for planning, coordination, and su-
pervision of project implementation lies with PBE's Project Management Group
(PMIG) which was recently established to assist the general manager. In order
to strengthen this group, PBE has recruited additional qualified staff and
has also agreed to employ design consultants to assist in detailed engineering
and in preparation of bid documents (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03). In view
of the urgent need for the services of design consultants and management -
accounting consultants (para 39), it is recommended that the Bank finance
retroactively expenditures incurred from January 1, 1974 for these consultants,
services, up to US$100,000.
44.      RUE Belgrade, which is constructing the Belgrade-B3ar railway under
the Bank assisted project (Loan 531-YU), will construct, manage and operate the
proposed railway investments under the project. PBE would enter into a Sub-
sidiary Loan Agreement with RTE Belgrade for relending a portion of the loan
to the latter for the construction of the railway facilities. The ratifica-
tion of this agreement would be a condition of effectiveness (Loan Agreement,
Recital N, and Section 7.01). Since most of the traffic through the port is
expected to travel along the Belgrade-Bar railway, it is essential that the
port and railway operations are closely coordinated. Therefore, PBE and RTE-
Belgrade have agreed to ensure continuous coordinat-on between the port and
railway operations, including joint review of projected traffic (Loan Agree-
inent, Section 3.02 (b) andl Subsidiary Loan Agreement, Section 3.04).
Exrpropriat ion
43.       The proposecd expansioni of the port facilities would involve expro-
priation of land and resettlemient of some 250 families,   Although tihe city of
Bar would provide the necessary land for resettlement, PBE is responsible for
ne_otiating the acquisition of land and for the provision of appropriate com-
pensation. PBE has made satisfactory plans for expropriation and adequate
provision for compensation:   all the landl is schieduled to be acquired by the
end of 1974.
Project Cost and Financing
46.       The total cost, includling interest during construction (US$6.0 mil-
lion), is estimated at US$78.0 million with a foreign exchange component of
US$36.9 million (about 47 percent of the total). Port facilities account for



- 13 -
US$67.8 million of the total cost and the railway facilities US$10.2 million.
Price contingencies assume annual price increases of 12, 10 and 8 percent for
the foreign exchange cost and 20, 16 and 10 percent for the local cost in
1975, 1976 and 1977, respectively.
47.       The proposed Bank loan of US$44.0 million would finance 55 percent
of the investment cost, including about US$7.1 million of local costs, and
US$4.6 million for interest on the Bank loan during construction. The proposed
investment is more than thirty times the size of PBE's current operating revenues
and PBE is not expected to generate sufficient funds to pay interest during the
construction period. The balance of the local costs for the port would be
financed as follows: grants from the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro
US$10.5 million, loans from the Investment Bank of Titograd (IBT) and the
Federal Directorate for Reserves of Food Stuffs (the Directorate) US$17.0 mil-
lion and PBE's internally generated funds US$2.0 million. For the railways,
RTE Belgrade would finance the balance of US$4.5 million and has agreed to
guarantee cost overruns (Loan Agreement, Recital (M) and Subsidiary Loan
Agreement, Section 3.03 (b)). IBT would guarantee cost overruns for the port
facilities. The Serbian and Montenegrin Governments have agreed to make their
respective grants and local loan agreements between PBE, IBT and Directorate,
all in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank, are about to be executed.
Authorization or ratification of all of these agreements would be conditions
of loan effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Section 7.01).
Procuirement
48.       Procurement would be on the basis of international competitive bid-
ding in accordance with Bank Group's "Guidelines for Procurement". The major
infrastructure, service and storage items would be procured through civil works
contracts and wharf cranes, bulk handling equipment, mobile mechanical handling
equipment and tug boats, each with an initial stock of spare parts, through
supply contracts. Most equipment financed under the Bank loan would be pro-
cured from abroad. For the purpose of bid comparison, a preference of 15
percent of the CIF landed price of imported goods or the actual custom duty,
whichever is lower, would be given to local manufacturers who qualify as
preferred bidders. There are competent contractors for civil and marine works
in Yugoslavia. It is therefore doubtful wlhether overseas contractors would be
interested, even in the larger contracts , except possibly in joint ventures
with Yugoslav contractors. Prequalification of bidders would be desirable to
confine bidding to reliable and experienced contractors. PBE has agreed that
prequalification would be applied for all civil works contracts estimated to
cost more than US$3.0 million. Experienced foreign suppliers and contractors
are well represented in Yugoslavia and local competitive bidding would apply
for works contracts under US$1.0 million and supply contracts under US$200,000.
Disbursement
49.       Disbursement is expected to start early in 1975, except for technical
assistance. For port facilities, disbursement would be made on the basis of:
(i) 100 percent of the CIF landed cost of imported goods or of the ex-factory
prices for goods procured locally; (ii) 100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of consulting services; (iii) 100 percent of interest during construction



- 14 -
on the Bank loan; and (iv) 57 percent of applicable civil works contracts.
The Bank would not disburse for land acquisition, accommodation (hostel and
apartments), or dredging, which are governed by local regulations or are the
continuation of existing contracts. For railway facilities the Bank would
disburse 55 percent of all expenditures and 100 percent of interest during
construction on the Bank loan. The disbursement schedule on the Bank loan is
given in Annex III. Any surplus funds in the loan account after the project
has been completed would be cancelled. As recommended in para 43, disbursement
would be made for up to US$100,000 against expenditures incurred after January
1, 1974 for consultants' services.
Environment
50.       The proposed expansion of the port is in accordance with the general
zoning plan of the Commune of Bar. PBE had an environmental study carried out
in connection with the project and is taking measures to prevent possible
coastal and marine pollution through bilge water discharge and oil spill. The
project is not expected to have any adverse effects on the existing environment.
Financial Position
51.       PBF's financial results for 1971 and 1972 showed small operating
losses due to the low level of traffic relative to tthe capacity and also to
poor operating procedures. During the construction period and in the subse-
quent years when traffic will rise dramatically, earnings are expected to in-
crease significantly; first until 1976 due to initial traffic increase and
improvement of operating procedures, and after 1978 when the assets under
the project would be used to capacity. The operating ratio will improve
from 85 percent in 1973 to 64 percent in 1976 and 57 percent in 1980. In-
terest and debt service ratios would be satisfactory reaching 2.8:1 times
and 2:1 times, respectively, in 1976 and 1980 and the rate of return on aver-
age net fixed assets will rise from 2.3 percent in 1973 to 8.7 percent in 1976
and 9.8 percent in 1980. Ilowever, these projections assume, and PBE has agreed
to ensure, that depreciation would be charged on breakwaters and wharves starting
January 1, 1976 (Loan Agreement, Section 5.04).    Expected debt/equity ratios would
be acceptable, reaching 53:47 in 1978 and declining to 48:52 in 1980.
52.       PBE plans to invest an additional US$14.5 million between 1978 and
1980 to meet the projected traffic demand after 1980. On the basis of the
financial projections, it will be able to finance, out of its revenues, all
but US$3.3 million of the planned investment.    PBE has agreed that it would
achieve an operating ratio of not more than 70 percent by 1976 (Loan Agree-
ment, Section 5.06), and that tariffs would be set at a level which would
enable PBE to earn a minimum rate of return on its average fixed assets of 4
percent between the year following the opening of the Belgrade-Bar line and
1980, and a minimum rate of 8 percent thereafter (Loan Agreement, Section
5.07). It was also agreed that PBE would not incur any additional long-term
debt unless its net income for the fiscal year is at least 1.5 times the maxi-
mum debt service requirements of any succeeding year on all its long-term debt,
including the debt to be incurred (Loan Agreement, Section 5.05), and that



- 15 -
during the period through 1980 it would not undertake any investments other
than those envisaged in the 1974-80 program, except for small items not ex-
ceeding US$400,000 annually (Loan Agreement, Section 4.07).
Tariffs
53.       PBE's tariffs have generally been lower than those of Rijeka and
Koper by 10-15 percent, reflecting the weaker competitive position of the
former. However, after 1976 when opening of the Belgrade-Bar railway will
substantially increase traffic at Bar, PBE's improved competitive position
would enable it to charge the level of tariffs comparable to those of Rijeka
and Koper. On this assumption the requirements in the rate covenant (para.
52) are realistic. The present tariff structure of PBE does not fully reflect
costs, partly because of the lack of adequate cost information. This is being
studied (see para 39) and PBE has agreed that a cost based tariff structure
would be prepared before January 1, 1976, for review with the Bank prior to
its implementation (Loan Agreement, Section 5.08).
Justification
54.       Linking the port of Bar and the Belgrade-Bar railway line would
achieve an important objective of transport policy to connect the mountainous
and relatively isolated regions of the south western Yugoslavia with more
industrialized areas to the north and east. It would also provide the indus-
trial centers in Serbia and Vojvodina with closer access to a major sea port
in Yugoslavia. The opening of the Belgrade-Bar railway is expected to facil-
itate economic and social development of the traffic zone along the line.
The proposed expansion of port of Bar under the project, represents the least
cost solution to meet the projected traffic demand consequent upon the opening
of the Belgrade-Bar railway.
55.       The quantifiable benefits of the project would consist primarily of
savings in overland transport cost for goods imported to and exported from
eastern Yugoslavia, savings in port operating costs, and net revenues from
transit traffic. It is estimated that by 1980 users' financial savings would
amount to about US$6.6 million per year, equivalent to one-third of the aver-
age cost of inland transport to the northern Adriatic ports. The project
would have an economic rate of return of 13 percent. The project would create
employment for about 800 for port workers in Montenegro, one of the less-
developed regions in Yugoslavia. Improvements in PBE's financial position
through the project would also raise the wage levels of the port workers.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
56.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Port of Bar Enter-
prise, draft Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Port of Bar Enterprise
and the Railway Transport Enterprise, Belgrade, the draft Guarantee Agree-
ment between the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Bank, the



- 16 -
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the pro-
posed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
57.       Features of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements of special interest
are referred to in paragraphs 44, 47, and 52 of this Report.
58.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOM1ENDATIONS
59.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -/
L.oan 531 Belgrade-Bar Railway: US$50.0 million Loan of March 22, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The completion of this project was originally scheduled for 1973
but geo-technical and other construction difficulties in mountainous terrain
are expected to delay operation of the line at least until 1976. The Closing
Date has been postponed from December 31, 1973 to December 31, 1975.
As a result of inflation and cost overruns, the total project cost
has increased from $295.5 million to $290.0 million. There is at present a
financing gap of about $35 million. The Federal Government and the Republican
Governments of Serbia and Montenegro have already taken some measures to close
this gap so that financing for all the works to be carried out in 1974, as
well as part of works in 1975, is identified.    The necessary financing for
the balance of work to complete the project is expected to be secured in the
course of this year.
Loan 654 Industrial Projects - 1970: US$e18.5 millioni Loan of January 1970;
Closing Date: July 31, 1974.
All three sub-projects under the loan have been substantially com-
pletecl. The Closing Date was postponed from June 30 to December 31, 1973,
to allow payments of 10 percent retention money under already concluded con-
tracts of Crvena Zastava and Sisak, and a second time on December 28, 1973 by
seven :montias to July 31, 1974, to allow final disbursements of guaranteed
payr.~ents. The disbursements have beeni substantially completed and the remain-
ing balance is expected to be cancelled shortly.
Loan 657 Telecommunications:   US$40.0 million Loan of February 20, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1'075.
Delays in civil works have occuirred which will delay completion of
tile project until late 1975. With the exception of the earth satellite sta-
tion, only preliminrary works have been completed.   A cost overrun for orders
already placed amounting to US$5.1 million, is expected due to currency reval-
uations.  Fo].lowing a revision of the disbursement schedule, disbursements
are now in line with the revised projections.
1/   ThLese notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them.  They should be read in this sense, and with understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 678 Fourth liighway: US$40.0 million Loan of lMay 28, 1970;
Closing D)ate: December 31, 1975
After an initial delav of about one year in starting work on the
Sarajevo-Zenica section because of difficulties in acquiring the right-of-way,
work on all sections is proceeding satisfactorily and six of the nine sections
have been substantially completed.   Ilowever, due to delays on the remaining
sections, the Closing Date has been postponed from June 30, 1974 to December
31, 1975.
Inflation and the delays in starting construction caused an increase
over tthe appraisal cost estimate of about 10 percent. On the basis of a re-
vised cost estinmate of construction work in January 1973 the disbursement
percentage was revised from 43 to 40 percent, effective March 1, 1973. Dis-
bursement is proceeding in line with the revised projection.
Loan 751 Fifthi Highway:  US$35.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date: September 1, 1976.
After a delay of about eight months in fulfilling the conditions
for effectiveness of the loan, construction work is now making satisfactory
progress on all sections. A 10 percent increase in the appraisal cost esti-
mate is expected, and the disbursement percentage will be revised on the
basis of more accurate revised cost estimates. Disbursements under the loan
are about one year behind the appraisal estimate.
Loan 752 Bernardin Tourism: US$10.0 million of Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date; June 30, 1976.
There have been delays in implementation of the project due to
delays in making the loan effective, appointing consultants, providing the
necessary infrastructure and approvals by local authorities. As a result
disbursements are behind schedule. Bids received in July 1974 indicate that
the project, if it were to be implemented as originally envisaged (2,500 beds)
would cost approximatelv US$55 million instead of US$24 million. This in-
crease is mainlv due to rapid inflation, but also to realignment in exchange
rates. Unilv a project of at least 1,600 beds would be economically viable
and this would require additional financing of US$16 million. The borrower
is presently trving to secure these funds.
Loan 777 Ibar Multipurpose Water: US$45.0 million Loan of June 30, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The start of project wok was delayed for one year. Ilowever, the
responsible agency, the Ibar-Lepenac Enterprise, is now well established and
good progress is being made in constructing the project. It should be pos-
sible to complete most of the project by the end of 1976 (i.e., one year later
than originally planned). Disbursements are proceeding in line with the re-
vised schedule.

Loan 782 Babin Kuk Tourismi:  US$20.0 million Loan of Julv 21, 1971;
Closing Date: July 31, 1976.
There have been delays in the implementation of the project due to
delays in making the loan effective and in mobilizing consultants.   According-
ly disbursements are behind schedule. Although these problemis have now been
largely resolved, the project is almost two years behinicd schedule.  Bids for
civil works and estimates for otlher components indlicate that the project would
cost at least twice as muchi as originallv estimated. This increase is largelv
clue to rapid inflation and also to realignmernt in exchange rates. As only
limiited additional funds mav be available, there is a need to reduce the
scope of the project. The economic viability of a reduced project is pre-
sently under study.
Loan 836 Power Transmission:  US$75.0( million Loan of June 23, 1972;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1977.
The project execution is about one vear beiniiid schedule mainly
because of coordination difficulties and inherent delays in reaching agree-
mrent a- on- 12 borrowers.  All main contracts lhave now been awarded and manage-
ment consultants would also commence work in November 1974 to help improve
plannijug, operation and 'management of the interconnected power system.  Dis-
bizrsements are proceediing in line with the revised schedule.
On Julv 10, 1974 an Accession and Amending Agreement was signed
between the Bank and the eleven original borrowers, JUGEIL and electric power
enterprise ()SIJEL, allowing the latter to become the twelfth borrower.
Loan 894 Agricultural Industries (Macedonia):   US$31 million Loan of May 25, 1973;
Closini Date:  Decenmber 31  1978.
This loan became efiective on Aovernber 28, 1973. A recent super-

Closirng Date:  June23. l9 77
This loan became effective on Mlarch 22, 1974, after almost six
rontLhs' delay.  L ids received on pipes andl equipment greatl_ exceeded appraisal
estimat:es and civi I work.s costs: have increased so that project costs are now
abouL 93 percenit above the appraisal estimate. Additional local finance for
civil works is being arranged but little additiornal foreign finance for pipes
and equtipmcnt is available.  The Bank is working with thie Borrower to devise
a reduced pro-ject.

Closing Date: March 31, 1978.
This loan was declared effective on Ilay 28, 1974 after four months
delay, which was primarily due to tihe extra time required for the ratification
of the Guarantee Agreement by the Federal Assembly. The implementation of the

Procurement              Plrocurement would be on the basis of international
Arrangements:            competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Croup's
'Guidelines for Procurement."   The major infrastructure,
service and storage items would be procured through
civil works contracts and wharf cranes, bulk handling
equipment, mobile mechanical handling equipment and
tug boats each with an initial stock of spare parts
through supply contracts. Most equipment financed
under the Bank loan would be procured from abroad.
Yugoslavia has no preference treaties and bids would
be compared on a CIF basis net of customs duties.
For the purpose of bid comparison, a preference of
15 percent of the CIF landed price of imported goods
or the actual custom duty, whichever is lower, would
be given to local manufacturers who qualify as pre-
ferred bidders. Experienced foreign suppliers and
contractors are well represented in Yugoslavia and
local competitive bidding would apply for works con-
tracts under US$1.0 million and supply contracts
under US$200,000.
