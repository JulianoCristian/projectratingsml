However, its contribution to Gross Domestic product\n            (GDP) and exports has decreased significantly since\n            independence. The decline in agricultural production was\n            attributed to a complex set of problems stemming from (a)\n            organizational and institutional weaknesses; (b)\n            macroeconomic circumstances; (c) misallocation of public\n            finances; and (d) transportation and communication\n            difficulties. In an effort to tackle these problems the\n            government launched the 1982 agricultural action plan and\n            requested International Development Association (IDA) to\n            fund technical assistance to carry out the plan. The project\n            was designed to (i) strengthen the institutional framework\n            of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD);\n            (ii) strengthen MARD capacity to effectively implement\n            agricultural projects; and (iii) assist the government in\n            its efforts to address key policy issues which affected the\n            performance of the agricultural sector."}, "docdt": "1992-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
