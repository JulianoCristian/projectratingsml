sustainability and a\n            substantial institutional development impact. Both bank and\n            borrower performance is considered satisfactory. The\n            development of new or less costly technology had a positive\n            impact on project implementation, while frequent turnover of\n            government control disrupted continuity. Lessons learned\n            include: a) projects that promote a cultural shift within\n            government succeed better if the overall environment of\n            societal change support them; b) complexity of the project\n            has to be commensurate with the capacity of the borrower; c)\n            adequate supervision is important; d) World Bank and Project\n            Implementation Units (PIUs) are not neutral, but rather can\n            impact internal institutional dynamics; e) continuity of key\n            personnel is important and helps; f) World Bank's\n            current focus on outcomes as opposed to outputs is an\n            improvement over the previous style of project design; g)\n            environmental management is a highly political topic that\n            poses project risks; h) risk-taking in institutional\n            development can pay off; i) institutional sustainability can\n            be through of differently; j) environmental education is\n            low-cost and high-return and k) adequately aligning sectoral\n            and environmental objectives, particularly in the sectoral\n            ministries, is crucial for success."}, "docdt": "2000-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
