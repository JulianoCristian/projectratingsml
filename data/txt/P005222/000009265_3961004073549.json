A center for training in the\n            management of health and family planning services will be\n            established at a national level. RHCs constitute the\n            cornerstone of the Iranian health care delivery system in\n            rural areas. They provide comprehensive Primary Health Care\n            (PHC) services and are essential to the development and\n            operation of outreach services. The project will provide the\n            necessary civil works, equipment and furniture, transport\n            facilities, training and salaries to establish 623 RHCs in\n            14 provinces. The project will assist in rapidly expanding\n            the Government's family planning program and\n            strengthening its institutional base. Services will be\n            provided through the primary health care network. The family\n            planning component will have four parts: (1) diversifying\n            the contraceptive method mix and expanding family planning\n            services; (2) building the Ministry's institutional\n            capacity at central and provincial levels to plan, manage\n            and deliver family planning services; (3) developing\n            information-education-communication capabilities to reach\n            target groups; and (4) establishing a capacity for program\n            evaluation and research in family planning through the use\n            of specific studies. The project will examine the fee\n            structure, the private sector role in tertiary care, and\n            establishing a national medical insurance scheme."}, "docdt": "1993-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
