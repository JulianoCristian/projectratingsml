World Bank\n            performance is considered unsatisfactory, although Bank\n            management and staff were very responsive in giving good\n            quality sector advise and in providing assistance to resolve\n            project implementation issues in a timely manner. Borrower\n            performance overall was also unsatisfactory despite\n            Government cooperation because unfamiliarity with Bank\n            policies, guidelines and procedures, and conflicts between\n            these conditions and Iranian laws and administrative\n            procedures, obstructed senior Government officials to take\n            timely actions to expedite project implementation. Lessons\n            learned were described broadly as recognizing the need for\n            rigorous sector analysis where Bank knowledge of a sector is\n            minimal as well as rigorous institutional and capacity\n            analysis at all levels of implementation; and being willing\n            to invest adequate resources. Some specific lessons focused\n            on involving all key partners in project preparation; and\n            developing a sound project implementation plan owned by the\n            Borrower for each component while building capacity of\n            counterpart staff."}, "docdt": "2002-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
