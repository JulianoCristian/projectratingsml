restricting or limiting any other right, power or remedy of the Bank under the
Loan Agreement, by notice to the Borrower, cancel such amount of the Loan

SCHEDULE 4
Procurement
With respect to any contract for highway construction, improvement or
paving:
1.    (a)   Bidders shall be required to prequalify, and a period of not less
than 45 days shall be given to contractors for presentation of prequalification
documents.
(b)   The Borrower shall, before qualification is invited, inform the Bank
in detail of the procedure to be followed and shall introduce such modifications
in said procedure as the Bank shall reasonably request. The list of prequalified
bidders, together with a statement of their qualifications and of the reasons for
the exclusion of any applicant for prequalification, shall be furnished by the
Borrower to the Bank for its comments before the applicants are notified and
the Borrower shall make such additions or deletions from the said list as the Bank
shall reasonably request.
2.    (a)   Before bids are invited, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank,
for its comments, the text of the invitations to bid and the specifications and
other bidding documents, together with a description of the advertising procedures
to be followed for the bidding, and shall make such modifications in the said
documents or procedure as the Bank shall reasonably request. Any further
modification to the bidding documents shall require the Bank's concurrence before
it is issued to the prospective bidders.
(b)   Without limitation on the generality of the foregoing:
(i)         For bidding purposes, highways included in Part A of the Project
shall be divided into sections and packages formed of appropriate
sections, and qualified contractors shall be permitted to bid for
one or more such sections and/or for one or more such packages.
Contracts shall be awarded for the lowest evaluated bid for each
section. In the case of packages, contracts shall be awarded either
on the basis of the lowest evaluated bid for each package, or
on the basis of the lowest aggregate total of evaluated bids for
the Sections included in such package, whichever is lower.
(ii)        Non-Brazilian contractors shall not be required to register in
Brazil as a prerequisite for submitting bids. In the event that


﻿25
registration shall be necessary after a non-Brazilian contractor
has been awarded a contract, the Borrower shall facilitate the
registration.
(iii)        Prequalified contractors shall be given a period of not less than
45 days for submission of bids. Bids shall be accompanied by
a bid bond or guarantee of not less than 2% of the proposed
contract amount.
3.    After bids have been received and evaluated, the Borrower shall, before
a final decision on the award is made, inform the Bank of the name of the bidder
to whom it intends to award the contract and shall furnish to the Bank, in sufficient
time for its review, a detailed report, including comments by the consultants
referred to in paragraph 3 of Schedule 6 to this Agreement, on the evaluation
and comparison of the bids received, together with the recommendations for award
of the said consultants, and the reasons for the intended award. The Bank shall,
if it determines that the intended award would be inconsistent with the procedures
set forth or referred to in Section 2.03 of this Agreement, promptly inform the
Borrower and state the reasons for such determination.
4.    (a)   Contracts shall be on a unit price basis and shall include:
i)          A price escalation clause, including appropriate formulae
for different work items with the provision that the
corresponding indices will be published periodically by the
Vargas Foundation.
(ii)        An obligation to provide (A) a performance guarantee in
the amount of 10% of the contract value, or an equivalent
deposit in Brazilian Treasury bonds with monetary
correction, or (B) alternatively, at the contractor's option,
a performance bond in the amount of 100% of the
contract value, such guarantee, deposit or bond to remain
in effect at least until the provisional reception of the
works.
(iii)       A provision for retention money or an equivalent deposit
in Brazilian Treasury bonds with monetary correction, in
the amount of 5% of the contractor's monthly statements.
After the provisional reception of the works covered by
the contractor's contract, or of any portion thereof, 50%
of such retention money or of such deposit in Brazilian


﻿26
Treasury bonds shall be returned to the contractor, and
the balance shall be retained for one year after such
reception. At the contractor's option, such balance may
be replaced by a bank guarantee or a surety bond in the
identical amount.
(iv)        A provision that non-Brazilian contractors will be entitled
to convert into foreign exchange a reasonable portion of
contract payments.
(b)   The terms and conditions of the contract shall not, without the Bank's
concurrence, materially differ from those on which bids were asked.
(c)   Two conformed copies of the contract shall be furnished to the Bank
promptly after its execution and prior to the submission to the Bank of the first
application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect of any
such contract.
(d)   The Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause contracts with
non-Brazilian firms to be registered with Banco Central do Brasil no later than
60 days after execution of such contracts by the parties thereto.
