BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Since 1964 the Bank has had a continuing exchange of views with
the Government of Brazil regarding the improvement and extension of the
transport system. Following the Bank's recommendation, a Transport Survey
was launched in 1965 with financial assistance by UNDP, USAID and the Bank,
the survey was carried out in two stages. Based on the findings and recom-
mendations of this Survey, the Bank is participating in the financing of
two highway construction projects (567-BR, October 1968, US$26 million, and
676-BR, May 1970, US$100 million), a railway project (786-BR, August 1971,
US$46 million), and a port project (756-BR, June 1971, US$45 million).
Progress on the two highway projects is satisfactory; the railway project
is progressing reasonably satisfactorily although some elements are delayed,
and the studies which form the basis for implementation of the port project
are proceeding.
ii.       Prior to Loan 567-BR in October 1968, the Government submitted a
Plan of Action (PA-1) summarizing its transport objectives and giving
schedules for action on highways, railroads and ports. Prior to Loan
676-BR in May 1970, the Government submitted another Plan of Action (PA-2)
outlining the measures necessary to bring about further improvements in
the transport sector. The progress toward attainment of the objectives in
individual modes has been varied, with satisfactory results in highways
(Annexes 2 and 3), and slower progress in railways and ports (para. 2.05).
The activity of GEIPOT as transport coordinating agency has not been success-
ful, but the Government has now confirmed to the Bank its intention to
strengthen GEIPOT's operations and to adopt satisfactory transport coordi-
nation policies.
iii.      This report appraises a highway construction program consisting
of: (a) construction and paving (and consultants for supervision) of 2,530 km
of highways comprised of two Groups -- Group A of 1,849 km and Group B of
681 km, (b) consulting services for detailed engineering of 1,626 km and
feasibility studies of 2,584 km of highways, and for further improving methods
of construction supervision, and (c) international experts for the highway
training center of the National Highway Department (DNER). The total cost
of this program is estimated at US$350 million equivalent. The Government,
with the agreement of the Bank, is examining the possibility of obtaining
separate financial assistance from sources other than the Bank for con-
struction works under Group B.
iv.       The project for which a Bank loan of US$89 m.illion is now proposed
includes all the above program with the exception of the construction and
corresponding supervision of Group B highways. The cost of the project is
estimated at US$221 million equivalent, and the loan will finance 40% of



- ii -
the cost of construction (including supervision) and consultants for
engineering and studies, and the actual foreign cost of consultants and
experts for improving construction supervision and for the highway training
Center. The foreign exchange cost of the project is estimated at US$26
million equivalent; the loan will therefore finance about US$63 million of
local expenditures.
v.        Execution of the project will be the responsibility of the National
Highway Department. The loan will be made to the Federal Government, and
DNER, as executing agency, will administer a revolving fund for payment to
contractors and consultants.
vi.       Construction contracts will be let on the basis of international
competitive bidding. The National Highway Department has prequalified
contractors and is calling for bids.
vii.      Internal economic returns for the roads in the program range from
13% to 40%, with an average for the whole program of 19%. The range of
internal economic returns for the project to be financed by the proposed
loan is also 13% to 40X, with an average of 24% for the whole project.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for Bank lending of US$89
million equivalent. On the basis of the average useful life of road con-
struction works and length of construction period, the appropriate term
would be 25 years, including a four-year period of grace.



BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Brazil has requested financial assistance for a
program consisting of: (a) the construction and paving of 2,530 km of highways,
(b) the supervision for the proposed works, (c) additional consulting ser-
vices for detailed engineering of 1,626 km and feasibility studies of 2,584
km of highways, and for further improvement of DNER's supervision of con-
struction, and (d) international experts for DNER's highway training center.
1.02      On the Bank's recommendation, a general Transport Survey was
launched in 1965 with the assistance of foreign consultants (para. 2.04).
Based on the findings and recommendations of the Transport Survey, the Bank
is participating in the financing of the First Highway Construction Project
(Loan 567-BR, October 1968, US$26 million) and the Second Highway Construction
Project (Loan 676-BR, May 1970, US$100 million). The two projects cover
about 2,600 km of construction and/or paving, 2,900 km of detailed engineer-
ing, and 3,100 km of feasibility studies. Both projects are progressing
satisfactorily; as of November 30, 1971, the First Project was about 90%
complete and the Second Project 31% complete.
1.03      Other Bank projects in the transportation sector included two
railroad projects financed by Loans 65-BR and 92-BR (US$12.5 million each)
in 1952 and 1953, covering the rehabilitation of the Central do Brasil fa-
cilities and the purchase of new rolling stock. A highway maintenance proj-
ect was financed by Loan 75-BR (US$3 million) in 1953 covering the purchase
of maintenance equipment for the State of Rio de Janeiro. All of the above
loans have been fully disbursed. Loan 756-BR (US$45 million) was signed in
June 1971; this loan is to assist in the financing of a five-year program
for the improvement and expansion of the Santos port. A Federal Railway
Project of US$46 million equivalent (Loan 786-BR) was signed on August 25,
1971; it covers the railway component of a mining complex for the exploitation
and export of iron ore.
1.04      This report has been prepared by Messrs. Schaefer (Engineer) and
Kanaan (Economist) who appraised the project in June/July and December 1971.



2-
2. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2.01      With an area of 8.5 million km2, Brazil is the fifth largest
country in the world. Population in 1970 was 93.5 million, growing at about
2.9% p.a. which will mean a total of about 120 million in 1980. Overall
population density is low, at about 11 per. km2, but there are wide regional
variations ranging from 3,000 per kmZ in the coastal regions of the States
of Guanabara and Sao Paulo to less than one per km2 in the Amazonas. The
vast natural resources which the country possesses make for great potential
in agricultural and industrial growth.
2.02      Rapid economic growth is one of the Government's main objectives.
Planners are working with rates of 8-10%, and the Bank's 1971 economic
report concluded that an 8-9% level of growth is possible. If the present
population growth trend is maintained, an 8.5% growth rate would permit a
5.5% rate of increase in per capita income. GDP would grow from US$37 bil-
lion equivalent in 1970 to US$83 billion equivalent in 1980, with per capita
GDP increasing from about US$400 to over US$670.
2.03      The Government has emphasized transport development to go hand in
hand with its economic growth targets. Efficient transport is needed to
open up new lands and to move agricultural products from the interior to
coastal consumption centers and ports of export; manufactured products need
to be transported in the opposite direction.
B.   Transport Policy and Coordination
2.04      Since 1964 the Bank has had a continuing exchange of views with
the Government of Brazil on improving and extending the transport system.
In 1965 the Government started a Transport Survey which was carried out by
consultants in two phases. Phase I, covering highway transport in four
states, railway transport, coastal shipping, and port operations in the three
main ports, was completed in 1967; a Bank grant of US$1.5 million shared the
foreign exchange costs with the Government. Phase II, covering highway trans-
port in fourteen states, was started in 1967 and completed in 1970. Phase II
foreign exchange costs were financed by UNDP (US$1.4 million), USAID (US$1.0
million) and the Government (US$1.4 million). The Bank acted as executing
agency for the UNDP. Local costs of both phases were financed by the
Government. The main recommendations from these studies are summarized in
Annex 1.
2.05      Both phases of the Survey were conditioned on the Government agree-
ing to Memoranda of Understanding on steps for improving transport services.
Prior to Loan 567-BR, the Government submitted a Plan of Action (PA-1) summa-
rizing its transport objectives and giving schedules for action on highways,



-3-
railways and ports. This plan has now been implemented (Annex 2). Prior to
Loan 676-BR, the Government submitted another Plan of Action (PA-2) outlining
the measures required to bring about further improvements in the transport
sector. Progress on implementing the objectives of this plan varies between
modes. In highways, progress has been satisfactory and major achievements
to date are reorganization of DNER, reorganization of a number of state high-
way departments (DERs), delegation of DNER's maintenance functions to the
DERs in four states, strengthening of DNER's planning capacity, and improve-
ment of construction supervision (Annex 3). The major changes that remain
to be accomplished are further delegation of maintenance operations to the
states, and progressive delegation of construction to those states where the
delegation of maintenance has been completed. In railways, progress has been
slower than expected, but the problems are complex and the Bank's involve-
ment is relatively recent. Achievements are: reductions in the number of
employees; closing of most of the uneconomic lines; preparation of corporate
plans (to be ready in mid-1972); and consolidation of the Sao Paulo railway
system (to be achieved by mid-1972). Major issues remaining are the
integration of the Federal Railways System and the Sao Paulo State Railways,
the restructuring of tariffs so as to reflect costs along the lines of the
study recently completed, the closing of the remaining uneconomic lines, and
the implementation of the corporate plans when they are completed. Progress
in ports, where Bank's involvement is also recent, has also been slower than
expected. The reorganization study which will be the basis for improvements
in operations and planning and for establishing cost-based tariffs, started
in December 1971 and, although several months behind schedule, is progressing
satisfactorily. However, the international experts whose services have
been financed under the Santos Port Project to help the Government in the
preparation of an overall ports plan have not yet been employed. For the
sector as a whole, the slowness of GEIPOT to address itself to the issues
of transport coordination, which was the main task assigned to it after its
reorganization in 1969, has affected all the modes. (para. 2.06).
2.06      GEIPOT, a Government agency, was established in 1965 to provide
counterparts and facilities, as well as to coordinate and supervise the
Transport Survey. When the Survey was completed, GEIPOT was made a perma-
nent agency within the Ministry of Transport. It is responsible for pre-
paring national transport policy with a view to coordinating the various
modes of transport and reducing overall transport costs (Chart 1). While
GEIPOT has been doing varied work in the transport field (most of it in
highways), it is only now addressing itself to the important function of
transport coordination. The latter is urgently needed since the agencies
responsible for planning and executing projects in the various modes -
especially highways - have strengthened their planning capabilities and,
in the absence of sectoral coordination by GEIPOT, are tending, individually,
to make projections of transport demand and modal split for the whole sector.
The Government has now confirmed to the Bank its intention that GEIPOT will
increase its staff and will direct its efforts towards coordinating the
various modes and integrating transport policy with national economic and
social strategy.



- 4 -
2.07      There is no administrative allocation of traffic between modes,
and users are free to select the mode of transport which best suits their
requirements.  Entry into the interstate road transport industry requires
DNER approval, but the granting of licenses is practically automatic. Intra-
state trucking operators are licensed by the DERs in the same way.  Bus
companies must apply to DNER or to DERs, prove public need, and file tariffs
and timetables for each route.  On the whole, road transport regulation is
not unduly restrictive.
2.08      In recent years, about one-fourth of total federal fixed investment
expenditures lias been in the transportation sector. In 1970 this repre-
sented about Cr.$ 2,600 million (US$563 million equivalent), of which about
half was spent on highways (Table 1). At the state level, the share of
transportation in total capital expenditure is about the same, and is almost
entirely directed to road construction.
C.   Highways
2.09      Details of the highway sector are given in Chapter 3.
D.   Railways
2.10      The Brazilian railway network comprises about 30,000 route-km, of
which 25,000 km are operated by a federal company (Rede Ferroviaria Federal -
RFFSA) and 5,000 km by a state-coordinated group of companies (Sao Paulo
State Company). In addition, about 600 km are owned and operated by a Govern-
ment mining company (Cia Vale do Rio Doce - CVRD) and carry mostly iron ore
traffic. About 90% of the network is meter gauge. Between 1961 and 1970
railway freight traffic, excluding CVRD, increased from about 11 to 15 bil-
lion ton-km, but passenger traffic declined from 18 to 13 billion pass-km.
Over the same period, the rail share of total freight movements decreased
from 19% to 17%, and passenger traffic from 22% to 7% (Tables 2 and 3).
2.11      Because of the great distances in Brazil, the potential for efficient
rail transport is favorable. Much of the traffic lends itself to efficient
bulk transport in high capacity trains with mechanized loading and unloading.
Forecasts of freight traffic growth indicate potential increases of at least
50% over the next five years, if the railways can be properly equipped, but
capital investment has been extremely low for many years. Costs could be
reduced by rationalizing the route system, by mechanizing track maintenance
and freight handling, and by centralizing workshops, but tariffs must be
raised to reflect costs and increase revenue.
E.   Ports and Coastal Shipping
2.12      There are 35 principal ports in Brazil.  In 1969 total port traf-
fic was about 73 million tons of dry and liquid cargo, including bulk.
Santos, the largest port handling general cargo, moved a total of about
13 million tons. Rio de Janeiro handled about 21 million tons of which
less than 10% was general cargo.



-5-
2.13      There is a National Department of Ports and Waterways (DNPVN)
within the Ministry of Transport. This organization is over-centralized
and lacks the flexibility of operation which is essential in the maritime
trade. The Government is aware of the need to improve DNPVN and port
administration generally. As part of the loan agreement of 756-BR for the
Santos port, the Government has embarked on a program to decentralize and
reorganize the administration of the major ports -- specifically, under the
Bank project, to improve administration, management, accounting systems,
and planning in the port of Santos. Once the Santos improvements are
effective, the new techniques will be introduced to other Brazilian ports.
2.14      Between 1961 and 1970, coastal shipping freight transport by pub-
lic and private carriers increased from about 14 to 25 billion ton-km,
while passenger transport remained negligible. In relation to total movements,
coastal shipping freight transport decreased from 18% to 14% during the
1961-70 period (Tables 2 and 3).
F.   Air Transport
2.15      Because of increasing economic activity among the many large and
widely separated urban centers, air transport is being used increasingly.
The major commercial airline company (VARIG) has extensive national and
international networks. Other airline companies of national importance
are CRUZEIRO DO SUL, VASP and SADIA. Between 1961 and 1970, traffic in-
creased from about 3 billion to about 4 billion pass-km, representing about
2% of total passenger transport (Table 3). Air cargo transport is negligible.
3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A.   The Highway Network-Traffic and Vehicle Fleet
3.01      Brazil has a total highway network of about 951,000 km, of which
52,000 km are national and 121,000 km are state highways. The balance of
778,000 km, or 82% of the network, are provincial roads which are mainly
earth roads or mere tracks. About 47% of the national and 18% of the state
highways are paved (Table 4). During the last four years DNER, as well as
most DERs, have put emphasis on paving their networks. Since 1967, an
average of 2,300 km of national and 1,300 km of state roads have been paved
annually (Table 5).
3.02      Tables 6 and 7 show the relationship between area, population,
motor vehicle registration and length of paved and unpaved highways in each
state or federal territory. Except in the states of Sao Paulo and Guanabara,
only a small percentage of the national and state highway network is paved.
Nearly all unpaved roads show poor design characteristics, and paving them
must almost always be combined with some improvement to alignment.



-6-
3.03      Road freight traffic grew between 1961 and 1970 at about 11% per
annum, resulting in an increase of the share of roads in total freight move-
ment over the period from 62% to about 69% (120 billion ton-km, Table 2).
For the same period, the road share of total passenger traffic rose from 74%
to 91% (170 billion pass-km, Table 3). Road traffic growth is expected to
continue at present rates for a time (reflecting Brazil's sustained growth
rate), but to taper off by the 1980's. The total vehicle fleet in 1970 was
estimated at about 3.5 million, with about 83% cars and pick-ups, 15% trucks,
and 2% buses (Table 8). About 62% of the truck fleet is 1- to 7-ton
capacity and is gasoline-powered, about 35% is 4- to 14-ton capacity and
diesel-powered, and about 3% is 2- and 3-axle tractor-trailer diesel-powered
(Table 9). Growth of the vehicle fleet has averaged 13% per annum (Table 10).
Practically all vehicle needs are met by domestic production, and future growth
of the fleet will not have to be limited by productive capacity.
B.   Highway Administration
3.04      The National Highway Department (Departamento Nacional de Estradas
de Rodagem - DNER), under the Ministry of Transport, administers the nation-
al highway network (Chart 2). Maintenance and construction is done through
20 district offices kone in each of the states, except Guanabara and Acre);
roads in the three federal territories are administered from neighboring
states. Each of the 22 states has a state highway department (Departamento
de Estradas de Rodagem - DER) responsible for its highway network.
3.05      DNER's activities have in the past been too centralized, with
wasteful duplication of services between the National and State Highway
Departments, especially in the more developed states. Government policy
is now to transfer maintenance and construction functions gradually from
DNER to the DERs, thus enabling DNER to concentrate on planning and overall
supervision.
3.06      Plans of Action PA-1 and PA-2, submitted by the Government prior
to Loans 567-BR and 676-BR respectively, contained objectives regarding
reorganization of highway administration. Considerable progress in reorga-
nizing DNER has since been achieved. In 1968, Brazilian management consult-
ants -- Getulio Vargas Foundation -- completed the first phase of a
reorganization study, which resulted in recommendations being made for DNER's
new administrative structure (Chart 2 and Annex 4); enabling legislation was
passed in March 1969. The consultants are now developing the new administra-
tive framework. Under a USAID loan, US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
experts are assisting in the technical aspects of the reorganization of DNER.
3.07      To enable it to plan the development of the entire Brazilian high-
way network, DNER needed a competent planning division. Under the Second
Bank Highway Project, teams of Brazilian and foreign transport economists
were engaged, and considerable progress is being made in systematic planning
and programming (including the updating of the original Master Plans), as
well as in data processing and budget control (para. 3.30).



-7-
3.08      DNER is establishing a training center for its middle and upper
level professionals, as well as for DER personnel. The center is expected
to start operations by the end of 1972, and the Government is now preparing
an organization plan and an operations program for the first two years;
these will be agreed with the Bank before September 30, 1972. It is likely
that the Brazilian Highway Research Institute (Instituto do Pesquisas
Rodoviarias) will be incorporated into DNER to provide a nucleus for the
training center. While most of the training will be done by Brazilians,
DNER will secure the assistance of international experts in fields where
Brazilian experience is not yet adequate; financing for these services is
included in the project (para. 4.08). The main focus of training will be
to expose staff to technological innovations introduced in Brazil during
and since the Transport Survey. Training will be in the fields of admin-
istration, planning, project preparation, supervision of construction,
bridge design, maintenance, programming and budgeting, and traffic engineer-
ing.
3.09      During the Transport Survey, reorganization studies were conducted
for the main states in Brazil, with a view to increasing the efficiency of
the DERs and thus preparing them for DNER's maintenance and construction func-
tions to be gradually transferred to them. Under PA-1 and PA-2 the Government
indicated that it would ensure that DERs would be gradually reorganized on the
basis of Transport Survey recommendations.
3.10      Considerable progress has been made in reorganizing most of the
DERs covered by the Transport Survey (Annex 4). The organization of the
DER of Minas Gerais is shown on Chart 3 as a typical example of the new
organizational structure.
3.11      Concurrent with the reorganization of DERs, DNER is gradually dele-
gating to them responsibility for maintaining national highways, usually on
the basis of pilot regions (paras. 3.22 and 3.23).  This delegation of main-
tenance operations is progressing satisfactorily.
C.   Highway Engineering
3.12      The design standards used for the engineering of all highway works
included in the program are shown in Tables 11 and 12. They correspond
to the standards adopted for the Bank's First and Second Highway Projects,
and conform with general design standards in Brazil. These standards are
satisfactory.
3.13      The Bank's involvement in transport in Brazil has contributed to
improved engineering practices. Foreign consultants employed during the
Transport Survey introduced new standards and methods and initiated systematic
economic evaluation of projects. Based on the new experience, national consulting
firms are now established in nearly all the major states. While the First
Highway Project was designed and is still being supervised by foreign consul-
tants, all engineering for the Second Project (with the exception of two
expressways in the States of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro) is being carried out



by Brazilian engineers. As a whole, the experience with the new consulting
firms has been satisfactory; some of these firms have extended their acti-
vities to other Latin American countries.
3.14      The regulatory provisions for maximum motor vehicle weight and di-
mensions are satisfactory. The maximum axle load is 10 tons for single
axles and 17 tons for tandem axles. The enforcement of weight regulations
is improving on national roads, but is still unsatisfactory on state roads,
except in the State of Sao Paulo. Twenty-six weighing stations have been
installed by DNER, 37 stations are planned for 1972, and 71 for the period
1973-75. The Government has given assurances that weight regulations on
the national system will be properly enforced.
D.   Highway Construction
3.15      Improvement of the quality of construction and supervision is one
of the most important and most difficult problems in the highway sector.
Ingrained malpractices will be eradicated only by continuous effort by DNER
management.  In the past, poor construction supervision resulted in poor
quality work; long delayed payments to contractors made it impossible for
DNER to enforce contractual work schedules. Although such bad practices are
still found, adherence to proper practices on Bank projects has helped DNER
to improve construction operations on all its highway projects in Brazil, as,
for instance, in applying bidder prequalification to all DNER's projects,
and adopting competitive bidding on unit price contracts for all major works.
3.16      Better construction supervision was one of the objectives of PA-2
(Annex 3), and contract administration has improved noticeably. Consult-
ants are being employed for construction supervision. Five experts from
INGEROUTE (France) are, under the Bank's Second Highway Project, assisting
the construction division of DNER to establish proper controls for construction
programs; they will be supplemented by additional experts for the proposed
Third Project (para. 4.08). Operation manuals are being rewritten with
assistance by FHWA advisors.
3.17      The Brazilian construction industry is competitive and there are
a large number of well organized and experienced local contractors.
Prequalification for the Second Highway Project showed the strength of the
industry. There were 13 firms and joint-ventures qualified for works over
US$20 million, 18 for US$10 - 20 million, 33 for US$4 - 10 million, 22 for
US$1.5 - 4 million, and 19 firms for works less than US$1.5 million. For
the proposed program, 147 Brazilian firms have been prequalified.
3.18      Local construction firms are carrying out about US$600 million
worth of highway construction per year. Including the program appraised
in this report, the Bank's highway program at its peak would add about 20%
to this volume of work, an increase which can be easily absorbed by the
Brazilian construction industry.



- 9 -
3.19      With the exception of the heaviest items (large tractors, scrap-
ers and shovels), construction equipment is manufactured in Brazil. Equipment
suitable for most road building operations - except heavy earth-work - is
therefore readily available.
3.20      Road construction and maintenance figure largely in labor employment.
A recent survey by the Institute of Economic and Social Planning in the
Ministry of Planning showed that most road works are carried out by a mix of
labor and equipment which varies among the regions in which they are executed.
The highest ratios of labor to machinery are found in the north-east where
labor is plentiful and relatively cheap due to scarcity of alternative employ-
ment opportunities; the lowest such ratios are in the south-east where labor
is scarce and expensive because of the availability of alternative employ-
ment. The survey showed that in 1969, 0.5 million workers were directly
employed in road construction and maintenance, equivalent to 20 percent of
total employment in the manufacturing industries. In addition, a large but
undetermined number of jobs will be generated as a result of road con-
struction; this is especially so in the newly opened up areas where the
government has initiated massive colonization programs to solve the unem-
ployment problems which resulted from migration of farm labor away from the
drought-affected agricultural areas of the north-east. It was estimated by
the survey that Bank highway lending in Brazil (the First and Second Highway
Projects under construction, and the proposed program) will provide direct
employment for about 146,000 workers between 1970 and 1973.
E.   Highway Maintenance
3.21      Maintenance has been much neglected in Brazil in the past, but has
now improved considerably, in part through USAID helping several states to
buy new equipment. Under the Transport Survey, consultants carried out
maintenance studies in 18 states, and made recommendations for improving
maintenance methods and operations, listed equipment needs, prepared
maintenance programs and advised on organizational changes.
3.22      Under the Loan Agreements for the First and Second Highway Projects
(Loans 567-BR and 676-BR), the Government undertook to maintain the entire
national network properly. Under the Agreement for Loan 676-BR, the Govern-
ment stated that its maintenance functions would gradually be delegated (and
necessary funds transferred) to those states where project construction works
would be undertaken on state and/or delegated national roads (Minas Gerais,
Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul). Under PA-2, the Government declared
its intention to extend such delegation gradually to all other main states.
3.23      Progress in the delegation of maintenance is satisfactory.  Pilot
regions have been established in the States of Minas Gerais (Map 7), Parana
(Map 11), Santa Catarina (Map 13) and Rio Grande do Sul (Map 15). These
states will maintain all national roads in the pilot regions, with the ex-
ception of one road in Rio Grande do Sul which is being maintained by the



- 10 -
Army, and four sections of interstate highways in Parana which will be dele-
gated later. A more detailed description of the status of highway mainten-
ance in the above states is given in Annex 5. Improvement of maintenance
operations in these regions, with gradual enlargement of the respective areas,
is under study by DNER, as is the establishment of new pilot regions in other
states.
3.24      DNER's increased awareness of the importance of maintenance, the
gradual delegation of maintenance functions to the DERs, and the provision
of adequate resources by the Road Tax (para. 3.26) should lead to further
improvement. The Government has confirmed that it will maintain the whole
national network properly, and has given assurance that delegation of mainten--
ance functions will be extended to those states which demonstrate the ability
to maintain and police their networks.
F.   Highway Financing
3.25      There are two main sources of road user charges in Brazil:  the
Federal Tax on Fuels and Lubricants (Imposto Unico Sobre Combustiveis e
Lubricantes - IUCL) and the Road Tax (Taxa Rodoviaria Federal). Two other
federal taxes, the vehicle insurance tax and a tax on inter-urban bus fares,
are also levied on road users; states and municipalities also impose other
charges but, compared with the IUCL and the Road Tax, total receipts from
all such charges are small.
3.26      The proceeds of the Road Tax are earmarked for road maintenance.
The tax, made uniform for the whole country in 1969, is an annual levy of
about 2% of the assessed value of vehicles. It is distributed 40% to DNER,
40% to the states, and 20% to the municipalities. The Road Tax goes a long
way toward meeting one of the recommendations of the Transport Survey that
users be charged the short-run marginal cost. The exceptions are that
passenger cars continue to pay more and tractor-trailers less than their
corresponding shares. The higher charges on passenger cars are justified
on the basis of redistribution of income, while the lower charges on tractor-
trailers do not cause a great deal of distortion in the overall picture due
to their small proportion of the total fleet (para. 3.03).
3.27      In 1972, proceeds from the IUCL are expected to reach about Cr$ 3,176
million, increasing at 8% per annum. The Road Tax will contribute about
Cr$ 897 million in 1972 and is expected to increase at an annual average of
14% in 1972-74, based on a vehicle fleet growth rate of 10% p.a. The IUCL
will contribute an average of 37% of the total 1972-74 expenditures, and the
Road Tax a further 11%. Other federal and state taxes, as well as state funds
earmarked for highways, will contribute 25%; foreign loans and federal budgetary
support will contribute 27% (Table 13). Revenues from road users cover about
70% of total expenditures on highways (including maintenance, administration
and construction), and substantially exceed the cost of maintaining and
administering the highway system alone.



G.   Highway Planning
3.28      The 25-year National Transport Plan, originally published in 1964,
is the basis for all investments in the sector; it is revised and updated
every five years by the Ministry of Transport. The first revision concern-
ing the highway sector was completed by DNER at the end of 1969 and forwarded
to the Secretariat General of the Ministry of Transport for coordination with
other modes and for approval by the National Council of Transport which is
now examining the plan. Final approval must be given by the National Congress.
3.29      In order to determine annual expenditures for highways, a 1972-74
investment budget has been prepared (Table 13), the greater part of which is
for projects selected from priority lists contained in the Transport Survey
Master Plans. The balance is for low-cost penetration roads - the most im-
portant of which are the Trans-Amazon road and the Cuiaba-Santarem road - to
open up virgin areas in the Amazon basin which were not covered in the
Transport Survey. The three-year budget was passed by the National Congress
and approved by the President in November 1971.
3.30      DNER has continued updating and expanding the Master Plans to en-
sure that highway investment decisions are guided by economic priorities;
its planning division has been expanded by additional permanent staff as well
as by national and foreign advisors. Seven Brazilian economists and four
foreign transport experts are now integrated into planning operations, the
latter financed under the Second Highway Project. Dependable data are
important for updating these Master Plans satisfactorily, and the Government
has given assurance that it will continue to improve and refine its data-
gathering techniques.
4. THE PROJECT
A.   General Description
4.01      The program, identified on the basis of Highway Master Plans
prepared during the Transport Survey, consists of:
(1) the construction and paving of a total of 1,849 km of
national highways (Group A) in the states of Piaui, Paraiba,
Pernambuco, Alagoas, Minas Gerais, Goias, Mato Grosso, Santa
Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, and 681 km of national and
state highways (Group B) in the States of Bahia, Minas Gerais,
Espirito Santo, Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul.
(See Maps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14); 1/
1/ The maps indicate all roads in the program, and do not separate out those
to be financed under the proposed project. To identify the latter, refer
to Table 14, Group A.

(2)  consulting services for supervision of item (1); and
(3) additional consulting services for:
(a) detailed engineering of 1,626 km of selected
road sections;
(b) feasibility studies of 2,584 km of selected road
sections; and
(c) expanding the advisory services provided under the
Second Highway Project for improvement of methods
and procedures of construction supervision.
(4) international experts for the highway ttaining center of
DNER.
The project for which a loan is now proposed consists of the program described
above, excluding Group B of the construction and paving and the corresponding
consulting services for its supervision. The Government, with the agreement
of the Bank, is examining the possibility of obtaining separate financial
assistance for Group B from other sources.
4.02      The lists of roads proposed for construction and/or paving, de-
tailed engineering and feasibility studies, are shown in Tables 14, 15 and
16, respectively. Their regional distribution is as follows - (the first
figure refers to the program, and the figure in parentheses to the proposed
project): 23% (14%) in the south, where increasing agricultural production
is handicapped by the lack of adequate transportation to markets; 22% (11%)
in the south-east; 23% (32%) in the north-east where many priority roads are
already being constructed under the Second Highway Project; and 32% (43%) in
the center-west, a fast developing area where trunk roads are badly needed.
B. Iiighways to be Constructed and/or Paved
4.03      The most important characteristics of the highways for construction
and paving included in the project are given in Table 14. More detailed de-
scriptions are given in Chapter 5 - Economic Evaluation - and in Annex 6.
C.   Consulting Services for Design and Construction Supervision
4.04      Detailed engineering studies for the roads proposed for construc-
tion and paving were carried out under the Second Highway Project. The
studies, which are in accordance with modern engineering principles, are
complete and the quality is satisfactory.
4.05      All detailed engineering was done by Brazilian consultants with the
exception of the northern access to the city of Salvador - Highway BR-324 -
for which a Brazilian-German joint venture was employed. The consultants are
listed in Annex 7.



- 13 -
4.06      To establish continuity of responsibility, the Government has agreed
that consultants who carried out the detailed engineering for highways proposed
for construction and paving should also be employed for construction super-
vision. Signing of the consultants' contracts for supervising Group A will
be a condition for loan effectiveness.
D.   Additional Consulting Services
4.07      With a view to preparing further highway construction projects for
future Bank financing, provision has been made in the project for detailed
engineering of 1,626 km and feasibility studies of 2,584 km of highways.
(Tables 15 and 16). All detailed engineering and feasibility studies, with
the exception of the detailed engineering for the access to Rio de Janeiro
of Highway BR-135, will be carried out by Brazilian consultants.
4.08      Under the Second Highway Project, five international experts from
INGEROUTE (France) are assisting the construction division of DNER to estab-
lish appropriate supervising procedures and to coordinate the various con-
sultants supervising construction (para. 3.16). In order to strengthen DNER's
construction division further, three additional experienced construction
experts will be provided by the same firm during construction of the project
roads. In addition, international experts will be employed to assist DNER in
the formation of a training center for professional personnel both of DNER
itself and of the DERs (para. 3.08).
E.   Cost Estimates and Financing
4.09      The total cost of the program is estimated at US$349.8 million
equivalent, including allowances for quantity and price contingencies; the
total cost of the project to be financed from the proposed loan is US$221.4
million equivalent. A summary of costs of the program (defining project
costs and Bank participation) follows:

4.10      The estimates of construction costs are based on February 1971
estimates converted at the then official exchange rate (Table 14). A 10%
contingency has been added to the construction and supervision costs to
allow for quantity increases. It is estimated that about 20% of the construc-
tion cost represents taxes.
4.11      A major problem in estimating the equivalent U.S. dollar cost of
the project is the relationship between internal inflation of highway con-
struction and engineering prices, and the exchange rate policy of the Go-
vernment. Since the Government has adopted a flexible exchange rate policy,
the risk is small that costs expressed in U.S. dollars would be greatly out
of line. For this project, the Bank's usual loan disbursement procedures
will be followed, and not the procedures adopted for the First and Second
Highway Loans. 1/ A study of trends during the last two years shows a 22%
average yearly increase in highway construction prices. During the same
period, the U.S. dollar exchange rate increased only 16%, the difference
being mainly due to the reduced buying value of the dollar. Based on these
trends, price contingencies have been computed separately for cruzeiro costs
and for equivalent U.S. dollar costs, taking into account the following:
a)   cost estimates were made in February 1971, while the bid
dates for Groups A and B will be in April 1972 and July
1972 respectively, and the commencement of detailed
engineering and feasibility studies will be in June 1972;
b)   cash flow estimates are based on a 32-month period for con-
struction and a 14-month period for studies; and
c)   the Brazilian law specifies that price revision starts at the
date of the proposal, but that prices cannot be escalated by
more than 35% from the date of authorized commencement of work.
4.12      The foreign exchange component for construction has been estimated
on the basis of contract awards to (a) local firms and (b) foreign firms.
The range is from 13% of the total construction cost if local contractors
using primarily local equipment were employed, to 39% if all work were car-
ried out by foreign contractors using foreign equipment. Under the First
Highway project, several foreign contractors showed interest, and one contract
was awarded to a joint venture with a foreign partner. Under the Second
Highway Project practically no interest was shown by foreign construction
firms, in spite of the size of the program, the introduction of packaged
lots, and the wide international advertising of the project; this has also
proved to be the case for this proposed program, and only one foreign firm
has been prequalified together with 147 Brazilian firms. It would be un-
realistic to expect that this single firm could undertake a significant part
of the program, and consequently the foreign exchange component for con-
struction has been estimated at about 13%.
1/   Under Loans 567-BR and 676-BR, although contract prices and payments were
in cruzeiros, for loan disbursement purposes contract unit prices were
equated in the US$ equivalent at the exchange rate pertaining at bid
opening.



- 16 -
4.13      The cost of construction supervision has been estimated on the
basis of the arrangements described in para. 4.06. The foreign exchange
costs are for foreign consultants for the supervision of construction in
Group B of the northern access to the city of Salvador (paras. 4.05 and 4.09).
4.14      The costs of the additional consulting services have been esti-
mated on the basis of:
(a) contracts recently awarded in Brazil for feasibility and
detailed engineering, and
(b) costs of recent Bank contracts for international experts.
4.15      Bank participation will be 40% of expenditures for construction
included in Group A and its supervision, and for feasibility studies and
detailed engineering; and the actual foreign costs of consultants and inter-
national experts for improving DNER's construction supervision control and
for the highway training center. The foreign cost of the project is esti-
mated at about US$26 million equivalent; the loan of US$89 million will there-
fore finance local expenditures of about US$63 million equivalent.
F.   Execution of the Project
4.16      The execution of the program as a whole will generally follow the
pattern outlined in the remainder of this chapter which is devoted solely to
the execution of the proposed Bank project. The construction and paving to
be financed under the proposed project (Group A) is, however, limited to
national roads, while Group B includes a number of state roads, which will
involve additional agreements among the authorities involved. (Table 14
shows the highway department responsible for each road). In addition, to
facilitate contract administration, the bid date for works in Group B
will be about three months after that for works in the project. Execution
of the project will be the responsibility of DNER for national highways,
and of the corresponding DER for the feasibility studies and detailed
engineering on state highways.
4.17      Subsidiary agreements will be concluded between the DNER and the
DERs of those states where feasibility studies or detailed engineering are
to be made for state highways. Satisfactory conclusion of these subsidiary
agreements will be a condition for loan effectiveness.
4.18      Contracts for construction and paving works will be let on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. Consultants have prepared bidding and contracting documents,
and will assist the Government in analyzing bids and in supervising con-
struction (para. 4.06). The Government has completed prequalification.



- 17 -
4.19      For contract purposes, construction works in the project have been
divided into 52 lots. Sizes of contracts for road works will range from
US$1.5 million to US$7.6 million, and individual bridge contracts start from
a minimum of US$0.2 million. To take advantage of economies of scale through
the use of larger contractors, and at the same time to allow small firms to
compete, construction lots were packaged, where possible, to enable pre-
qualified bidders to bid on packages and/or single lots. There are two
packages of US$6.6 million and US$7.7 million.
4.20      During the First and the Second Highway Projects, difficulties were
created by delays by the Central Bank of Brazil in registering foreign con-
sultants' contracts. Since registration is legally required before any pay-
ments in foreign currency can be made under a contract, satisfactory conclu-
sion of registration procedures in respect of the foreign consultant advising
on supervision (para 4.08) will be a condition for loari effectiveness.
4.21      In connection with the First Highway Project, legislation has been
made effective regarding (a) the duty-free import of construction equipment
for the contractual period of construction, (b) the price escalation formula,
and (c) bidding and contracting documents. No further action on these mat-
ters is required.
4.22      The Government is proceeding with the acquisition of right-of-way,
and construction contracts will not be awarded prior to legal expropriation.
During loan negotiations the Government provided assurance that right-of-way
will be acquired expeditiously. After some difficulties in the First Highway
Project, experience in this matter has been satisfactory.
G.   Disbursement
4.23      Disbursement for the project will follow the usual loan disburse-
ment procedures (para. 4.11).
4.24      The loan will be to the Federal Government.  DNER will administer
a revolving fund for payments to contractors and consultants. The Federal
Government will finance the cost of all construction and consulting services,
and the states will reimburse such amounts as are expended on feasibility
studies and engineering related to state highways. The revolving fund will
be replenished with the Bank's reimbursement for payments made, and with the
contributions of the Federal and State Governments. The government has
agreed that DNER will make deposits in the revolving fund as required, so
that at the beginning of each calendar month the amount in the revolving fund
will be at a level sufficient to cover one month of forward project cost, in
accordance with work schedules. A revolving fund with an initial deposit by
DNER of US$2.5 million equivalent will be established in a blocked account at
a suitable Brazilian bank, and its establishment will be a condition for loan
effectiveness. Experience with the revolving funds for the first two projects
has been satisfactory.



- 18 -
4.25      Construction is expected to corience during the third quarter, and
is to be completed in about 32 months. Feasibility and detailed engineering
studies will be started in about June 1972, and completed in about 14 months.
The schedule of disbursements (Table 17) was estimated on this basis.
4.26      Legislation regarding payment of foreign experts and repatriation
of profits and overheads of contractors and consulting firms, provides for
levies on contractors' profits - including retention for remittances abroad -
corresponding to about 50% of profits, which is in line with corporate tax
rates in most developed countries. Retention on profit remittances could
have the effect of favoring local bidders by about 2.5% of bid prices. How-
ever, neither the 50% tax rate nor the slight advantage given to local bidders
should deter participation of foreign bidders. In addition, a flat 25% reten-
tion in lieu of income tax is applied to remittances abroad by consulting
firms. This retention is covered in local currency payments to foreign con-
sultants. Prior to the Second Highway Project, a legal opinion was provided
by the Government confirming the interpretation of the relevant legislation.
4.27      Any surplus of funds remaining in the loan account on completion
of the project should be cancelled.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      Large increases in highway transport volumes - passengers and
cargo - have resulted in pressures to improve and extend the highway system.
This growing demand for transport is the result of three main factors: (a)
the opening up of vast areas in the interior and the beginning of their econ-
omic development; (b) rising trade and interaction in general among tne cities
located in the more developed eastern states; and (c) increased interaction
and exchange of products between the developing agricultural interior and the
developed industrial coastal areas and the ports of export.
5.02      To permit priority ratings among alternative investments, Highway
Master Plans were prepared during the Transport Survey (Annex 1), and are
being updated and expanded by DNER to ensure that highway investments are
guided by priorities. This is done on the following bases:
(a)  estimating traffic between major zones based on production
analyses, consumption patterns, traffic counts and origin-
destination surveys;
(b)  projecting traffic to 1976 based on projectad production
and consumption patterns, and extrapolation of past trends
for passenger traffic;



- 19 -
(c) allocating traffic to modes in the light of relative costs,
taking into consideration expected operational improvements
in railway transport and coastal shipping;
(d) estimating costs of necessary new construction and improve-
ments to satisfy projected demand;
(e) calculating benefits derived from the proposed improvements through
lower vehicle operation and highway maintenance costs, taking into
account traffic generation through induced production, where appro-
priate; and
(f) listing investment priorities and optimum years of opening of
the roads.
5.03      The roads included for construction in the proposed program were
selected from a high priority list. Consultants studied alternative align-
ments wherever warranted, and final selection was based on economic consid-
erations. The economic case for construction of roads in the project to be
financed from the proposed loan does not depend on the completion of the
roads in Group B for which financing may be provided from other sources.
Roads proposed for detailed engineering under the project (Table 15) were
selected from the Master Plans and from feasibility studies, and those for
feasibility studies (Table 16) were also selected from the higher priority
listings in the Master Plans.
B.   The Prolect Roads
5.04      Following are regional descriptions and characteristics of the most
important roads in the program; a detailed description of each road is given
in Annex 6.
In the North-East Region -
5.05      With a population density above the national average (31% of the
population for 18% of the national area), the North-East Region is one of
the poorest in Brazil; the per capital income is one-fourth that of the
South-East. Its economy is based on low-yielding agriculture and on animal
husbandry, but these are hampered by difficult natural conditions. To promote
regional growth, the Government created in 1959 a development agency (Superin-
tendencia do Desenvolvimento do Nordeste-SUDENE) which administers fiscal in-
centives for industrial development, and federal appropriations to provide in-
frastructure. As a result of SUDENE's activities, and also through efforts
1/ The North-East Region includes the following states: Maranhao, Piaui,
Ceara, Rio Grando do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe and
Bahia.



- 20 -
of other Government agencies (e.g. Banco do Nordeste), industrial growth has
accelerated in the north-east, especially in the vicinity of the city of Sal-
vador where an important industrial park (Aratu) has been constructed. In-
dustrial production in the region is focussed on the processing of foodstuffs,
textiles, and metallurgical and chemical products. The main agricultural prod-
ucts in the region in 1969 were: sugar cane (27 million tons), manioc (13
million tons), corn (1.5 million tons), and rice (1 million tons). Timber
products reached 43 million m3 in 1969, and cattle, pig, goat and sheep herds
numbered 20 million, 17 million, 11 million, and 9 million head respectively.
The State of Bahia is an important producer of cocoa - 96% of national pro-
duction - and high grade tobacco.
5.06      Two road sections, BR-316/232 and BR-104, are proposed for construc-
tion in this region. Highway BR-316/232 plays an important role in regional
integration in the north-east by connecting Teresina, Sao Luis and Belem to
Recife, one of the major regional growth poles. It also forms a section of
the Trans-Amazon Highway which starts in Recife and will eventually cross the
Amazon Basin to Rio Branco near the Bolivian border (Map 1). Highway BR-104
serves the productive agricultural interior of the north-eastern states, and
provides a north-south alternate route to BR-101.
1/
In the South-East Region -
5.07      Although only one-tenth of Brazil's area, the South-East Region
contains 38% of the total population. It is well endowed with natural re-
sources. The fast-growing economy is based on modern agriculture and a
dynamic industry which is the main supplier of industrial products processed
in Brazil. The main agricultural products in 1969 were: sugar cane (41 mil-
lion tons), manioc (5 million tons), corn (4.3 million tons), citrus (3 million
tons), rice (2 million tons), and coffee (1 million tons). Timber products in
1969 were 30 million m3. Cattle and pigs numbered 35 million and 17 million
head respectively. The main industrial products are steel, chemicals,
electrical appliances, and processed foods and textiles. The most important
mining operations are in the state of Minas Gerais where 25 million tons of
iron ore were extracted in 1969, and where half of the country's steel was
produced.
5.08      One of the important trunk roads in this region is BR-381/354
connecting Sao Paulo with the center of Minas Gerais (Map 6). One section
of BR-354 - between Lagoa Formosa and Estalagem - is being constructed under
the Second Highway Project. It is now proposed to continue it to Perdoes,
i.e. to the intersection with BR-381. Another very important trunk road
which is to be detail engineered is BR-135 which links Minas Gerais to Rio de
Janeiro. (Map 5). Under the Second Project, the feasibility was demonstrated
of improving this highway from outside Rio de Janeiro to Juiz de Fora (up to
20,000 ADT in some sections, Table 18); a feasibility study is now being
1/ This region includes the States of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de
Janeiro, Guanabara and Sao Paulo.



- 21 -
carried out under the same project to determine what improvements are re-
quired to ensure adequate connection of the highway with the city of
Rio de Janeiro.
In the Center-West Region 1/
5.09      This region is sparsely populated (22% of the country's area and
5% of its population), but is well endowed with agricultural lands, and
attracts an increasing number of settlers coming from overpopulated and poor
areas, especially the north-east. The main products in 1969 were: sugar cane
(2 million tons), manioc (2 million tons), rice (1.5 millio   tons), and corn
(1 million tons). Timber products amounted to 11 million m , and cattle and
pig herds were 19 million and 8 million respectively. This region is a net
exporter of agriculture and animal products.
5.10      The proposed construction of the Guapo-Jatai section of Highway
BR-060 will improve the connection between Brasilia, Goiania and Cuiaba;
the Government is building the Jatai-Cuiaba section. Highway BR-163 from
Bandeirantes to Campo Grande, included for construction, and from Dourados
to Pontal do Tigre, included for feasibility study, form the main north-
south axis in the State of Mato Grosso, along with the Cuiaba-Rondonopolis-
Bandeirantes section to be built and financed fully by the Government. To-
gether with Highways BR-487 or PR-4, and BR-373 (both included for feasibility
study in the Southern Region) this route will connect the heart of the Center-
West Region to Curitiba and its port at Paranagua.
In the Southern Re  ion  /
5.11      Containing 7% of the area of Brazil and 17% of the population, this
region has important agriculture, cattle raising, lumbering and wood proces-
sing activities. Agricultural production in 1969 consisted of: sugar cane
(5 million tons), rice (2 million tons), and wheat (1.5 million tons). Other
important products are grapes, tobacco and citrus fruits. Pigs, cattle, and
sheep number 22 million, 19 million, and 14 million head respectively. The
region exports part of its agricultural and animal products mainly to the
metropolitan areas of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
5.12      Most of the roads included in the program are important on the
regional level and carry heavy traffic, as do most of the main roads in the
south (Table 19). As already discussed in para. 5.10, BR-487 and BR-373,
both included for feasibility study, have national importance.
1/ This region includes the states of Goias, Mato Grosso and the federal
district of Brasilia.
2/ This region includes the States of Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio
Grande do Sul.



- 22 -
C.   Benefits from the Project
5.13      Most of the quantified benefits are derived from road user savings
accrued to generated as well as normal or diverted traffic. During the
preparation of the Highway Master Plans, estimates were made of benefits as
a result of upgrading earth and gravel roads to paved roads. They were based
on theoretical computations checked against trucking companies' records, and
test runs of typical Brazilisar vehicles over different types of roads. The
estimates were updated by GEIPOT in 1971 (Table 20). In the case of heavy
traffic routes with large percentages of urban commuting traffic, benefits
were also derived from reduction in congestion, as well as time savings
reflected in the wages of drivers of commercial vehicles and travellers on
business trips. Other quantifiable benefits accrue from the difference in
maintenance costs between well-constructed paved roads and existing gravel
and earth roads.
5.14      A number of benefits that are diffcult to quantify but that are
also attributable to the proposed road improvements are the general reduction
in travel time and increased comfort, lowering of inventory costs, and less
spoilage of fresh fruits and vegetables. In addition, some of the improved
roads reaching into the frontier areas will facilitate migration from the
densely populated areas along the coast to newly opened agricultural lands
in the interior, where potential for growth is high but where human resources
are lacking.
5.15      Net benefits resulting from the proposed road works, discounted
over a 20-year economic life of the roads, give internal economic returns
ranging from 13% to 40% for Group A (to be financed under the proposed loan),
and from 13% to 34% for Group B (to be financed separately from the proposed
loan); the IER is 19% for the program as a whole, and 24% for the project
to be financed by the Bank. A sensitivity analysis indicates that reasonable
variations in vehicle operating and maintenance costs - the inputs most likely
to vary from the estimates - have little effect on IER (Table 21).
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During loan negotations, agreement was reached with the Government
on the following principal matters:
(a) the enforcement of weight regulations on national roads (para. 3.14);
(b) the maintenance of national roads and the policy of delegation of
maintenance functions (para. 3.24);
(c) the collection of data for highway planning "?ara. 3.30);



- 23 -
(d) the employment of consultants for supervising construction
(para. 4.06);
(e) the registration of the contract for additional construction
experts (para. 4.20); and
(f)  the acquisition of right.of-way (para. 4.22).
6.02      Conditions for loan effectiveness will be:
(a) the signing of supervisory consultants' contracts (para. 4.06);
(b) the conclusion of subsidiary agreements between the Federal
Government and the DERs (para. 4.17);
(c) the registration of the foreign consultant's contract (para.
4.20); and
(d) the establishment of a revolving fund (para. 4.24).
6.03      The project provides a suitable basis for a loan of US$89 million
equivalent. On the basis of the average useful life of road construction
works and length of construction period, the appropriate term for the loan
would be 25 years, including a four-year period of grace.

BRAZIL
TRANSPORT SURVEY
1.  Main 'Recommendations
Transport Coordination
1.        The consultants made general recommendations which, if adopted,
would go far to ensure the movement of traffic by that mode of transport
which incurred the least cost to the economy. it was recommended that in-
vestments be made according to economic criteria, that there be free user
choice of mode of transport, that government policies should not unduly
favor or discriminate between modes, and that users be charged in proportion
to the costs of resources consumed in the provision of the services.
Railways
2.        An extensive analysis of the Federal and State railways was made
and the main recommendations included:
(a)  the merger of al'l railways into one system, controiled
by a Board with Managing Director responsible to the
Minister of Transport;
(b) a program of abandonment of uneconomic lines;
(c) improvement in equipment, signalling and operations;
(d) reduction of personnel;
(e) adoption of cost-based tariffs; and
(f)  "normalization" of accounts (writing of concessionary
Government traffic at full commercial rate).
Ports
The ports of Rio de Janeiro, Santos and Reci-e were studied in
detai; with a view to providing guidelines for the improvement of adminis-
tration and to prepare master plans for investrernt. The s_tua_ion in the
?orts was unsatisfactory in almost every respec-, tne prLncipa! cause bein-,
overcentralization.  IE was proposed that the National Porr Organizazion be



ANNEX 1
Page 2
responsible only for rational planning and coordination, and that individual
ports should be transformed into largely independent port authorities. For
the port of Rio de Janeiro, the Survey recommended extensive rehabilitation
and expansion of facilities, including new wheat and dry bulk terminals, and
new general cargo berths. In Santos, new facilities, including a container
berth, were recommended to handle increasing traffic. In Recife, replace-
ment of almost all equipment was recommended as well as the rebuilding of
sheds.
Coastal Shipping
4.        The consultants were asked to identify major shortcomings and to
recommend any new investment in ships that may be required. A major find-
ing was that the present fleet was much too large for the available cargo,
and extensive scrapping was recommended. Fixed sailing schedules were sug-
gested, as were the consolidation of shipping companies and the decrease in
the role of the regulatory body, the Merchant Marine Commission.
Highways
5.        The highway studies covered the following states:
Phase I
Minas Gerais, Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul
Phase II
Region A          Region B         Region C       Region D      Region E
Sao Paulo      Rio de Janeiro      Bahia          Alagoas       Ceara
Mato Grosso   Espirito Santo       Sergipe        Pernambuco   Piaui
Goias                                             Paraiba       Maranhao
Rio Grande
do Norte
The studies concluded with the listing of priorities for investment on na-
tional and state networks, forecasts of financial expenditures on highway
investment, maintenance equipment, and maintenance and administration. They

construction and maintenance
functions to the DERs.
Construction functions are being dele-
gated to states on a road by road
basis.
Maintenance - New Road Tax is ear-
marked for maintenance purposes.  In
~the-case of delegated national roads,
states receive funds out of DNER's
share of new road tax. All new agree-
ments regarding delegation of con-
struction of national roads by DERs
now specify that such roads will
later be maintained by respective
DERs.
(c)   Reorganization of DERs         GEIPOT reorganization studies com-
ppleted in 1969.
'.   Restructuring of road user
charges:                           New uniform Road Tax, decreed in
October 1969 and put into effect in
January 1970, raises additional funds
from roac users. Toll charges will
be started in 1972 for roads with ADT
greater than 10,000.



ANNEX 2

(The first roads with toll charges
will be Rio-Sao Paulo, Rio-Petropolis
and Sao Paulo-Santos). By 1975 total
road user charges will be paying for
maintenance and administration of the
existing network, and for 70% of costs
of expanding the network.
3.    Preparation of investment
budgets to be based on
Transport Survey priorities:          Three-year investment budget 1968-70
was essentially based on survey pri-
orities. The new three-year invest-
ment budget (1972-74) is based on sur-
vey priorities. Exceptions are low-
cost feeder roads for agricultural
development, and penetration roads to
open up virgin territories.

REORGANIZATION OF HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION
1.          The main purpose of reorganization of the Brazilian highway admi'n-
istration is to reduce the centralization of highway activities in DNER, and
to eliminate duplication of services between the DNER and the DERs. To
accomplish this target, the Government decided to gradually transfer mainte-
nance and construction functions from DNER to the DERs. This will enable
DNER to concentrate on planning and supervising the national and state high-
way systems and to be specifically responsible for:
(a)   planning and regulatory functions;
(b)   financing of road programs and supervision of
utilization of resources;
(c)   overall supervision of physical operations and
financial activities;
(d)   supervision of the application of legislation and
rules; and
(e)   statistical data.
The DERs will ultimately be responsible for the executive aspect of highway
activities, including all national and state roads.
Reorganization of DNER
2.          During the Transport Survey reorganization, studies were made for
the DERs of the main states of Brazil. The resulting recommendations were
conditioned by DNER's reorientation of objectives and reorganization of its
administrative structure. Plan of Action PA-1 was submitted by the Govern-
ment to the Bank in August 1968, and Plan PA-2 ia Eabruary 1969. Both Plans
contained definite objectives regarding reorganization of highway adminis-
tration. During the first phase of reorganizacion, a study of the general
administrative structure of DNER was made by the Getulio Vargas Foundation.
This study was completed in 1968.  The resulting recommendations were re-
viewed by the Bank and approved by the Government, and were legalized by
Decree No. 64.242 of March 21, 1969. Tne consultants are now working on the
second phase of this study, developing new regulartons and operational pro-
cedures, and writing administrative, operational, and technical manuals. The
Vargas Foundation is assisted by four U.S. FdWA experts provided under a
loan from JSAID for technical assistance. Tne internal ret;ulations of DNER
have been re-writter. and were legalized by Decree No. 68.243 of March 25,
1971. The first manuals were published in 1971.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
3.        Under the Bank's Second Highway Project, the services of consultants
are being provided for the strengthening of DNER's planning and construction
divisions. Seven Brazilian transport economists (TRANSPLAN) and four foreign
transport experts (SYSTAN, U.S.) are assisting the planning division. Five
foreign construction experts (INGEROUTE, France) are working within the con-
struction division, together with their Brazilian counterparts.
Reorganization of DERs
4.        Under PA-1 and PA-2 the Government indicated that it will ensure
that DERs will be gradually reorganized in accordance with the recommenda-
tions of the Transport Survey. Reorganization has progressed in all of the
more important states covered by the Survey as follows:
Rio Grande do Sul: Since 1970, foreign consultants (Frederic
Harris, U.S.) provided by a USAID loan have been assisting the
State Highway Department in organizational changes. Enabling
legislation is expected to be passed in 1972.
Santa Catarina: The draft law concerning organizational changes
has been submitted to the State Government and approval is
expected in 1972.
Parana: The new State Government wishes to accelerate the re-
organization process. The proposed new organization corresponds
closely with the Transport Survey recommendations. The draft
law regarding reorganization is expected to be submitted to the
State Government for approval in 1972.
Sao Paulo: Reorganization has been completed. Required legisla-
tion was passed in 1970.
Minas Gerais: Reorganization has been approved and legislation
was passed in August 1971.
Goias: Reorganization has been approved and legislation was passed
in June 1970.
Mato Grosso: Reorganization has been approved and legislation was
passed in March 1971.
Rio de Janeiro: Reorganization has been approved and legislation
was passed in March 1971.
Bahia: First reorganization was carried out in 1969 and required
legislation was passed in June 1969. Revision of reorganization
is being studied.
Pernambuco: Reorganization has been approved and legislation was
passed in March 1971.

STATUS OF HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE
IN THE SOUTHERN STATES AND MINAS GERAIS
1.        Since October 1970,Bank supervision missions have been carrying
out a detailed evaluation of operating results in the maintenance field.
So far, missions have assessed the maintenance organizations and operations
in the States of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Parana and Minas Gerais.
Rio Grande do Sul
2.         The State has 12,297 km of national and state highways (Attachment
I, MIap 15). In June 1971, an agreement was signed between DNER and the
State Highway Department (Departamento Autonomo de Estradas de Rodagem -
DAER) establishing a pilot region in the northwestern part of the State.
All national roads in this pilot region, with exception of one road which
is being maintained by the Army, are delegated to the State for maintenance.
The pilot region comprises about 40% of the entire area of the State and 37%
of the road network (Map 15). A committee consisting of DNER and DAER offi-
cials and a U.S. FEWA advisor, determined (a) the funds required for economi-
cally justified improvements of delegated roads, based on the findings and
recommendations of the Transport Survey, and (b) the funds required for main-
tenance of the delegated roads.
Santa Catarina
3.         The State has 6,768 km of national and state highways (Attachment
II, Map 13). In August 1971, an agreement was signed between DNER and the
DER of Santa Catarina, establishing a pilot region in the western part of
the State. All national roads in this pilot region are delegated to the
DER/SC for maintenance. The selected region comprises about 20% of the area
of Santa Catarina and 18% of the road network (Map 13). As in the State of
Rio Grande do Sul, a committee consisting of DNER and DER/SC officials, as
well as a U.S. FHWA advisor, has made a study regarding required funds, and
its report was used as the basis for agreement between DNER and DER/SC.
Parana
4.         The State has 10,227 k:. of national and state highways (Attachment
III, Map 11).  In Seitember 197' an agreement was signed between DNER and
DER/PR delegating all national roads in t.ae State of Parana to the DER/PR,
with the exception of:
BR-116 - from the    wa w_z.. Santa Ca.arina to the
border w:;_  Sao 'au_o;
3R-277 - iron Cur   ': > ; Para,.ragua and from P.elogio
to Foz do 7guacuaC;



ANNEX 5
Page 2
BR-373 - from Ponta Grossa to Relogio;
BR-468 - from Curitiba to the border with Santa Catarina.
These four road sections will be delegated to the State as soon as existing
repair contracts are finished and the State has proved its capability to
efficiently maintain and police high-traffic interstate highways.
5.         As in the other states, a committee has been formed to determine
the required funds, and its report was used as the basis for agreement be-
tween DNER and DER/PR.
Minas Gerais
6.         The State has 20,575 km of national and state highways (Attachment
IV, Map 7). An agreement,between DNER and DER/MG was signed in August 1971,
establishing a pilot region in the northern part of Minas Gerais. All nation-
al roads in this region are delegated to the DER/MG for maintenance (Map 7).
7.         Experience gained in this pilot region will greatly contribute to
the improvement of national and state roads in the State, which eventually
will be the sole responsibility of DER/MG. The region comprises about 42%
of the entire area of the State and 24% of the road network.
8.         As in the other states, a committee studied the maintenance situa-
tion and determined the required funds, and its report was used as the basis
for agreement between DNER and DER/MG.

THE PROJECT ROADS
The principal economic characteristics of the regions in which
roads are located are presented in Chapter 5 - Economic Evaluation. The
essential technical characteristics of each road, including description
of existing conditions and proposed standards, are found in Tables 14-16.
Quantification of economic benefits is given in Table 21. Description
of each road follows:
A.   ROADS PROPOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION AND/OR PAVING
GROUP A
In the North-East Region
1.        Route BR-316/232 (300.5 km, Maps 2 and 3).  This road plays an
important role in integrating various parts of the north-east by linking
Teresina, Sao Luis and Belem on the one hand, to Recife, the major growth
pole of the region, on the other. In addition it provides a major link
between the proposed Trans-Amazon Highway and the north-eastern urban cen-
ters. The traffic is predominantly long distance. The 1970 ADT was 345
vehicles of which 65% were trucks, and the annual growth rate is estimated
at 10%.
2.        Route BR-104 (282 km, Map 3).  This highway serves two functions -
inter-connecting the productive agricultural interior of the north-eastern
states, and providing an alternate route to BR-101 between Natal and the
other important urban centers of northern Brazil, and Salvador, Rio de Janeiro
and Sao Paulo in the south. The 1970 ADT on these road sections varied from
a high of 750 to a low of 225 vehicles, with heavy vehicles varying from 75%
to 45%, and the traffic growth rate increasing between 6% and 10% per year.
In the South-East Region
3.        Route BR-354 (211.4 km, Map 6).  This road is a continuation of
the section of BR-354 included for construction in the Second Highway Proj-
ect. Together they form a part of the direct route from Patos de Minas, an
important agricultural area, to Sao Paulo, via Route BR-381. The 1970 ADT
was about 350 vehicles with 40% trucks, growing at an average of 10% per
year.
In the Center-West Region
4.        Route BR-60 (2S!.6 i&-.   3) is a link in the hi!hwav that
connects Brasilia and Goiania to Cuiaba, via Route BR-364. It also connects
at Rio Verde with Route BR-L52 included for construction in the Second High-
way Pro-ect.  These two roads zogether link the region which they serve to
Sao Paulo. The 1970 ADT was 955 vehicles with 60% trucks, and the annual
growth rate is about 10%.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
5.        Route BR-153 (236.2 km, Map 8).  This is a part of the highway
between Brasilia and the central regions of Brazil on one hand, and Belem
and the northern regions of the country on the other.  Since its construc-
tion ten years ago, this road has played an important role in opening up the
interior which has good agricultural and cattle raising potential. The 1970
ADT was 510 vehicles with 60% trucks, and the growth rate of vehicles is
about 10% per year.
6.        Route BR-050 (218.2 km, Map 8) is the only missing link in the
most direct route between Brasilia and Sao Paulo, decreasing travel distance
between these two centers by about 100 km compared to the present route via
BR-153.  The most important flows are of manufactured products and fuels
from Sao Paulo to Brasilia. On the regional level, this route connects Bra-
silia to the cattle-and wheat-producing areas around Uberlandia and Uberaba.
The 1970 ADT was about 115 with about 50% trucks, growing at an annual rate
of 10%.  The diverted traffic due to the shorter distance is expected to be
about 700 vehicles per day in the first year after opening.
7.        Route BR-163 (65.5 km, Map 8).  This is a link in the highway
connecting Guiaba, the capital of Mato Grosso, to Campo Grande, the major
growth pole in the southern part of the state where agriculture and cattle-
grazing are important. Detailed engineering for the Bandeirantes-Cuiaba
section of BR-163 is being carried out with special funding by the Govern-
ment. The 1970 ADT was 370 vehicles with 50% trucks, and the annual rate
of growth of the vehicles is 6%.
In the Southern Region
8.        Route BR-386/158 (186.2 kIn, Maps 12 and 14).  This link completes
the "Kennedy Highway" which connects the western part of Santa Catarina and
Northern Rio Grande do Sul to Porto Alegre. The last 54 km outside Porto
Alegre were constructed under the First Highway Project. The 1970 ADT was
510 vehicles with about 60% trucks, and average annual rate of vehicle growth
was 12%.
9.        Route BR-158 (67.2 km, Map 14) is a continuation of Route BR-158
now being constructed under the Second Highway Project. It links the north-
central parts of Rio Grande do Sul to Santa Maria, an important regional
center. The 1970 ADT was 340 with 45% trucks, and the average annual rate
of growth was 10%.
GROUP B
In the North-East Region
10.       Route BR-324 (11.6 km_, Map 4).  This is an extension of Route
BR-324 included for construction in the Second Highway Project, and forms
the major access route to the northern section of the city of Salvador. It
is expected to relieve the congestion at the entrance to the city, as the
ADT in 1970 was 16,000 vehicles (23% trucks) and the traffic growth rate
per year is estimated at 6%.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
In the South-East Region
11.       Route MG-174/168/28/157 (292.4 km, Map 6).  These routes form
an efficient regional network in southern Minas Gerais, and serve one of
the important agricultural areas of that state. The 1970 ADT varied on the
various links from a high of 275 vehicles to a low of 260 vehicles, and the
truck composition varied between 25%-30%. Annual traffic growth is esti-
mated at 10% throughout.
12.       Route ES-37/36 (61.6 km, Map 5).  This road is of regional impor-
tance in the north-central part of Espirito Santo, and connects Nova Venecia
and Sao Domingos, twqo regional centers, to Vitoria, the state capital, via
Routes ES-2 and BR-259 (both under construction and paving). The 1970 ADT
was 260 vehicles of which 60% were trucks, and the estimated vehicle growth
rate is 9% per year.
In the Southern Region
13.       Route PR-12 (45.3 km, Map 10) is a link of regional importance
which connects the fertile agricultural area in northern Parana to the east-
west-oriented transport system of the state via Route BR-369. The 1970 ADT
was about 655 with 47% trucks, and the average annual growth rate was about
10%.
14.       Route BR-153 (247 km, Maps 10 and 12) forms an important regional
highway in the center of the three southern states, linking these production
areas to the consumption centers to the north. It connects with the Sao
Mateus-Uniao da Vitoria section of Highway BR-476 which was constructed under
the First Highway Project. The 1970 ADT was 675 vehicles of which 57% were
trucks, and the average annual growth rate was 13%.
15.       Route RS-19 (23.6 km, Map 14).  This road north of Porto Alegre is
of regional importance and connects via Route BR-116 the agricultural area
which it serves to the rest of the state. The 1970 ADT was 805 vehicles of
which 25% were trucks, and the average annual rate of growth was 10%.
B.   ROADS PROPOSED FOR DETAILED ENCINEERING
In the North-East Region
16.       Route BR-412/110 (77 km, Map 3).  These two road sections have the
highest priority in the route which provides a diagonal connection in the
central part of Paraiba and ?ernambuco between two important east-west
highways, namely BR-232 originating in Recife and BR-230 starting in Joao
Pessoa. The 1969 ADT was estinated at 320 vehicles, of which about 40% were
trucks; the estimated annuaL traffic growth is about 10%.
17.       Route BR-3U/BA-630 (232 km, Map 4J.  This route plays an important
role in eas,-west transport in the southern part of Bahia, connecting the



ANNEX 6
Page 4
area of Bacm Jesus de Lapa on the Sao Francisco river to BR-116, the major
north-south axis between the north-east and the center-east. The estimated
1969 ADT is 300 with 50% trucks, and the average annual traffic growth rate
is 9%.
18.       Route BR-101 (137 km, Map 4)  is a missing link of the important
north-south coastal route which will significantly lessen the travel time
between the north-east and the center-east by providing an alternative route
to the present one which goes through Salvador. The 1969 ADT was 750 vehi-
cles with 70% trucks, and the rate of traffic growth is estimated at 10%
per year.
In the South-East Region
19.       Route BR-135 (215 km, Map 5) is the main road connecting Rio
de Janeiro to Belo Horizonte, as well as the access to Rio de Janeiro from
the north via Route BR-464, and from the south via Routes BR-462 and BR-116,
the latter being the principal route to Sao Paulo. In 1969, ADT on this road
varied from 5,500 on the section farthest from Rio de Janeiro, to a high of
about 21,000 in the section nearest Rio de Janeiro, with about 30% trucks.
A number of alignments to connect this route to the urban system of Rio de
Janeiro are being studied, and the best alternative will be included for
detailed engineering under the present project.
20.       Route MG-10 (137 km, Map 6) links Pirapora on the Sao Francisco
River, to Corinto in the central part of Minas Gerais, and from there via
Routes BR-135 and BR-40 to Belo Horizonte. The 1969 ADT was about 200
vehicles with 33% trucks, and the average annual traffic growth was about
10%.
21.       Route MG-23 (144 km, Map 6).  The completion of this road will
provide a connection between four important national routes, BR-135, BR-381,
BR-262 and BR-040. In addition, this road provides a direct link between
the steel plants located in Divinopolis and the coal-producing areas to the
north. This coal movement alone provides about 100 trucks per day in ADT
expected to be about 300 vehicles.
In the Center-West Region
22.       Route BR-364 (197 1.m, Map 8) is the major road connection between
Cuiaba, southern Goias and western Minas Gerais connecting, at Canal Sao
Simao on the Goias-Minas Gerais border, with Route BR-365 which is being
constructed under the Second Highway Project. The 1969 ADT was 300 vehicles,
with 50% trucks; the traffic growth rate is 7% annually.
In the Southern Region
23.       Route PR-13 (176 Icm, Map 10) including a link to Nova Esperanca,
is of regional importance in the agricultural north-central part of the
state of Parana, linking a number of regional centers to Route BR-376, the



ANNEX 6
Page 5
main diagonal highway in the state. The 1969 ADT varied between 400 and
2,100 vehicles on the various sections, and truck percentage varied between
40 and 60; average annual growth rate was 12%.
24.       Route RS-12/50 (274 km, Map 14) forms a small network in the
northern part of Rio Grande do Sul, connecting the agricultural centers of
Santa Rosa and Ijui to Route BR-386 included for construction in this proj-
ect. The 1969 ADT varied from 150 to 350 with about 60% trucks, and average
annual rate of vehicle growth was 15%.
25.       Route BR-158 (37 km, Map 14) is a continuation of BR-158 from
Cruz Alta included in this project for construction (described above in
para. 9).
C.   ROADS PROPOSED FOR FEASIBILITY STUDY
In the North-East Region
26.       Routes BR-316/110 (409 km, Map 3).  These routes, together with
the section of BR-316 included for construction in the proposed project,
and the southern part of route BR-110, form an important regional network
serving both local and long-distance traffic in the north-east, and connect-
ing the north-east with the central part of the country. In addition, they
provide access to the hydro-electric complex at Paulo Alfonso which at pre-
sent is quite isolated, but which will contribute greatly to the develop-
ment of the region.
In the South-East Region
27.       Route MG-4/ES-39 (132 ki, Maps 5 and 6) forms an important link
between the Governador Valadares area in Minas Gerais and the coastal net-
work of the state of Espirito Santo, and from there to the port city of
Vitoria.
28.       Route MG-8 (117 km, Map 6) forms an important regional link be-
tween the agricultural area of Patos de Minas (cereals, dairy products and
cattle) and Belo Horizonte via BR-354 and BR-262.
29.       Route MG-58 (59 km, Map 6) links the south-eastern part of Minas
Gerais with northern Sao Paulo, and plays an important role in the movement
of the regional products and especially coffee, sugar cane, dairy products
and cereals.
30.       Route BR-331 (76 km, Map 9) forms a part of the most direct route
between the city of Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte. It carries very heavy
traffic at present and will require new alignment and additional lanes.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
31.       Route SP-89 (60 km, Map 9) is the missing link between the city
of Sao Paulo and the newly reconstructed port of Sao Sebastiao where cargo
movements have increased significantly in recent years.
In the Center-West Region
32.       Route BR-163 (183 km, Map 8) is a section of the road from Dourados
in southern Mato Grosso to the port of Paranagua in the state of Parana (de-
scribed in para. 33). Together with another section north of Campo Grande,
for which detailed engineering is now being carried out by DNER, this con-
tinuous route will connect the center-west part of Brazil to the southern
states and especially to the ports of export.
In the Southern Region
33.       Routes BR-487 (502 km), BR-373 (376 km) and BR-277/376 (81 km),
(Map 10) are alternative routes from which one will be selected. That
route, together with Route BR-163 described above in para. 32, will provide
an alternative export route through the port of Paranagua for the products
of the central part of Brazil, thus relieving the pressure on the port of
Santos. In addition, it will provide access to the central part of the
state of Parana where potential for development has been limited by lack
of efficient transport.
34.       Route BR-467/163 (217 km, Map 10).  Two alternative routes are to
be evaluated to link the regional centers of Toledo and Guaira in western
Parana in which large increases in agricultural production (soybeans, wheat
and dairy products) are taking place.
35.       Route BR-158 (175 km, Map 10) is a system connecting south-eastern
Parana with Santa Catarina. The continuation of BR-158 to Rio Grande do Sul
is proposed for construction under this project. This is a region of active
colonization where agricultural production (corn, wheat, soybeans) as well as
pig-raising is increasing rapidly.
36.       Route RS-19 (103 km, Map 14) will provide an alternative access
route from Porto Alegre to BR-101, the major north-south axis, and from there
to the rest of the country. In addition, it provides reliable transport to an
area with a strong tourist potential.
37.       Route RS-3 (94 km, Map 14) is a section of one of the most impor-
tant east-west highways in Rio Grande do Sul linking Argentina and Porto
Alegre. This road serves one of the best agricultural areas in the state,
and will complete an improved link between the two important centers of Santa
Maria and Santa Cruz. The adjacent section is being constructed under the
Second Highway Project.
