REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT

FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A
THIRD HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
February 25, 1972



INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO BRAZIL FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Brazil for the equivalent of $89 million. The loan would have a
final maturity of 25 years, including a four year grace period; interest
thereon will be charged at the rate of 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Brazil" (WH-210a) dated November 30, 1971, was distributed
to the Executive Directors on December 2, 1971. A country data sheet is
attached as Annex II. As noted in my Report and Recommendation on the
Steel Expansion Project (R 72-19) dated January 20, 1972 the economic
report indicates that, provided good economic and financial management
continues, Brazil should be able to service a large continuing inflow
of external loans. The report also concludes that, given the size of
Brazil's external capital requirement as compared with likely capital
goods imports associated with projects, a substantial part of the
capital inflow will have to be used to finance local expenditures.
PART II - THE BANK'S ROLE IN BRAZIL
3.        With the proposed loan the Bank will have lent more to Brazil
than to any other country.  Since 1949, Brazil has received 38 loans
from the Bank amounting to $1,158.8 million (net of cancellations).
Of this amount $183.4 million has been repaid and $559.0 million
remains undisbursed. A summary statement of loans as of January 31,
1972, is attached as Annex I. Service on Bank loans (including amounts
undisbursed) is estimated to account for 12 percent of Brazil's total
debt service in 1975 and 16 percent in 1978, remaining at that level
thereafter.
4.        Brazil also has the largest share of IFC's commitments.  Since
1957, IFC has made thirteen commitments totalling $61.8 million of which
$5.1 million has been repaid, $13.4 million sold and $1.3 million can-
celled. Of the balance of $42.0 million, $30.3 million represents loans
and $11.7 million equity. A summary of IFC investments is given in
Annex I.

5.        In my Report and Recomnmendation on the loan to Companhia
Siderurgica Nacional (P-1012) of January 17, 1972 the status of disburse-
ments of outstanding loans was discussed, and the factors delaying certain
projects were identified. In general, execution of Bank financed projects
in Brazil has been satisfactory. Disbursements, which were very slow
during FY65 to FY69, averaging only $10 million per year, rose to $66
million in FY70, to $75 million in FY71 and were $67 million during the
first half of FY72. We expect that the pace of disbursement will continue
to accelerate during the next few years.
6.        We are proceeding with an active lending program in Brazil in
the current fiscal year. Two loans totalling $96 million were approved
in August 1971 for the MBR iron ore and related railway project. A
loan of $64.5 million to finance the expansion program of the Companhia
Siderurgica Nacional was approved on February 2, 1972, and loans to two
other steel companies, USIMINAS and COSIPA are being prepared. In
addition, the staff has recently appraised the Sao Simao Hydroelectric
project, a grain storage credit program and a small land settlement
project in the State of Maranhao. I hope to be able to recommend loans
for most if not all of these projects during the next few months.
7.        In lending to Brazil, the Bank is responding to Brazil's
demonstrated ability to absorb increasing amounts of external capital
that enable it to sustain a high rate of economic growth. In selecting
sectors and projects for lending, the Bank seeks to fill important
development needs. In the first place, the Bank can help Brazil to
increase its foreign capital inflow by associating Bank loans either
with sectors where sufficient bilateral financing is not available
or where the Bank's participation will help Brazil obtain such financing
on a more favorable basis. The Bank's recent and projected lending for
electric energy projects, for example, meets this criterion. We also
hope that bilateral lenders will progressively increase their financing
of development projects, and will be willing to finance some local
currency expenditures, particularly in the field of highway construction.
We have therefore encouraged the Brazilians to seek bilateral finance
for a part of the highway program which was appraised by our staff
(see para. 31 below). In the second place, we hope to direct Bank
lending towards areas where it can support the Government's efforts
to strengthen institutions and pursue sound economic policies. Such
is the case with the Government's transport coordination policy, which
will be commented on below. Thirdly, we hope to select projects which
will help Brazil overcome the most critical constraint on economic
growth, namely, the balance of payments.  This means support of export
oriented investments such as the MBR iron ore project or of import
substituting industry where, as in the case of steel, Brazil has a
significant comparative advantage. Fourthly, in selecting projects



- 3 -
for financing, the Bank will bear in mind the importance of fostering
the growth of the less developed part of Brazil and reducing regional
income disparities.
8.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's fourth for a highway
project in Brazil. It would be its eighth loan for development of
the transport sector -- loans for railway projects were made in 1952,
1953 and 1971 and a port loan was made in 1971.
9.        The project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited
Brazil in June/July 1971 and in December 1971. Negotiations took
place from February 7 to February 9, 1972. The Government of Brazil
was represented by Dr. Jaime Alipio de Barros, General Counsel of
the Ministry of Finance and by Dr. Elieseu Resende, Director General
of the National Highway Department.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
10.       Brazil with an area of 8.5 million km2 is the fifth largest
country in the world. Population density is low, at about 11 per km2,
but there are great regional variations ranging from 3,000 per km2 in
the coastal regions of the States of Guanabara and Sao Paulo to less
than one per km2 in the Amazon region. Potential for agricultural
and industrial growth is large due to the country's vast natural
resources. In pursuing the goal of rapid economic growth the Govern-
ment has emphasized the need for transport development to go hand in
hand with growth of the productive sectors. Efficient transport is
needed to open up new lands and to move agricultural products from the
interior to coastal consumption areas and ports of export as well as to
move capital goods and manufactures in the opposite direction.
Transport Policy
11.       Recent Bank association with Brazil's transport sector began
in 1965 when, through a technical assistance grant of $1.5 million, it
helped finance and supervise the first phase of a nationwide Transport
Survey.  This phase covered the railroads, coastal shipping, the ports
of Santos, Rio de Janeiro and Recife and highways in four states. A
second phase of the Survey, partly financed by UNDP and AID, with the
Bank as executing agency, covered highways in the remaining principal
states and was completed in 1970.
12.       In connection with both phases of the Survey the Government
entered into Memoranda of Understanding with the Bank recording the
steps it proposed to take to improve transport services. Prior to
the First Highway Loan in 1968 the Government adopted a plan of action



- 4 -
summarizing its transport objectives with schedules for action on high-
ways, railways and ports. This plan has now been implemented. Prior to
the Second Highway Loan in 1970 the Government prepared another plan of
action outlining measures to achieve further improvements. Implementa-
tion of this plan varies from mode to mode. In highways progress has
been satisfactory and major achievements include reorganization of the
National Highways Department (DNER), reorganization of a number of state
highway departments (DERs), delegation of DNER's maintenance functions
to DERs in four states, strengthening of DNER's planning capacity and
improvement of contract supervision. In railways and ports significant
progress has been achieved, but the pace has been slower than expected
because the problems are more complex than in the case of highways. In
railways, the federal system (RFFSA) has succeeded in reducing its
operating ratio from 3.5 to 1.6 between 1963 and 1970, and five inde-
pendent railways in Sao Paulo State have been merged into a single more
viable company. But important issues remain -- the federal and Sao Paulo
systems should eventually be merged; railway tariffs should more closely
reflect costs and the railways should make operating and investment
decisions in the context of longer range plans. Such plans are now
under preparation. Developments in the ports have been slow largely
because of unwieldy adninistrative structures and regulations.  As part
of the Santos Port Loan (756 BR) consultants are studying the operation
of the National Ports Department and of the Santos Port authority and
will make recommendations for reorganization and improvement where
necessary. Coiisultants' servces to assist the Governmient in preparing
a National Port plan have been provided for under Loan 756 BR. For the
sector as a whole, the main task remaining is the creation of an effective
mechanism to ensure transport coordination.
Transport Coordination
13.      In 1965, the Govermnent established an agency now known as
Grupo de Estudos para Integracao da Politica de Transportes (GEIPOT),
to provide counterparts to, and to coordinate and supervise the Transport
Survey. When the survey was completed in 1969 GEIPOT was made a permanent
agency within the Ministry of Transport with responsibility for advising
the Minister on transport policy and coordination. GEIPOT has undertaken
and commisioned a number of studies for particular modes but has not yet
addressed itself to the crucial task of coordination. This is urgently
needed since various modal agencies (especially DNER) have strengthened
their planning capabilities and in the absence of sectoral coordination
are making independent estimates of transport demand for each mode.
There is a danger that continued lack of coordinated planning may lead
to inconsistent and wasteful transport investment.
14.      To correct this situation, the Government has decided that
GEIPOT should give more emphasis to coordination of the various modes,
and to integration of transport policy with national economic and social



- 5 -
strategy. GEIPOT's staff will be strengthened to make it adequate for
this purpose. As a result of discussions with a Bank mission in November
1971, the Minister of Transport has written to the Bank outlining the
measures which will be taken. A translation of this letter is included
in Annex III.
The Highway Sector
15.      Brazil has a total highway network of about 951,000 km of which
about 50,000 km are paved. During the last four years priority has been
given to paving the existing network and to building low standard roads
to open new areas for exploration and settlement, especially the new
Amazon highways.
16.      Road freight traffic grew by about 11 percent per year during
the sixties and increased its share of total freight movement from about
62 percent in 1961 to 69 percent in 1970. For the same period, the road
share of passenger traffic rose from 74 percent to 91 percent. Rapid
growth of road traffic should continue for some time.
17.      The total vehicle fleet in 1970 was estimated at 3.5 million
with 83 percent cars and pickups, 2 percent buses and 15 percent trucks.
Growth of the vehicle fleet has averaged 13 percent per year. Domestic
production provides practically all vehicle needs and there _s ample
productive capacity for future growth.
Highway Administration
18.      The DNER, an autonomous agency under the Ministry of Transport
administers the national highwray network. Each of the 22 states has a
DER responsible for state highways. The plans of action submitted by
the Government prior to the First and Second Highway Construction loans
set forth objectives regarding reorganization of highways administration.
Considerable progress has been achieved. DNER has engaged consultants
to develop a new administrative framework and many of the state DERs have
been reorganized and others will be reorganized later. In order to avoid
overcentralization and to peirmit D7ER to concentrate on planning and
overall supervision, DNER's maintenance and construction responsibilities
are gradually being transferred to state DERs on the basis of pilot regions.
This delegation is proceeding satisfactorily.
19.      DNER is establishing a training center for middle and upper
level highway personnel. Ihile most of the training will be provided by
Brazilians, DNER will secure the assistance of international experts in
fields where Brazilian expertise is not yet adequate. Financing for
this assistance is included in the project.



-6-
Highway Engineering
20.      Highway engineering practices have improved considerably during
the past few years. During the Transport Survey new standards and
methods were introduced and systematic economic evaluation of projects was
started.    Brazilian consulting firms, using the new techniques, have
now established themselves in most major states. 'hile the First High-
way Project was designed and supervised by foreign consultants, nearly
all engineering for the Second Project is being carried out by Brazilian
engineers. The experience with these firms has been generally satis-
factory.
21.      Regulations governing motor vehicle weight and dimensions are
satisfactory, and enforcement is improving on federal roads but is still
unsatisfactory on state roads, except in Sao Paulo. The loan documents
provide that the Government will continue to enforce weight regulations
and the Government has presented a satisfactory program for the installa-
tion of new weighing stations.
Highway Construction and Maintenance
22.      Improvement of the quality of construction and supervision has
been an important problem. Poor construction supervision has in the
past resulted in poor quality work; long delayed payments to contractors
made it impossible for DNER to enforce work schedules. Such practices
still occasionally occur but DNER is now making good progress in enforcing
proper methods of construction on all its highways. Consultants --
nearly all Brazilian -- are now being employed for construction supervi-
sion, and a special effort is being made to establish proper controls
for construction programs (see para. 34).
23.      International competitive bidding under the past Bank loans has
demonstrated that the Brazilian construction industry is competitive.
Local firms are carrying out about $600 million worth of highway con-
struction per year. The highway programs financed by the Bank including
the program described in the Appraisal Report, would at their peak add
about 20 percent to this volume of work, an increase which can be absorbed
without difficulty by the industry.
24.      Maintenance has improved considerably in recent years, partly as
a result of the acquisition by several states of new equipment, financed
by USAID. During the Transport Survey, consultants carried out maintenance
studies in 18 states and recommended improvements. The Government is
aware of the importance of proper maintenance. DNER will have overall
responsibility for the federal network and is gradually delegating
maintenance of federal roads to those states which show capability to
maintain and police their networks.



-7-
Employment
25.      Road construction and maintenance are large employers of labor.
A recent survey by the Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic Planning
(IPEA) showed that the mix of labor and capital in road work varies by
region. The most labor-intensive methods are found in the Northeast
where labor is relatively plentiful and cheap; the least labor-intensive
methods are found in the South-East where labor is scarce and expensive
due to alternative employmont opportunities. This survey showed that
in 1969 half a million workers were directly employed in road construc-
tion and maintenance, equivalent to about 20 percent of total employ-
ment in manufacturing industries. In addition a large but undetermined
number of jobs are generated as a result of road construction, especially
in newly opened up areas where the Government has initiated colonization
programs to ease the unemployment problems of the drought-affected areas
of the Northeast. It was estimated by the IPEA study that Bank financed
highway projects in Brazil will provide direct employment for about
146,000 workers between 1970 and 1973.
Highway Financing and Planning
26.      There are two main road user charges in Brazil:  a tax on
gasoline (the IUCL) and an annual charge on the assessed value of
vehicles (the Road Tax). Proceeds from the Road Tax are earmarked for
highway maintenance; this goes a long way towards meeting the recom-
mendation of the Transport Survey that users pay short run marginal costs.
Revenues from all charges on road users equal about 70 percent of total
highway expenditures, including new construction.
27.      The basis for all highway investments is the 25 year National
Transport Plan, originally published in 1964. This plan is updated
periodically. The Highway part was most recently revised in 1969 at
which time the conclusions of the Transport Survey were incorporated.
28.      DNER continually reviews its construction program to ensure
that economic criteria guide investments; its planning division has been
strengthened and includes the services of experts financed under the
Second Highway Project. The Government will undertake under the proposed
Third Highway loan to continue to improve its data gathering services to
assure reliable inputs for highway planning.
Progress Under the Previous Highway Loans
29.      The First Highway project was 90 percent complete as of November
31, 1971, only slightly behind the schedule which called for 94 percent
completion at that date. The Second Highway project was 31 percent com-
plete and is on schedule. The quality of construction work on both
projects is generally satisfactory and supervision is adequate.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.      A report entitled "Appraisal of the Third Highway Construction
Project, Brazil' (PTR-105a), dated February 29, 1972 is being distributed
separetely. The project which is proposed for Bank financing consista of:
(a)  construction and paving of 1,849 km of federal highways
located in ten different states -- these highways are
described as Group A in the Appraisal Report;
(b) consulting services for supervision of item (a);
(c)  consulting services for detailed engineering of 1,626 km
and feasibility studies of 2,584 km of selected road
sections;
(d) consulting services to assist the National Highways Depart-
ment (DNER) to improve methods of contract supervision; and
(e) consulting services for strengthening of DNER's highway
training center.
31.      The highway construction program covered by the Appraisal Report
includes, in addition to the project for which a Bank loan is now proposed,
construction and paving of a further 681 km of federal and state highways
and supervision thereof. These highways are described as Group B in the
Appraisal Report. As mentioned in para. 7 above, the Brazilian Govern-
ment, with BP..nk support, is attempting to obtain bilateral financing to
assist in the financing of this group of highways.
Highways for Construction
32.      The roads included in the project for construction or improvement
are distributed fairly widely throughout the country -- 32 percent are
located in the Northeast where many priority roads are already being
constructed under the Second Highway project, 11 percent are located in
the South-East where growing agricultural production is handicapped by
the lack of adequate transportation to markets, 43 percent are located
in the Center-West and 14 percent in the South.
Design and Construction Supervision
33.      Detailed engineering studies for the roads proposed for con-
struction and paving vwere carried out under the Second Highway project.
All detailed engineering was made by Brazilian consultants. To establish
continuity of responsibility, consultants *Oho carried out the detailed
engineering for highways to be constructed or paved will also be employed
for construction supervision. Signing of those consultants' contracts
would be a condition for loan effectiveness.



- 9
Additional Consulting Services
34.     IWith a view to preparing further highway construction projects
for possible future Bank financing, provision has been made in the
project for detailed engineering of 1,626 km and feasibility studies
of 2,584 km of highways. Three construction experts would be provided
by the firm of INGEROUTE (France) to assist DNER's construction divi-
sion to establish proper supervising procedures and to coordinate the
various supervisory consultants. Five experts from the same firm were
already employed for this purpose under the Second Highway Project.
In addition, experts will be employed to assist DNER in the formation
of its highway training center. DNER has agreed to submit the program
for the establishment and operation of this center for the Bank's
approval by September 30, 1972.
Cost Estimates and Financing
35.      The total cost of the project is estimated at about $221
million including allowances for price and quantity contingencies.
Local currency costs are estimated at about $196 million equivalent
and foreign exchange costs at about $26 million or 12 percent of the
total. -The Federal and State Governments, would provide $132 million
(60 percent) of the financing for the project and the Bank would provide
$89 million (40 percent).
Execution of the ProJect
36.      DNER would be responsible for execution of the project.  It
would conclude subsidiary agreements with the DERs of those states where
feasibility studies or detailed engineering are to be made for state
highways. Satisfactory conclusion of these subsidiary agreements would
be a condition of loan effectiveness.
37.      Contracts for construction and paving works would be let on
the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines. To facilitate contract administration, and to avoid
overstraining the administrative capacity of DNER the bid date for the
Group B highways (the highways for which bilateral finance is being
sought) will be about three months later than that for Group A (the
proposed Bank project).
38.      During the First and Second Highway projects, difficulties
were created by delays of the Central Bank of Brazil in registering
foreign consultants' contracts. Since registration is legally required
before any payments in foreign currency can be made on a contract, the
loan documents provide that registration of all foreign consultant's
contracts would be a condition for loan effectiveness. The Government
has also agreed to proceed promptly with the acquisition of rights-of-
way for the project roads.



- 10 -
39.      Construction is expected to commence during the third quarter
of 1972 and will be completed in about 32 months. Feasibility and
engineering studies would be started in the second quarter of 1972 and
completed in about fourteen months. Consultants for assistance in
construction supervision will be retained for two years.
Disbursement
40.      Disbursement for the project would follow the usual procedures.
DNER would administer a revolving fund for payments to contractors and
consultants. The Federal Government would finance the cost of construc-
tion and consulting services and the states would reimburse such amounts
as are expended on studies and engineering related to state highways.
The revolving fund would be replenished with the Bank's reimbursements
and with the contributions of the Federal and State Governments. The
loan documents provide that DNER will maintain a balance in the revolving
fund sufficient to cover one month of forward project costs. Establish-
ment of such a fund with an initial deposit of $2.5 million equivalent
would be a condition for loan effectiveness.
Benefits from the Project
41.      The roads proposed for construction were selected from the
priority listings in the Master Plans prepared under the Transport
Survey. Consultants studied alternative alignments wherever warranted,
and final selection was based on economic considerations. Roads
prepared for detailed engineering were selected from the Master Plans
and from feasibility studies and those for feasibility studies were
also selected from the Master Plans.
42.      Net benefits resulting from the proposed road works give
internal economic returns ranging from 13 percent to 40 percent and for
the project as a whole the internal economic return is 24 percent.
Most of the quantified benefits are derived from road user savings on
normal and diverted traffic and from traffic generation. In the case
of sections with heavy traffic, benefits were also derived from reduction
in congestion as well as time savings reflected in the wages of drivers
of commercial vehicles and travellers on business trips. Other quan-
tifiable benefits accrue from savings in road maintenance costs.
43.      A number of benefits have not been included in the calculations
because they are difficult to quantify. These include reductions in
travel time, lowering of inventory costs and less spoilage of fresh fruits
and vegetables. In addition, some of the roads reaching into the frontier
areas will facilitate migration to newly opened agricuiltural lands in the
interior where potential for growth is high.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Federative
Republic of Brazil; and the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and draft
Resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The major features of these agree-
ments have already been described in this report.
45.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
46.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

from debt rescheduling and from the contracting of external financial
credits by the Bank of Brazil. The Bank's Economic Report classifies
these liabilities as part of Brazil's external debt.

Ministry of Transport
Federative Republic of Brazil
January 21, 1972
Mr. Robert McNamara
President of the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. President:
In my letters of February 6 and April 14, 1971 I had occasion to
refer to the importance of a global policy for the development and
operation of the transportation sector in Brazil. The Study of Trans-
port in Brazil undertaken between 1965 and 1970, with technical
assistance from IBRD and financial support from both IBRD and UNDP,
made a valuable contribution to the formulation of this policy. The
master and operational plans drawn up in the course of the preparation
of this Study indicated the specific action required for each mode of
transport and due consideration has been given to those recommendations
in the operational plans and programs of the subsectoral agencies.
Recognizing the need for continued and coordinated sector planning,
which has been increasing markedly, especially since 1968, the Brazilian
Government established in 1969 the Study Group on the Integration of
Transport Policy (GEIPOT) as a permanent advisory organ directly respon-
sible to the Minister of Transport. The rapid economic development of
Brazil has accelerated the demand for transport, and recent investments,
especially in highways, have made it necessary to revise and update the
Study on Transport in Brazil. In addition, although this study has
provided the basis for a global transportation policy, its coverage of
the various forms of transport has been uneven and certain additional
studies have yet to be undertaken, especially on ports and shipping and
on the coordination of these facilities with air transport.
The Brazilian Government, with the assistance of World Bank experts,
has been reviewing the functions and organization of GEIPOT in its ca-
pacity as the principal advisory organ in the development of a coordi-
nated transportation policy. The attached document contains the
directives that have been given to GEIPOT and which are to form the
basis for its permanent task of advising on the coordination of



ANNEX III
Page 4
investments, pricing policies and regulations for the various trans-
portation subsectors, with the broad objective of minimizing the total
cost of transport to the Brazilian economy.
Initially GEIPOT will undertake a review of the studies so far
made and identify the most serious shortcomings in the documentation
at present available. The Brazilian Government not only attaches great
importance to the visit to be made to Brazil by the World Bank trans-
portation sector mission towards the end of the first quarter of 1972,
but also requests its guidance in the preparation of terms of reference
for the studies to be made by the subsectoral agencies in association
with GEIPOT. TWhile these studies will complete the information provided
by the Study of Transport in Brazil, the main emphasis in GEIPOT's
future activities will be not on specific studies but rather on the
continuous updating of existing documentation and, in certain cases,
the promotion of inter-modal studies with a view to solving coordina-
tion problems as they arise.
To enable GEIPOr to effectively perform its role, it is our in-
tention to strengthen its technical manpower resources by the addition
of:
i) A senior ecanomist with experience in transportation planning
andcoordination, to act as adviser to the Superintendent of
GEIPOT.
ii) Two senior economists to be assigned to the economic sector.
iii) An engineer, an economist, a financial analyst and a shipping
expert for the ports and shipping subsector.
iv) A railroad engineer, with operational experience, and a
financial analyst for the railroad subsector.
These requirements for support staff can be discussed later with
the Bank transportation mission that is coming to Brazil.
As we believe that it will be difficult to recruit such senior and
experienced personnel, the Brazilian Government intends to engage con-
sultants for an initial period of two years. During these two years
an intensive training program will be undertaken, leading to the
progressive replacement of the consultants by GEIPOT staff and helping
to upgrade selected personnel from the subsectoral agencies.
We should appreciate the Bank's assistance in drawing up a de-
tailed training program for GEIPOT personnel. The Government will
consider what incentives will be needed to induce GEIPOT staff to re-
main in the subsectoral agencies after completion of the training
period.

GEIPOT will consequently work very closely with the various sub-
sectoral agencies, and will set up joint study groups with them to
decide what needs to be done in each particular case. Also, such inter-
modal cooperation can only be productive if it is supported by effective
planning teams within the subsectoral agencies themselves. The Brazilian
Government believes that both the continuing association with World Bank
missions on various modes of transportation and the training program it-
self will in due course help to improve the planning capabilities of
these agencies.
Very sincerely yours,
/s/    Mario David Andreazza
Minister of Transport

DIRECTIVES TO GEIPOT ON ITS ADVISORY
ROLE IN THE COORDINATION CF TRANSPORT
The principal functions of GEIPOT, as a permanent agency under
the sponsorship of the Ministry of Transport, shall be to advise on the
formulation of a rational transportation policy and to assist in the
coordination of investments and the preparation of pricing policies and
regulations for the activities of the various forms of transportation.
These activities should be regarded as a continuing process of updating
and supplementing existing transportation plans and surveys. In order
to perform this role efficiently GEIPOT will have to cooperate very
closely with the various subsectoral planning departments and establish
a constant interchange of plans from their inception and throughout all
the subsequent operational stages, as indicated below:
A. GEIPOT shall obtain from the subsectoral planning depart-
ments data relating to the existing transportation system
and its operations:
i) Size, condition and capacity of the transportation
infrastructure;
ii) construction projects under way or for wJhich contracts
have been awarded;
iii) number, specifications and condition of vehicles and
equipment;
iv) volume of transport carried by each mode of transport;
v) nature of operations and productivity of each mode of
transport;
vi) transportation costs and prices for services.
B. It shall obtain from the Ministry of Planning the data re-
quired to furnish updated estimates of the future demand
for transportation including:
i) The Government's operating plans with respect to in-
creases in national income;
ii) Government estimates with respect to future population
growth and its location;
iii)  future developments in agriculture, industry, mining
and other sectors and their likely locations.



ANNEX III
Page 7
C. It shall analyze pricing policies and regulations in the
transportation sector, for which purpose it shall:
i)  Evaluate the economic costs of the various modes of
transportation and determine whether or not existing
rate structures and user contributions are adequate,
with a view to ensuring that users meet at least the
marginal costs of such services;
ii)  evaluate the effects on the allocation of resources and
on development, whenever the user contribution is also
designed to achieve fiscal, financial or other objectives;
iii)  review legislation and regulations affecting the opera-
tions of each mode of transport, on the principle that
the users are free to make a free choice between the
various modes available and that, ideally, competition
between the various subsectors should be unrestricted.
This review can take the form of an analysis of exist-
ing legislation and of the rules and practices regulating
the operations of each mode of transport.
D. It shall draw up, in association with the subsectoral plan-
ning agencies, a preliminary investment plan designed to
meet future traffic needs at the minimum cost to the economy
and taking into account the data available on existing in-
dustrial plants, the future demand for transport, appropriate
price-fixing policies and the relative cost of the various
investment options.
E. It shall establish uniform standards for the feasibility
studies to be sponsored by the subsectoral agencies on the
basis of specific investments included in the preliminary
plan.
F. It shall examine the conclusions ofthe feasibility studies
with a view to determining relative priorities for the
proposed investments, and shall recommend to the Minister
a program of investments and operational improvements for
the transportation sector as a whole.
