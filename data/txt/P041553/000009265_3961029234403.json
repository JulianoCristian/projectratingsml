for Cameroon; its objectives are\n            closely linked to adjustment operations and aimed at\n            encouraging growth and private sector participation in the\n            economy. The project will provide additional financing to\n            complete the public enterprise privatization work in the\n            agriculture and financial sectors and enlarge the scope of\n            privatization. Furthermore, the project's objective of\n            establishing a transparent institutional framework will help\n            accelerate the overall privatization program. Finally, the\n            project will prepare the groundwork for the next adjustment\n            sector operation (The Enterprise Reform and Divestiture\n            Credit) scheduled for FY97. More specifically, the project\n            objectives are to: 1) put in place an adequate and\n            transparent institutional framework for\n            privatization/liquidation and implement a broad\n            privatization program; 2) improve the regulatory and\n            business environment in a limited number of well targeted\n            areas complementary to the privatization program; 3)\n            reorganize the loan recovery agency and support the\n            restructuring of two banks; and 4) provide preliminary\n            support to the judiciary to initiate a program of reforms\n            over the next few years. To achieve these objectives, the\n            project will consist of the four following complementary\n            components: 1) privatization and liquidation, which will\n            provide consultant services and basic equipment; 2)\n            restructuring of two banks and the loan recovery agency; 3)\n            preliminary support to improve the private sector\n            environment; and 4) strengthening of the judiciary providing\n            the Ministry of Justice the necessary support."}, "docdt": "1996-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
