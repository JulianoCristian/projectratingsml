only modest. Among the\n            lessons learned, it is highlighted that potential\n            macroeconomic reforms, and privatization require an\n            established technical capacity to achieve such reforms,\n            based on an essential political commitment. This is\n            exemplified by the experience of the joint implementation of\n            this project, and the Third Structural Adjustment Credit\n            Project, which showed that the combination of an adjustment\n            operation, and of a capacity building operation, does\n            provide satisfactory outcomes, while underscoring the\n            importance of harmonized activities, to achieve micro, and\n            macroeconomic reforms in parallel. Another lesson spells out\n            the need to implement public awareness campaigns,\n            irrespective of possible prolonged dialogues, which by\n            themselves may not necessarily lead to measurable\n            indicators, or outputs. Though understandably there is the\n            temptation to move ahead with numerical targets for\n            enterprises to be privatized (or liquidated), it is also\n            true that the government's refusal to render public\n            awareness, may in the end limit the overall scope of the\n            program. Specifically, due to budget constraints on the\n            Bank's side, both a follow-up in the judicial\n            component, and public awareness were neglected; indeed, a\n            regulatory seminar would have raised awareness to forward\n            the utilities privatization, while the judiciary system\n            remains a major cause for the vulnerability of the banking\n            sector, particularly deterring private investments."}, "docdt": "2001-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
