outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            low or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the project: Flexibility built into the design\n            of complex institution building projects enables efficient\n            and effective adjustments in the project implementation in\n            response to rapidly evolving operational environment and\n            needs of project agencies. Creating efficient institutional\n            arrangements is a critical factor for implementing a complex\n            technical assistance program and for maximizing its impact.\n            The difficulties encountered by the PIU and beneficiaries of\n            this project in procurement suggest that the Bank may\n            underestimate the time and effort needed to familiarize\n            Borrowers with the Bank's procurement rules. A\n            technical assistance project usually benefits from the\n            complementarities and leverage provided by a multi-year\n            policy program as the combination can lead to broader and\n            longer-term institutional development impact. It was\n            determined best to address the energy regulation issues in\n            the context of an adjustment operation rather than through a\n            technical assistance loan, and the Loan funds were\n            redirected to other uses."}, "docdt": "2007-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
