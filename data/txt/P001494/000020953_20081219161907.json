It has been\n            pointed out earlier that the weaknesses that affected both\n            preparation and appraisal of several components of this\n            project made the work of the supervision missions more\n            difficult. This difficulty was compounded by the fact that\n            Bank staff responsible for the project changed several times\n            over the course of the first year. Project implementation\n            was delayed because of the following reasons: insufficient\n            preparation of certain project components; rapid staff\n            turnover one year delay in credit effectiveness, as a result\n            of which project funding did not become available until\n            April 1983; insufficient and delayed availability of\n            counterpart funds; and cumbersome procurement procedures,\n            because procurement guidelines of both the World Bank and\n            the Government of Madagascar had to be followed. The\n            management of the Livestock Development Agency for Western\n            (FAFIFAMA) circumvented whenever possible The\n            Government's support for the project was evident\n            throughout, but the services of the Ministry of Animal\n            Production and Water and Forest Resources (MPAEF) proved\n            very weak. Relative to the objectives and design of the\n            project, one can say that project results have been\n            satisfactory in terms of livestock coverage in the Mahajanga province."}, "docdt": "1993-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
