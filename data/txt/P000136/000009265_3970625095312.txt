CURRENCY
The Government of Botswana introduced their own national currency, the
pula, in 1976. Formerly, the currency used in Botswana was the South
African rand: therefore, all local costs in the appraisal of the Third Road
Project are denoted in rand. In this report all costs expressed in local
currency are given in pula except for the Third Road Project appraisal
estimates which are given in rand. The pula was set at the same rate as
the rand until 1977.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This Project Completion Report (PCR) has been prepared for the
Third and Fourth Road Projects in Botswana for which Loans 1174 and
1408-BT, in the amount of US$5.8 and US$20.0 million, were signed on
November 21, 1975 and May 20, 1977 respectively. Loan 1174-BT was fully
disbursed by February 1983, 32 months later than estimated at appraisal;
US$0.731 million of the loan funds were cancelled in February 1983.
Disbursements of Loan 1408-BT were completed in November 1984, 41 months
later than estimated at appraisal; US$0.9 million of loan funds were
cancelled in November 1983, as a consequence of the March 1983 amendment of
the loan agreement and an unused loan balance of US$1.5 million was
cancelled in late 1984.
The PCR was prepared by EAPT2 and is based on Appraisal Reports
Nos: 896-BT - dated October 16, 1975 - and 1389b-BT - dated March 23, 1977,
supervision reports, legal documents, project correspondence files and
consultant progress and other reports.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft completion report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however,
none were received.

THIRD AND .-OURTH ROAD PROJECTS
LOAN 1174 Ahv 1408-BT
PROJECT COMrLETION REPORT
HIGHL :GHTS
(i)       The Third and Fourth Road Projects in Botswana included the
upgrading to bitumen standard of 150 km of the North-South road, as well as
50 km of other main roads. Originel project components also included a
road maintenance study and its implementation, development of a
labor-intensive district road maintenance program, a feeder road study and
extension of road training facilities. There were significant cost savings
for both projects as a result of lower than estimated construction costs,
changes in exchange rates, and USAID financing of the implementation of the
road maintenance study (paras. 3.39 - 3.47). Cost savings were used to
finance an additional 20 km of roads, two road feasibility studies,
detailed engineering of several roads, increased technical assistance for
DRMP, and additional road training facilities. Additional funds were also
received from NORAD for equipment costs for the district road maintenance
program.
(ii)      Construction of the projects' major road components was completed
to a satisfactory standard, although one road was completed fourteen months
behind schedule because award of the contract for construction was delayed
due to staff shortages in the Roads Department (para. 3.02). These staff
shortages also resulted in a one year delay in letting the contract for the
road maintenance study; a further six months delay in finalizing the report
meant that the study was not completed until eighteen months after the
appraisal estimate (para. 3.06). Staff shortages were foreseen during
project preparation but appeared to have improved by appraisal.
Subsequently, the staffing situation deteriorated again. Implementation of
the study's findings were delayed because of the time required for
arranging USAID financing of the road maintenance program and redesign of
the pilot district road maintenance program by ILO experts called in after
appraisal of the Third Project (paras. 3.08 and 3.23).
(iii)     The following are the two projects' major points of interest:
(a)     appraisal construction costs were overestimated by more
than 30Z in both projects (paras. 3.40 and 3.45); this
would not have occurred if final Bank approval of both
projects had been withheld until after the opening of
bids.   Bids for construction of the Gaborone-Molelpolole
roads were not called until 15 months after Board
approval of the Project;



-vii-
(b)     implementation of the Fourth Road Project was seriously
affected by delays in completion of the road maintenance
study financed under the Third Project (para. 2.08).
Notional amounts were included in the Fourth project for
implementation of the study's findings (both for road
maintenance and extension of the district road
maintenance program), but these amounts proved to be much
lower than required. This indicates the problem of
including components that are only at the identification
stage in the projects. It would not have been possible to
complete implementation of the two components were it not
for bilateral assistance provided by USAID and NORAD
(para. 3.46).
(c)     additional components were included in the Fourth Road
Project throughout implementation of the project for a
total cost of US$3.6 million (paras. 3.28 - 3.35). There
were also three other components included at appraisal
that were only tentatively identified. Therefore, a
substantial part of the project was not designed at the
time of preparation/appraisal of the project and only
evolved during the course of project implementation. The
additional components included in the two projects
included a miscellaneous collection of small items.
Regarding the three components only tentatively
identified at appraisal, it would have been better to
have delayed them until the next project in view of their
poor state of preparation (para. 6.04).
(d)     during the implementation of the projects there were
occasional lapses in communication between the Bank and
RD (para. 6.03). These could have been avoided by:
- having Aide Memoires drafted by Bank supervision
missions and approved by RD before mission departure
and
- maintaining a higher level of Bank staff continuity;
turnover of Bank staff dealing with the two projects
was high.

BOTSWANA
THIRD AND FOURTH ROAD PROJECTS
(LOANS 1174 AND 1408-BT)
PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      At independence in 1966, Botswana had about 430 km of all-weather
roads which mainly served the eastern corridor of the country - the area
where 75X of the population lived. By 1975, the all-weather road network
had expanded to about 1000 km and the length of bituminous-surfaced roads
had increased from 26 to 150 km. The Bank Group had assisted with the
development of the road network through two credits for the First and
Seccnd Road Projects (Cr. 63-BEC and Cr. 303-BT) and one loan for an
infrastructure project with a road component1/.   By 1975, the Government
was proceeding with an ambitious five-year road plan to construct or
upgrade a further 1112 km of trunk and main roads, including improvement of
the remaining 780 km of the North-South road to bituminous standard. The
Third and Fourth Road projects included the upgrading to bituminous
standard of 150 km of the North-South road, as well as 50 km of other main
roads. External assistance for the North-South road was also forthcoming
from the UK's Overseas Development Ministry (ODM), Germany's Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), the Danish International Development Agency
(DANIDA), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the
Norwegian Agency for Development (NORAD), and the US Agency for
International Development (USAID).
1.02      The rapidly expanding road network had put considerable pressure
on the Roads Department (RD) of the Ministry of Works and Communications
(MWC) and Central Transport Organization (CTO). There was insufficient
staff for the increasing workload and available staff were poorly trained.
The CTB had insufficient maintenance equipment to hire out to RD
particularly the Maintenance Department, and was not able to maintain the
little equipment that there was. Therefore, the Third and Fourth Road
Projects included components to improve road maintenance and the training
of RD staff. Both projects also included components for developing a road
maintenance capacity for the district roads, which were mainly earth/sand
roads that received little, if any, maintenance. Improved district road
maIntenance was regarded as essential if Government policy to foster
agricultural development was to be realized.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND APPROVAL
A. Third Road Project
Prepsration
2.01      lhe Third Read Project was first discussed in early 1973, but at
that time there was only US$2.0 million available in the lending program
for a road project. Nevertheless, the Bank decided to go ahead with
preappraisal in November 1973 with a project to include the upgrading of
the Gaborone-Molepolole road to paved standard. This 52 km Lwo-lane earth
and gravel road linked Molepolole, the administrative and commercial center
of Kweneng District, with the capital, Gaborone. RD was carrying out the
detailed engineering although no feasibility study had been carried out.
However, the Bank mission estimated an economic rate of return for the road
based on preliminary cost estimates and traffic counts obtained from the
Plarning Unit of MWC.  Given that traffic ranged from 200-330 vehicles per
day (vpd) for different sections of the road, the estimated economic rate
of return appeared to be reasonable.
2.02      At the Bank's Auinual Meetings in September 1973, the Botswaria
Goverrment requested that upgrading of the Mahalapye-Serule section (150
km) of the North-South road also be included in the Third Project. ihe
Government was giving hiah priority to this se,tion since it was the last
part of the Gaborone-Nata road for which financing was not yet available.
The Government was also anxious to complete the road before the 1973 oil
embargo on the Republic of South Africa (RSA) affected Botswana's oil
supplies.  The sense of urgency was such that the Government was prepared
to finance the feasibility study and detailed enigineering out of its own
funds. However, including the Mahalapye-Serule Section in the project
would have delayed project preparation and implementation because of the
additional time required for the detailed engineering of the Mahalapye-
Serule Section. Hence the Bank suggested to go ahead with the Third Road
Project as originally discussed and to include the Mahalapye-Serule Section
in the Fourth Project. The Government agreed to this approach, in
particular as the urgency to upgrade the Mahalapye-Serule Section had
diminished because the oil embargo had turned out to be less effective than
anticipated.
Appraisal
2.03      The project as originally defined was appraised in January 1975
by which ti.ae the amount available for the project in the lending program
had been increased to US$8.0 million. Durirg appraisal, the Governmerit
requested that maintenance equipment be financed under the project, but the
appraisal mission insisted that a road mainteriance study was first required
to determine equipment arid other needs. The appraisal mission was
particularly concerned with the poor performance of the CIO, which was
responsible for the allocation and maintenance of all plant arid vehicles
for central Governmerit minis_ries and agencies, inicluding RD's
Maintenance Branch. Inadequate facilities, shortage of skilled staff anid
poor equipment managemerit procedures resulted iri a low 30  equipment
availability rate, which seriously hampered road maintenarice operations.
Ihe mission suggested that if another agency finianced the National
Transport Plan which was already included in the project, there would be
sufficient funds to include a Road Maintenance Study in the project.



- 3 -
Shortly after the appraisal, Government found alternative financing for the
Transport4Plan and the maintenance study was included. No assistance for
CTO was provided in the project, since CIDA had already agreed to provide
technical assistance to CTO to review the organization and draw up an
improvement program. However, a covenant was included in the Loan
Agreement to ensure that an acceptable program to improve CTO was drawn up
and that implementation of the program would be carried out (para. 4.02).
2.04      In 1973, the Government had proposed that the project include a
component to develop a road maintenance capacity for the Central District.
In theory, the districts had responsibility fcr district road maintenance,
but in practice little maintenance was carried out because of the lack of
equipment and funds and no trained staff. The appraisal mission studied
the Government's proposals and concluded that different maintenance
techniques should be tested, including labor and capital-intensive
methods. Therefore, preparation of a pilot program to determine the most
appropriate blend of equipment and labor was included in the Road
Maintenance Study. The project also included financing of two maintenance
units to implement the pilot program. The whole program was to be
implemented by the Ministry of Local Government and Lands (MLGL), since it
was responsible for district councils.
Negotiations and Board Approva]
2.05      The loan was negotiated in September 1975 with no major issues.
By the time of Board Presentation in November 1975, the project cost had
dropped from US$7.76 to US$7.38 because of the devaluation of the Rand
against the US dollar. The Bank's loan was correspondingly reduced from
US$6.0 to US$5.8 million, representing 78% of total project costs and 92%
of the foreign exchange component.
B. Fourth Road Project
Preparation
2.06      The Fourth Road Project quickly followed the Third Project, with
only ten months between Board approval of the Third and appraisal of the
Fourth. The feasibility study for the Mahalapye-Serule road, carried out
by Sir Alexander Gibbs, had begun in 1974 when the Government was anxious
to include the road in the Third Project (para. 2.02). The study was
completed in July 1975 and found that the economic rate of return for the
road was 190. Detailed engineering, which was financed under the Third
Road Project (para. 3.05), was substantially completed by September 1976.
Appraisal
2.07      During appraisal, the Government requested that the Bank also
finance the upgrading of six km of road from Francistown to the industrial
estate at Dumela. The appraisal mission suggested that the Government
request KfW financing since the road could be considered as a continuation
of the Francistown-Serule road which was being financed by KfW and was soon
to go to tender. The Government and the appraisal mission finally agreed
that if KfW financing was not forthcoming the Bank would finance the road,
but only if the work was included as a variation order to the



-4-
Francistown-Serule contract. On the mission's return to Washington, this
arrangement was rejected by the Bank on the grounds that KfW would have to
conform to Bank procurement rules and, even if possible, might increase
unit prices of the contract. KfW was therefore requested to finance the
road, to which it agreed in November 1976.
2.08      Implementation of the recommendations of the Road Maintenance
Study financed under the Third Project were to be included in the Fourth
Project. However, by the time of appraisal of the Fourth Project in
September 1976, the Maintenance Study had not even started (para. 3.06) so
that notional amounts of US$1.15 million were included in the project for
both the implementation of the findings of the Road Maintenance Study and
extension of the pilot District Roads Maintenance Program (DRMP). In
addition, a notional amount of US$0.23 million was included for preparation
of a Fifth Road Project (although no road project was included in the
lending program). A small amount was also included for the purchase of
equipment for RD's Training School. By the time of the Decision Meeting in
October 1976, the notional amount allocated for the preparation of a Fifth
Road Project had been reallocated to the preparation of a feeder roads
program, which was to form part of a larger Rural Development Program which
was only at a very early identification stage.
2.09      Total project costs estimated at appraisal were US$24.02 million,
substantially higher than expected because of an increase in construction
cost estimates. Therefore, the Bank increased the loan amount from US$14.0
to US$18.0 million to finance 75Z of project costs. The poor performance
of CTO was still a major issue because of the short time between the two
projects and because the CIDA-financed team had only just begun to
implement its program to reorganize CTO and improve operations. In view of
the uncertainty, the Bank decided to make improved performance of CTO
(including a satisfactory vehicle and equipment availability rate) a
condition of disbursement for road maintenance equipment. Another
important issue raised at the Decision Meeting was the serious shortage of
professional staff within RD. The Government did not accept the Bank's
suggestion that loan funds be used to "top up" expatriate salaries to make
the positions more financially attractive and the Bank did not insist on
this point, since by appraisal the staffing situation had somewhat
improved with the arrival of more expatriate staff. The only other issue
raised at the Decision Meeting was the marginal economic rate of return of
12% and low first year rate of return of 10  for the Mahalapye-Serule
road. The drop in the rate of return was the result of the increase in
construction cost estimates since the feasibility study and the downward
revision of some benefits. However, by Board presentation in April 1977
the reestimated rate of return was 15% (despite a 9% increase in costs
(para 2.10) over appraisal estimates) because the consultants had increased
their estimates of vehicle operating costs (VOC). The extent to which the
increase was justified is difficult to evaluate, given the subsequent
different basis for estimating VOC (using the HDM).
Negotiations
2.10      By October 1976, cost estimates were again increased to reflect
highKr than expected unit prices of bids on the Francistown-Serule road,
bringing total project costs to US$26.35 million. Subsequently, the Bank
agreed to the Government's request during negotiations to increase the loan
amount from US$18.0 to US$20.0 million, covering 92% of foreign exchange



costs. The Government hoped to obtain bilateral financing for the pilot
DRMP and sought assurances from the Bank that if this should occur, the
DRMP funds could be reallocated to other categories to cover 100 of
foreign costs. The Bank agreed to consider Government's request nearer the
time. The Bank also agreed to Government's request to include an
additional US$45,000 for an additional classroom building for the RD
Training School. The Government made strong representations during
negotiations to substitute a study of feeder roads in the Tuli Block for
the feeder road study already included in the project. (The Tuli Block is
a farming and livestock area lying adjacent to the eastern border with
South Africa.) However, the Bank was adamant that the funds allocated
should be reserved for a study of feeder roads that would form part of a
rural development program. Nevertheless, the Bank agreed to consider the
Tuli Block study should there be cost savings from the supervision of
construction contract, as anticipated by Government.
2.11      The Government delegation expressed strong reservations about the
covenant requiring the Borrower to consult annually with the Bank on its
proposed budgetary allocations for road maintenance. They were concerned
that the covenant could lead to internal conflicts between MWC and the
Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) during the preparation
of annual budgets, depending on the Bank's reaction to the level of the
proposed budget. In order to alleviate some of the Delegation's concerns,
the wording of the covenant was amended to avoid reference to "proposed"
budgetary allocations (which gave a timing connotation) and instead
required that budgetary estimates and expenditures for road maintenance be
discussed annually with the Bank.
Board Approval and Changes in Project Financing
2.12      The loan was approved by the Board in April 1977. Shortly after,
both OPEC and the Norwegian Government expressed interest in co-financing
the project. OPEC was willing to provide US$1.0 million and agreed to
finance the supervision of construction contract on a parallel financing
basis,after declining to finance part of the construction contract because
of the possibility that the contractor would be South African. The
Norwegian Government offered US$10.0 million and agreed to Botswana's
request to finance all of the local costs, net of taxes, amounting to
US$5.0 million. Problems arose with the disbursement arrangements since
Norway wanted the Bank to administer the loan, including the financing of
local costs. Eventually, an agreement was reached on the participation of
Norway in the loan, with an annual amount to be deposited by the Norwegian
Government in a special non-interest bearing account with the Bank of
Norway in the name of the Bank. The Bank would tnen withdraw funds as
needed for withdrawals by the Borrower from the loan account or to
reimburse the Bank. The agreement between the Bank and the Norwegian
Government was riot finalised until May 1978 because of the delay in
agreeing on disbursement procedures.
Project Objectives and Description
2.13      The objectives of both projects were to assist Government to
develop the road network (particularly the completion of the improvement of
the North-South road), plan arid organize main and district road
maintenance, strengthen RD, and enforce vehicle weight and dimensions
legislation. The projects included the following components:

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
3.01     There were no special conditions or delays in effectiveness of
either of the two projects. The date of effectiveness for the Third
Project was January 12, 1976 and for the Fourth Project, August 18,1977.
A.   Implementation of the Third Road Project
Construction of Gaborone-Molepolole Road
3.02     Bids for the construction contract were called in December 1976,
one year later than scheduled and 15 months after Board presentation.
This delay was mainly the result of the shortage of staff in RD (para.
4.04), which resulted in delays in approval of the tender documents. Bids
were opened in February 1977; a South African contractor was selected but
the contract was not signed until July 1977, again because of staff
shortages in RD. Actual construction began in July 1977, fourteen months
behind schedule.
3.03     The contract was due to be comp,eted by October 1978 but the road
was not substantially completed until June 1979, eight months behind the
contract schedule. Four months of this delay was due to an extension of
the contract required because of greater than estimated earthworks and
abnormal rainfall in 1978, as well as minor extensions because of the
inadequate supply of water in Molepolole due to Government delay in moving
an existing water line and work outside the original scope of the contract.
The remaining four months overrun was the result of contractor delays. By
May 1978, only 25X of work had been completed in 560 of the contract
period: in June 1978, the Chief Roads Engineer wrote to the contractor to
express grave concern over the slow rate of construction progress. Reasons
for slow progress were insufficient equipment to carry out the work, poor
state of repair of much of the equipment and the closing down of site
operations twice monthly for long weekends when construction was already
far behind schedule. Finally, the contractor's financial problems led to
the take-over of the firm by a larger construction company in February
1979, from which time progress substantially improved. Liquidated damages
paid by the contractor for the delay amounted to US$58,000. The road was
to be repaired by the contractor during the maintenance period. A contract
for additional drainage works in Molepolole was awarded to a contractor
registered in Botswana in December 1981 at a cost of US$120,000. This work
was satisfactorily completed in mid-1982.
3.04     Supervision of construction was carried out by American
consultants. At the time of contract negotiations in November 1976, the
Bank considered that the consultants' estimates of 83.5 man-months for
supervision was excessive for a 15-month construction contract.
Subsequently, the amount of expatriate man-months was reduced, but even
with the resulting reduction in costs the total cost of the consultant's
contract was still 42% higher than estimated at appraisal. Final costs
were even higher because of the longer construction period. The
consultants provided close supervision of the contract and held many
meetings with-the contractor's representatives to try to resolve the
problems of slow construction progress.



- 8 -
Detailed Engineering Mahalapye-Serule Road
3.05      The contract for the detailed engineering of the Mahalapye-Serule
road was awarded to a British consulting firm. Work began in February 1976
and -as satisfactorily completed on schedule in December 1976.
Road Maintenance Study
3.06     Consultants for the Maintenance Study were shortlisted in November
1975, but invitations for proposals did not go out until June 1976 because
RD did not have sufficient staff to evaluate proposals (para. 4.04). The
study was awarded to a joint venture of Danish and British consultants.
Work finally started in February 1977, over one year behind schedule. The
draft report was completed by September 1977, but the final report was not
issued until May 1978, 18 months later than estimated at appraisal. The
delay was partly due to the protracted time (8 months) taken by the
consultants to incorporate the comments of the Government and the Bank into
the report.
3.07     The study can be divided into two parts - fa) recommendations for
improving maintenance of the main road network, and (b) preparation of the
pilot DRMP.   A five-year program was drawn up for the maintenance and
improvement of the main road network. The report also contained
recommendations on qazetting and degazetting of roads, a task system for
maintenance workers to improve productivity, an accelerated program of
localization of Mainternance Branch staff, a plant hire scheme, improved
cost accounting, mechanical workshop improvements, maintenance vehicle and
equipment requirements, and more use of private sector workshops for repair
and maintenance of vehicles and equipment. While RD endorsed the latter
recommendation, CTO strongly disagreed with it, claiming that with extra
facilities and more time the performance of CTO would improve (para 4.06).
RD disagreed with the consultants recommendations that all periodic
mainterance continue to go out to contract since RD wanted to build up a
force account periodic maintenance capacity which it has proceeded to do.
Subsequently, the Bank agreed to RD's request to include the purchase of
equipment for two regravelling for account units under the Fourth Road
Project, although this was eventually financed by USAID (para. 3.23). The
whole problem of poor relations between RD and CTo was not addressed by the
consultants in the study, which only recommended that relations "should be
improved". The poor relations stemmed from RD's frustration with continued
poor performance of CT0 and what was perceived as lack of cooperation.
3.08      Pilot DRMP.  Ihe consultants recommended a labor-intensive
improvement and maintenance program for 370 km of district roads in the
Central District. However, the extent to which the program would be
replicable in other districts was seriously questioned by the consultants,
given the qreater administrative, materials, equioment and other resources
of the Central District compareG to others. Such doubts were criticised by
both the Government and the Bank who considered that the program could
hardly be a pilot one if it could not be replicated elsewhere, although
there was still the problem of the much lower population densities of other
districts.   Consequently, it was possible to extend the program to other
districts (para 3.24). Overall, the Governmenit found that the design of
the pilot program needed revisions. Ihe Bank therefore agreed with the
Government that an individual be recruited immediately to establis.. one
maintenance unit to test labor-intensive methods and other appropriate
levels of technology, if necessary. The expert would be responsible for



- 9 -
drawing up proposals for the appropriate composition and requirements of
the pilot unit, rather than accepting the Maintenance Study's
recommendations on the pilot program. RD requested both the Bank and ILO
for assistance with recruiting a suitable expert for the pilot DRMP and ILO
responded in mid-1978 by providing an experienced engineer to review the
program's needs.
3.09     The program submitted by ILO in April 1979 was considerably larger
than the one recommended in the Maintenance Study and envisaged at
appraisal, with estimated costs over three times the notional sum included
at appraisal. The program included the selective betterment of roads and
substantial technical assistance. The Bank was to finance 84 man-months of
technical assistance for a total cost of US$0.60 million, while the
equipment and all local costs were to be financed by NORAD for a total cost
of US$0.50 million. The Bank was concerned that the program was far too
large and that the technical assistance requirements were excessive, given
the experience already accumulated in Kenya and other countries with
labor-intensive techniques. However, ILO insisted on retaining all
technical assistance but agreed that the Project Manager would review
expatriate staffing requirements on arrival. The Bank agreed to this and
signed an agreement with ILO in September 1979.
Implementation of the Pilot District Road Maintenance Program
3.10      The program eventually started in January 1980, three years later
than estimated at appraisal, and was completed by July 1982, four years
later than scheduled. During 1980, various techniques were tried on
experimental sections of roads and by May 1981 a full pilot program had
begun. Overall, the pilot program proved successful in developing
labor-intensive methods for the selective betterment and maintenance of
roads. Altogether, 35 km of roads were improved and 100 km of bush
clearing was carried out between May 1981 and June 1982, all by
labor-intensive methods. The original concern over the availability of
labor proved unfounded, for no problems with recruiting labor were
encountered. This was despite a daily wage rate of P2.10, 48Z less than
the public sector minimum wage (a special dispensation had been given by
the Cabinet to allow the program to pay the lower rate). Productivity did
not appear to suffer, being on a par with other countries where
labor-intensive methods had been introduced. Efforts were made to foster
the local production of tools, but most locally manufactured tools proved
to be of inferior quality with the exception of donkey carts manufactured
for the program.
3.11      The pilot program's estimate of the direct costs of spot
improvements are US$1140/km and for roads requiring a higher level of
betterment US$1880/km. Indirect costs, excluding technical assistance, are
an additional US$1550/km. Technical assistance costs have not been
included because such costs are considered to have longer term training and
institution-building benefits.
Staff Training for RD
3.12      Funds allocated under the loan for scholarships for RD trainees
abroad were not utilised, since scholarships were provided by USAID.

Soils Laboratory Equipment
3.13     Soils and materials laboratory equipment as agreed at appraisal
was delivered in 1976. In 1982, the Government requested that the Bank
finance an additional US$0.25 million of equipment for the new laboratory
which had been financed under the Fourth Road Project. The Bank agreed and
the equipment was purchased and delivered by March 1983.
Weighbridges and Loadometers
3.14     Three weighbridges and 12 loadometers were purchased and procured
by October 1976. However, when the first weighbridge was installed it was
found to be far too sensitive, requiring constant adjustments of the scales
and intensive maintenance. During the rainy season it was virtually
inoperable due to moisture intrusion. RD proposed to the Bank that eight
sets of semi-portable weighbridges designed for conditions similar to those
of Botswana be purchased with savings from other project components for a
total cost of US$0.13 million. The Bank agreed and the weighbridges were
delivered and installed by mid-1982 and appears to be operating efficiently
and effectively.   The Bank also agreed to RD purchasing 24 automatic
traffic counters to improve collection of traffic data for a cost of
US$20,000.
Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering of the Dumela-Ramokgwebana Road
3.15     In 1978, the Government requested that the feasibility study and
detailed engineering of the Dumela-Ramokgwebana road be financed with cost
savings under the loan. The road led to the border with Zimbabwe and was
considered necessary because of the extra traffic expected to be generated
when Zimbabwe became independent and lifted restrictions on traffic
crossing the border. The Bank agreed and a firm of British/South African
consultants were selected to carry out the feasibilty study in 3anuary
1979. The study was completed by November 1979 and showed that paving the
road was economically justified for 47 of the 76 km of road up to the
border if restrictions on traffic crossing the border were not lifted.
However, if the restrictions were lifted, paving of a further 18 km would
be marginally justified. Detailed engineering of 65 km of the road was
awarded to another UK firm; an additional 10 km to the Zimbabwean border
was included at a late stage in the study. The work was satisfactorily
completed by October 1980 and the road was later constructed under the
Fifth Road Project (Loan 1941-BT).
Project Revisions
3.16      An amendment to the Loan Agreement (Annex 1) was approved in June
1978 to include the feasibility study and detailed engineering of the
Dumela-Ramokgwebana road, additional weighbridges and traffic counters. The
total and foreign cost estimates for the project were revised downwards,
mainly because of cost savings for construction of the Gaborone-Molepolole
road.  This meant that the Bank could finance 100' of the foreign costs as
opposed to the original 92%, even with additional components included in
the project.

B. Implementation of the Fourth Road Project
Construction of the Mahalapye-Serule Road
3.17     The contract for the construction of the Mahalapye-Serule road was
awarded to the lowest bidder, an Italian contractor, in November 1977,
three months behind the appraisal schedule. During the first half of the
contract, delays were encountered because of the contractor's difficulties
in organising the construction works, problems with compaction and level
control of the base course, and technical problems with new chip
spreaders. Continuity of works also suffered from a large turnover of
expatriate staff and delays in arrival of replacements (partly due to the
length of time it took to process residence/work permits). None of the
above problems were apparent during prequalification. Attempts to rectify
the situation were hampered by strained relations between the contractor's
agent and the consultant's supervision staff. However, after the
replacement of the agent with another contract manager in May 1979
construction progress and contractor/consultant relations improved
significantly. The road was completed to a satisfactory standard by
September 1980, three months behind schedule. On completion of the road,
the contractor put in claims for poor weather, additional works and other
items amounting to US$2.50 million, the majority of which were rejected by
the supervising consultants. Subsequently, after negotiations the
contractor and .he Government agreed in 1982 to a settlement of US$1.20
million for all clainiC.
3.18     Construction supervision was awarded to the same consultants who
had carried out the feasibility study; their performance was satisfactory.
Feeder Road Study
3.19     The project included a feeder road study to be carried out after
the Ministry of Agriculture had prepared an Arable Land Development
Program, so as to ensure coordination of rural road and rural development
programs. However, progress was very slow so that by 1980 rural
development areas had still not been identified by the Ministry of
Agriculture, nor was there any sign of the program beginning in the near
future. Therefore, MWC decided to go ahead with first phase of a study to
identify 1000 km of feeder road priorities; the second phase was too
include an in-depth study of the technical and economic feasibility of
upgrading those roads. The study was awarded to a firm of British
consultar,ts and work was started in March 1980, one year later than
scheduled at appraisal.
3.20     The first phase of the study was completed by August 1980.  The
consultants studied 4000 km of roads and, using simple economic and social
criteria, identified 1000 km for further study in Phase 2. RD was under
the impression that the 1000 km had been agreed to during a Bank
supervision mission, especially since 1000 km had been included in the TOR
for the second phase of the study. However, subsequently the Bank
recommended that 500 km be included in Phase 2 because only this amount
appeared to be economically justified for further study. The Bank also
objected to the inclusion of main roads in the list of feeder roads to
receive further study, although in Botswana the majority of main roads were
of the same class as feeder roads and had low traffic levels and road
influence areas with low population densities. However, the Government



- 12 -
insisted on including 1000 km in Phase 2 because of its strong commitment
and perceived contractual obligation to study this amount; the remaining
500 km were therefore financed out of local funds.
3.21     The major problem with Phase 1 was that the consultants used a
methodology more appropriate to Phase 2 for selecting the roads to be
studied. This methodology should have been discussed with the Bank at the
beginning of Phase II. Simple criteria should have been developed for
identifying road priorities in Phase 1 as suggested in guidelines for the
study sent to the Government by the Bank after receiving the terms of
reference. A more detailed economic analysis could then have been carried
out as part of Phase 2. In addition, the TOR for Phase 2 seem to have been
interpreted to include only studying the feasibility of upgrading roads to
gravel or bitumen standard, rather than studying improvement of the roads
to a lower standard. Instead of recommending improvements to the
methodology of the studv, the Bank tried to make the Government abide by
the findings nf Phase 1. Significantly, after the study was completed in
1981 the Bank agreed to finance the preparation of a spot improvement
program for the 900 km of roads not economically justified for upgrading to
a higher standard, which was the original intention of the study.
Confusion over the study stemmed from the turnover of Bank staff working on
the project (para 6.03) and an ambiguous set of TOR.   Phase 2 found that
only three roads were economically justified for upgrading to bituminous
standard after the design standards were reduced on the advice of the
Bank. These were:
Maun-Shorobe            35 km
Mochudi-Sikwane         40 km
Pitsane-Good Hope       27 km
3.22     The Bank agreed in early 1982 to finance the detailed engineering
of the above roads with cost savings from other components. The detailed
engineering, which was awarded to three different consultants, was
completed by September/October 1983.
Implementation of Road Maintenance Study
3.23     Implementation of the Road Maintenance Study was not ready to
start until mid-1978 when the Maintenance Study was finalized (para. 3.06).
However, USAID offered to finance the maintenance program with
US$6.0 million of grant funds, so that no Bank funds were required.
Implementation of the program began in early 1980, one year later than
estimated at appraisal. -It included maintenance equipment and technical
assistance for RD and CTO, including one maintenance engineer, one cost
accountant and two mechanical training officers. The program was completed
by the end of 1983, 18 months later than estimated at appraisal. The
performance of RD's Maintenance Branch was improved after reorganisation
and the installation of a cost accounting system. Performance certainly
benefitted after the delivery of US$4.87 million of vehicles and equipment
and the secondment of CTO mechanics to road maintenance depots. Overall,
coordination between RD and CTO improved with different personnel and
equipment availability rates increased, due in large measure to the new
equipment. However, problems still exist with CTO's inventory control and
the timing and processing procedures for the procurement of spare parts.
Also, vehicles were not replaced as scheduled in 1982 because of cutbacks



- 13 -
in recurrent funds resulting from the Government's poor budgetary
situation.
Extension of DRMP
3.24     The pilot project for DRMP was not completed until mid-1982
(para. 3.10), nearly three years later than estimated at appraisal.
Serious consideration was given to deleting the extension of the program
from the project, since the Closing Date was originally set for December
1981. However, in order that other project components could be completed
the Closing Date was extended to December 1983, so that the extension of
DRMP was kept in the project. The contract for the IL technical
assistance team for the extension of the program to other districts was
signed in September 1982; the team consisted of one technical adviser, one
civil engineer, one training adviser, and one training officer. In
addition, SIDA financed the post of district roads engineer with
responsibility for DRMP and other rural road programs within MLGL. NORAD
continued to finance all equipment and local costs of the program (para.
3.10). By end-1983, three additional DRMP units had been established in
Central, Ghanzi and North East districts and there were also plans to
establish two more in North West and Kgatleng districts in 1984. Training
of gang leaders, technical assistants and officers has been highly
successful.
3.25     This phase of the program was scheduled for completion by
end-1986, but the Closing Date for the project remained December 1983.
Consequently, the Government requested additional funds for the rest of the
program from either cost savings under the Fifth Road Project or from a
future road project. The Bank was not able to grant this request since the
technical asistance services proposed for financing were different from and
additional to those appraised in the Fifth Road Project (which also had a
Closing Date of October 1984) and the uncertainty as to whether there would
be another road project. However, on an exceptional basis, the Bank agreed
to continue to process withdrawal applications for DRMP until June 1984,
six months after the Closing Date. Thereafter, NORAD agreed to pick up the
technical assistance costs, in view of its already deep involvement in the
program.
Training
3.26     During appraisal no training specialist from the Bank had visited
Botswara to review the RD training program. However, a Bank training
specialist was sent out in June 1979 to discuss with the Government the
role of the MD Training Center and the development of a new curriculum,
including a course for road technicians. The Bank and the Government
subsequently agreed to expand the Training Center from the three classrooms
and office space envisaged at appraisal to include applied science and
soils and materials laboratory facilities, additional classroom space and
hostel facilities. British consultants were appointed to prepare detailed
plans and bid documents. The appraisal envisaged that works would be
carried out by force account because of lack of local contractors to carry
out such a small contract, but the Bank later agreed to Government's
request to contract out the work because of the expanded size of the
contract. The contract was awarded to a local company after local
competitive bidding; work began in late 1979 and was satisfactorily
completed in September 1980.



- 14 -
3.27      In 1982, the Bank agreed to Government's request to finance yet
another extension of the Training Celdter with cost savings from other
project components. A further extension of hostel and kitchen facilities
was necessary because RD had undertaken the additional responsibility of
training staff for DRMP (although theoretically the responsibility was that
of MLGL). The extension was designed by consultants and the contract was
awarded to a local firm in October 1983 after local competitive bidding.
After considerable delays, the work was satisfactorily completed by October
1984. Despite the doubling of funds allocated to training equipment in
1978 (para. 3.39), no equipment was procured under the project because of
availability of funds from bilateral donors. Because of the shortage of
staff at the Training Center, additional assistance was provided in 1981
under the Fifth Road Project for training of instructors.
Additional Project Components
3.28     Tuli Block Road Study. When the contract for the supervision of
construction of the Mahalapye-Serule road was let in May 1977, the
Government immediately followed up on its request made at negotiations
(para. 2.10) to use cost savings from the supervision of construction
contract for a study of roads ire the Tuli Block area.  The Bank only agreed
to the study once the bids for construction of the Mahalapye-Serule road
had come in well under the estimated cost (para. 3.45). The study, awarded
to a joint venture of two firms from USA and Botswana, commenced in January
1979 and was completed by November. The main objective of the study was to
identify roads which would provide improved access for produce from the
Tuli Block area to the main centers of population in Botswana. The Tuli
Block is an area of large freehold farms and subsistence agriculture; it
had good agricultural potential for both irrigated and dryland farming, but
little development had taken place during the last ten years.
3.29      The study found that upgrading of several roads to paved standard
for varying widths of 3.7 - 6.0 meters was economically justified, provided
that an optimistic scenario for agricultural development was assumed.
However, if no change in agricultural development was to take place then
upgrading of only one road was economically justified. Based on the
optimistic agricultural scenario, the Bank agreed to finance the detailed
engineering of three roads to paved standard:
Selebi Phikwe - Sefophe           23 km         6.0 m wide
Palapye - Martin's Drift         100 km         4.5 m wide
Mahalapye - Macheneng             96 km         3.7 m wide
The same joint venture carried out detailed engineering for the first two
roads and the third road was awarded to another firm of South African
consultants. Work began in February 1980 and was satisfactorily completed
by early 1981. In mid-1980, the Bank agreed that detailed engineering for
the seven km access road to the Selebi Phikwe Airport could be added to the
Selebi Phikwe - Sefophe contract. This road, along with the airport access
road, was included for construction in the Fifth Road Project. However,
the other two roads were not included because the Bank's 1980 agricultural
sector mission found that the optimistic scenario for agricultural
development in the Tuli Block area was unrealistic. The study also
recommended spot improvements for several hundred kilometers of roads, 149
km of which were included in the Fifth Road Project.



- 15 -
3.30     In 1983, the Bank agreed to finance a more detailed investigation
of water availability for two of the three roads in the Tuli Block area for
which detailed engineering was complete. This arose because of the
difficulties ongoing road projects were having in obtaining water, with the
likelihood of claims resulting. Under the Department of Water Affairs
a consulting firm registered in Botswana successfully carried out the
drilling work, which was completed in early 1984.
3.31     Gaborone-Tlokweng Border Gate Road.  In 1978, the Government
requested that detailed engineering and construction of the
Gaborone-Tlokweng Border Gate road be financed under the project with cost
savings from the Mahalapye-Serule road. Tlokweng Border Gate is situated
on the border with RSA, 17 km east of Gaborone, and is a popular crossing
point. After MWC provided the economic justification for improving the road
from a temporary sand seal to a double bituminous surface dressing standard
on a new basecourse, the Bank agreed to inclusion of the road in the
project. Detailed engineering, carried out by British consultants, began
in mid-1979.
3.32     The consultants soon found that the existing base was much
stronger than originally thought; consequently, RD changed the TOR so that
Phase 1 would look at various pavement design alternatives and the optimum
time of construction. On the instructions of RD, the consultants proceeded
with Phase 2, which included further deflection tests on the road and
detailed engineering for the whole road on the basis that the road would
need a new base course some time in the future.   Only when a supervision
mission visited Botswana in June 1980 did the Bank realize that work had
proceeded so far; evidently, RD had not received a Bank telex sent in
January objecting to the changes in the TOR, including the deflection tests
and plans for Phase 2. As detailed engineering was so far advanced the
Bank agreed to its completion. The Bank and the Government agreed
that only resealing, fencing and some drainage works would need to be
financed under the project, since this would be sufficient to delay
reconstruction of the road for at least another three years. Separate
contracts for resealing and fencing were awarded in March 1981 after local
competitive bidding; the work was satisfactorily completed by late 1981.
3.33     In mid-1981, Government submittted proposals for more works on the
road, including extensive drainage works. The Bank objected to these
proposals, arguing that such works could be carried out when the road was
reconstructed. An acrimonious exchange of telexes and letters followed,
for RD had been under the impression that the drainage works had been
agreed to in principle by the Bank in June of 1980 and in February 1981
when a Bank supervision mission had not raised any objections to the
works. Finally, the Government's proposals were accepted by the Bank in
December 1981, after RD had demonstrated to a supervision mission
consisting of different Bank staff the necessity for drainage works if
existing road works were to be protected. The work was locally tendered
and started in January 1983 and satisfactorily completed in November 1983,
four months later than scheduled. Supervision for all the contracts was
satisfactorily carried out by the same consultants who carried out the
detailed engineering.
3.34     Confusion also arose over whether the Bank had approved detailed
engineering and construction of the Tlokweng village road, requested by
Government in early 1981 during a Bank supervision mission. After a



- 16 -
lengthy exchange of telexes, the Bank eventually agreed to consider
Government's request after submission of an economic evaluation for
upgrading the three km road to paved standard. MWC provided the economic
justification in November 1982, when the Bank agreed to the road's
inclusion in the project. Detailed engineering was completed in mid-1983
by the consultants who worked on the Tlokweng Border Gate road. The
consultants were retained for supervision of construction, which was
awarded to a local contractor in accordance with local procurement
procedures. International competitive bidding had been stipulated in the
Loan Agreement but the Bank agreed, on an exceptional basis, to local
procurement procedures because of the relatively small contract amount.
Work was satisfactorily completed by February 1984.
3.35     lechnical Assistance  for RD   In mid-1978, Governrient requested
that the project include the financing of consultants to fill short term
vacancies within RD. The staffing situation had deteriorated during 1978,
with large time lags between the departure of expatriate staff and arrival
of replacements. The Bank was not enthusiastic about financing consultants
for staff positions, but realised the difficulties of filling vacancies
with expatriate staff. It therefore agreed that, while Government was
searching for long-term expatriate staff, temporary use could be made of
consultants for a maximum term nf nine months for any one position.
Consultant services arnounting to about US$0.34 million have been financed
under the project; this has included the provision of temporary staff for
the Training Center, the secondary road improvement program, supervision of
regravelling works, design and supervision of construction of road depots
and the Central Materials Laboratory (financed under the Fifth Road
Project), a gravel survey for periodic maintenance requirements for the
Nata-Maun road, and training of local staff in maintenance procedures for
weiqhbridges. On the whole, costs have tended to be low because of the
selection of consultants with local offices.
Project Revisions
3.36     The project was first revised in November 1978 (Annex 2),
following the lower than estimated cost for construction and supervision of
the Mahalapye-Serule road (paras. 3.45-46) and the participation of NORAD
and OPEC in the financing of the project (para. 2.12). Total project costs
were estimated at IJS$21.0 versus US$26.0 million estimated at appraisal.
This revised estimate included additional project components - construction
of the Gaborone-llokweng Border Gate road, feasibili'y study arid detailed
engineering of the Tuli Block roads and technical assistance for RD.
Additional funds were also provided for implementation of the Road
Maintenance Program (US$2.1 million compared to the appraisal estimate of
US$1.0 million) and more equipment for RD's Training Center (US$0.7 million
compared to the appraisal estimate of US$0.3 million). Dishr!sement
percentages were also changed to reflect the Norwegian fir.ancing of local
expenditures.
3.37     Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement was changed again in September
1981 so that funds could be reallocated from the unallocated category to
cover contingencies for the civil works cost of the Mahalapye-Serule road.
In March 1983, the project was revised again (Annex 3) to reallocate loan
funds of US$2.1 million that had not been used for the Road Maintenance
Program because of USAID fir,;t.,. "ig (para. 3.23) arid US$0.7 million that had
not been used for traininri  -1,jil,ment and vehicles because of financinq from
bilateral sources (para. 3.LjI Additional project components were



- 17 -
included in the amendment to the Loan Agreement, including detailed
engineering, supervision and construction of the Tlokweng village road,
additional costs of detailed engineering and supervision of construction of
the Gaborone-Tlokweng Border Gate road, detailed engineering for three
feeder roads, expansion of RD's Training Center and investigation of water
availability in the Tuli Block area. Additional funds also had to be
reallocated from the unallocated category to cover further cost increases
on the Mahalapye-Serule road (para. 3.17) and additional works on the
Gaborone-Tlokweng Border Gate road Cpara. 3.33).
Project financing
3.38     The Bank and the Government of Norway each financed US$8.8
million of project expenditures, instead of the US$10.0 million originally
estimated, since the cancellation of US$2.4 million was shared between the
two agencies. OPEC financed US$1.0 million for consultants to supervise
construction of the Mahalapye-Serule road and part of the cost of detailed
engineering and supervision of construction of the Gaborone-Tlokweng Border
Gate road. There was some confusion over claims submitted to OPEC instead
of the Bank in 1980, but this was resolved by submission of OPEC claims to
the Bank for the amount overpaid.
C. Project Costs
Third Road Project
3.39     Total project costs (see Table 3.2) were US$6.6 million
(P5.6 million), B5Z of the appraisal estimate of US$7.78 million, including
taxes and duties. The total cost includes additional project components
(paras. 3.13-15) and excludes those components financed from other sources
(paras. 3.09 and 3.12). Total costs for the project as originally defined,
includirig equipment financed by NORAD for the pilot DRMP, totalled
US$6.16 million, 79X of the appraisal estimate.
3.40     The major decrease in project costs was for construction of the
Gaborone-Molepolole road; including the additional cost of drainage works
in Molepolole, the final cost totalled P3.33 million (US$3.98 million),
about one third less than projected at appraisal. The major reason for
this large difference in costs was that tender prices were much lower than
estimated - the lowest bid was P2.93 million compared to the Bank's
estimate of P3.92 million. The very high Bank estimate was the result of
the devaluation of the rand from US$1.47 at the time of appraisal to
US$1.15 by the time the appraisal report was finalised in November 1975.
Construction costs estimated in US$ at appraisal were retained while the
cost in rands was changed to reflect the devaluation. However, the
contract was let in pula to an RSA contractor at very close to 'he cost
estimated in rands at appraisal, illustrating the problem of projecting the
currency in which the contract will be let. Given that the original
estimate was made in pula, it is not clear why the Bank assumed that the
contract would be in US$, for it was very difficult for contractors from
other countries to compete with S. Africans for contracts of that size.
Presumably, the appraisal team wanted to make sure there would be no cost
overruns. The appraisal estimates of price contingencies were also
over-estimated, for prices of labor and specified materials (mainly
petroleum and petroleum-based products) only increased by an average of
4.5Z from 1977 to 1979, while the appraisal allowed for a 19Z increase frcm
1975 to 1977.



- 18 -
3.41      The other item with lower costs than estimated at appraisal was
detailed engineering of the Mahalapye-Serule road: the actual cost of
US$0.38 million was 750 of the appraisal estimate. However, the estimated
cost in rands given in the Issues Paper was very close to actual costs, but
again it was assumed that the contract would be let in US$, so that the
appraisal estimate in rands was increased to reflect the devaluation of the
rand.
3.42      Costs for supervision of construction were 82'a higher than
estimated at appraisal (in US$). This was partly because the contract
period was nearly 60% longer than originally estimated due to problems with
the contractor (para. 3.03). In addition, RD selected consultants who had
included a substantial amount of expatriate services in their proposal;
the Bank expressed strong reservations about the cost of the proposal and
subsequently some expatriate staff were replaced by Botswana personnel.
3.43      The total cost of technical assistance for the pilot DRMP
(US$0.62 million) was 50'0% higher than the notional amount of US$0.42
million originally included in the project. The increased cost was the
result of higher than estimated man-months of expatriate staff. Loan funds
originally allocated for equipment for the program were used to finance
technical assistance, since NORAD financed all of the equipment. Other
project costs were higher than estimated because of changes in project
components. Additional weighbridges and traffic counters (para. 3.14)
increased costs by US$0.15 million and additional soils and materials
laboratory equipment (para. 3.13) increased costs by US$0.25 million. The
cost of the additional project component, the feasibility study and
detailed engineering of the Dumela-Ramokgwebana road (para. 3.15) amounted
to US$0.38 million.  No funds allocated for scholarships were used because
of bilateral financing (para. 3.12).
Fourth Road Project
3.44     Total project costs amounted to U5$21.15 million (P18.96 million),
75  of t.he original appraisal estimate of US$28.03 million (see Table 3.2),
including taxes and duties. The total cost includes additional components
(paras. 3.32-35) and excludes components financed from other sources
I(pras. 3.23 and 3.27).  Total costs for the project as originally defined,
including components financed by other donors, totalled US$24.06 million or
86% of the appraisal estimate.
3.45     The major decrease in costs was for construction of the
Mahalapye-Serule road: final costs were US$14.22 million, 62% of the
appraisal estimate of llS$22.99 million. The lowest bid for the contract
was US$11.10 million, 69%o of the appraisal estimate. This bid was well
below the next lowest bid of US$13.96 million (86% of the appraisal
estimate) because the contractor had just completed work on the
Nata-Kazungula road and therefore had less mobilization and other costs. At
the time of appraisal in September 1976, the cost of construction had been
estimated at US$14.78 million, closer to average bid prices. However, this
estimate was increased to US$16.17 million by Grey Cover in March 1977 to
reflect the price of bids opened in late 1976 for the Serule-Francistown
road. There appears to be no apparent explanation for why bids opened in



- 19 -
late 1976 for this road were higher than the average price of bids opened
in July 1977 for the Mahalapye-Serule road. Final costs of construction
were 28X higher than the bid price, compared to 42% physical and price
contingencies allowed for at appraisal: this includes claims amounting to
US$1.2 million which were settled through negotiation in 19B2.
3.46     Supervision costs were also lower than projected, amounting to
US$0.99 million, or 78% of appraisal estimates. Other consultant services
originally included in the project were for the feeder road study - costs
for this study (US$0.24 million) were 77Z lower than the notional amount
included at appraisal. Additional funds of US$0.6 million were provided
for detailed engineering of three feeder roads (para. 3.22). Technical
assistance costs for the extension of DRMP to other districts totalled
US$1.37 million, 86% of appraisal estimates. The original cost estimate
was a notional amount, since the pilot DRMP had not even begun at the time
of appraisal (para. 3.10), and included equipment costs which were
eventually financed by NORAD. Construction of the training school
extension was the only component whose cost was over the appraisal
estimate. This was because the extension was far larger than originally
envisaged (paras. 3.26-27). Total costs for the training component
amounted to US$0.71 million, compared to US$0.43 million estimated at
appraisal. However, this was for expansion of the training school and did
not include the purchase of US$0.33 million of training equipment
originally included in the project, as this was financed bilaterally.
Financing of the remaining project component - implementation of the road
maintenance study - was taken over by USAID (para. 3.23).   USAID's final
costs of US$5.84 million were nearly four times higher than the appraisal
estimate, which was a notional sum primarily included for maintenance
equipment. The cost of equipment financed by USAID amounted to US$4.87
million, three times the appraisal estimate.
3.47     Costs for additional project components totalled US$3.62 million,
comprising:

Disbursements
3.48     Only 50% of loan funds had been disbursed by June 1979, when the
Third Road Project was scheduled for completion. This was because of (i)
delays in calling for bids for construction of the project's major
component, the Gaborone-Molepolole road (para. 3.02) and the Road
Maintenance Study (para. 3.06), and (ii) lower than estimated costs of the
Gaborone-Molepolole road (para. 3.40), and (iii) time taken to implement
additional project components. The Closing Date was extended four times
from December 31, 1978 to August 31, 1982 to allow full disbursement of
funds. The loan was fully disbursed by March 1983, two and three quarter
years later than scheduled. US$0.7 million of loan funds were cancelled in
late 1982.
3.49     Only 67% of the loan for the Fourth Road Project was disbursed by
June 1981, the scheduled date of completion. This was the result of (i)
delays in starting the extension of DRMP (para. 3.24) and the feeder road
study (para. 3.19), (ii) time taken to settle claims for the
Mahalapye-Serule road contract (para. 3.17), and (iii) lower than estimated
cost for the project's main component, construction of the Mahalapye-Serule
road (para. 3.45). The Closing Date was extended once from December 31,
1981 to December 31, 1983 to allow full disbursement of loan funds.
Disbursements of the Bank loan and the Norwegian grant were completed in
November 1984, 41 months later than scheduled. US$0.9 million of loan
funds were cancelled in November 1983, as a consequence of the March 1983
amendment of the loan agreement, and an unused loan balance of US$1.5
million was cancelled in late 1984.
Procurement
3.50     There were no procurement problems of any significance in either
of the two projects.
Reporting
3.51      Progress reporting requirements were agreed at negotiations of
both projects. In July 1979, the Bank realised that no progress reports
had been received for the two projects, with the exception of the
construction components. (Similar reporting problems had been encountered
under the Second Road Project). RD began submitting quarterly progress
reports from 1979, but they tended to be very brief and contained few
details of project progress. In particular, there was no revised project
implementation schedule, no review of covenants, or details on key
personnel changes in RD, as required under the Third Project. Project
monitoring indices required under the Fourth Project were never submitted,
perhaps understandably so, since they were extremely detailed.
Significantly, the Fifth Road Project returned to the same progress
reporting requirements as used under the Third Project and completely
dropped the project monitoring indices of the Fourth.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Covenants and Borrower's Performance
4.01     Details of the covenants of Loan Agreements 1174 ard 1408-BI and
Government's compliance with them are included in Annex 4. Both loan
agreements contained covenants requiring improved procedures for collection
of traffic data (Section 4.04 of Loan 1174-BT and Section 4.05 of Loan
1408-BT) because the traffic data collection system in Botswana had not
been reliable. The Government submitted a program to the Bank in December
1975 to improve traffic data collection by transferrinq responsibility from
RD to the Statistical Unit in MWC; technical assistance was also provided
by the Central Statistics Office. Thereafter, traffic statistics were
compiled annually by the Unit and the first transport statistics bulletin
was issued in 1979.
4.02     Both loan agreements also included covenants regarding the
improved performance of CrO (Section 4.05 of Loan 1174-BT and Section 4.06
of Loan 1408-BT). A reorganization and improvement program was submitted
to the Bank in December 1975 and implemented with bilateral assistance
(para. 4.06). The condition of disbursement for maintenance equipment
requiring a 60% equipment availability rate (Schedule 1, para. 4 (b)) never
became an issue because maintenance equipment was financed by USAID and not
the Bank (para 3.23). Information is only available on the availability of
equipment including that purchased with USAID financing (para 4.06).
Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate if the covenant would have been met
before new equipment was purchased.
Consultants Performance
4.03     Under the two projects, consultants were employed for supervision
of construction, feasibility studies, detailed engineering, the Road
Maintenance Study and short term assistance for RD. Performance was, on
the whole, satisfactory. However, the Road Maintenance Study financed
under the Third Road Project had a few weaknesses: some parts were
incomplete and the pilot project for DRMP had to be redesigned. The latter
was rejected because the program did not show a real knowledge of
labor-intensive techniques (para. 3.08) and another pilot project was drawn
up by an ILO expert (para. 3.08). The consultant's lack of experience in
labor-intensive methods had been of some concern to RD when awarding the
contract, but at that time the Rank did not accept RD's request tn exclude
the pilot DRMP from the study and employ individual consultants w Ii more
experience of labor-intensive methods.
Institutional Performance
4.04     One of the major problems during the first few years of the two
projects was the shortage of staff within RD; this had also been a
recurrinq problem throughout the Second Road Project (PPAR, Credit 303-B1,
March 31, 1977 - para 20). In mid-1976, about 30% of the professional
posts were vacant, although some of the positions were filled with
expatriate staff by the time of appraisal. However, by mid-1977, 40Z of
professional and nearly 50Z of semi-professional positions were vacant.
The major staffing problem has been the lack of qualified local staff to
fill engineering and technical posts within RD, for eveni by 1984 only 8 of



- 22 -
a total of 21 professional positions in RD were held by Batswana highway
engineers (one of whom is the Chief Roads Engineer); of 60 technician
positions, 16 were filled by expatriates in 1984. Training of road
technicians and supervisors and equipment operators has been improved under
the Fourth and Fifth Road Projects. Training facilities have been improved
(paras. 3.26-27), additional staff have been recruited and the curriculum
expanded and improved to make the training more practically oriented.
4.05      The shortage of local staff has meant a heavy reliance on
expatriates, financed by several different bilateral agencies. The major
problem in 1976 and 1977 was replacing those staff whose contracts had
expired with new engineers, a problem exacerbated by the slow Government
recruitment process. The Government's Directorate of Personnel, which was
responsible for recruiting expatriate staff for RD, was very slow in
processing requests and approving candidates, despite pressure from the
Bank to speed up recruitment. The Bank eventually agreed to RD's request
to finance consultants to temporarily fill vacant positions (para. 3.35).
By 1979, the staffing situation had improved and has since remained
relatively stable, although there is still the problem of lack of
continuity of staff, since many staff only have two year contracts.
Nevertheless, RD has been able to handle a large construction program
during the course of the two projects, as well as a program to improve road
maintenance; it has also provided assistance to MLGL to help design and
implement DRMP.
4.06     The performance of CTO has improved considerably since appraisal
of the two projects when the Bank was very concerned about the low
availability rate of maintenance vehicles and equipment. A program to
improve the operations of CTO was drawn up, with CIDA assistance, in 1975
and started in 1976. Six staff members, including the General Manager,
were financed by CIDA, two mechanical instructors were financed by USAID,
and one training and organization specialist was financed by ODM.
Performance gradually improved and equipment availability rates increased
to well over 60% by 1983, although it is difficult to separate out the
effect of the program from the effect of newly-procured maintenance
equipment (para 3.23). Overall, road maintenance has improved as the
result of the USAID-financed maintenance program and the assistance
provided by CIDA to CTO. Major achievements have been improved cooperation
between RD and CTO and improved maintenance of equipment in the field
because of the secondment of CTO mechanics to RD road maintenance depots.

V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
General
5.01     The basis for the economic analysis of roads included in the Third
and Fourth Road Projects was an assessment of expected benefits and costs
with and without the road improvements. Investment costs have been taken
net of taxes and duties and include supervision of construction. The
quantifiable benefits are savings in vehicle operating and road maintenance
costs. Actual traffic volumes have been taken up to 1983-84, from when
projections based on past traffic growth rates have been used. VOC
for various years are shown in Table 5.1; these estimates are taken mainly
from appraisal reports (Third, Fourth and Fifth Road Projects), which have
taken the estimates from different consultant feasibility studies. This
means that the costs are not all consistent, since each consultant has
calculated voc in different ways.
Third Road Project
5.02     Gaborone-Molepolole road.  The area of influence of the
Gaborone-Molepolole road mainly consists of small farms which concentrate
on cattle raising and crop cultivation. Gaborone, the capital of the
country, and Molepolole are primarily marketing centers, although both have
some limited industrial development. Traffic has increased at a lower than
projected rate: in 1984 traffic was 324 vpd on most of the road (44 km)
compared to 512 vpd projected at appraisal. The small length of road close
to Gaborone (8 km) has a higher level of traffic of 522 vpd: this compares
to 844 vpd projected at appraisal for the first 5 km from Gaborone.
Traffic levels fell by 20-330 from 1977 to 1979 on the two sections of
road, but have since increased by 11% p.a. The economic reevaluation has
projected an annual increase of 10% p.a. until 1990, declining to 7% p.a.
thereafter.
5.03     All costs and benefits are in 1976 prices, net of taxes and
duties. Total economic construction costs amounted to P4.0 million in 1979
prices (including supervision of construction), compared to P4.31 million
estimated at appraisal in 1975 prices. Estimated voc with and without the
road improvement for different years are given in Table 5. The voc are
obviously not compatible from one year to another, since voc savings
estimated at pre-1979 appraisals were much higher than estimated at later
appraisals. Therefore, estimates of voc savings for given traffic levels
are lower in the economic reevaluation than at appraisal of the two
projects. The reestimated rate of return for the 8 km Gaborone-
Metsimothabe section is 13% compared to 17% estimat d at appraisal for the
5 km Gaborone-Mogoditshane section, and 12% for the Metsimothabe-
Molepolole section compared to the appraisal estimate of 17%. Overall, the
road yieJded a rate of return of 12% compared to the appraisal estimate of
17%. The lower construction costs were offset by lower benefits resulting
from the decrease in traffic during the first few years of the project and
the lower estimate of voc savings6/km in the economic reevaluation than at
appraisal.



- 24 -
5.04     Pilot DRMP. No rate of return was estimated at appraisal for the
pilot DRMP because there was little definition of the program. The final
report on the pilot study made a rough estimate of the economic costs and
benefits of the program, using the costs given in para. 3.11. Voc savings
were estimated at US$260 per km per annum (although no additional benefits
were estimated for roads improved to a higher standard), assuming average
traffic levels of ten vpd. Assuming a ten year life and a 5°% annual
increase in traffic, the rate of return for the roads receiving spot
improvements is about 5% (including direct and indirect costs). Benefits
from increased agricultural production or year-round access have not been
estimated.
Fourth Road Project
5.05      The Mahalapye-Serule road was the last section of the North-South
road to be upgraded to all-weather standard. This road links the
population centers of the eastern corridor, where 80% of the country's
population resides, and links the capital, Gaborone, with Francistown and
the mining complex around Selebe Phikwe in the north-east of the country.
Traffic on the Mahalapye-Serule section of the North-South road has
increased by an average of 16% per annum since 1976. Average traffic
levels on the 65-km section from Mahalapye to the junction with the Martins
Drift road were 550 vpd in 1984 compared to the 377 vpd projected at
appraisal; on the following 9-km section from Martins Drift road junction
to Serowe Fork the average traffic levels were 459 vpd in 1983 compared to
377 vpd projected; and on the Serowe Fork-Serule section (75 km), 399 vpd
compared to the 249 vpd projected. Traffic growth has slowed down since
1980 from Martins Drift road junction to Serule, averaging 10% per annum.
The economic reevaluation has assumed 10% annual increase in traffic for
the Mahalapye-Martins Drift road junction up to 1990, and thereafter a 7%
increase. Traffic on the other two sections is projected to increase by 7%
p.a. from 1984 until the end of the project.
5.06     All costs and benefits are in 1979 prices.  Total economic costs
of construction were P11.5 million in 1979 prices (including supervision),
compared to the appraisal estimate of P15.10 million in 1976 prices.
Vehicle operating cost savings are based on the difference in operating
costs for an earth and a paved road. The appraisal calculated separate
rates of return for three sections of the road, since they had different
traffic levels and rates of growth. The reestimated rates of return for
these three sections are given below:

Gaborone-llokweng Border Gate Road and llokweng Village Road
5.07     Construction of the Gaborone-Tlokweng Border Gate road (17 km) was
added to the project in 1979 after an economic justification for the road
had been prepared by the Planning Unit of MWC.  The original justification
for the road was based on upgrading the existing road having a bituminous
sand-seal to a double bituminous surface treatment standard, assuming that
vehicle operating conditions on the road would revert to the equivalent of
a gravel road after three years. Based on a traffic level of 240 vpd and a
7% estimated annual traffic growth, the rate of return was estimated at
nearly 20X. Subsequently, the road was found to be stronger than estimated
(para. 3.32), so that only resealing and fencing were carried out at
first. However, after the double bituminous surface treatment was
completed, extensive drainage works costing P0.613 million were carried out
on the road. to protect the base and new surface treatment. Without such
works it is assumed that the road would have qradually deteriorated to an
unpaved road over the next three years. Based on such an assumption the
rate of return is 19%.
5.08      The Tlokweng Village road (3.2 km) was an additional component
included in the project in 19B2. The road was upgraded from earth to paved
standard and had a traffic level of 523 vpd in 1984. An economic
evaluation of the road carried out by MWC's Planning Unit estimated a 26%
rate of return. Final construction costs were lower than estimated,
resulting in a reevaluated rate of return of 40'X.



- 26 -
VI. ROLE OF THE BANK
6.01     There were substantial cost savings for both projects, primarily
because of lower than estimated bids for the major road construction
components of each project. The extent to which the over-estimation of
costs at appraisal could have been avoided is difficult to judge. In the
case of the Third Road Project, the Bank clearly made an incorrect
assumption that the contract for the Gaborone-Molepolole road would not be
let in rands. 'This is somewhat inconsistent with references in the files
before and after appraisal that the contract would probably go to a South
African company because of the relatively small size of the contract.
However, the most likely explanation for assuming the contract would not be
let in rands is that Bank staff were more concerned about underestimating
costs. Additional funds would have been far more difficult to obtain after
Board approval compared with the comparative ease with which excess funds
could be used or even cancelled. The Fourth Road Project construction cost
estimates were based on unit prices of similar works for which bids had
already been received, although the consultants who prepared the bid
documents did estimate costs at closer to the average bid prices. (The
lowest bid was in fact far lower because of the comparative advantage of
the contractor who had just completed another contract in Botswana). Both
projects clearly demonstrate the advantage of presenting road projects to
the Board only after the opening of bids. There is also the additional
advantage of saving start-up delays for road construction.
6.02     Savings on costs of construction and from components subsequently
financed by other donors were used to finance 100% of foreign costs and
additional components for the two projects. RD appears to have regarded
surplus funds from the Fourth Road Project as a line of credit for an
ad-hoc collection of small projects. The Bank approved requests as they
were submitted by RD throughout project implementation, although there was
obviously concern about considering each request without reviewing other
sector priorities. The continual addition of components was largely due to
cost savings from the Mahalapye-Serule road in the first part of the
project arid additional funds made available later in the project because of
the financing of the road maintenance component by USAID (para. 3.23). In
at least one case, there appears to have been insufficient vettirng of RD's
requests - approval was given for the detailed engineering of 219 km of
roads in the Tuli Block, 196 km of which later proved not to be
economically viable (para. 3.29). Towards the end of the projects, the
Bank introduced restrictions on the use of cost savings, resulting in the
cancellation of funds for both projects.
6.03     During project implementation there were occasional
misunderstandings between the Bank and RD as to what had been agreed during
missions and in telexes. These lapses in communication could largely have
been avoided by having Aide-Memoires drafted by Bank supervision missions
and approved by RD before missior. departure. Also, there was a high
turnover of Bank staff supervising the projects; a higher level of staff
continuity would, no doubt, have prevented some of the misunderstandings.



- 27 -
6.04      Three of the components originally included in the two projects
had to be substantially revised from what was envisaged at appraisal. The
training component of the Fourth Road Project was poorly prepared largely
because no training expert was involved in the preparation or appraisal of
the project. Subsequently, the needs and curriculum of the Training School
were substantially revised as a result of a Bank training expert's visit to
Botswana during project implementation (para. 3.26). The second component
to be revised was the Feeder Road Study financed under the Fourth Road
Project. This component was substituted for preparation of the Fifth Road
Project shortly after appraisal because of doubts over whether there would
be a Fifth Road Project. In retrospect, the inclusion of a feeder road
component appears to have been premature: the Rural Development Program to
which it was meant to be linked was at a very early stage of identification
and was not developed any further during implementation of the project.
The pilot DRMP was the third component to be substantially revised, partly
due to the Bank's lack of experience with labor-intensive methods. IL0
recommended a considerably larger program than originally thought necessary
to successfully develop labor-intensive methods in Botswana (para. 3.09).
Although a successful district road maintenance program has been developed,
the economic viability of the program still remains questionable (pars.
5.04), especially if the high cost of the technical assistance (US$1.88
million) is included (paras. 3.12 and 3.46).
6.05      Both projects involved other financing agencies, either as a
direct part of the projects or in parallel with them. Coordination between
the Bank and those other agencies appears to have been good and effective.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      There were lengthy delays for both projects because of RD's
slowness in calling for bids and contractors' delays. During the first two
years of the projects, RD suffered from staff shortages which were partly
alleviated by hiring consultants temporarily to fill vacant positions. The
staffing situation had somewhat improved by the end of the projects,
although lack of local personnel is still a problem because of the lack of
suitably qualified engineers from Botswana. Subsequently, RD and programs
like DRMP will continue to be dependent on expatriate engineers and other
professionals over the next several years.
7.02      Costs for both projects were substantially lower than estimated
at appraisal mainly because of lower than estimated construction costs for
the two projects' major components. Cost savings have also been realised
under the Fifth Road Project, indicating successive appraisal teams'
tendency to overestimate costs. If the projects had been approved after
bids were opened for the major construction components, this overestimation
of costs could have been avoided. Seven components not originally included
at appraisal were added to the two projects; in addition, two components -
the Road Maintenance Study and DRMP - were substantially larger than
anticipated at appraisal, as were other smaller components. The projects
could have benefitted from more work on the non-construction components at
the project preparation stage, for preparatory work was only carried out on
the major construction components. Additional work carried out under the
two projects included a miscellaneous collection of small components that
had little connection with each other.
7.03      Despite the above reservations, the projects were successful. The
construction of the Mahalapye-Serule road completed the paving of the
North-South road up to Nata. Road maintenance and training of MWC
personnel also improved and labor-intensive methods of construction and
maintenance have been developed and local staff trained in the use of those
methods under the two projects.

this date, which has already been extended from December 31, 1981.
You will note in the attached letter that we are proposing
that US$900,000 of the project savings renaining after reallocation of
the surplus ffunds be cancalled forthwith. Of this. US$450,000 would
be from the Bank loan and US$450.000 from the participation in the loan
of the Kingdom of Norway. Accordingly. vs are informing the Norwegian -
Government of the amendment to the loan agreement and the cancellation.
We are also sending a copy of our letter to the OPEC Fund. which iz a
cofirancier of the project.
Best wishe3.
Yours sincerely.
