The projects achieved their\n            objectives, their impact on institutional development was\n            significant, sustainability is likely, and the performance\n            of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from these projects. First, RD and\n            programs like DRMP will continue to be dependent on\n            expatriate engineers and other professionals over the next\n            several years due to a lack of local personnel. Second, if\n            the projects had been approved after bids were opened for\n            the major construction components, overestimation of costs\n            could have been avoided. Finally, the projects could have\n            benefited from more work on the non-construction components\n            at the project preparation stage; preparatory work was only\n            carried out on the major construction components."}, "docdt": "1985-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
