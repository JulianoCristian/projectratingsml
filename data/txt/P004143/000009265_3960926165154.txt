TAEGU URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
Loan and Prolect Summary
Borrower:      Taegu City Government (TCG)
Guarantor:     Republic of Korea
Awount.        US$30 million equivalent
Terms:         Repayable in 15 years, including 3 years graco, at the
standard varz.able Interest rate.
Proiect
Description:   The project supports TCG's efforts to improve the
transportation. system within Taegu City through the
construction of a major urban expressway and associated
road investments, introduction and application of Traffic
System Management (TSM) techniques, and strengthening of
TCG's transportation planning capacity. The project
includes: (a) land acquisition and construction of the
Sh'tnchon Expressway, connecting roads, and associated
bridge widenings; (b) civil works for intersection
improvements, pedestrian facilities, and other TSM and
safety improvements, and the provision of traffic signals
and other equipment; and (c) advisory services for
transportation planning and construction supervision.
The main benefits of the project would be reduced
congestion and improved traffic flows within Taegu City,
especir,lly in and around the Central Business District.
Risks:         Since the project would require the relocation of over
2,000 families, there is a risk that difficulties in land
acquisition could result in delays in road construction.
However, this risk is not considered great since
experience indicates that assessment and payment of
compensation to affected persons is done in a fair and
timely manner in Korea.

KOREA
TLAMU URBAN TRANSPORT PROJWCT
1. S-
Urbanization Trends
1.01      During the last 25 years, Korea experienced rapid economic
growth and transformation from a rural agricultural society to an urban
industrial economy. Jetween 1960 and 1986, the Korean economy grew at
an average of 8% per annum in real terms and per capita 0¢N increased
from US$180 (in current prices) to over US$2,200. The population of
Korea grew from 25 million in 1960 to 42 million in 1986, at an average
rate of 2s per annum. At the same time, a major utbanization of the
population occurred. The urban population grew by over S% annually
between 1960 and 1985, increasing from 7 million (28a of total
population) to 26 million (65%).
1.02      Korea's urbanization has been characterized by a concen-
tration of population in the northwest and southeast parts of the
country, and in a number of large cities. Seoul, Inchon and the
surrounding Kyonggi Province in the northwest (see Map IBRD 20245)
accounted for about 50% of manufacturing employment, 50% of urban
population and 40% of total population in 1985, while Pusan, Taegu and
Kyong Bug and Kyong Nam Provinces in the southeast accounted foir another
40% of manufacturing employment, 30% of urban population and 30% of
total population. The five largest cities, Seoul, Pusan, Taegu, Inchon,
and Kwangju, accounted for 66% of the urban population in 1985. During
the 1960s and early 1970s, the urbanization process in Korea was
characterized by a concentration of growth in the capital, Seoul. While
Seoul continues to dominate the urban sector, its growth is slowing
down. Recently, growth has grodually been shifting to regional cities,
such as Taegu and Kwangju.
1.03      Korean cities are generally well managed and have been suc-
cessful in coping with this rapid urbanizatioiL In many countries, one
of the major problems arising from rapid urbanization has been a
deterioration in urban services, major lnfrastructure bottlenecks and
the rapid deterioration of the quality of urban life. Korean cities,
however, have been able to maintain investment in infrastructure and
municipal services at high levels. In 1986, 86% of the urban population
had access to piped water, 98* were served with municipal garbage
collection, 52% of urban areas were covered by sewerage systems and 69%
of the municipal roads were paved.



-2-
Taegu City
1.04      Taegu City, with a population of 2.1 million in 1986, is the
third largest city in Korea and a major regional center in Kyong Buk
Province in the southeast. Founded in the eighth century A.D., the city
is an important manufacturing, administrative and strvice center
strategically located on the Seoul-Pusan axis where much of Korea's
modern industrial development has taken place. Taegu accounts for about
5% of the nation's manufacturing produrtion and employment. Within the
city, service industries account for over 60% of employment.
1.C5      The city is expected to continue to grow and pcrform an
imyportant regional role. Between 1982 and 1986, the population of Taegu
grew at 2.4% per annum, overall employment grew by 5.1% per annum, and
employment in service industries by 5.9% per annum. In the southeast,
Kyong Bug and Kyong Nam Provinces are likely to continue to be major
manufacturing growth centers, with more development taking place outside
of the major cities like Pusan and possibly Taegu. However, Pusan and
Taegu would continue to function as the major commercial and service
centers ia the area.
Urban Transportation
1.06       The urban transportation system in Korea has reached a
critical phase in its development. The number of vehicles in the
country has doubled in the last five years, increasing from just under
600,000 in 1981 to over one million in 1985. Significant increases
occurred in car ownership which averaged more than 15% per annum since
1981. Higher incomes have made cars more affordable while the increase
in domestic production of automobiles has kept prices fairly stable.
This growth in automobiles has resulted in higher levels of congestion
and a significant increase in the number of accidents.
1.07      Car ownership is expected to continue to grow at the current
high rate. Despite recent increases, the number of cars per thousand
population in Korea was still only 14 in 1985. Car ownership was higher
in Seoul where there were 31 cars per thousand population. These numbers
are low compared to ownership levels in other countries at a similar
level of development. For example, there are an estimated 99 cars per
thousand population in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia where per
capita incomes are just over US$2,000 as in Korea. Furthermore, car
ownership per thousand population is higher in Bangkok (88), Jakarta
(44) and Manila (33), all in countries where the level of economic
development is not as advanced as that in Korea. The growth of cities
and the continued rise in incomes are both expected to increase demand
for automobiles both for commercial and private use. At the same time,
automobile manufacturing is one of the major growth industries in Korea.
Car ownership should therefore continue to grow at the current rate,
reaching a level of about 29 cars per thousand population by 1991.



- 3 -
1.08       In the past, Korean cities were generally able to avoid
traffic congestion by constructing new roads and expanding existing
routes. However, the cities are expected to find it more difficult to
continue this approach given the rapid increase in vehicles and the high
cost of land, especially in the central business districts (CBD).
1.09       Increasing emphasis would therefore need to be given to maxi-
mizing utilization of the existing road networks in the urban areas.
One method being used in the developed countries but not yet carried out
on a large scale in Korea is Transportation Systems Management (TSM).
TSM attempts to increase road capacity and improve traffic flows and
road safety through low-cost traffic improvement measures such as
redesigning intersections, coordinating traffic aignals, introducing bus
priority lanes, and restricting parking. Increased parking charges and
other financial disincentives can also be used to restrict non-essential
traffic, especially in the CBD. TSM emphasizes improving traffic flows
over the existing network and is less expensive than constructing or
expanding roads. Although somewhat skeptical at the beginning, the
Government is now actively promoting the introduction of TSM in the
major cities.
1.10     Although Korean cities are well experienced in design and
construction, particularly with regard to roads, they are still weak in
transportation planning, and designing and coordinating investments to
improve the overall efficiency of existing transport networks. The main
cause of this weakness is institutional fragmentation within the city
government organization. This fragmentation has also made policy
formulation difficult since no single agency has the overall
responsibility for transportation planning. Some of the larger cities
have recognized this problem and are undertaking reorganization to
consolidate and strengthen their transportation planning capabilities.
Transportation in Taegu City
1.11      Taegu City is developing east-west alorg the Kumho River
(see Map IBRD 20245).  Since growth of the city to the north and south
is constrained by mountains, north-south links within the city are not
well developed and the major traffic arteries run east-west. The Kyong-
Bu Expressway, the main road link between Seoul in the northwest and
Pusan in the southeast, runs east-west to the north of Taegu City and is
connected to the city by two interchanges located at the city's east and
west ends. Currently, traffic from the CBD as well as the south has to
travel through the city to gain access to the Kyong-Bu Expressway.



- 4 -
1.12     The transportation system in Taegu is relatively good compared
to that in other Korean cities. Approximately 66% of the road network
is paved and 13.6% of land use in the developed areas is for roads.
Public transportation which accounts for about 68% of all trips (54% bus
and 14% taxi) is well managed and provides good service. All bus
companies in Taegu are privately owned and operate without subsidy.
Between 1980 and 1986 the number of vehicles in Taegui increased by 17%
per annum and the number of cars more than tripled. The principal
lmpact of this growth has been to decrease speeds and increase
congestion, particularly in the CBD. Traffic volumes in this area have
increased by over 50* in five years.
1.13       Taegu City Government (TCG) is taking a two-phased approach
to address this situation. In the short term, TCG aims at improving the
efficiency and safety of the existing road network through the
introduction of TSM measures. Steps are already under way to establish
a traffic control center and computerize the coordination of traffic
signals. Following the recommendations of a Bank-financed study (see
para. 1.17 below), TCG has created a Transportation Planning and
Management Division to consolidate traffic planning and to develop a
four-year program of traffic management and public transport improvement
measures. In the medium term, TCG plans to increase the road capacity
by constructing an urban expressway, the Shinchon Expressway, which will
provide an effective bypass to the CBD, relieve traffic congestion in
the vicinity of the industrial area situated in the north of the city,
and provide a much needed north-south road link within the city.
Bank Lending Strategy
1.14      The Bank has been assisting the Government meet the needs of
the urban population through investments in regional development, land
development and housing, water supply, urban transportation and city
management. To date, the Bank has made 13 urban development loans to
Korea: three in regional development, three in land development and
housing, four in water supply, one in urban transportation, and one in
city management and development. A housing finance sector loan was
approved by the Board in June 1987.
1.15     The Bank's urban strategy in Korea has emphasized the
following:
(a)   assisting the Government to expand urban infrastructure
effectively and to provide services, with an emphasis on the
lower-income groups;
(b)   introducing new technologies and approaches to project
planning and management; and
(c)   strengthening sector institutions to plan investments,
implement projects, and operate and maintain services.



1.16     The Bank's objective in the urban transport subsector is to
assist the Government to maintain the efficiency of Korea's major cities
not only through the construction of new roads but also through better
utilization of the existing road network by encouraging the use of TSM
techniques, and establishing and strengthening transportation planning
capabilities in the cities.
1.17     The Bank's involvement in urban transportation in Korea
started with Government's inquiry in 1980 about the possibility of Bank
financing for such projects. A Bank mission visited Korea in October
1980 to review the urban transport situation and explore project
possibilities. While noting the significant progress made up to that
time, the mission highlighted the need for improvements in traffic and
transport planning, traffic management and urban transport policy
formulation, ard suggested strengthening key institutions and improving
coordination among the various national and local government institu-
tions. The Government then undertook transportation improvement studies
in the major cities (Seoul, Pusan, Taegu, Y.wangju and Taejon), with
financing provided through the Seventh Railway Project (Loan 1836-KO).
These studies formed the basis for subsequent urban transportation
projects in Korea.
1.18     The first project to take a comprehensive approach to urban
transport, the Seoul Urban Transportation Project (Loan 2514-KO),
was approved by the Board in April 1985. Although there was some inital
reluctance to adopt TSM due to its novelty, the Seoul project has had a
positive demonstration effect and led to wider acceptance of the TSM
concept in Korea.   The Pusan Urban Management Project (Loan 2801-KO),
approved by the Board in April 1987, also includes measures to introduce
TSM and to undertake institutional changes to improve transportation
planning similar to those proposed under this project.
Proiect Rationale
1.19      The rationale for Bank support for urban transport projects
in Korea is to promote comprehensive transportation planning, introduce
traffic management concepts and practices, and assist the cities to deal
with their future traffic problems. The Taegu Urban Transport Project
is an integral part of the Bank's urban transport strategy. Following
on the Bank's efforts in Seoul and Pusan, the project will assist Taegu
City to finance new road investments, implement TSM, and support the
city's efforts to reorganize and strengthen transportation planning.

II. THE PROJECT
Proiect Origin and Formulation
2.01     Under the Urban Planning Law, all cities in Korea are requir<d
to prepare urban development plans, which identify land use zones and
establish rights-of-way and reserves for roads as well as other city
infrastructure. One of the priority roads identified in the Taegu City
Urban Plan was an urban expressway along the Shinchon River. In 1984,
Taegu City Government (TCG) commissioned a feasibility study of the
Shinchon Expressway 1_/ which evaluted several alternative alignments.
The proposed route proved to be the least expensive, especially in terms
of disruption to established communities and acquisition and compen-
sation costs. The alternative selected also had the highest economic
rate of return.
2.02      The Korea Advanced Institute for Science and Technology
(KAIST) carried out a transport planning study in Taegu 2_J which
provided the basis for the traffic management programs in the proposed
project. The study observed that the transportation situation in Taegu
City was entering a critical stage brought about by the rapid growth in
car ownership, and recommended efficiency and safety improvements
through the greater use ,of TSM techniques, strengthening of the city's
capability to plan and manage the transportation system, and expansion
6f the road network. Following the KAIST study, TCG consolidated it3
transportation planning into a newly formed Transportation Planning and
Management Division in the Urban Planning Bureau.
Project Obtectives
2.03     The objectives of the proposed project would be to:
(a) increase the efficiency, capacity and safety of the existing
transportation system in Taegu through the introduction and
application of TSM techniques and the construction of a major
urban expressway with associated links; and
(b) assist TCG to build the institutional capacity to plan, design
and implement traffic and safety improvements, and deal with
future transportation problems.

Projiect Description
2.04    The proposed project would include three principal components:
(a) Major Road Investments (estimated cost US$134.4 million):
Land acquisition and construction of around 9.5 km of the
Shinchon Expressway and connecting roads and bridges, and
consultant services for construction supervision;
(b) TSM and Safety Improvements (estimated cost US$10.4 million):
Construction of intersection improvements, channelization,
markings, and pedestrian facilities, and the installation of
traffic signals; and
(c) Institutional Development (estimated cost US$0.9 million):
Advisory services, training and equipment.
2.05     Major Road Investments: The construction of the Shinchon
Expressway and associated road works (see Map IBRD 20245) would be the
largest project component, involving over 90% of project costs. The
six-lane expressway would be constructed along the west bank of the
Shinchon River and would improve access to the CBD and the industrial
area in the north of the city. Service roads would be constructed to
serve the existing residential and commercial areas to the west of the
new highway and footways would be provided to allow access to the river
banks. One section (1 km) of the expressway is already open to traffic,
and another section (4 km) was completed in September 1987. The
proposed project wou'd finance the remaining five sections (about 9.5
kim), as well as three connecting roads (about 1.7 km) and two bridges
necessary to improve access to the expressway.
2.06     The southernmost section of the Shinchon Expressway (between
Chungdong Bridge and Tongdaegu Ro, about 8% of project cost) would link
with a proposed highway from Taegu to Kimhae (the site of the inter-
national airport serving Pusan and the southeast). The design and start
of implementation of this section of the expressway would be determined
by the construction schedule of the proposed Taegu-Kimhae highway. The
Ministry of Construction (HOC) began preparation of a feasibility study
for the highway in 1987 and, if the highway is found to be feasible,
would carry out detailed engineering and design in 1988. While funds
for the construction of the southernmost section of the Shinchon
Expressway have been included in the project, the decision to construct
this section would have to be taken after the design and construction
schedule of the Taegu-Kimhae highway have been established. If the
Taegu-Kimhae highway is to be completed by 1992, TCG would proceed with
construction of the southernmost section of the expressway, also for
completion by 1992. If not, funds allocated for this section of the
expressway would be utilized to carry out other priority road and
transportation investments included in the city's annual transportation
investment plan. TCG will submit to the Bank, no later than December
31, 1988, a feasibility study on alternative priority transportation
investments in Taegu City which would complement the function'ng of the
Shinchon Expressway. These arrangements were confirmed during
negotiations.



- 8 -
2.07     TSM and Safety Improvements:  This component would involve
five subcomponents:
(a)  the supply and installation of a computer based traffic
control center and traffic signal equipment at about *00
intersections;
(b)  traffic and pedestrian improvements at about 20 locations in
the CBD;
(c)  intersection improvements at about 35 locations in close
proximity to the Shinchon Expressway and at about 6 other
locations;
(d)  safety improvements at approximately 150 accident blackspots;
and
(e)  public transport improvements end bus priority measures on the
main traffic corridors and in the CBD.
2.08     The immediate objective of the TSM and safety improvement
component is to introduce low-cost traffic management schemes throughout
the city aimed at increasing road capacity, improving traffic flow, with
particular emphasis on public transport vehicles, and improving road
safety. The program of improvements would involve the identification of
traffic bottlenecks, traffic conflicts and accident blackspots. Typical
measures for dealing with these problems would include junction improve-
ments, one-way streets, channelization, bus bays and priority lanes,
markings, signals, selective road widening and pedestrian facilities
such as safety islands and controlled crossings. In contrast with the
expressway which is a discreet investment, the TSN and safety components
would be carried out as an annual program which should form a regular
and continuing activity of the TCG. Thus, the development of the
institutionil arrangements for this purpose is an important part of the
project.
2.09    Institutional Development:  The principal objective of this
component would be to provide technical assistance to improve TCG's
capability in transportation planning and implementation of traffic and
safety improvements. The institutional development component would
comprise three subcomponents:



- 9 -
(a) technical assistance to the Transportation Planning and
Management Division of the TCG to promote the transfer of TSM
and transportation planning technology. Particular emphasis
would be given to improving public transport facilities and
services. Advisors would assist in the planning of the TSM
and safety components, and the training of TCG staff. During
negotiations, the terms of reference were confirmed and an
agreement reached with TCG that the advisors would be in place
by June 1988;
(b) short- and long-term overseas training programs for staff of
the TCG. The scope and content of the overseas training pro-
gram were reviewed during negotiations; and
(c) equipment for the Transportation Planning and Management Divi-
sion to carry out traffic monitoring to measure the impact of
the TSM and safety programs. The list of equipment was
reviewed at negotiations.
An outline of the terms of reference, training program and TSM equipment
needs are attached as Annex 1.
Prolect Costs and Financing
2.10        The total project cost, including taxes and duties, is
estimated at about W 116.6 billion (US$145.7 million). The foreign
exchange component is about U 29.4 billion (US$36.7 million) or 25% of
the total project cost. Land acquisition costs, estimated to be W 37.7
billion, are included. Taxes and duties are estimated to be about W 6.9
billion (US$8.6 million). Consultant services are estimated to total
W 3.1 billion (US$3.9 million) and would be required for: (a) advisory
services (about 90 manmonths); (b) detailed design and supervision of
the TSM components (about 120 manmonths); and (c) construction
supervision of the road investments (about 1,000 manmonths). Consultant
costs include fees, local allowances, international travel and other
overheads but exclude price contingencies.
2.11       Project costs are summarized in Table 2.1 and detailed cost
estimates are presented in Annex 2. The base costs are expressed in
September 1987 prices. Cost estimates are based on contract award costs
for sections of highway already contracted in 1987 and detailed
engineering for sections to be bid in 1988. Physical contingencies have
been estimated at 5% of base costs; price contingencies are based on
increases of 1% p.a. for 1988-1991 and 3.5% p.a. thereafter for both
local and foreign costs.

2.12        The proposed Bank loan of US$30.0 million would contribute
to about 21% of the project cost and would cover about 82% the foreign
exchange requirements. The Bank loan would be made to Taegu City for a
term of 15 years including three years grace at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. The loan will be guaranteed by the Republic of
Korea. The local counterpart funds would be provided in a timely manner
by the Taegu City Government (TCG). Assurances to this effect were
obtained at negotiations. TCG would provide w 53.6 billion (US$67
million) from internal revenues and w 39.0 billion (US$48.7 million)
from highway bonds. The Financing Plan is summarized in Table 2.2.

2.13        The proposed project would represent about 30% of capital
expenditures in the city's General Account 3_J over the project period
(1988 to 1992). As the third largest city in Korea, TCG has a strong
financial base and is not expected to experience difficulties providing
the counterpart funds during implementation and servicing the debt after
completion. C',ty General Account revenues have grown from w 84 billion
in 1982 to w 1.28 billion in 1985, an increase of around 15% per annum
(or about 12% in real terms). The city derives the greater part of its
General Account income (over 60%) from local taxes, while central
3 J City accounts are divided into General and Special A^counts.
Special Accounts are established for revenue generating oper4tions, such
as water supply, hospitals, etc. Transportation investments are
included in the General Account.



- 12 -
government transfers account for just over 10% of revenues. TCG has
increased its borrowings in recent years, but borrowings account for
less than 7% of revenues. Expenditures have increased in line with
revenues, averaging around 15% per annum between 1982 and 1985. Capital
investments account for about 508 of these expenditures. Revenues
excluding borrowings are projected to grow at 7% per annum and expen-
ditures excluding the proposed project are estimated to grow at about 6%
during the project period 1988 to 1992. While Taegu City has increased
borrowings, loans (including the Bank loan and highway bonds) would
remain less than 8% of city revenues and the city will maintain a deft
service coverage 4_J of over 3.0. Taegu City's finances are presented
in Annex 3.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Taegu City Government
3.01     Taegu City Government (TCG) is an independent legal entity
with the status of a Direct Jurisdictional City 5_J, equivalent to a
province. TCG employs a total of 6,712 officials, of whom 851 work in
the City Hall. City Hall is divided into 10 bureaus, 2 special offices
(Audit and Fire Safety) and a training institute. The remaining city
staff are employed in the ward (gu) and other branch offices. TCG's
organization is shown in Annex 4.
3.02      Construction of city infrastructure is carried out by the
Construction Bureau. The Bureau has four divisions (Architecture,
Housing, Roads and Management) and has a total of about 75 staff. The
Rop.ds Division, which has a staff of 6 engineers, designs and implements
8'1 road construction projects with the support of the Management
Division and the Ward Offices. Consultants are hired when necessary to
assist in feasibility studies, design and constriction supervision. The
Division has been responsible for implementing large road improvement
projects over the last several years including sections of the Shinchon
Expressway already completed and in progress. The Accounting Division
of the Finance Bureau is responsible for contract administration.
4_J Debt Service Coverage equals:
(revenues -borrowings - recurrent expenditure - loan repayment)
Debt Service
5_J Taegu City was designated a Direct Jurisdictional City in 1981 under
the "Taegu Inchon Direct Jurisdictional City Establishment Law" (July 1,
1981).



- 13 -
3.03     Responasibilities for traffic management and traffic control
were until recently spread among several city bureaus, with the Traffic
Police Section in the Public Safety Division of the Police Bureau taking
a leading role, particularly with regard to the planning of traffic
signal improvements. Recognizing the need to consolidate transportation
planning responsibilities and to give TSM more emphasis, TCG set up a
Transportation Planning and Management Division within the Urban
Planning Bureau in January 1987. The new division consists of four
sections: Traffic Planning, Traffic Facilities, Traffic Operations, and
Vehicle Registration. The Transportation Planning and Management
Division and the Traffic Police Section are both adequately staffed to
implement the TSM component of the project with initial assistance from
consultants and advisors.
3.04     TCG has also gained approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs
to create a Transportation Bureau. The new bureau would be formed by
consolidating three existing divisions of the Urban Planning Bureau
dealing with transportation. Organizational changes of this magnitude
take time to implement in Korea. The timing of the formation of the
bureau is not critical to the implementation of the project since the
TSM component would be supervised by the existing Transportation
Planning and Management Division and the Traffic Police Section.
Implementation Arrangements
3.05     Construction of major project road investments would be
carried out by the Roads Division of the Construction Bureau.
Consultants would provide assistance in construction design and
supervision. Samwoo Engineering Co., which conducted the feasibility
study, is also carrying out the detailed engineering which would be
completed by December 1987.
3.06     The TSM component would be implemented by the Traffic Police
Section and the Transportation Planning and Management Division. Final
engineering design and contract documentation of the traffic signal
component is currently being prepared by the Korea Transport Institute
(KTI) 6_J. Preliminary engineering designs for other TSM components
would be prepared by the Transportation Planning and Management Division
in coordination with the Traffic Police Section. Detailed engineering
design and supervision would be carried out by consultants. Overall co-
ordination of the project and liaison with the Bank would be provided by
the Director of the Planning and Management Bureau who reports directly
to the Mayor. Implementation responsibilities are summarized in Table
3.1.
6_J Urban transport planning and research (along with the staff
involved) were transferred from KAIST to KTI.

Implementation Schedule
3.07     The project would be implemented over a five-year period, 1988
to 1992. The implementation schedule, as well as a timetable of key
events for the TSM component, is presented in Annex 5. Detailed
engineering is completed for the 1988 civil ,orks contracts and would be
completed for the remaining civil works contracts by December 1987. The
first contract under the project is scheduled to be awarded by April
1988.
3.08     The right-of-way (ROW) required for the project would involve
the acquisition of about 17 ha and the relocation of about 2,300
families. Land acquisition for the Shinchon Expressway has been in
progress since 1984 and acquisition of the ROW for the section scheduled
to start construction in 1988 is well advanced. TCG has a satisfactory
plan and timetable for acquiring the remaining ROW in line with the
construction schedule and has budgeted funds for this purpose as part of
the project costs. Although relocation creates hardship, TCG pays a
fair and timely compensation for both property and loss of livelihood,
and provides alternative housing where necessary in order to facilitate
land acquisition and minimize hardship. TCG's procedures and plans for
land acquisition and compensation are described in Annex 6. Progress on
land acquisition and relocation will be monitored through the regular
project progress reports (para. 3.16).

3.10      Civil Works. The estimated value of civil works under the
project is about US$90 million. About four contract packages over
US$7 million each, totalling US$69.9 million, would be procured from
prequalified contractors through international competitive bidding (ICB)
in accordance with Bank guidelines. However, foreign contractors are
not expected to be interested in these bids due to the very competitive
and efficient local construction industry. The balance of about 10
construction contract packages, totalling US$20.0 million, are
relatively small and would be awarded through local competitive bidding
(LOB) procedures satisfactory to the Bank.



- 16 -
3.11      Goods contracts for traffic monitoring equipment totalling
about US$0.2 million would be grouped in &ppropriate bidding packages
and procured through prudent shopping from local and foreign sources in
accordance with Bank procedures. The city would procure traffic signal
equipment (not financed by the loan) according to local competitive
procedures.
3.12      Consultants services for project supervision would be
negotiated with the same consultants engaged for detailed engineering.
TCG would obtain consultants for advisory services and detailed
engineering for the TSM component. Bank loan funds will not be used to
finance consultant services, but the Bank would be given the opportunity
to comment on the consultants' qualifications, experience and terms of
reference. This was confirmed during negotiations.
3.13      Prior Review.  All civil works contracts over US$7.0 million
each would be subject to the Bank's prior review, which would cover
around 80% of the value and 30% of the number of the civil works
contracts. Other contracts would be subject to selective post-award
review.
3.14      Disbursement would be made against the following categories
of expenditures:
(a) 40% of the cost of civil works; and
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory) and 65% of other local expenditures for
materials and equipment; and
Disbursement of Bank funds for all contracts under US$3.0 million would
be made on the basis of statements of expenditures with all relevant
documentation being held on file in the Finance Bureau of TCG. All
other disbursements would be fully documented. An estimated schedule of
disbursements is shown in Annex 7. It is expected that disbursements
would be completed by June 30, 1993, about six months after completion
of civil works, to allow for payment of contractor's retention monies.
The disbursement period of six years is in line with the disbursement
profile for Korea. In order to facilitate implementation and disburse-
ments, a Special Account of US$2.0 million would be established in the
Taegu Branch of the Korea Exchange Bank. The loan closing date would be
December 31, 1993.
Accounts and Audits
3.15      TCG would establish and maintain a separate project account
in the Finance Bureau for expenditures under the project. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that TCG would furnish to the Bank,
within six months of the end of each year, audit reports prepared by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit would contain a
separate opinion where statements of expenditure have been used as a
basis for disbursements.



- 17 -
Progress Reporting and Monitoring
3.16      The Planning and Management Bureau would be responsible for
overall monitoring of the project, and would prepare and forward
Progress Reports to the Bank semi-annually. The Progress Reports will
monitor progress on land acquisition and relocation of affected
residents. Monitoring of the civil works components would be based on
the implementation program (Annex 5, Table 1). Monitoring of the TSM
component would be based on the timetable of key events (Annex 5, Table
2). In order to measure the impact of the TSM program, the Traffic
Planning and Management Division would carry out traffic surveys before
and after the implementation of various improvement measures (Annex 5,
Table 3). The Planning and Management Bureau would also be responsible
for preparing the Project Completion Report. These arrangements were
confirmed during negotiations.
IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Benefits
4.01     The proposed Shinchon Expressway 7_J would primarily improve
traffic flows and reduce congestion and delays in the industrial areas
to the north of Taegu City and within the CBD. It is estimated that the
expressway would reduce traffic volumes in the CBD by about 16%. The
TSM and safety investments would have a citywide impact, resulting in
reduced delays and lower accident rates. The project is also expected
to have a beneficial environmental impact in that the relief of traffic
congestion and higher vehicle speeds would also contribute to reducing
pollution from vehicle exhaust fumes.
4.02      The project is expected to have a significant institutional
benefit by strengthening TCG's transportation planning and traffic
management capability. The newly established Transportation Planning
and Management Division would be the main beneficiary of technical
assistance and training under the project, and would gain valuable
experience in planning and managing TSM programs. The local and
overseas training programs would also make a significant contribution to
the development of TCG's transportation planning and traffic management
capabilities.
7 J Alternative alignments for the expressway were evaluated in the
feasibility study (para. 2.01). The present alignment was chosen since
it had the best rate of return, lower land acquisition costs and smaller
relocation problems.



- 18 -
Economic Evaluation
4.03       The Shinchon Expressway and associated road investments,
which account for over 90% of project costs, would result in a smoother
flow of traffic, faster speeds and reduced delays in reaching desti-
nations. The economic benefits of the expressway and associated roads
have been quantified in terms of vehicle operating cost (VOC) and
passenger time savings. The feasibility study included projections of
traffic volumes and average speeds on the main roads of Taegu City's
transportation network with and without the proposed expressway and
associated road investments, using a conventional traffic assignment
model. The VOC and time costs were estimated by comparing costs for the
network with and without the proposed investments. The basic
assumptions used and details of the economic analysis are presented in
Annex 8.
4.04      The economic rate of return (ERKQ of the expressway and
associated road improvements is estimated to be 25% based only on VOC
savings. If time cost savings are included, the ERR increases to 37%.
Sensitivity analyses were carried out assuming:
(a) a 25% decrease in benefits, which resulted in the ERR (VOC
only) decreasing to 21%; and
(b) a 25% increase in cost, which resulted in the ERR (VOC only)
decreasing to 22%.
The above rates of return are acceptable for these types of investments
in Korea.
4.05       The TSM component consists of a large number of small civil
works scattered around the city; as such it is very difficult to isolate
the impact of these investments. However, experience in other countries
has shown TSM to be a cost-effective measure in improving traffic flows
and safety. Rates of return in the order of 30% to 70% have been
obtained from similar TSX improvements in other Bank projects. While
institutional aspects of the project are also expected to have a
beneficial impact on the city over the long term, these benefits cannot
be directly quantified.
Prolect Risks
4.06     The project poses no major risks.  There is a possibility that
unforseen difficulties with land acquisition could result in delays in
the construction of the expressway and/or associated road works. Land
would have to be acquired in close proximity to the city center,
involving the relocation of about 9,000 persons (2,300 families). This
is not expected to pose a significant problem given TCG's satisfactory
land acquisition plan and implementing capabilities. Experience in
Korea indicates that the assessment and payment of compensation to
affected persons is done in a fair and timely manner, and alternate
housing is provided for resettlement as necessary. Progress on land
acquisition will be monitored closely during project supervision.



- 19 -
4.07     Given its novelty, the implementation of the TSM program,
especially in the earlier years of the project, may encounter delays.
However, the establishment of a separate Transportation Planning and
Management Division is an indication of TCG's commitment to improving
transportation planning and safety. In addition, the staff of the
Transportation Planning and Management Division would be supported by
experienced advisors. Progress on the TSM component would be closely
monitored during project supervision.
V. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      Terms of reference for the consultant advisors, the training
program for TCG staff, and TSM equipment requirements were reviewed and
confirmed with TCG during negotiations (para. 2.09). It was also
confirmed that the Planning and Management Bureau would prepare and
forward to the Bank semi-annual progress reports and the Trans-
portation Planning and Management Division would conduct befoie and
after surveys to assess the impact of the TSM program (para. 3.16).
5.02      The following agreements were reached during negotiations:
(a) TCG would provide, by December 31, 1988, a feasibility study
on alternative investments if TCG will not go ahead with the
Chungdong Bridge - Tongdaegu Ro section of the Shinchon
Expressway (para. 2.06);
(b) TCG would put in place TSM advisors by June 30, 1988 (para.
2.09);
(c) TCG would provide counterpart funding in a timely manner
(para. 2.12); and
(d) TCG would furnish audit reports, prepared by independent
auditors satisfactory to the Bank, within six months of the
end of each fiscal year (para. 3.15).
5.03     With the above assurances, the proposed project would be
suitable for a Bank loan of US$30 million. The loan would be for a
period of 15 years including three years of grace at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. The Borrower would be the Taegu City Government
with a guarantee of the Republic of Korea.

KOREA
TAMGU URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
A. Outline Terms of Reference for Advisory Services
Introduction
1.         Traffic facilities and roads in Taegu City are quickly
becoming congested, and traffic accidents are increasing because of
rapidly increasing car ownership. Urgent measures are therefore needed
to improve the efficiency and safety of the road system. The Taegu City
Government (TCG) has decided to tackle these problems by carrying out
innovative programs of Transportation System Management (TSM) measures
to be partly financed by the Bank. Since many of the techniques and
measures that will be used to improve the efficiency and safety of the
traffic system are new to Korea, TCG is seeking the assistance of
advisors for about two years to transfer this knowledge and experience
to city staff and assist in the preparation and implementation of the
TSM and other transportation improvement programs. The technology
transfer will also involve the preparation of manuals and an extensive
training program.
Ob ectives
2.       The purpose of these terms of reference are to define the
scope of the work program as well as the qualifications , experience and
duties of the advisors. The TCG would like to develop their own staff's
skills as soon as possible in transportation planning, TSM engineering,
public transport planning and road safety engineering. To this end some
of the advisors would work full time with the city staff in Taegu
preparing manuals, guidelines and computer applications for use in
Taegu. The advisors will also prepare a program of in-house staff
training which will also involve overseas visits of short, medium, and
long duration for formal training and technical visits.
3.       The technical assistance contract would involve three main
tasks:
(a) technical support to Taegu City's Transportation Planning
and Management Division for the implementation of TSM;

- road safety engineering; and
(c) Training of TCG officials.
Scope of Work
4.       The technical assistance contract would involve about 48 man-
months, of both foreign and local advisory support. The principal
duties of the advisors would be to pass on their knowledge and
experience to the city staff by: (a) assisting them in planning, design
and implementation of TSM, road safety and monitoring programs; and (b)
preparing manuals and guidelines; and (c) developing comprehensive
training programs. The duration of the proposed interventions of the
advisors would be over two years.
5.       Technical Support  The advisors will assist TCG's
Transportation Planning and Management Division:
(a) design and implement TSM, road safety and public transport
improvement projects;
(b) design and carry out traffic impact studies and project
monitoring activities to determine the impact of TSM, road
safety and public transport improvement projects; and
(c) develop covprehensivce city transport policies encompassing
TSM, road safety, public transportation, pedestrian traffic
and parking.
6.       Preparation of Manuals and Computer Applications  The advisors
will develop technical guidelines in Korean and computer applications
for TCG's Transportation Planning Division. This task is one of the
most important since the guidelines and computer applications will be
used after the departure of the advisors. Guidelines will be produced
for:
(a) Traffic Impact Analysis: This type of analysis became a legal
requirement for all new major development schemes in 1987.
Although guidelines are under preparation by Government, it
will take some time for the concepts and techniques to become
institutionalized. The experts will provide practical
guidance in the form of manuals on the implementation of these
guidelines.

(b) TSM Planning: Pianning and design ruidelines will be prepared
for traffic management, traffic engineering, capacity analysis
of intersections, parking, public transport priority measures,
signing and marking, traffic signals and safety improvements.
(c) Transportation Planning and Evaluation: Simplified computer
models and instructions will be prepared to assist the cities
in planning and carryirg out economic evaluation of road and
public transport improvement proposals.
7.       Training  The advisors will develop amd conduct training
seminars involving the staff from the Construction, Urban Planning,
(proposed; Transport and Traffic Police Bur.aus as well as the budget
division dealing with transport proposals. Approximately eight training
sessions of about five days duration would be held over a two year
period. The topics to be covered would include: traffic monitoring,
traffic signals design, traffic management and parking, public transport
planning, project evaluation and traffic impact analysis. Written
documentation would be provided with each course. Full use would be
made of visual aids to illustrate the lectures and provide insights
into traffic and transport planning methods from overseas.

KOREA
TAEGU URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
Taegu City Finances
1.        In Korea, local government finances are divided between a
single General Account, which includes general government services and
other operations where there is no direct cost recovery, and several
Special Accounts, which account separately for operations entailing
direct payments by beneficiaries, e.g., water supply, housing, land
development (re-adjustment), etc. Transportation investments are
included in the General Account and comprise the bulk of the capital
investment in the account.
2.        An analysis of past trends and projections of future revenues
and expenditures were carried out for Taegu City's General Account to
determine whether the city would be able to provide counterpart funding
and service the Bank loan. Data are presented in Annex Table 1. In
1985 (the last year for which actual figures are available), General
Account revenues in Taegu City totalled W 128 billion, which consisted
of: (i) local taxes, W 79 billion (62%); (b) non-tax revenues, W 24
billion (19%); (c) central government transfers, W 16 billion (13%); and
(d) borrowings, W 8 billion (6%). The main sources of revenue (other
than central government transfers) are: (i) the acquisition tax (based
on land purchases), W 17 billion; (ii) the registration tax (based on
registration of property), W 18 billion; and (iii) the property tax
(based on assessed value of fixed assets), W 14 billion. As the third
largest city in Korea, Taegu has a strong financial base. Furthermore,
Taegu is a Direct Jurisdictional City, making it equal in status to a
province and giving it revenues which normally go to the  rovincial
government.
3.        In 1985, Taegu City's General Account expenditures totalled
some W 120 billion. The city expended W 60 billion (50% of total
expenditures) for capital investments. Transportation investments are
estimated to be around W 26 billion, just over 40% of capital expen-
ditures in the General Account. Other major investments, such as in
water and sewerage, housing, and schools, are included under their
respective Special Accounts. Taegu City has historically allocated
about half of its General Account to capital expenditures. In most
years, the city has recorded a surplus in the General Account. Cash
balances (which are carried forward and included under non-tax revenues
in the city budgets) have been about 10% of revenues.

ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 4
4.        Projections for the project period (1988-92) were prepared by
Taegu City, assuming continuation of current trends. The comparison of
past and projected revenues and expenditures are presented in Annex 3
Chart 1. Local taxes would continue to form the bulk of General Account
revenues, accounting for about 67% in 1992. Land prices are an
important factor in determining local tax revenues since land-based
taxes (e.g. acquisition tax, registration tax and property tax) are the
major sources of revenues. Land prices in Taegu (as in other large
cities in Korea) have risen continuously in the past reflecting the
increased demand for land from urban growth. The city can therefore
expect a continued rise in revenues.
5.        City projections show that capital investments would continue
to account for around 40% of city expenditures. Total capital invest-
ment during the proposed project period (1988-92) is estimated to be
about W 390 billion. The proposed Taegu Urban Transportation Project
would be W 119 billion or about 30% of total city investments.
6.        The city will finance W 39.0 billion (42% of local counterpart
financing requirements) through highway bonds which are repaid in 6
years (balloon payment in the sixth year) and carry an interest rate of
6% compounded yearly. These bonds are a form of compulsory savings
since their purchase is mandatory for residents registering vehicles in
the city. This is a common practice in Korea. For example, residents
needing connections to the city water system are required to purchase
water bonds which are then used to finance water supply investments.
7.        Debt service is not expected to be a problem.  Projections of
the debt service coverage ratio 1J are satisfactory, averaging over
6.0, expect in 1987 and 1988 when two large loan repayments become due.
1J Debt Service Coverage - (Total revenues -borrowing -recurrent
expenditures -loan repayments)/(debt service)

In order to obtain information for design purposes and measure
the impact of the TSM program, it will be necessary to carry out traffic
surveys at key intersections and on critical links "before" and "after"
the implementation of the individual improvement schemes. The *before"
and 'after" studies should monitor travel speeds, delays, traffic
volumes, vehicle classifications and accident records. It may also be
necessary to measure pedestrian volumes. This exercise will provide
monitoring information which would allow the Transportation Planning and
Management Division and the Traffic Police Division to continually adapt
and improve the efficiency of the traffic system in the city.

TAEGU URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
Description of Land Acquisition and Compensation Procedures
1.       Land Acquisition.  The Shinchon Expressway has a 50 m wide
right of way (ROW) established under the Taegu City Government's (TCG)
urban development plan. The ROW has been sterilized against new
development since 1982.  The total length of the expressway is about
14.5 km, of which two sections totalling about 5.0 km has already been
completed by 1987. These completed sections involved the acquisition of
about 1.4 ha in 232 lots and was accomplished satisfactorily during the
period 1984-1986 in line with the construction schedule for these two
sections. The balance about 9.5 km of the expressway is scheduled for
construction under the project during the period 1988-1992 in five
sections and involves acquisition of a further 15.3 ha in 1366 lots.
The acquisition of 2.0 ha in 190 lots falling within the next 1.2 km
section of the expressway, scheduled for construction in 1988, is well
advanced. Table 1 shows TCG's overall land acquisition plan for the
Shinchon Expressway.
2.       Acquisition proceedings by public agencies including TCG are
governed by the "Special Law on Acquisition and Compensation of Lands
for Public Use" in force since December 31, 1975. Under this law, TCG's
Construction Bureau (Compensation Section) makes the initial surveys and
investigations, prepares an initial valuation of compensation payable
for property, loss of livelihood, relocation expenses, etc., and
forwards these estimates to the TCG's Gu Offices for verification and
discussion with affected persons. This normally occurs about six months
ahead of finalization of acquisition proceedings. Almost simul-
taneously, the Construction Bureau refers these initial surveys to two
private valuers who are licenced under the law to make independant
valuations of compensation payable to the affected persc -. These
independent valuations are made in accordance with guie.l. -s framed
under the Law and are based on the valuers' professional judgement after
considering both market prices and book values. The average of the two
independent valuers assesments form the basis for final negotiations
with the affected persons and, being generally fair and reasonable, are
accepted by the majority of those affected. Where no agreement is
reached, the affected parties are entitled to make an appeal to a
Committee for Appeals which is set up under the Law by the Ministry of
Construction (independant of TCG) to hear and adjudicate on such
appeals. The general experience is that about 10% of affected persons
take an appeal to this Committee mainly to get a reassessment of
property values based on anticipated appreciation due to the improvement
for which the acquisition is being made. In the rare event of the



- 35 -
Annex 6
Paae 2 of 3
Committee's findings being unacceptable to the parties concerned,
recourse is possible to the established Law Courts. These proceedings
are seen to be and are accepted as fair and reasonable and takes from 6-
9 months to complete.
3.      Compensation. As explained above, compensation valuations are
determined by independent professional assessments based on market and
book value. Compensation is payable for both moveable and immoveable
property affected as well as for loss of crops and other amenities, loss
of livelihhod (on an average up to three months of estimated lost
earnings), loss of rental deposits and relocation expenses. In addition
TCG's Health and Social Welfare Services attached to the Gu Offices
provide assistance to disadvantaged families to relocate, find suitable
accomodation, schooling and health facilities. TCG has fund allocations
to subsidize poorer families for hardship caused by displacement.
4.        Relocation. TCG gives first priority to displaced persons in
the allocation of housing from TCG's annual housing programs which
includes rental units. Between 1986 and 1991 some 104,000 new housing
units are scheduled for construction within the city of which 9,360 are
rental units. However most affected persons would find rental units or
purchase housing on their own using the compensation payments. Of the
274 families affected in the completed sections of the expressway only
29 families availed themselves of city apartments as alternate
accomodation. Almost all affected families are urban dwellers and most
incomes are derived from city occupations in the vicinity. A few (about
5%) are engaged in small-scale businesses (inns, retail shops, scrap
dealerships, etc.) and would either relocate elsewhere in the vicinity
or close down and invest compensation payments in other activities.
5.        TCG has developed a realistic and satisfactory plan to
accomplish the land acquisition, compensation and relocation affecting
some 2370 families (9300 persons) due to the scheduled construction of
the expressway between 1984 and 1992. The final alignment of the
expressway has minimized relocation and associated costs after a study
of possible alternative alignments. TCG has accomplished satisfactorily
about 10% of the total relocation and compensation in the two sections
already complete and has budgeted funds for timely payment of
compensation to affected persons in the remaining sections between 1987-
1992. These costs have been included in project costs and in the
analysis of the financial and economic viability of the project. TCG has
also the organizational capacity and experience to successfully
administer this plan without causing undue hardship and social and
political problems while implementing this important public development
in the heart of the city.

TAEGU URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
Economic Analysis Summary
1.        Savings in road user costs were used to measure the economic
benefits of road investments under the project. Road user costs were
divided into: (a) vehicle operating costs (VOC); and (b) the value of
time. VOC include fuel, oil, tires, maintenance, depreciation,
insurance and other fixed costs. VOC were estimated for different
speeds (ranging from 8 km/hr to 96 km/hr) by type of vehicle, i.e.,
passenger cars, taxis, buses, and trucks. Similarly, the value of time
saved was estimated by type of vehicle. The details of the estimates
and costs (in July 1985 prices) are presented in Chapter 5 of the
feasibility study 1J which is available in the Project Files. These
costs were updated to December 1986 prices in the revised feasibility
study 2_J which is also available in the Project Files. VOC costs are
summarized below.

2.       The feasibility study projected the traffic volumes along
Taegu City's main arteries using an origin-destination and traffic
assignment model in order to establish demand for the proposed Shinchon
Expressway and other road investments. A comparison was done of the
situation with and without the proposed investments in order to gauge
the impact of the expressway. Using the cost parameters for VOC and
time (para. 1 above), the wOC and time costs for the network with and
without the investments were then calculated and the cost savings
obtained.
3.        The economic rate of return (ERR) of the expressway and
associated road improvements is estimated to be 25% based only on VOC
savings. If time cost savings are included, the ERR increases to 37%.
Sensitivity analyses were also carried out assuming 25% decrease in
benefits and a 25% increase in costs. ERRs are summarized in Table 2.

VOC and Time Savings     37%          31%        33%
4.        The cost-benefit analysis is presented in Table 3 (attached).
The VOC and time cost savings estimated in the revised feasiblity study
(Alternative One) were taken as the benefits. The study had used 365
days in a year in estimating benefits. This was reduced by about 12%
(i.e. by 1-(320/365)) in order to adjust the number of days in the year
to discount Sundays when traffic volumes are expected to be much lower
(most businesses work half a day on Saturdays). Benefits were reduced
by 50% in 1989/90 and 25% in 1991/92 to adjust for the longer construc-
tion period. All benefits and costs prior to 1988 were not factored
into the analysis. Annual costs were taken from the Bank project cost
estimates. During the appraisal, project costs were adjusted by adding
physical contingencies, some marginal components were dropped, and the
construction period extended to five years. All data is net of taxes
and are expressed in December 1986 prices.
