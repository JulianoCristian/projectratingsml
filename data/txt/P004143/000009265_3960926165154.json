         supports the Taegu City Government's (TCG) efforts to\n            improve the transportation system within Taegu City through\n            the construction of a major urban expressway and associated\n            road investments, introduction and application of Traffic\n            System Management (TSM) techniques, and strengthening of\n            TCG's transportation planning capacity.  To that end,\n            the project includes: (a) land acquisition and construction\n            of the Shinchon Expressway, connecting roads, and associated\n            bridge widenings.  The project furthermore entails (b) civil\n            works for intersection improvements, pedestrian facilities,\n            and other TSM and safety improvements, and the provision of\n            traffic signals and other equipment; as well as (c) advisory\n            services for transportation planning and construction\n            supervision.  The main benefits of the project would be\n            reduced congestion and improved traffic flows within Taegu\n            City, especially in and around the Central Business District."}, "docdt": "1988-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
