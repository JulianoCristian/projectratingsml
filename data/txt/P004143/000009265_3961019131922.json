for\n            the Republic of Korea achieved an overall satisfactory\n            outcome. Despite some postponements, the project made a\n            substantial contribution toward institutional development\n            and led to an increase in traffic efficiency, capacity, and\n            safety. The project applied transportation system management\n            techniques and constructed the Shinchon Expressway and\n            associated links. It also strengthened the Taegu City\n            Government's transportation planning and traffic\n            management capacity. Implementation of the project was\n            satisfactory. Delays occurred due to land acquisition\n            issues, but the project loan was fully disbursed and closed\n            as scheduled. Sustainability of project benefits is likely,\n            as there is every indication that the transportation system\n            management techniques have been adopted and will continue to\n            gain force in Taegu. One possible threat to sustainability\n            is that traffic volumes continue to increase faster than\n            forecasts, but the planned development of a subway system\n            should mitigate this risk. Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Bank staff contributed to project success\n            by recognizing the Government as a mature and capable\n            institution. Borrower performance was satisfactory, as the\n            Government successfully adapted to a challenging period of\n            unanticipated rapid economic growth and sudden increase in\n            land prices. The main lesson learned regards severely\n            underestimating the cost and time of relocating local\n            families affected by the construction. The Bank must ensure\n            that the cost and scheduling of land acquisition are\n            carefully estimated at appraisal when projects include land\n            acquisition as a controlling element of implementation."}, "docdt": "1995-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
