Block I: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The project seeks to improve the availability and quality of economic and social infrastructure services in small
municipalities and villages in the West Bank and Gaza (WBG). This objective would be pursued through labor intensive
approaches which would increase temporary job opportunities in WBG for unskilled and semi-skilled Palestinian
laborers.
....... .......... ........................................  ............I.......... .........................................................-....................... ...................... ..............................................................
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
The project design builds on Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR) experience
with the emergency Employment Generation Program (1996) by channeling small amounts of funds (grants) to
communities in a demand-driven, efficient, and transparent manner. The project involves a high level of community
participation in the identification and implementation of infrastructure microprojects, transparent decision making
regarding resource use, and attention to operation and maintenance. A capacity building component to support
management, budgeting, and accounting skills in local government units and contractors, and to enable them to
participate in competitive bidding, is also proposed.
Donors have expressed interest in cofinancing the project but firm commitments are yet to be made. The table below
assumes that cofinancing in the amount of US$ 17 million would be forthcoming. In the event that cofinancing is less
than anticipated, the number of microprojects would be reduced. The staff of the Project Management Unit (PECDAR)
devoted to the CDP would also be expanded or contracted in accordance with the number of microprojects to be
financed.

costing not more than US$150,000 each, identified and
implemented by local government unit (LGUs) with a minimum
of 25% labor content, using local contractors, suppliers and
laborers. Such works may include improvements in water supply,
sanitation, solid waste management, and rehabilitation of local
clinics, primary schools and feeder roads.

provide training to LGUs to ensure good quality microproject
proposals, responsiveness to competitive bidding, and an
increased capacity to plan, manage and implement infrastructure
investment, operations and maintenance. Training to small local
contractors to participate in competitive bidding procedures and
provide supporting documentation for payment, would also be
delivered through subcontracting arrangements. Subcontracts with
local firms to help LGUs produce technical studies and designs.
- Total       30.0            100
3. Benefits and target population:
People in at least 250 villages and small municipalities would benefit from the resulting improvements in the availability,
regularity or quality of basic services and from greater economic activity due to demand for local labor, materials,
contractors and suppliers. Priority would be given to: (i) villages and small municipalities which have not received
microprojects through the Employment Generation Program or other donor financed schemes in the last two years; (ii)
the poorest villages and small municipalities according to data available from a recent living standards monitoring survey

Country: West Bank and Gaza                                           Project Title: Community Development Project
and the Ministry of Social Affairs; and (iii) within these villages, priority would be given to social infrastructure such as
schools, clinics, water supply and sanitation which are expected to have a high social return. Families of approximately
24,000 laborers would benefit directly through wages (laborers hired for 26 equivalent workdays).
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: April 1997- January 1999
Implementing agencies: Communities would identify microprojects, contribute to their costs, and be involved with
implementation through their local government units (LGUs), namely municipalities, village councils and village
committees. Communities would put forward microproject proposals in accordance with the Operational Manual which
has been prepared by PECDAR, with inputs from the Ministry of Local Government, and which the Bank has reviewed
and found satisfactory. The Operational Manual details the organizational and procedural aspects for submission of
proposals, selection, implementation and monitoring of microprojects. PECDAR's Project Management Offices (PMO)
would consider microprojects according to criteria stipulated in the Operational Manual (which has been reviewed within
the Bank and found satisfactory). After approval of a microproject, the receiving LGU would sign a Standard
Microproject Agreement with PECDAR stipulating the use of the funds and the roles and responsibilities of the LGU,
community, PECDAR, daily supervisor, and other ministries or government bodies. The LGU would also enter into a
contract with a daily supervisor for the duration of the microproject to provide on-site supervision and report to an
assigned PECDAR follow-up engineer. For contracts under US$50,000, the LGU would undertake procurement of goods
and materials, with supervision and guidance by the assigned PECDAR follow-up engineer. Contracts above US$50,000
would be packaged by PECDAR's PMOs for national competitive bidding. LGUs would be involved in monitoring
progress and quality of work prior to payment of suppliers, contractors, and the daily supervisor.
Project coordination: PECDAR would be responsible for overall project coordination and management. Maintenance
of the special account, payment of contractors, accounting, auditing and reporting would be under the central PECDAR
office. Appraisal, procurement and implementation of microprojects would be supervised by PECDAR's Project
Management Offices (one each in Gaza and West Bank). The PMOs would coordinate with government ministries to
ensure proposed microprojects are in compliance with ministry planning, norms and standards, operation budgets, and to
avoid duplication of funding. Ministry norms and standards of common microprojects would be updated prior to project
effectiveness and compiled in an Engineer's Handbook. Qualified firms or individuals would be subcontracted to deliver
training to LGUs and contractors and prepare technical designs to be financed under the third component.
Project oversight: PECDAR would be principally responsible for project oversight and would report to the Government
and the World Bank on progress and impact of the CDP.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: PECDAR would be responsible for accounting and
administrative matters. In the present PECDAR structure, accounting and Management Information System (MIS)
functions are centralized in the central PECDAR office. The proposed project would finance computers, technical
assistance and training to link the accounting system with the MIS to facilitate consolidation of financial information.
Resources would also be provided to upgrade the accounting system in Gaza and ensure linkage with the central
PECDAR office. Upgrading of the accounting and MIS, and linkage of the two systems, would be done during the first
six months of the project. The central PECDAR office would maintain the special account, make requests for
replenishment, conduct internal audits, and make arrangements for semi-annual external audits by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA. Technical reviews would be undertaken twice a year by external reviewers acceptable to IDA.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Regular and comprehensive monitoring and evaluation are important for
success of the CDP. A comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system comprising microproject supervision, the MIS,
regular reports, World Bank supervision, and special impact studies would be used for the CDP to serve as feedback
mechanisms to project management and to monitor key indicators of performance, progress and impact. Microproject
supervision would be done by PECDAR engineers who would report regularly on progress of individual investments.
The MIS would enable PECDAR to monitor key indicators of performance, progress and impact of microprojects, such

as labor content, time to pay contractors, and number of beneficiaries. The MIS would also signal cost overruns and
microprojects experiencing unusual delays. Reports generated by the MIS would be the basis of monthly and quarterly
reports by PECDAR to IDA and the Government. During the first six months, PECDAR would report every two months
on progress and obstacles; thereafter, reports would be submitted on a quarterly basis. Reports would highlight progress
achieved against targets, problems to be solved, and options to transcend difficulties. The World Bank would contribute
to monitoring and feedback through its supervision missions, and through Bank staff located in the Resident Mission.
IDA supervision would include site visits and reviews of 10-15 microprojects per mission to ensure compliance with the
Operations Manual and advise on project management. The project would also enable PECDAR to subcontract local
researchers to undertake an annual beneficiary impact assessment of a sample of microprojects. The assessment would
examine impact of the microprojects on incomes of laborers and capacity of LGUs, community participation in the
microproject cycle, operation and maintenance, impact on the poor and vulnerable groups, and attitudes of beneficiaries
toward microprojects. The lessons learnt would be used by PECDAR to improve project management and operating
procedures.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project
The project objective is consistent with the Bank Group strategy outlined in "Replenishing the Trust Fund for the West
Bank and Gaza", December 1996, which emphasizes restoring and further developing basic and social infrastructure and
alleviating poverty.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The Palestinian Government strategy compliments the Bank's strategy and focuses on infrastructure improvements and
private sector development. The main components of the strategy as detailed in the "Palestinian Public Investment
Program and Funding Needs for 1997 ", presented at the Consultative Group Meeting of November 1996, deal with
investment in physical infrastructure and the social sector. In addition, the Palestinians have requested donor support for
the Palestinian Authority's budget and employment generation initiatives. Infrastructure rehabilitation and restoration in
major urban centers are being addressed by on-going Bank and donor funded operations. However, with the exception of
the Employment Generation Programs, the infrastructure needs of small municipalities and villages have largely been
untouched by post-Oslo donor assistance. The main constraints on infrastructure improvements in small municipalities
and villages are (a) availability and predictability of investment and maintenance funding; (b) limited capacity in the
local consulting and contracting industry; and (c) lack of capacity in LGUs for investment planning, financing and
monitoring.
... ..... .......................................................................................................................................................................................................... .............. .................... .......
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project:
The proposed project would address the first constraint by making funds available for rehabilitation and restoration and
by requiring that each microproject include a simplified operation and maintenance plan and budget to aid communities
in planning preventive maintenance and other future costs. The project addresses the second constraint by making it
possible for small contractors to receive training and technical assistance to increase their knowledge of competitive
bidding procedures and to improve their basic management and budgeting skills. The project addresses the third
constraint by providing technical assistance and training to LGUs. The project would also encourage greater community
participation in prioritization of infrastructure needs and cost sharing which would improve accountability of LGUs and
increase the likelihood for microprojects to be sustained.
................................~~~~~~~~~...........................................................................................................................................................................................
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Alternative 1: Support employment generation using direct-hire, highly labor-intensive (90% labor content) municipal
works such as street cleaning, painting, etc.
Reasons for Rejection: Experience from the Holst-funded Employment Generation Program shows that "make-work"
labor intensive schemes, though creating temporary job opportunities, do not build economically viable capital stock in
villages and small municipalities. Furthermore, there is little support from the Borrower or donors for purely labor-
intensive works which are generally low in sustainable development impact.

Alternative 2: Implement microprojects through NGOs.
Reasons for Rejection: Implementation of microprojects by communities through their Local Government Units builds
up the institutional structure and promotes local ownership. Furthermore, PECDAR has successfully demonstrated the
capacity to implement similar projects through the EGP. Additionally, a separate Bank operation is being planned to
support Palestinian NGOs providing social services to the poor and marginalized communities.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Lessons emerging from the Employment Generation Program (EGP) and other interventions, which are reflected in the
design of the proposed project, include the following: (a) microprojects responding to locally-identified needs have
generated community contributions and enhanced accountability of local governments in project resource use; (b)
transparent decision making in LGUs and project implementation units has been critical to public support for programs;
(c) the need for training and technical assistance to implementing agencies; and (e) in the case of the EGP, the majority
of microproject resources have gone directly to communities.
Among the improvements included in the proposed project design are: (a) community contribution to microproject costs
would be a requirement for project selection in order to strengthen participation and ownership; (b) greater information
sharing and stakeholder participation to strengthen local ownership and improve transparency; (c) provision of technical
assistance to LGUs through a demand driven training program. In addition, the project is designed to ensure: (d) clarity
of roles and responsibilities among PECDAR, Ministries and LGUs; (e) project selection criteria based on capacity and
commitment to operation and maintenance.

11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
PECDAR formally sought support from the World Bank to finance more than 450 infrastructure microprojects identified
by municipalities and village councils, totaling about US$30 million. Subsequently PECDAR, in close cooperation with
the Ministry of Local Governments, established task teams to prepare the project. These teams have been largely
responsible for the preparation of the CDP Operational Manual which has been reviewed and found acceptable to the
Bank.
............................................................................................................................................................................................................................ ................... .. ...........
12. Value added of Bank support:
As the administrator of the Holst Fund, the Bank assisted with the implementation of the emergency Employment
Generation Program from March 1996, as access of Palestinian labor to Israel was temporarily restricted and
unemployment had risen dramatically in WBG. Over 50,000 temporary jobs (15 to 26 day cycles) were created mainly
through labor intensive direct hire jobs (such as street cleaning, painting, etc.). The EGP experience showed that the
Borrower and donors are increasingly interested in moving away from labor-intensive direct hire jobs that do not add to
the capital stock, toward works that increase capital assets and at the same time, create job opportunities in WBG.
Furthermore, chronic unemployment in WBG is likely to be an issue irrespective of the closures. Hence, the proposed
Bank intervention reflects the shift in approach towards meeting community infrastructure needs as well as generating
jobs. The Bank brings to bear in the project its global experience in helping to design social funds which can be an
effective approach in achieving the objectives held by the borrower and Bank for the project. Additionally, the Bank
maintains an effective link with the Borrower for policy-guidance and institutional development in the infrastructure
sector through its dialogue and ongoing investment lending program of which the proposed project is a part.

13. Economic Assessment        2    Cost-Benefit Analysis:            n  Cost                Z   Other:
NPV=US$          million;           Effectiveness
ERR=    %                           Analysis:
Given the nature and size of projects and given that the CDP would be demand driven, no detailed economic analysis can
be undertaken ex ante. However, basic economic indicators such as costs/job created or costs /beneficiary, as well as cost
benefit analysis where possible (with applicable caveats), would be estimated during appraisal of individual
microprojects, as stipulated in the Operational Manual. Furthermore, a unit cost database would be developed and
regularly updated to aid in preparation and monitoring of budgets for microprojects.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)   NPV=US$                 million; FRR=          %
The proposed credit of US$10 million would cover 33% of the total project costs. Approximately 90% of the IDA Credit
would finance civil works and the remaining 10% would finance goods, services and supplemental operating costs. The
national contribution includes community contributions to microprojects of US$2.7 million or 9% of the project costs, and
the government contribution of US$0.5 million or 1% of the project costs. Cofinanciers are expected to provide the
remaining 57% (US$17 million) of the project costs.
Since the Bank will disburse against expenditures net of taxes and duties, microprojects will not be implemented unless
provisions are made for national contributions. Most LGUs (small municipalities and village councils) are financially
weak. Water and electricity charges are their only means of revenue generation, and weak accounting and budgeting
capacity inhibits determination of the financial positions of most LGUs. Consequently, LGU capacity to contribute to
project investment costs and operation and maintenance (O & M) is limited. Hence the national contribution to
investment and 0 & M costs will have to come from community members themselves. This is not expected to be an issue
as assessment of the EGP has shown many instances of community contribution to project costs even though community
contributions and commitment to operation and maintenance were not required.

15. Technical Assessment:
A technical assessment was made of microprojects financed through the EGP and administered by PECDAR. Under the
EGP, a total of 400 microprojects have been completed or are under implementation. The common types of microprojects
have been road rehabilitation, sidewalk tiling and retaining walls, addition of classrooms to schools, rehabilitation of
health clinics and hospitals, and extension or rehabilitation of water supply, waste water and sewage

lines (detailed assessment in projectfiles, see Annex 7). The main findings of the technical assessment are:
*  The engineering standards of completed projects vary from microproject to microproject. In general, sidewalk tiling
and school maintenance and classroom construction have been of acceptable professional standards while problems
have been observed with boundary walls, retaining walls, water supply and sewage lines, road and street maintenance.
Problems observed are mainly due to lack of knowledge among contractors and supervising engineers of technical
standards and specifications; lack of skills and experience for road design, construction and maintenance.
*  In some cases, microprojects were not completed according to the project plans due to project cost overruns. Lack of
unit prices for the costing of works and lack of project monitoring systems have contributed to cost overruns.
*  Safety conditions for laborers and the public at work sites should be improved. Lack of awareness of acceptable safety
conditions by daily supervisors and site supervisors contributes to the problem.
*  There has been a lack of technical experience and capacity among village council engineers in preparation of
microproject proposals, especially in preparing technical designs. Villages without engineers have subcontracted
preparation work or have found engineers within the village to contribute expertise in preparation of the proposal.
Based on the technical review, the following measures have been integrated into the CDP:
*  A Engineers Handbook will be compiled including technical designs and standard drawings consistent with the use of
local materials and labor.
*  Simplified technical specifications and standards for different kinds of works would be updated and included in the
Engineer's Handbook, which would be available to PECDAR engineers and LGU engineers.
* Unit costs for major items in Bills of Quantities would be updated regularly by PECDAR and recorded in the MIS.
* Guidelines for site organization and safety conditions would be described in the Engineer's Handbook and reviewed
during Technical Reviews.
* Skills development of appraisal engineers would be undertaken to improve their ability to do an integrated appraisal
to avoid incomplete microprojects and cost overruns.
* Simplified standard bidding documents and microproject proposal forms acceptable to IDA would be adopted in
Arabic.
* Roles of daily supervisors, which are often times municipality or village council engineers, would be specified prior
to microproject implementation in the Standard Microproject Agreement between PECDAR and the receiving LGU.
*  Training and technical assistance would be made available to daily supervisors.
*  The methodology for pre-qualification of contractors would be revised to create an incentive system for contractors to
perform good quality work in order to bid on additional contracts.
I     titi o a   e      :...........................
An institutional assessment was undertaken during project preparation, of PECDAR as the executing agency and project
management unit for the proposed CDP, and of local government units as they would be responsible for identification,
preparation, and implementation of individual microprojects to be financed under the CDP (detailed assessment is in
projectfiles; see Annex 7).
PECDAR
The institutional assessment included examination of PECDAR's administrative organization, management roles and
functions, staffing levels, operating procedures and tools and technology that would be used to implement the CDP,
namely the accounting system and the Management Information System (MIS). The assessment concluded that
PECDAR's capacity to manage the project was generally satisfactory, but that moderate modifications and clarification of
the roles, organizational structure, and procedures used by PECDAR for identification, preparation and implementation of
microprojects are needed.
Based on the institutional assessment, the following recommendations have been incorporated into the proposed CDP:

Country: West Bank and Gaza                                              Project Title: Community Development Project
*  The Interministerial Steering Committee in Gaza would be continued, its roles defined in the CDP Operational
Manual, and its membership broadened to include more stakeholder views, such as women's charitable organizations.
*  Interministerial cooperation would be improved under the CDP through the following measures: (a) holding a project
launch workshop with participation from government ministries and agencies to enable sharing of information on the
CDP and improve transparency of decision making; (b) ministerial review of the CDP Operational Manual; (c)
dissemination of monthly and quarterly reports on the CDP; (d) updating specifications and norms for common
microprojects (see Technical Assessment); and (e) conducting regular consultations with ministries during regular
Bank supervision of the CDP.
*  An Operational Manual specifying the roles of the PMOs, LGUs and the MLG would be prepared. Consensus
between the MLG and PECDAR was reached on the means to deliver the training component for LGUs, and
agreement was reached to share monthly and quarterly reports of the CDP. Development of the Local Government
Program Management and Training and the Local Government Operations and Maintenance Programming under the
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project would be monitored under World Bank supervision in order to plan for
adoption of these modules and programs to village councils.
*  The recommendations of the MIS specialist for enhancement of the MIS and linkage with the accounting system has
been estimated in the CDP budget and would be completed within the first six months of project effectiveness. The
requisite inputs include technical assistance, acquisition of software and hardware, and training of existing or newly
hired PECDAR staff.
*  Professionals skilled in community development and social research would be recruited by PECDAR and resources
would be spent to sensitize and develop the skills of technical staff at the PMOs in community participation.
Local Government Units
Local Govemment Units (LGUs) in the West Bank and Gaza have a long history of providing public goods and services.
The local government system is composed of 31 municipalities (5 in Gaza and 26 in West Bank), 103 village councils and
some 400 villages that have "project committees" composed usually of representatives of families in the village. The local
government system is currently undergoing transition. Legally, municipalities have well-established service delivery and
regulatory functions including electricity, water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, local roads, libraries, parks
and recreation, land use planning, and business and professional licensing. Village councils are elected but lack the broad
range of functions and revenue raising options of municipalities and are mainly made up of representatives of families
living in the village. Small municipalities and village councils either have an engineer and an accountant on the payroll or
share professionals with nearby communities. In some cases, villages subcontract or ask for volunteers from the
community to perform professional work for the community.
The main findings of the institutional assessment of the LGUs involved in the EGP include:
*  While LGUs were not obligated to contribute to the costs of microprojects, they often times assumed the expense in
preparing technical designs. There are also instances in which communities either directly or through the LGU budget
purchased land, contributed labor, building materials, and operating materials and supplies.
*  LGUs were asked to hire a daily supervisor to act as a foreman in the case of direct hire and as a daily supervisor for
contractors. His salary was paid by PECDAR for the duration of the microproject. In most cases, the daily supervisor
was the engineer of the LGU.
*  LGUs do not appear to have difficulty in opening bank accounts to receive microproject grants. Most LGUs have
existing bank accounts.
*  The skills and experience of daily supervisors are frequently limited (see Technical Assessment), and there has been a
lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities under the EGP microprojects.
*  Frequently, LGUs submitted proposals for investments in which they did not have requisite licenses and permits,
which precluded PECDAR's consideration of the proposal. Water projects and in particular digging of wells are
frequently the top priority of LGUs but licenses from Israeli authorities are frequently a bottleneck.
*  LGUs need written guidelines and simplified procedures for participating in procurement (e.g. paying laborers and
suppliers) and in providing requisite documentation.

Mindful of these findings, the proposed CDP was designed to incorporate the following recommendations:
*   Instructions would be provided in the Operational Manual for estimating community contributions, especially in
monetizing in-kind contributions.
* Microproject costs would include salary for daily supervisors, not to exceed three percent of the microproject cost.
* Written instructions would be provided in Arabic to LGUs on how to do procurement and pay contractors and
supervisors, and provide receipts and supporting documentation. This information would be contained in attachments
to the Standard Microproject Agreement to be signed between PECDAR and the receiving LGU.
* PECDAR engineers would be trained/retrained in procurement in order to increase their support and oversight
capacity.
* The roles of daily supervisors and site engineers would be specified in the Standard Microproject Agreement.
* Promotional work would specify the criteria for approval of microprojects, including the necessity for licenses and
permits.
* Training seminars for LGUs in budgeting, management, and accounting have been budgeted under the third project
component to build the capacity of LGUs. These and other modules would be offered in response to demand from
LGUs.

17. Social Assessment:
To strengthen operations of the proposed CDP, a participatory social assessment was carried out by a team of Palestinian
social scientists of selected microprojects implemented by PECDAR under the EGP (detailed assessments in projectfiles,
see Annex 7). The tools used by the researchers were in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with community
members, officials of the Palestinian Authority, and local social scientists). The main findings of the social assessment
include:
* Beneficiaries are largely satisfied with the positive impact of microprojects on their living conditions.
* Communities typically contribute to the cost of microprojects in labor and cash. Contributions range from 5-10
percent of microproject cost in poor communities to 25-35 percent in better off communities. Wealthy community
members often contribute significant amounts of cash whereas poor members make little or no cash contribution.
* For many microprojects, communities assume responsibility for operation and maintenance costs other than wages,
which are covered by government institutions.
* The population is in need of greater information on the objectives and procedures of the EGP. Generally, community
members outside the village councils learn about the microprojects only after decision-making regarding microproject
selection has been completed.
*  Most microprojects are identified by village council representatives with limited consultation with community
members regarding needs and priorities. This has been in part due to perceived time constraints in submitting
proposals to PECDAR. Consequently, some microprojects have not always reflected the most urgent needs and
priorities of the communities.
*  There is a need to improve the transparency of operations during microproject implementation, especially to better
inform communities on progress in physical works, use of funds, hiring procedures for laborers and procurement of
goods and services.
*  The targeting strategy for the EGP has been to reach every village and municipality with a microproject, regardless of
poverty levels. Consequently, with exception of the positive employment effects, poor and vulnerable people have not
benefited proportionally from microprojects.
Based on these findings, the following recommendations were made and incorporated into project design:
*  In order to increase community participation, local government units would be encouraged to call open community
meetings and to consult with women and poor to discuss priorities in the community and the objectives of the CDP.
They would also be encouraged to establish microproject management committees which could be an elected sub-
committee of the village council and include representatives from the village council. This approach would increase
information sharing on use of funds and other microproject related activities and for mobilizing and collecting the
community contribution.

*  Microproject appraisal would integrate criteria related to community participation, such as holding of community
meetings, establishment of microproject management committees, inclusion of women, youth and the poor in
microprojects committees, and consultations with vulnerable groups.
*  Social researchers would be hired or subcontracted by PECDAR to join technical evaluators during microproject
appraisal to investigate the means and depth of community participation. Engineers would also receive training in
social mobilization and social appraisal.
*  Beneficiary assessment would be carried out annually of a sample of microprojects to gain beneficiary feedback on
microprojects and the CDP.
*  Promotional activities to inform the general public of the objectives, criteria and procedures for the CDP would be
carried out. Activities would include mass media campaign, dissemination of a brochure, and information
dissemination through existing local government networks.
*  Levels of poverty would be integrated into the targeting strategy for the CDP to increase the likelihood that a high
proportion of CDP resources would flow to poorer communities (see Annex 2, detailed project description).
18. Environmental Assessment:        Environmental Category    Jj   A     0  B        g  C
The small projects implemented through the EGP programs generally had positive environmental impacts. However, there
has been no systematic environmental screening of microprojects. In the CDP, microprojects would be appraised for
environmental impact in accordance with the Operational Manual. Microprojects with negative impacts would either
include mitigation plans or, in cases of serious environmental impacts, be excluded from funding.

20. Sustainability:
Community participation and contribution to the costs of microprojects (in kind or cash) are envisaged to increase and
thereby to increase the likelihood that they will be maintained and sustained in the long term. A completed
ownership proposal package would include a simplified plan and budget to operate and conduct preventive maintenance
and minor repairs on the proposed infrastructure to be rehabilitated. Appraisal engineers would be trained to verify the
soundness of the plan and to advise communities on low cost options for preventive maintenance. Respective ministries
would be expected to review microprojects prior to approval by PECDAR indicating that resources are available for
operating costs. Technical staff of LGUs, especially engineers and accountants, would have access to training in order to
increase their skills for operation and preventive maintenance.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - US$27.6 million (92% of total cost of project)
Implementation of at least 250 infrastructure microprojects, costing not more than US$150,000,
identified and implemented by local government unit (LGUs) with a minimum of 25% labor content, using local
contractors, suppliers and laborers. Such works may include improvements in water supply, sanitation, solid
waste management, and rehabilitation of local clinics, primary schools and feeder roads. An absence of
cofinancing would result in a consequent reduction in the number of microprojects financed.
Existing procedures used by the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction
(PECDAR) to approve and supervise microprojects under the emergency Employment Generation Programs
would be adapted and modified to meet the development objectives. Among the modifications would be to: (a)
incorporate cost sharing by LGUs and communities; (b) emphasize community participation in microproject
identification and implementation; (c) make provision of operation and maintenance essential criteria for
approval; and (d) develop a transparent targeting strategy. The criteria for approval of microprojects and
procedures to be followed for targeting, identification, appraisal, approval, implementation, supervision,
monitoring and evaluation of microprojects would be detailed in a project Operational Manual. Microprojects
would follow a microproject cycle, which would include the following stages.
Targeting Strategy
The CDP would have a limited amount of funds while the need for infrastructure rehabilitation in small
municipalities and villages is great. In order to prioritize the use of the limited funds, a targeting strategy would
be applied for the implementation of the CDP. Priority would be given to those proposals from communities that
in the two years prior to the launch of the CDP have not received a project under a World Bank or other donor
project. (This is estimated to be about 50 communities.) Once these communities have been covered, remaining
funds would be targeted at the poorest villages and small municipalities. A study has been undertaken by the
Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute and the World Bank to assess living standards in the WBG. These
data and others would be considered in order to rank communities by poverty and vulnerability.
Identification and Preparation
PECDAR has already received many proposals from local government units in response to the EGP. The
targeting strategy would narrow the pool of proposals that could be considered for financing under the CDP.
Communities that qualify under the targeting methodology and that have already submitted proposals would be
asked to identify which one of the proposals is the priority. All proposals would have to include information on
how the proposal was identified, how the community will contribute to the cost, and a simplified plan and budget
for operation and preventive maintenance. All proposals would be reviewed by the Ministry of Local
Government to verify consistency with plans and to avoid duplication of funding from other sources. Technical
designs and specifications would be available from PECDAR to communities to help them in preparing
proposals.
Proposals that meet the following criteria would be eligible for appraisal:
from a targeted community



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 3
* microproject cost does not exceed US$150,000
* microproject is among the typology of CDP microprojects (as stipulated in the Operational Manual)
* proposal package is complete (with technical designs or sketches, bill of quantities, copies of written
licenses and permits for proposed work, explanation of how the community participated in
identification, will contribute to costs, and attached Simplified Plan and Budget for Operation and
Preventive Maintenance).
Appraisal
The PMOs would be responsible for appraisal of microprojects. A site visit would be taken, during which
the appraisal engineer would:
* recommend any changes to the proposal so as to better meet the appraisal criteria
* verify and revise the statement of current damages to the existing infrastructure facility
* verify and revise the bill of quantities based on these changes and in accordance with the PECDAR Unit Cost
Database
* verify the technical, social, institutional, financial, and environmental criteria in accordance with the
Operational Manual.
Community Contribution
A minimum of ten percent of the microproject cost would be required from the community for
microproject approval. Contributions may be in cash or in-kind. Whenever possible, contributions would be
made in cash. Contributions in-kind would be verified and valued by the appraisal engineer. The amount, type
and timing of delivery of the community contribution would be stipulated in the Standard Microproject
Agreement between the requesting LGU and PECDAR. Examples of community contribution include technical
designs for preparation of the microprojects, construction materials and equipment needed for microproject
implementation which can be easily monetized, and equipment and supplies needed for operation that can be
easily monetized (e.g. desks, textbooks).
Sustainability
A completed Microproject Proposal Package would include a Simplified Budget and Plan for Operation
and Preventive Maintenance for the proposed microproject from the community. During appraisal, the appraisal
engineer would review the budget and plan with the LGU and ensure that the costs can be met by the LGU,
govemment ministries or agencies, and cost sharing by users or members of the community. The appraisal
engineer would make recommendations to the LGU on technical or other steps that can be taken to minimize
operating or future maintenance costs. Written documentation would be required from the respective ministry to
indicate that resources are available for operating costs as stipulated in the Simplified Budget and Plan for
Operation and Preventive Maintenance.
Approval
Upon completion of the appraisal, the appraisal engineer would submit a completed package to the PMO
along with his/her recommendation. The appraisal engineer may recommend approval, rejection or delay, with
explanation of its recommendation. IDA would review for no-objection the first 30 microprojects.



ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 3
Procurement and Implementation
The PMO Procurement Department would determine the appropriate mode of procurement in accordance
with the Operational Manual. Microprojects costing US$50,000 and above would be packaged and tendered in
accordance with IDA procurement guidelines (National Competitive Bidding). For microprojects less than
US$50,000, LGUs would use National Shopping or Force Account, with supervision by PMOs.
Upon approval of a proposal, a Standard Microproject Agreement would be signed between the PMO
and the LGU specifying the roles and responsibilities of the PMO, LGU, daily supervisor, and any other parties
in microproject implementation. The community contribution would be deposited in the LGU local bank account
prior to start of microproject implementation. The LGU would be authorized to hire a daily supervisor for the
duration of the microproject, who would report to the PMO site engineer. The LGU would designate one
representative to verify the quality and progress of work, goods and services prior to payment of contractors,
suppliers and the daily supervisor.
Completion and Handover
Upon completion of the microproject, a Completion Certificate would be signed by the receiving LGU
and the PMO verifying that the microproject is satisfactory and complete. The daily supervisor would also
receive a certificate attesting to his/her good quality work.
Project Component 2 - US$ 1.9 million (6% of total cost of project)
Supplemental operating costs, vehicles, communications and other equipment, training and impact
studies needed by PECDAR for project execution and management. In the event that co-financing does not
materialize, the operating costs would be reduced according to the levels needed for supervising and managing
fewer microprojects.
This component would also finance technical assistance, hardware, software and training to upgrade the
Management Information System and to link the accounting system with the MIS. A Resident Technical Advisor
would be provided for the first six months of project effectiveness. Consulting services would be provided to
undertake an annual Beneficiary Impact Assessment as part of the monitoring and evaluation process. Training
of PECDAR staff in computers, comprehensive appraisal, procurement, community participation, and financial
management would also be provided through local training institutes, tailored training courses and workshops,
technical assistance, and study tours. Financial audits by external auditors acceptable to IDA would be done
twice a year. Technical Reviews and procurement reviews would be conducted every six months. Project
management costs are estimated at six percent of the total project costs.
Project Component 3 - US$ 0.5 million (2% of total cost of project)
Subcontract agreements with qualified firms or individuals to provide training to LGUs to ensure good
quality microproject proposals, responsiveness to competitive bidding, and an increased capacity to plan, manage
and implement infrastructure investment, operations and maintenance. Training would be provided through
qualified firms or individuals and delivered on a clustered geographic basis. Training to contractors to participate
in competitive bidding procedures and provide supporting documentation for payment would also be delivered
through subcontracting arrangements. Almost half of the component resources would be used to subcontract
local firms to prepare technical studies for complex microprojects. An absence of co-financing would result in
fewer actual resources devoted to institution building, though the proportion of total project costs devoted to this
component would remain the same.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
Procurement would be in accordance with IDA Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995 and as revised
in January 1996), using standardized local bidding procedures and contract forms in the Operational Manual.
Packaging of small projects would be undertaken only when there are significant implementation deficiencies
present. The size of the Civil Works would range between US$20,000 to US$100,000 and will not attract foreign
competition. Therefore National Competitive Bidding procedures would be used for contracts greater than
US$50,000. For contracts costing US$50,000, or less, National Shopping would be the norn. In cases where
National Shopping is not feasible, "Force Account" would be the alternative. World Bank bidding documents in
Arabic (when available) would be used for National Competitive Bidding. Procurement of goods would be
procured through National Shopping for goods less than US$50,000 and International Shopping for goods
costing over US$50,000. National Shopping would be based on at least three quotations; International Shopping
on three quotations from at least two countries.
Procurement of consulting services would be in accordance with Guidelines for the Use of Consultants
by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981).
Procurement seminars/workshops catered to microprojects would be held in Gaza and West Bank
during the first year of project operation. PECDAR would be responsible for monitoring procurement activities
of project beneficiaries and compliance of contractors and suppliers with contract provisions.
Incremental operating expenses of the project management unit including salaries, rent, operation and
maintenance of vehicles will be financed through the project.

Diabursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
The project funds are expected to be disbursed over a period of two years and completed before January
1999. The closing date for the Bank loan would be June 1999. It is estimated that PECDAR would be able to
disburse at average of US$1.0 million per month. All IDA funded disbursements towards civil works are
expected to be completed in 12 months from day of project effectiveness. To facilitate disbursement against
eligible expenditures, PECDAR would establish a Special Account under terms and conditions satisfactory to
IDA. An initial deposit of the $2 million will be made into the Special Account from the IDA credit. PECDAR
would submit replenishment applications for the Special Account on a monthly basis.
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs):
-     all contracts under civil works
