The main\n            lessons address: 1) the adequacy of beneficiaries\n            representation, whose participation was monitored through\n            project committees on the basis of inclusion, with\n            representatives from all social groups, including\n            women's groups, youth, and poor families; 2) social\n            interventions, suggesting that an independent implementing\n            agency should manage the program, with strong leadership.\n            This would enhance transparency, and accountability to build\n            trust among beneficiaries, and communities, and, would in\n            turn be beneficial for promotional campaigns, crucial for\n            successful community based projects; 3) the critical aspects\n            of capacity building, and output indicators, which are time\n            consuming and difficult to measure, but, its absence caused\n            unnecessary implementation delays. However, workshops, and\n            training sessions based on participatory approaches proved\n            successful, and were highly regarded by beneficiaries; and,\n            4) ownership, and sustainability, which were enhanced\n            following the first detailed review of subprojects, when the\n            Bank placed responsibility on the implementing agency, who\n            met the challenge, and further suggested innovations on\n            appraisal, and monitoring, responsible as well for social,\n            and environmental criteria in project selection."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
