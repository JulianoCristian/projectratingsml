Dear Dr. Shetayyeh: 
 
Re: 
Community Development Project (TF024112) 
 Amendment to the Trust Fund Credit Agreement
We refer to the Trust Fund Credit Agreement dated April 2, 1997, for the Community 
Development Project (TF024112) between the International Development Association, acting as 
administrator of the Trust Fund for the Gaza and West Bank (the Administrator), and the Palestinian 
Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, an Agency of the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization (the Borrower), as amended (the “Credit Agreement”). We also refer to the 
discussions between the Borrower and the Administrator in which agreement has been reached to 
amend the Credit repayment dates. Accordingly, the Credit Agreement is hereby amended as 
follows:  
 
“Section 2.07. The Borrower shall repay the principal amount of the Credit in semi-
annual installments payable on each January 15 and July 15 commencing July 15, 2007, 
and ending January 15, 2037. Each installment to and including the installment payable on 
January 15, 2017, shall be one percent (1%) of such principal amount, and each installment 
thereafter shall be two percent (2%) of such principal amount.”  
 
All the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, not amended hereby, shall remain in 
full force and effect. 
 
We propose that this amendment to the Credit Agreement shall, upon confirmation in the 
manner indicated below, constitute an agreement between the Borrower and the Administrator. 
 
Sincerely, 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION 
acting as Administrator of the Gaza and West Bank Trust Fund
