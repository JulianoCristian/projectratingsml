ANKARA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL PROJECT
PROJECT COHPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This   report   reviews   the   preparation,   implementation   and
achievements of the Engineering Loan for the Ankara Air Pollution Control
Project (Loan S-15-TU), for which a loan of US$6 million was made to the
Governmeat of Turkey. The loan was signed in December 1979, became effective
in April 1980 and was closed in July 1984 after cancellation of US$4.45
million.     The  Environment  Protection  Undersecretariat  (BCM)  was  the
coordinating agency for the project.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle
East and North Africa Regional Office on the basis of a review of the
President's Report, the Loan Agreement, and other reports related to project
implementation.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaliation Department
(OED) but the Project was not audited by OED staff.
Following normal procedures, OED has sent copies of the draft PCR
to the Government and executing agencies for their comments. These comments
have been reproduced as Appendices A and B to the report.

LOAN S-15-TU
ANKARA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan S-15-TU, approved in November, 1979 for an amount of
US$6 million, was the Bank's first and so far only loan to Turkey in the
environmental  protection  sector.   The  Government  of  Turkey  was  the
borrower  and  the  Enyironment  Protection  Undersecretariat  was  the
coordinating agency.  Loan S-15-TU was expected to finance the estimated
foreign exchange requirements covering about 53% of total project cost of
US$11.25 million.
Th'e project was essentially experimental and research oriented
with the ultimate objective of reducing the air pollution in Ankara
through investigations of promising methods of manufacturing smokeless
fuel from lignite and through studies to identify alternative feasible
technologies.
The project contained five major components (i) alternative
technology study; (iii) start-up of the coking plant at Seyitomer; (iii)
development of a hot briquetting process; (iv) long term measures for
pollution reduction; and (v) immediate measures for pollution control
(para. 2.08).
The  loan  became  effective  in April  1980  (para.  3.01)!   The
implementation of the project did not proceed as envisaged since it became
obvious at an early stage that no feasible technological processes existed
for the man'ufacture of smokeless fuel based on the poor quality Turkish
lignite.   Neither  would  the  limited  available  lignite  --  after  a
subsequent decision to allocate the bulk of the available lignite from the
only feasible site to power generation -- be sufficient to justify the
development of a gasification plant (para. 3.03-3.06).



-v -
The implementation of the air pollution monitoring program
proceeded well and was eventually expanded (para. 3.07).
Total project costs were aubstantially reduced because of the
changes in scope of work.   They amounted to US$1.8 million, or 16% of the
appraisal estimate (para. 3.09).
The level of air pollution in Ankara remains high. Additional
studies are needed to identify practital measures to be taken in the
medium and long term.  Greater use of nati -al gas and low sulphur oil and
the construction of combined heat and power stations to meet the city's
energy needs may have to be considered as part of a balanced energy
program.

ANKARA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Engineering Loan of US$6.0 million equivalent was to be used
to finance the foreign exchange costs of consultant services, materials
and equipment in order to enable the reduction of the severe winter air
pollution in Ankara.
1.02     The borrower was the Republic of Turkey with the Environment
Protection Undersecretariat (BCM) acting as coordinating agency.  The
Turkish Coal Board (TKI) was responsible for the implementation of the
various project components with assistance to be provided by the Mineral
Research Institute (MTA) for the development of a hot briquetting
process. The Ministry of Health was given the responsibility for air
pollution control and monitoring.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project Origin and Preparation
2.01     Ankara, the capital of Turkey, situated at an altitude of 800
meters and surrounded by hills, suffers from harsh climatic conditions
during the winter. The topographical feature inhibits air circulation
causing the chimney smoke and car exhaust to hang over the city, creating
severe air pollution. Th s pollution causes general inconvenience and
discomfort and also serious respiratory and bronchial diseases among the
population. The peak levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the air had
exceeded 500 ug/m& more than once in some winters. By comparison WHO's
recommended limit is 150 ugIm3.  The pollution was mainly caused by the
use of highly sulphurous fuel oil and poor quality lignite for heating
purposes.
2.02     Turkish authorities had long been concerned with air pollution.
A NATO study during 1969-72 had led to the establishment of a monitoring
network and several consultants, under the auspices of the UNDP had given
advice to the Government, which, inter alia, had resulted in the creation
of BCM.
2.03     In the spring of 1978 the Government had asked the Bank for
assistance to finance a project to help reduce Ankara's air pollution.
In this coinection, preliminary feasibility studies had been submitted
for Bank review on (i) a hot briquetting plant (the MTA process) and (ii)



a district central heating scheme. The Bank, however, had concluded that
the proposed hot briquetting process was not sufficiently developed to
justify the construction of a full scale plant and that more
investigations would be required for a central heating system.
2.04     The Bank then recommended and the Government agreed to proceed
with an Engineering Loan to finance the design and construction of a
pilot plant for the MTA process, for modifications to TKI's coking plant
(para. 2.06) and for the implementation of studies to identify other
possible immediate and long-term solutions.
Project Objectives
2.05     The project objectives were to develop prom.ising methods of
manufacturing smokeless fuel from lignite and to investigate other
possible technologies, which could provide a more appropriate clean fuel
to reduce air pollution in Ankara in the future.
Project Description
2.06     A plant had been built for TKI at Seyitomer by two contractors
on a turnkey basis. The first part of the plant was meant to dry lignite
from an adjacent mine, while the second part, the carbonization unit, was
intended to produce coke. The plant had started operations in September
1976, but had been plagued with failures due to inexperience, power and
water supply cuts and technical problems.  Technical modifications were
introduced and an attempt at restarting the plant was made in August
1978. This proved unsuccessful due again to a series of power failures
and other technical problems. In September 1978 the start-up attempt had
been abandoned following an explosion in the air discharge area of the
carbonization unit. A Bank mission, supported by consulting specialists
then visited Turkey and concluded that problems encountered in the plant
start-up had not been exceptional for this type and size plant, using
Seyitomer lignite. Finally, as a condition of the loan, agreement had
been reached in mid-1979 on further modifications of the plant to put it
in operating condition.
2.07     The MTA hot briquetting process had been under development on a
laboratory scale to produce smokeless fuel by carbonizing crushed lignite
and briquetting the resulting char. The test plant had been designed to
produce 100-200 kg per hour. However, it had been operated only
intermittently and the results had not been conclusive.
2.08     The project, which was essentially experimental and research
oriented, was to have consisted of the following five components:
(a) Alternative Technology Study:   Consultant services to
include a feasibility study, detail design, tender
documents, and cost estimates to determine whether
internationally known and established processes could be
used to manufacture smokeless fuel using Turkish lignite;
this would then also be compared with the processes employed
at Seyitomer;



(b) Start-Up of TKI Coking Plant at Seyitomer:   Technical and
financial  ,sistance to catry out the necessary
modifications and stait-up operations on the existing coking
plant at Seyitomer;
(c) The MTA Hot Brigiuettin  Process:   Development of the MTA
hot briquettitng process by the provision of consuliant
services and funds for the design, construction and
operation of a pilot plant of 2-3 ton/hour capacity;
(d) Long-Term Measures for Pollution Reduction:   Consultant
services to review and evaluate the feasibility of producing
fuel gas using Turkish lignite as an appropriate long-term
measure, and to compare its economic viability with such
other alternatives as district heating, geothermal energy,
desulpherization of oil and distribution of propane gas; and
(e) Immediate Pollution Control Measures:   Procurement of
monitoring equipment for the implementation of a pollution
control program and such immediate pollution control
measures as could be taken.
Negotiations and Approval
2.09     Negotiations were conducted with the Government in July 1979.
On October 23, 1979, the Board approved a loan of US$6.0 million to the
Republic of Turkey and the Loan Agreement was signed on December 12, 1979.
Loan Covenants
2.10     The following main covenants were incorporated in the Loan
Agreement.
(a) In order to assist TKI in carrying out the Project, the
Borrower would cause TKI to employ consultants whose
qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment would be satisfactory to the Bank (Sec.3.02 [al);
(b) The Borrower would exchange views with the Bank with regard
to the recommendations of the study for the production of
fuel gas prior to committing itself to any investments (Sec.
3.07);
(c) The Borrower would, through BCM, implement a pollution
monitoring program satisfactory to the Bank and furnish
annual reports to the Bank on the results (Sec. 3.08); and
(d) The Borrower would cause MTA and TKI to enter into a
protocol not later than December 31, 1979, for the provision
of technical assistance by MTA to TKI in the preparation of
design, supervision of construction and operation of the
pilot plant for the hot briquetting process (Sec. 3.10).
Because of changes in project implementation, only the covenant given in
(c) above became applicable.



III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
Loan Effectiveness
3.01     There were two conditions of effectiveness, i.e. the-formal
ratification of the Loan Agreement and the execution of the TKI
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Borrower and TKI. The loan was
declared effective on April 4, 1980, or about four months after signing.
Project Implementation
3.02     The implementation of the five project components is summarized
below.
3.03     Alternative Technology Stud:   Terms of reference were prepared
and consultant proposals were received and evaluated in 1979. However,
the Turkish authorities were reluctant to proceed until an extensive
survey of existing literature was undertaken by MTA to better assess the
chances of success of such a study. MTA undertook the review and
concluded that there was no suitable process for manufacturing smokeless
fuel with the poor quality lignite available in Turkey. This was further
confirmed by the results which emanated from the Seyitomer and MTA
plants. The Bank concurred with the decision to drop this study.
3.04     The TKI Coking Plant at Seyitomer:   The plant modifications
agreed upon in mid-1979 (para. 2.06) were started, then interrupted over
a payment dispute between the contractors and TKI, the operator.
Modifications were eventually made and new attempts at starting up
operations carried out. However, shortcomings in the plant itself,
failures in power and water services and problems with the feedstock
continued to impede steady operation. By 1982 Bank consultants who
visited the site reported that the plant was operating and approaching
the design throughput level, although the size and strength of the
product were inadequate, the moisture too high and the volatile content
too low. Then, during commissioning in June 1982, another explosion
occurred in the carbonization unit causing severe damage. In light of
this long experience of failures and poor quality product, TKI decided
that the carbonization process was not viable and the unit would not be
rebuilt. Nevertheless, the drying unit which was unaffected would
continue to be used to dry up lignite which, after deactivisation with
cool air to prevent spontaneous combustion would be sold to cement
production plants. The Bank agreed to this course of action.
3.05     The MTA Hot Briguetting Process:   Terms of Reference were
prepared and consultant proposals were received for the design of a pilot
plant. Prior to proceeding, the Bank had requested that some additional
tests be carried out on the existing laboratory plant in order to further
verify the viability of the process. Based on the results of these tests
it was concluded that the processing method for hot briquetting was not
sufficiently promising to warrant investing in a larger scale pilot
plant. The Bank agreed with this conclusion.
3.06     Long-Term Measures for Pollution Reduction:   The use of a clean
fuel like gas for heating had been considered as a long term solution for



.i r pollution abatement. For this purpose alternative technological
processes were to be analyzed and evaluated. However, shortly after the
terms of reference for the required studies were agreed upon, a decision
was made to allocate as much as 85% of the lignite available at Beypazari
(the only feasible source within a reasonable distance from Ankara) to
power generation, leaving an insufficient quantity to sustain a gas
production plant. Consultant proposals were consequently not invited,
and the Bank agreed with the decision not to proceed with these studies.
3.07     Immediate Pollution Control Measures:   This component of the
project was designed to reinforce and upgrade the limited air pollution-
monitoring program already in existence. The initial batch of equipment
ordered in December 1981-consisted of 17 semi-automatic stations.
Another 17 similar stations wece later added. Each station covers an
area of 2 km2.  Subsequently the system was further improved by setting
up two fully automatic stations reporting to two local centers with each
center reporting by telemetry to a main control center. For pollution
control purposes, four "danger" levels have been established by the
Government (Ministry of Health). Depending on the measured conditions,
heating has been restricted, traffic partially stopped, and offices and
schools shut down.
Procurement
3.08     The air pollution monitoring equipment was procured through
international competitive bidding. The only other item for which Bank
funds were utilized was the rehabilitation of the Seyitomer Coking
Plant. Due to the proprietary nature of this plant a suitable contract
was negotiated and signed with the contractor who had originally
built it.

I V.  lT I IUT IUNAi PERFORMANCE
4.01   The projcct imrpli1iti:1 t ;ti1.i t criud was i 'a time of important political
tLhanges in Turkey.  The  ei,suItLii! UtnLertainLy affecLed the project in various
ways, notahlLv rhe C11S:." Lfilaiouy et personnel assigned to the project,
inadequate implcm ,:tatiun .oordinrat'on and delayed dlecisions.  In retrospect,
however, these problems were nlot relevant to the disappointing outcome of
project investigatioas.
V.  BANK PERFORMANCE
5.01   The projecL was regularly supervised.  Bank missions were adequately
staffed and consultants were engaged to advise the Bank and the Borrower on
various technical matters. The Bank and the consultants assisted in the
preparation of the terms of references of the different studies that were to
be carried out under the project as well as in the review of the design and
technical specificationis for the equipment procured.
5.02   The Bank adjusted its approach to project implementation as more
information and data became available and, with the Borrower, reached the
conclusion that the studies and the pilot plant components should not be
carried out (para. 3.03 through 3.06).
VI. JUSTIFICATION
6.01   In order to reduce air pollution to reasonably low levels, clean fuel
is needed for Ankara's domestic needs. The limited proven resources of natural
gas and the critical shortage of foreign exchange for the purchase of
low-sulphur oil made it imperative to investigate any possibility of
developing, in the medium-term, smokeless fuel from local lignite.
6.02   The installation of an appropriate pollution control system was
required to enable monitoring of present air pollution, to establish a warning
system and to create a data base for actions to be taken on pollution control
on short and long term bases.
6.03   The engineerKng loan was designed to assist the Government within the
framework of thie above imperatives. As a result it has been possible to
conclude that for the time being there does not appear to exist a feasib'e
techniological Drocess for the manufacture of smokeless fuel based on the poor



-7
quality Turkish lignite. Neither would the litaited availability of lignite
justify the development of a gasification plant.
6.04   An extensive air pollution control system has been established and is
functioning well. This has enabled a number of short term measures to be
taken such as the identification of priority areas where low-sulphur oil and
washed lignite should be used.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01   The project was research oriented.  It hias been concluded that the
alternatives of smokeless fuel or gasification are not for the time being
viable propositions. Other solutions will have to be sought.
7.02   The most promising alternative may be to supply district heating from
several combined heat and power stations to be built as part of the power
generation expansion program to meet the growing electricity needs of the
Ankara region. The stations would be fueled by unprocessed lignite with the
emissions to be controlled through high stacks and flue cleaning devices. The
Turkish authorities have to decide whether to proceed further with this
alternative which needs to be assessed against the alternative of expanding
natural gas supplies to Ankara's households.
7.03   For abating the air pollution, the Turkish authorities are undertaking
short term measures such as using (i) washed or handpicked lignite; (ii)
imported coke or briquettes; and (iii) diesel instead of fuel oil. An
educational campaign has also been launched for better insulation of the
houses and skilled laborers are being trained to control the performance of
the burners of installed boilers.
7.04   The level of air pollution in Ankara remains high despite significant
efforts that have been made. A decision has yet to be made as to what
measures are to be taken in the intermediate or long term. This is expected
to be based on energy planning studies currently under way in consultation
with the Bank.
