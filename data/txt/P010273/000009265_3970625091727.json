objective of this second phase of\n            the Sind and Punjab Agricultural Extension Project is to\n            achieve sustained increases in agricultural production in\n            the Punjab and Sind provinces.  For this purpose the project\n            would complete the strengthening and reorganization of the\n            extension services in Punjab and Sind by extending the\n            training and visit system to the remaining 31 districts not\n            covered by the two Phase-I projects (Credits 813 and 922),\n            while at the same time consolidating the gains made during\n            these projects and strengthening the adaptive research\n            system in the two provinces.  To achieve these objectives,\n            the project would include: 1) agricultural extension\n            services (1,600 additional staff and necessary physical\n            components, including offices, staff housing, vehicles and\n            equipment); 2) adaptive research (3 adaptive research\n            farms); 3) staff training; 4) information and media; and, 5)\n            project administration, monitoring and evaluation.\n            Technical assistance would be provided to support these activities."}, "docdt": "1987-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
