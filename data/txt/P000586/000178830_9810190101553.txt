I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      At the beginning of 1980, the Government of the Comoros, with the
assistance of the European Investment Bank, conducted a study to ascertain
the feasibility of creating a development bank that would replace the
CREDICOM, an existing institution which, due to serious financial
difficulties, had discontinued operations. The report, published in mid
1980, concluded that there was a need for such an institution and
recommended the creation of a new multisectoral development bank.
1.02      Later that same year, a World Bank mission visited the Comoros to
further assess the feasibility of, and measures for the establishment of
the development bank.  This mission endorsed the conclusions of the
feasibility study.  It also concluded that even though the size of the
country and the relatively limited number of investment opportunities would
make the proposed development bank a small institution, it would still
benefit from the World Bank financial and technical assistance.
1.03      To prepare for this assistance, a World Bank/UNIDO Cooperative
Programme mission visited the Comoros in November 1981, to ascertain
investment possibilities in the productive sectors and in November 1982, a
mission appraised DBC for this first line of credit. UNIDO has also
agreed, as a result of its involvement in the preparation of the project,
to provide an expert for one year to help establish within DBC, an SSE
Technical Assistance and Promotion Unit.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
A. The Economic Setting
2.01      The Comoros, with a population of about 347,000 1/ inhabitants,
ranks among the least developed countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. In 1980,
GDP in market prices was US$117 million, i.e., around $337 per capita.
Between 1970 and 1974 GDP at constant prices rose at a yearly average rate
of 5.8%, followed by severe drops of 23% and 22% in 1975 and 1976 due to
the withdrawal of French technical and financial assistance following
unilateral declaration of independence in 1975, and the installation in the
same year of a regime which undertook to implement radical social and
economic changes. From 1976 to 1980 GDP rose at an average annual rate of
4.2%. Considering an annual population growth rate of about 2.7%, per
capita growth of GDP has been barely positive from 1976 on. Preliminary
estimates of real GDP growth for 1981 is around 5%.
2.02      The country's economic performance is hampered by geographic
isolation, lack of infrastructure, shortage of skills and serious
population pressure. Despite a system of import and export licensing, the
Comoros has maintained a relatively open economy in which the ratio of
exports and imports to GDP average about 14% and 23% respectively per
annum.
1/ With Mayotte, the population of the Comorian archipelago amounts to
about 417,000 individuals.

B. The Productive Sectors
Current Situation and Constraints
2.03      Agriculture is the largest contributor to GDP (between 42 and 47%
during 1976-80) and the largest employer (over 80% of the work force).
About 40,000 ha. are devoted to the major food crops, mainly rice, tubers,
bananas, legumes and maize; a further 30,000 ha. are taken up by coconuts,
both a subsistence and an export crop, and 9,000 ha. by the major export
crops, vanilla, ylang-ylang and cloves. Crop outputs have increased very
slowly (total of slightly over 10%) for the period 1966-80, with the
exception of fruits where increases during the same period were more
substantial (25-30%). Total exports of agricultural products amounted to
CF4.4 billion in 1981, with vanilla accounting for 50% of the total. The
importance of copra as an export crop had declined in recent years because
of the closure of its traditional market in Madagascar, although it is
still a major subsistence crop.
2.04      The performance of agriculture in the Comoros has been well below
potential, for both food and export crops. The most important reasons for
this are declining soil fertility caused by reduction of fallow periods and
cultivation of fragile, steeply sloping soils through increasing population
pressure on the land, rudimentary cultivation techniques, lack of improved
seed material, inappropriate crop rotation, poor crop husbandry, and
widespread rodents and other pests, particularly for coconuts.
2.05      Manufacturing and artisanal activities are at an embryonic stage
of development and contributed only 4.8% of GDP in 1980. Then, the sector
comprised 125 enterprises, 2/ with a total employment of around 700,
engaged in the following activities: bakery, soft drink and carbonated
water production, manufacture of wearing apparel, sawmilling, furniture
making, printing, soap manufacture, ylang-ylang distillation, jewelry, and
handicrafts. All these establishments, with the exception of one
ylang-ylang distillery, may be considered as being of small to medium-scale
and are evenly dispersed between the islands of Grande Comoros and
Anjouan. It is estimated that ylang-ylang distillation and furniture
making contribute the most to sector value added.
2.06      This low level of industrialization is explained by the existence
of fairly formidable constraints of which the geographical isolation of the
country and the small size of its market are probably the most important.
Production disruptions are frequent and due mostly to irregular supplies of
imported inputs.  In addition, the small market makes many manufacturing
projects uneconomical. Other constraints include: the lack of capacity of
public utility services which results in frequent production disruption to
existing industries or creates a barrier for new ones; the lack of term
financing and technical assistance in support of project preparation and
implementation; and the lack of semi-skilled and skilled manpower.
2.07      The construction sector is one of the fastest growing with its
contribution to GDP having risen from 7.3% in 1976 to 9.2% in 1980. A
2/ This information came from an ILO manpower survey which defined the
sector to include establishments with a minimum of one employed person.



substantial part of this growth comes from increases in public works
(mainly roads and buildings), although self construction of private
housing, widespread in the Comoros, was also on the increase. In line with
this growth, sector employment had reached about 3,200 persons, employed by
39 enterprises. Of these firms, five, locally owned and mainly locally
managed, for about 70% of all construction in Comoros, other than
self-construction of houses and large-scale infrastructural public works
such as the building of harbors, bridges and bituminous roads. The latter
are mostly being undertaken by two foreign based companies.
2.08      The most serious constraint to expansion of construction is a
paucity and poor range of locally produced construction materials. Local
manufacture of building materials has not kept pace with the growth in
construction, and piecemeal importation of cement hampers the continuity of
most construction projects, from self-construction to large-scale
infrastructural programmes.
2.09      The tourism sector in Comoros is still very small.  In 1980 the
number of non-resident arrivals to the country was 5,000, of which only
1,900 stayed in hotels. Of these about 90% were business and external aid
personnel and only 10% real tourists. As should be expected tourist
infrastructure is undeveloped. There are currently only 4 hotels with a
total of 164 beds meeting international standards. Until recently existing
hotel capacity was not a major constraint to the promotion of tourism since
occupancy rates were low. The major obstacle was inadequacy of transport
connections with the outside world. As this transport situation is now
improving, hotel capacity is becoming a constraint.
Policies and Issues
2.10      The Government's development strategy is still evolving, and so
policies for expanding the productive sectors are not fully in place.
Nevertheless, appropriate initiatives have already been taken in
agriculture, industry and tourism. In construction however, no policies or
special programs are in place.
2.11      In agriculture, self-sufficiency in food production is the
Government's highest priority, and this goal has been translated into
action as follows: the development of a rural extension network,
practically from scratch; the substitution of imported rice by locally
produced maize, pidgeon peas and taro, a local tuber; rural works programs
including land terracing for erosion control, and rural roads; development
of poultry and artisanal fishing.  The goal must not be pursued, however,
at the expense of export crops, Comoros' sole source of foreign exchange
and frequently with a relatively high revenue per hectare.
2.12      Implementation of the first two policies is the responsibility of
the Centre Federal d'Appui et Developpement Rural (CEFADER), an institution
under the Ministry of Production and Industrial Development, which aims at
rural development in general. Created in May 1980 to provide extension
services to agriculture, the CEFADER brought under its auspices a number of
already existing programmes. It has a number of field affiliates, the
Centres d'Appui au Dgveloppement Rural (CADER), which provide extension
services to farmers. At present there are five CADERs and it is planned to



- 4 -
establish two in 1983, three in 1984 and one in 1985 (financing is assured
for four).
2.13      The CEFADER/CADER system aims at providing extension services to
the rural population. The agricultural sector was the first covered, and
other sectors of the economy are likely to be included in the future.
Overall technical managerial and administrative advice to the system is
provided by FAO.  The CADERs offer small credits to farmers to purchase
seeds, fito-sanitary equipment and products, hand tools, egg hatches,
cattle and chicken feed. This financing was initiated within the framework
of an operation to increase maize production, and it is expected to extend
it gradually to other products. Overall the CEFADER/CADER system appears
adequate and working satisfactorily.
2.14       In order to develop fishing activities, the Government created in
September 1982 a parastatal company, the Societe de Developpement des
Pgches aux Comores (SODEPECHE),  It aims at developing and motorizing new
types of fishing craft, improving fishing techniques and providing landing
and cold storage facilities. Financed by the ADB and by equipment grants
from the Japanese Government, the project aims at increasing the present
catch from 3,000 - 4,000 tons/year to 6,000 tons/year.
2.15       In industry two policy measures have been taken, both aimed at
stimulating investment. First, an investment code was adopted in 1980
under which a variety of fiscal incentives can be awarded to industrial as
well as non-industrial ventures. The idea of using fiscal incentives to
stimulate investment is sound for the Comoros, given the financial
obstacles to profitable productive sector investment. Unfortunately, the
specific provisions of the current code favor large-scale enterprises,
whereas the country would benefit from support to small-scale enterprises.
For instance, it provides incentives to projects which either create 100
jobs for Comorians or represent investment amounting to CF150 million and
create at least 50 jobs. Furthermore, the code supports a capital and
import intensive economic development not in line with the country's
resource constraint and potential.  The matter was discussed during
negotiations and it was agreed that by December 31, 1983 the Government
will complete a review of incentives it offers to investment enterprises
and that by May 31, 1984 it will take appropriate action to correct the
deficiencies of the existing code. The requisite technical assistance to
review the present code and determine an appropriate incentive system could
be financed from the consultancy services funds under the credit.  Second,
the creation of the Development Bank (DBC) to identify, promote and provide
long term capital to projects is an indication of Government's desire to
foster industrial development, and a step in the right direction.
2.16      At the same time as the revision of the investment code there is
a need to define a coherent strategy of industrial development. Key issues
to be addressed by such a strategy are whether the industrialization effort
should be export oriented or concentrate on satisfying the limited domestic
market; whether protection will be accorded domestic producers for the
domestic market, in what form and at what levels.
2.17      Certain Government policies, if they are not modified, will
remain obstacles to the establishment of productive enterprises. For



example, with respect to the policy on price control, two local industrial
companies have experienced financial difficulties, because prices for their
products were too low. Existing price homologation which permits to
control prices of imported first necessity goods, particularly food stuff
should be maintained. On the other hand, price controls for locally
manufactured goods, if not abolished, should ease in order to attract
investment.  It is however difficult for the Government to address itself
to this issue in isolation of the protection policy. Because of the
complexity of these issues and the existence of vested interests, changes
in industrial policy cannot be decided upon in the short term. The matter
was reviewed during negotiations and it was agreed that, no later than May
31, 1984, the Government will formulate, in consultation with the
Association, a pricing policy for locally manufactured goods. The
technical assistance that may be required to develop such policy would be
provided from the consultancy services to be financed under the credit.
2.18      In tourism, a previous ambivalence is slowly giving way to
positive policies. Since the major constraint is the undeveloped
infrastructure, Government policy initiatives are crucial in this area.
The investment code includes tourism projects as eligible for fiscal
incentives. More significantly, Government is directly negotiating two
separate hotel projects with foreign hotel chains. Both projects involve
the management under contract of the hotels by the respective foreign
groups, and if implemented, will increase the country's international hotel
capacity from the current 164 beds to 502 beds.
Prospects
2.19      The overall economic prospects for the Comoros in the foreseable
future are modest, given the lack of resources, and the consequent need to
depend heavily on concessionary foreign assistance. In the latest Bank
economic report on the country (No. 3432-COM dated May 27, 1982) a
preliminary growth projection through 1985 indicates that to achieve a
modest 1.0% annual growth in GDP per capita (4.5% annual economic growth),
the agriculture sector will have to grow by 3.9% per annum; industrial
growth will have to accelerate from 4% in 1980 to 8% by 1985; and the rest
of the economy must grow by 5% per year. To achieve these growth rates
will require substantial investments, with the investment to GDP ratio
averaging about 28% over the period.
2.20      These are formidable targets given the constraints, yet useful to
illustrate the potential in such an undeveloped economy. In agriculture,
increases in crop output, especially of maize, are possible given current
low yields. There are also promising opportunities in poultry and
fishing. To realize this potential, investments in hand tools, fences and
poultry hatches, fishing motors and equipment etc. are needed. In
industry, investment opportunities exist both in import substitution
activities (sea salt, pozzolanic cement, mechanical and electrical
workshops) and in larger-scale export oriented activities (coconut based
products such as edible oil and soap and vanilla extract). In construction
potential exists for local enterprises to undertake sub-contract work on
large projects, and to undertake low cost housing. In tourism, depending
on the success in expanding hotel capacity, a number of additional
activities centering around tourism could be set up to offer goods and

services such as artisan shops and restaurants.  It will be the challenge
of the development bank to promote and finance these investment
oossLi'lities,  To that effect, it is establishing, with UNIDO's
asststaxce, an SSE Technical Assistance and Promotion Unit (para 3.09).
C .  _inanc4ai Sector
c2l2      The Ban1king System in the Comoros consists of: a Central Bank
which, in 1981, replaced the Institut d'Emission des Comores (IEC), created
irn December 1974 to take over the currency management functions previously
performed by the Banque de Madagascar et des Comores; a commercial bank,
the Banque Lnernationale des Comores (BIC) which replaced the Banque
Commerciale des Comores (BCC); a Development Bank, the Banque de
DXveloppem.ent des Comores (DBC), which was created in 1981 and started
operations in the first part of 1982.  To a large extent it will replace
the former Soci6tf de Cr6dit pour le D6veloppement des Comores (CREDICOM)
which discontinued operations in 1981.  The system is adequate and
appropriate to the Comoros' needs.
2.22      Central Bank.  IEC, the Currency Board, was established in 1974
with the exclusive right to issue legal tender. It received an initial
caDital grant from France of CF250 million after the signature on November
23, 1979 of a monetary co-operation agreement, whereby the Comoros became
part of the Franc Zone, the Comorifan Franc having a fixed parity of CF50 to
the French Franc. This association ensures full convertibility of local
currency, thus facilitating foreign trade. An operation account is kept
wi th the Bank of France, through which all foreign transactions are made.
Unlimited convertibility is offered for transactions within the Franc Zone,
although certain quotas may be drawn up for other currencies.
2.23      Up to 1981, IEC's main activity was the rediscounting of
commercial bills, treasury bonds and medium-term loan guarantee bills. It
had relatively little influence over the level and distribution of credit
in the country. Furthermore, it had no legal authority to formulate, or
control monetary and credit policies. In 1981, the Government decided to
convert IEC into a Central Bank, with power to regulate interest rates
charged by financial institutions and to determine the country's monetary
and credit policies, According to the statutes of the Central Bank and the
Franc Zone reguLiations , the Deputy Director of the Bank is a French
official who also carries out technical assistance on currency management
and the handling of monetary issues.
2.24      As of September 30, 1982, the Central Bank had a credit balance
with the French Treasury amounting to CF1.8 billion as compared to CF0.7
billion in December 1980 and CFO.2 billion in December 1979.  Its assets
totalled about CF5.0 billion of which CF1.9 billion in short-term and CFO.1
billion in medium-term financing.
2.25      Commercial Bank.  The Banque Internationale des Comores (BIC) was
established in February 1982 to replace the Banque Commerciale des Comores
(BCC), a joint venture of the Banque de Madagascar et des Comores, which
ceased operations on January 31, 1982, because of bankruptcy and is now
being liquidated,



- 7 -
2.26      BIC has a share capital of CF300 million distributed as follows:
Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique Occidentale (BIAO): 51%; Comorian
State: 34%; local private shareholders: 15% 3/. As of September 30, 1982,
BIC had extended loans totalling about CF3.1 billion in short-term
financing and overdrafts. Its management does not intend to participate
in medium-term financing of investment projects. As of September 30, 1982,
BIC's assets amounted to CF6.0 billion.
2.27       Inflation.  Inflation in the Comoros, as measured by the GDP
deflator, was 10% by 1980, 4/ having declined from 15% in 1978 and 1979.
It is projected to remain at 10% per annum through 1985.
f
2.28       Interest Rates.  The Central Bank presently charges a rediscount
rate of 7.5% for medium term funds and 6% for short term funds. BIC, the
commercial bank, charges, on its short-term loans, rates which range from
13% for short-term financing of export crops and 16-19% for its normal
domestic trade financing and overdrafts. These lending rates are high,
compared to inflation, and have been authorized by the Central Bank to
permit the new commercial bank to obtain a substantial spread in its
formative years to compensate for its small portfolio.  It is expected that
the rates will be lowered in future. The Development Bank of Comoros (BDC)
charges rates ranging between 9 and 12% on its medium and long-term loans,
depending on the risk and the sector of activity. Although the BDC also
needs a substantial spread in its formative years, Government believes that
long term interest rates should be kept low to encourage investment. Given
the low risk and high profits associated with the sort of import-export
trade that the commercial bank finances, compared to the investments that
BDC finances, the higher rates for commercial loans are justified.   As
already noted, these rates are expected to decline in future.
2.29      The deposit rate is 6% per annum and is therefore negative in
real terms at the current inflation rate. It should be noted however that
the most important factor influencing the level of the deposit rate is not
inflation, but the rates in France which, at present, vary between 8 and
12%. The rate should be set so as to avoid substantial transfers of
deposits to France, given the free convertibility between the Comorian and
French francs and to encourage saving mobilization. During negotiations,
this matter was discussed with the Government and agreement was reached
that deposit rates will be such that they will attract and retain deposits.
III. THE INSTITUTION
A. Institutional Aspect
Background and Objectives
3.01      The Development Bank of the Comoros (DBC), was created by an Act
of Parliament in August 1981, to promote the economic development of the
country through provision of equity capital and financing for directly
productive investments in a wide variety of sectors:  agriculture,
3/ Each private shareholder may not have more than 1%.
4/ The latest year for which data are available.



- 8 -
industry, tourism, transport and services.  DBG is also authorized to make
loans, within a 30% limit of its annual approvals, for the construction or
the improvement of private houses. The maturity of DBC's loans range from
one to ten years.
Ownership and Board
3.02      DBC has a share capital of CF300 million which is fully
subscribed and paid-in. The shareholders are the State of Comoros (50%),
the Central Bank of Comoros, the European Investment Bank and Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (about 16.6% each). DBC's Board of
Directors which is chaired by the Director General of the Planning
Directorate comprises six members, three of whom represent the Government,
one each the Central Bank, Caisse Centrale and the European Investment
Bank. The Caisse Centrale's local representative attends the Board
meetings for that institution. DBC's Board members are active, dynamic and
play an active role in the management of the institution. The Board meets
about every other month to discuss policy matters and approve loans.
Management, Organization and Staffing
3.03      DBC is managed by an expatriate general manager seconded by the
Caisse Centrale, and a Comorian deputy, both of whom are dynamic and
competent. They have successfully started the institution, identified
bankable projects and are actively promoting investment ideas. The
Comorian deputy is expected to assume the general manager's position by the
end of 1983, with the assistance of an expatriate adviser, likely to be
provided by Caisse Centrale which will also finance the cost of the
position for one year. The need for further technical assistance to DBC's
management will be reviewed by IDA at the end of this period.
3.04      DBC is a small institution with a total staff of ten, of whom
three are professionals. Management intends to recruit, during 1983, two
additional professionals.   The institution has two departments, one for
loans and the other for administration. The Loan Department is responsible
for the review of loan applications, forecasting volume of operations,
making disbursements and collections. The Administration Department
handles all matters related to the staffing and financing of the
institution. DBC's management is establishing an SSE Technical Assistance
and Promotion Unit that will help promoters to prepare and implement
investment projects. UNIDO has agreed to finance an expert for one year
for the Unit and the proposed IDA credit would finance this position for an
additional two years.  DBC's staff is still somewhat inexperienced but
highly motivated.
Operating Policies
3.05      DBC's investment and financial policies, developed with IDA's
assistance and reflected in its Policy Statement and Rules of Procedures
are generally adequate. These policies specify, in particular, that DBC's
total exposure in a single enterprise shall not exceed 30% of its equity
(i.e. about US$260,000 equivalent) and that the institution shall not
assume the exchange risk on its foreign borrowings. However:



- 9 -
(a) the policy statement indicates that normally the
institution will not finance the totality of the
cost of a project, although specific limits are
spelled out in DBC's Rule of Procedures.
Agreement was reached during negotiations that a
normal limit of 80% of total project costs
including working capital, will be spelled out in
DBC's Policy Statement;
(b) there is no reference in DBC's Policy Statement to
its debts to equity ratio limit of 4:1 which is
acceptable.  This limit, however, is mentioned in
its Rules of Procedures. Agreement was reached
during negotations that this limit will be
incorporated into DBC's Policy Statement;
(c) DBC's Policy Statement does not contain explicit
project selection criteria. During negotiations
it was agreed that DBC would include a new clause
in its policy statement spelling out such
criteria. These amendments of DBC's Policy
Statement which were discussed and agreed upon
during negotiations will be a condition of
effectiveness of the IDA credit.
Procedures
3.06      DBC's Rules of Procedures contain specific guidelines for some
aspects of DBC's operations. In addition, DBC's management has prepared a
number of internal notes indicating the procedure to be followed on such
matters as the processing of loans, disbursements, signing of loan
agreements, etc. These notes will be incorporated into an operational
manual.
3.07      Appraisal and Supervision.  Until now, in preparing project
appraisals, DBC's staff has used a checklist of items to be analyzed in
these reports. These appraisals are of good quality. DBC's management
intends to prepare in coming months a document providing more detailed
guidelines to the staff for project appraisal ane supervision.
3.08      Procurement and Disbursement.  DBC requires project promoters to
obtain quotations from a number of suppliers, from amongst whom, the
promoter, with DBC's assistance selects the most advantageous. DBC
disburses against presentation of invoices or relevant documentation, after
the promoter has paid his share of the investment. DBC's procedures for
procurement and disbursements are adequate.
3.09      Project Promotion.  In view of the relatively limited range of
investment opportunities in the country, promotion activities will be
essential to permit DBC to fulfill its role. Since DBC started operations
in 1982, its management has played a very active role in that area and has
succeeded in promoting projects. To further these activities, DBC is
establishing, with assistance from UNIDO, an SSE Technical Assistance and
Promotion Unit, the main purpose of which will be to identify promising



- 10 -
project ideas in the various productive sectors, to work with potential
promoters in developing bankable propositions and finally to provide
technical assistance in the implementation of projects as well as technical
assistance to existing DBC clients.  It is expected that this Unit will be
fully operational by the middle of 1983.
Interest Rates
3.10       DBC is authorized by the Central Bank to charge interest rates of
9 to 12% on loans for productive investments and 9 to 14% for housing
loans, depending on cost of the resources used to finance a particular
operation and the guarantees provided by the borrower.  In practice,
however, most loans granted so far have carried interest rates of 9-10%.
Furthermore, DBC charges its clients a 1% commitment fee on the total
amount of the loans, starting on the date of signature of loan documents
and an additional 1% fee, one year after signature, on the undisbursed
balance of the loan.
Audit
3.11       DBC's accounts will be audited according to generally accepted
principles by an auditor of international reputation acceptable to the
Association, which is still to be selected. DBC's management will submit
to IDA's approval a list of auditors that would be invited to make
proposals. The first audit will cover the 15 months period ending December
31, 1982. During negotiations, agreement was reached with DBC that future
audited accounts will be submitted to IDA within 6 months after the end of
each fiscal year.
B. Operations and Finance
3.12       Operations:  DBC approved its first loan in May 1982, and had
approved 25 loans for a total of CF 84.4 million by the end of October 1982
(annex 1). Of these, 17 were medium and long-term loans for CF 76.5
million, and 8 were short-term loans 5/ for CF 7.9 million. CF 23.9
million (about 28%) of these loans had been disbursed.
3.13       Although still small, DBC's operations to date already reflect
the multisectoral character of the institution.  The 17 long-term loans
include 8 loans for residential housing, 3 for industrial enterprises, 2
for agricultural enterprises and 1 each in fishing, agroindustry, artisanal
activities, and transport.  The short-term loans have been mainly for
artisans and poultry farming. The size of its loans have been small, with
21 out of the 25 loans below CF 5 million. The largest loan to date was a
CF 12 million loan to SOCOTRA, a construction and building materials
enterprise. This compares with DBC's exposure limit of about CF 94 million
(30% of its equity base) to a single enterprise.
3.14       DBC's total lending of CF 60.9 million for productive activities
have contributed to the financing of an estimated CF 136.3 million of
5/ Short-term loans have a maximum maturity of 2 years and have been for
small investments.



- 11 -
investments (45% of financing) in 17 projects (annex 2). Based on its
appraisal data, these projects would generate 91 jobs at a fairly low
average investment per job of $4,160. The agricultural and agroindustrial
projects have the lowest investment per job ratio ($2,570 average) whilst
fishing and poultry farming had the highest ($5,789 average). Almost all
the projects financed are oriented towards domestic consumption. The value
added as a proportion of the value of output range from a low of 29% for
the agroindustry project to a high of 93% for the agricultural projects.
The average for the group is 45% (annex 2).
3.15       Finance:  DBC's first fiscal year ended on December 31, 1982, and
*       its first accounts for the 15 months to that period are still under
preparation. Provisional accounts through October 1982 indicate a small
net income before provisions and depreciation of CF 0.4 million. DBC does
not however expect to make a profit during its first year, when its main
source of income would be interest earned from short-term investment of its
paid-in capital (annex 4).
3.16      As should be expected from the pace of disbursements (para. 3.12)
the size of its portfolio as of October 1982 was small (CF 25 million). So
far, DBC's paid-in capital of CF 300 million has been adequate to finance
its operations and expenses and still leave a substantial cash surplus for
short-term investment.
C. Prospects
3.17      Projected Operations:  Annex 3 shows projected operations for DBC
for 1982 through 1986. These projections are subject to a high degree of
variation because DBC is a new institution with no track record; it will be
operating in an environment which has proved unattractive to date for
significant productive investments; and its own project development and
promotion capabilities will largely determine how much it can lend in the
key productive sectors. Bearing these factors in mind, the projections
assume that DBC could double its approvals in 1983 when it is more
established, and then increase approvals thereafter at 10% per annum in
nominal terms. (No growth in real terms). Its total commitments through
1986 would be CF 1,463 million. These projections are more conservative
than DBC's own estimates 6/ but take into account DBC's existing pipeline
of projects, most of which are in the industrial sector (production of
shoes, paints, clothings, mattresses, cookingwares).
3.18      Whilst it is expected that demand for housing loans from DBC will
be strong, it is DBC's policy to restrict its annual approvals for housing
to 30% of its total approvals.  Its cumulative approvals and commitments
for housing will therefore not exceed 30% of its total approvals and
commitments during the period. The balance of 70% will go to productive
investments according to the following distribution; 50% for industry, 12%
for artisanal activities and 9% for agriculture. These productive sector
commitments are expected to be 80% in the form of long-term loans, 14% in
the form of short-term loans and 6% in equity.
6/ DBC's own estimates of its cumulative commitments for 1982 to 1986 is CF
1,990 million.



- 12 -
3419      Resource Requirements:  To fund the CF 1,463 million of projected
commitments through 1986, the following financing plan is envisaged.
Capital                              CF  300 million
Grants                                    110
Operating Surplus                          76
Loan Collections                          175
Rediscounting                              93
IDA Credit                                709
1,463
The grants represent expected collections from the portfolio of the defunct
CREDICOM. The rediscounting from the Central Bank represents 55% of the
current maximum of CF 300 million the Central Bank has set for medium-term
rediscounts. Therefore, even if its internal cash generation from
operations, its collection from the CREDICOM portfolio, and the repayments
from its borrowers turn out to be only 50% of what is currently projected,
DBC could fill in most of the gap with additional rediscounts from the
Central Bank. DBC will therefore not face any additional resource
constraints over the next five years (annex 8).  It should be noted however
that the IDA resources will not be available for short-term and housing
loans, and that DBC will have to tailor its commitments in these areas to
fit in with its other resources.
3.20      Financial Prospects:  Annexes 4 to 7 show financial projections
and ratios for DBC. Even with substantial interest free resources in the
form of capital and grants, an effective spread on its borrowed funds of
about 6.5% over the period, and cost free technical assistance for key
expatriate staff, DBC's projected profitability is modest. Starting with
no profits in 1982, the situation is expected to improve gradually to a
return on its average equity of about 4.9% by 1986. DBC's profitability
will be most sensitive to provisions and write-offs in respect of bad
loans, which on a cumulative basis, have been projected at 2% of the
portfolio. This rather modest profit potential is not surprising given the
relatively small size of DBC's portfolio. DBC's shareholders were however
aware of this possibility when they invested, and would be satisfied if DBC
is able, in its initial years of operations, to meet its expenses, and
generate adequate cash flows to service its debts without recourse to
further equity injections and subsidies.
3.21      In view of its initial reliance on its equity resources to
finance operations, DBC's drawdown of its borrowings will not start till
1984. As a result its debt equity ratio will stay well within its
mandatory limit of 4:1.
3.22      On the whole, barring major loan losses and laxness in following
up and collecting its debts, DBC would develop into a financially viable
and creditworthy institution.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The main objective of the project is to assist in developing
productive activities in the Comoros by providing financial resources and
technical assistance to help establish and strengthen the newly created
development bank. Institution building is therefore a key element of the
project.
4.02      The line of credit would be used to finance new projects and also
the expansion, modernization or rehabilitation of existing enterprises in
all productive sectors.
B. Description
4.03      The proposed project would have the following components:
(a)  Investment Financing.  US$2.0 million would be used by
DBC to finance loans and equity investments in small
and medium-scale enterprises in industry, agriculture,
agro-industry, fisheries, construction activities,
tourism, transport, artisan activities, and services
connected with production. This amount would represent
about 70% of DBC's projected commitments for projects
in these sectors through 1986 and about 40% of its
total resource requirements during the period.
(b)  Technical Assistance to DBC.  US$0.3 million would be
used to provide DBC with technical assistance in the
key areas listed below. Such assistance is required to
help establish DBC as a well managed and effective
institution.
(i) SSE Project Promotion and Technical
Assistance to Entrepreneurs. US$110,000
would be used to finance 12 man-months of an
SSE specialist who would be located in the
SSE Technical Assistance and Promotion Unit
to be established in DBC.  The IDA credit
would finance the salary, benefits, housing
and travel expenditures of the specialist.
*                      UNIDO will be financing this expert for one
year starting at the beginning of 1983.
(ii) Training of DBC's Staff. US$30,000 would be
used to finance the training of DBC's staff,
particularly in project appraisal and
supervision, at other experienced development
banks and relevant training institutions.
This should allow most of DBC's small



- 14 -
professional staff to benefit from training
programs during the period covered by the IDA
credit.
(iii)     Consultancy Services and Technical
Assistance. US$40,000 would be used to
finance consultancy services to conduct
feasibility studies for projects selected by
DBC in productive sectors with emphasis on
industry, agro-industry and tourism. This
would also include consultancy services for
review of the Investment Code (para. 2.15).
Consultants selected to carry out these
feasibility studies would be chosen by DBC
after consultation with IDA. DBC would
submit for approval the objectives of each
study, its detailed terms of reference and a
short list of consultants envisaged to carry
it out with a detailed explanation of their
expertise in the particular field of study.
If requested, IDA will be prepared to assist
in identifying qualified consultants. An
additional US$120,000 would be included in
the credit to finance possible future
technical assistance to DBC's management
(para 3.03).
Proposed Credit to DBC
4.04      The US$2.0 million line of credit to DBC would finance the
eligible cost in foreign exchange and local currency of fixed capital
investments of medium and small projects approved by DBC in the following
sectors: industry, agriculture, agro-industry, fisheries, construction,
tourism, transport, artisan activities, services connected with production.
Terms and Conditions
4.05      Financing Component.  This component (US$2.0 million) would carry
the following terms and conditions:
(a)  On-lending Rate to DBC.  To provide DBC with a spread
which allows it to meet its operating expenses, realize
an adequate profit and build up provisions against
portfolio risk, the IDA credit would be onlent by the
Government to DBC at a rate which would be 6 percentage
points below the rate charged on the subloans financed
with the IDA resources. This relatively wide margin is
considered necessary to permit DBC cover its start-up
cost and compensate for the limited size of its
portfolio (para. 3.20). The on-lending rate by
Government to DBC, would be at 5%. Furthermore,
because of DBC's still fragile financial position,
Government would be requested to support all of the IDA



- 15 -
0.5% commitment fee. These matters were discussed and
agreed upon during negotiations.
(b) On-lending Rate by DBC. DBC would charge 11% to its
IDA financed clients.  In view of the inflation
expectation of 10% through 1985, this would provide a
marginally positive rate. The rate which DBC would
charge its clients for loans made with the IDA
resources, would be reviewed annually until the credit
is fully committed, by the Association, the Government
and DBC to ensure that the latter is not less than the
local rate of inflation.
(c) Foreign Exchange Risk. Because, DBC's clients will be
mostly small enterprises, Government would assume the
foreign exchange risk without charging a fee neither to
DBC nor to its clients. This was agreed upon during
negotiations.
(d) Free Limit. IDA would review the first five
subprojects that DBC will submit to ensure that the
appraisal reports are of good quality. Subsequently
the free limit for projects in all sectors should be
US$75,000 and the aggregate free limit US$1.0 million.
This limit would permit IDA to review most of the
projects likely to be submitted by DBC.
(e) Economic Analysis of Sub-projects. For subprojects
above the free limit, DBC would be required to provide
a comprehensive economic analysis and to calculate an
economic rate of return.
(f) Amortization Schedule. In view of the expected small
sizes of the IDA financed sub-loans DBC would repay the
Government according to a fixed amortization schedule
of 10 years with a four-year grace period.
4.06      Technical Assistance Component.  In view of DBC's still fragile
financial condition, the Government would pass on this component (US$0.3
million) to DBC as a grant.
C. Implementation
4.07      Reporting Requirements.  DBC would be required to submit
quarterly reports which would include financial statements, resource
position, statement of arrears and notes on sub-projects encountering
serious operational difficulties. DBC would also be required to submit
annual audit report in accordance with IDA guidelines for audits of DFCs,
prepared by qualified auditors approved by IDA along with DBC's annual
report.
4.08      Procurement.  Procurement for the sub-projects financed under the
credit would be in accordance with DBC's procurement practice
(para. 3.08). Consultants to be employed under the project would be
retained on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association.

4.09      Disbursements.  The proceeds of the proposed first credit would
finance 100% of the total costs of goods and services excluding taxes, 100%
of technical assistance. Disbursements would be fully documented.
However, after a certain number of claims have been submitted, IDA will
review its disbursement procedures and could allow DBC to claim
reimbursement against a certified statement of expenditure, the supporting
documentation being retained by DBC for inspection by Project supervision
missions.
4.10      As DBC is a new institution, operating in an environment
different from most Bank Group financed DFCs, neither the Bank-wide nor the
Region-wide sectoral disbursement profiles for the IDF Sector were relevant
and projected disbursements in Annex 9 are based on DBC's forecast of
operations. The credit is expected to be fully disbursed by December 31,
1988.
D. Benefits and Risks
4.11      The Development Bank of Comoros is a newly created institution
which has a significant role to perform in order to stimulate the
development of productive sectors. By providing financing and technical
assistance to this institution, IDA would contribute to achieving such
objective while developing and strengthening DBC as a sound and viable
institution.  On the basis of DBC's typical project financing so far,
the line of credit is expected to finance investments totalling US$4.0
million equivalent and to create about 500 jobs at an average cost of
US$8,000.
4.12      The risks associated with the project are that because of the
numerous constraints of the Comorian environment (distance from sources of
supply and from markets, high transport cost of imported inputs, narrowness
of domestic market) the number of investment projects, particularly in
manufacturing, would be limited. Furthermore, DBC's viability and
effectiveness will depend to a large extent on the quality of its
management and of its limited professional staff, particularly on its
ability to play a strong promotional role. As local talents are very
scarce, the project includes a large technical assistance component which
is justified.  The project success will depend largely on the quality of
technical assistance staff and services.  This aspect of the project will
be closely monitored.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
5.01      This report recommends an IDA credit of US$2.3 million on the
terms and conditions specified in paragraphs 4.04 and 4.05.
5.02      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:
(a)  with Government and DBC that:
(i) DBC's interest rates and charges will be
reviewed annually (para. 4.04(b));



- 17 -
(b) with Government that:
(i)  Deposit rates will be such that they will
attract and retain deposits (para. 2.29);
(ii)  revision of the Investment Code will be
completed by May 31, 1984 (para. 2.15);
(iii)  it will on-lend the financing component of
the IDA line of credit (US$2.0 million) to
DBC at a rate which will be 6 percentage
points below the rate charged by DBC on the
IDA financed sub-loans; and that it will
support all of the IDA 0.5% commitment fee on
this component (para. 4.04(a));
(iv)  it will pass on to DBC as a grant the
technical assistance component (US$0.3
million) of the line of credit (para. 4.06);
(v)  it will assume the foreign exchange risk on
the total amount of the line of credit and
will not charge a fee neither to DBC nor to
DBC's clients for assuming this risk (para.
4.04(c));
(c)  with DBC that:
(i)  it will specify in its Policy Statement that
its assistance to individual projects shall
normally be no more than 80% of total project
costs (para. 3.05(a));
(ii)  it will incorporate in its Policy Statement
a 4:1 limit for its debt to equity ratio
(para 3.05(b));
(iii)  it will submit to IDA its audited accounts
within six months after the end of each
*                     fiscal years (para. 3.11);
(iv)  it will on-lend the proceeds of the IDA
credit at a rate which initially shall be at
11% (para. 4.04(b));
(v)  it will provide a comprehensive economic
analysis and will calculate an economic rate
of return for all subprojects above the free
limit (para. 4.04 (e));
(vi) it will submit to IDA quarterly financial and
operational reports (para. 4.07).
5.03      Condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit will be that DBC
will have amended its Policy Statement (para. 3.05(a), (b) and (c)).
