The project\n            concentrates on the Punjab province but also has some\n            national aspects.  The main objective of the project is to\n            support the core program of the Punjab's Five-Year\n            primary education investment program.  The specific\n            objectives include:  (a) improving institutional capacity to\n            plan, manage and implement the investment program; (b)\n            supporting policy reform; and (c) supporting innovations in\n            the delivery of primary education.  To that end, the project\n            entails (i) management improvement; (ii) curriculum\n            development and materials supply; (iii) teacher training;\n            (iv) communications/demand generation; and (v) finally,\n            school construction.  With the last component, the project\n            supports concentrating on the building of new girls schools\n            and providing facilities for existing shelterless girls\n            schools.  This is in line with the overall Government\n            strategy to increase female enrollments."}, "docdt": "1987-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
