Public Sector Management Loan: the outcome\n            was moderately satisfactory, the sustainability was likely,\n            the institutional development was modest, the Bank and\n            borrower performance were both unsatisfactory. Private\n            Sector Finance Loan: the outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development was modest, the Bank performance\n            was unsatisfactory, and the borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Rio Grande Do Sul State Reform Loan: the\n            outcome was moderately satisfactory, the sustainability was\n            likely, the institutional development was modest, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was unsatisfactory. Rio the Janeiro State Reform\n            Privatization Loan: the outcome was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development was\n            modest, the Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and\n            the borrower performance was satisfactory. Mato Grosso State\n            Privatization Loan: the outcome was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The major lessons of general applicability\n            from the five loans assessed include: Continuity of Bank\n            interventions is important for promoting lasting\n            institutional change. Sub-national programmatic loans offer\n            advantages, in this respect, over time-bound State Reform\n            Loan (SRLs). The principles of the Levy Report remain\n            relevant for designing financial sector lending operations.\n            Credit lines (financial intermediary loans) are unlikely to\n            be appropriate instruments for supporting financial sector\n            adjustment. Reconciling project expenditures fully and\n            correctly at closing is a core Bank responsibility. An\n            oversight agency operating within an appropriate regulatory\n            framework is an important prerequisite to successful\n            privatization of public services. As investment loans, the\n            SRLs proved to be cumbersome instruments for supporting\n            structural change."}, "docdt": "2003-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
