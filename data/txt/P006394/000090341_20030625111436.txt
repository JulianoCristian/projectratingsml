I       OED Mission: Enhancingdevelopmenteffectivenessthrough excellenceand independencein evaluation.                        1
 About this Report
      The Operations EvaluationDepartment assesses the programsand activitiesof theWorld Bankfor two purposes: first, to
 ensurethe integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocess and to verifythatthe Bank's work is producing the expectedresults,
 and second,to helpdevelopimproveddirections,policies,and proceduresthrough the disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom
 experience.As part of this work, OED annuallyassesses about25 percent of the Bank'slending operations.Inselecting
 operationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento thosethat are innovative,large, or complex; thosethat are relevantto
 upcomingstudies or country evaluations; those for which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank management have requested
 assessments;and those that are likelyto generateimportant lessons.The projects,topics, and analyticalapproaches
 selectedfor assessmentsupport larger evaluationstudies.
      A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the ImplementationCompletion Report (a
 self-evaluation by the responsibleBank department)and fieldwork conducted by OED. To preparePPARs, OED staff
 examine project files and other documents, interviewoperationalstaff, and in most cases visit the borrowing country for
 onsite discussions with projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to validate and augment the information
 providedin the ICR, as well as examine issuesof special interestto broaderOED studies.
      Each PPAR is subject to a peer review processand OED managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the PPAR
 is reviewed by the responsibleBank department and amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then sent to the
 borrowerfor review; the borrowers'comments are attachedto the documentthat is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive
 Directors.After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.

 About the OED Rating System
      The time-tested evaluationmethods used by OED are suited to the broad rangeof the World Bank'swork. The
 methodsoffer both rigor and a necessary levelof flexibilityto adapt to lending instrument, project design, or sectoral
 approach. OED evaluatorsall apply the same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and
 ratingscale used for each evaluationcriterion(more informationis available on the OED website:
 http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
      Relevanceof Objectives: The extentto which the project's objectives are consistentwith the country's current
 development prioritiesand with current Bank country and sectoral assistancestrategies and corporategoals (expressedin
 PovertyReductionStrategy Papers, CountryAssistanceStrategies, Sector Strategy Papers,OperationalPolicies).
 Possible ratings: High, Substantial,Modest, Negligible.
 theirEfficacy:  The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved,or expectedto be achieved,taking into account
      relative importance.Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extent to which the projectachieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higherthan the opportunity
 cost of capital and benefits at least cost comparedto alternatives. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
 This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
      Susfainabilify: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possibleratings: Highly Likely, Likely, Unlikely,
 Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or regionto make
 more efficient, equitable and sustainableuse of its human, financial, and natural resourcesthrough: (a) betterdefinition,
 stability,transparency, enforceability,and predictabilityof institutionalarrangementsand/or (b) betteralignment of the
 missionand capacity of an organizationwith its mandate,which derives from these institutionalarrangements. Institutional
 DevelopmentImpactincludes both intendedand unintended effects of a project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
 Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevantobjectiveswere achieved,or are expectedto be
 achieved, efficiently.Possibleratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
 Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

         This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for five loans to Brazil,
covering the period 1986-2001. The loans are: the Public Sector Management Project (Loan
2721-BR); the Private Sector Finance Project (Loan 3268-BR); the Rio Grande do Sul State
Reform Loan (Loan 4139-BR); the Rio de Janeiro State Reform Privatization Project (Loan
4211-BR); and the Mato Grosso State PrivatizationProject (Loan No. 4189-BR). A fourth in
the state reform loan series (SRLs) was approved for the state o fMinas Gerais (Minas Gerais
State Privatization Project -Loan 4318-BR), but never became effective.

        The Public Sector Management Loan (PSML), totaling US$29 million, was approved on
May 29, 1986. The project closed three years behind schedule inDecember 1993, after formal
amendment on three separate occasions. At closing, anundisbursed balance ofUS$5 million
was cancelled.

        The Private Sector Finance Loan (PSFL) was approved on August 31, 1990 inthe
amount o f US$300 million. The loan closed on the originally-scheduled date o f December 31,
1993. The remainingbalance o fUS$116 million was cancelled.

        The Rio Grande do Sul State Reform Loan (RS-SRL), inthe amount US$125 million,
was approved on March 4, 1997, and became effective June 31, 1997. It closed on schedule on
December 31, 1998. A final disbursement took place on December 9, 1998, when a balance o f
U S 2 0 million was cancelled.

        The Rio de Janeiro State Reform Privatization Project (RJ-SRL) was approvedJuly 17,
1997 for the amount US$250 million. It closedon the originally-scheduled date o f December
30, 1998, when a balance ofUS$50 millionwas cancelled.

        The Mato Grosso State Privatization Project (MT-SRL), totaling US$45 million, was
approved June 12, 1997, but didnot become effective untilApril 20, 1999. It closed on
September 30,2001, nearly three years later than originally envisaged.

        The Minas Gerais State PrivatizationProject (MG-SRL) was approvedon April 28,
1998 inthe amount US$170 million. The loan was never signed, and lapsed on October 19,
1999, eighteen months after Board approval.

        Justification for the PPAR. The five loans addressed central problems o f economic
management with different approaches andinstrumentalities. The Public Sector Management
Loanprovided technical assistance to strengthen the federal government's analytical and
institutional capacity, andbuild support for comprehensive reform. The Private Sector Finance
Loan promoted financial sector reform via a credit line to Brazil's most important national
development bank - BNDES. Inboth cases, the Brazilian experience serves to confirm lessons
leamed elsewhere from similar operations. Equally important, the passage o f time has altered
significantly the assessment o ftheir development impact, which was obscured at the time o f
first evaluationby a protracted period of economic instability.

        The four state reform loans (SRLs) cannot yet benefit from the same long-term
retrospective, but benefit from being analyzed ina cluster, which reveals facets o f their
performance which might, otherwise, have been obscured, hadthey been examined only
individually. The SRLs were innovative, because, for the first time, they involved the Bank in
direct lending to sub-national governments. Hence, their assessment furnishes
some first-time lessons.

        Sources. The PPAR i s based on Bankproject files, reports, and documents; data produced
bythe federal and state Brazilian governments; InternationalMonetary Funddocuments; academic
studies; discussions with Bank staff and ex-staff involved inthe projects; and interviews with
Brazilian federal and state officials, academics, andprivate sector representatives. Key Bank
documents included project identification and preparationreports, back-to-office reports, concept
and issues papers, Staff Appraisal Reports, President's Reports, loan agreements, supervision
reports, Project and ImplementationCompletion Reports, correspondence, and other project files.
Economic and sector reports from 1984 to 2001 (including Country Assistance Strategy
documents) have also been consulted. A mission visitedBrazil duringAugust-September 2001.

        PPAR Finding. Differences betweenPPAR and ICWPCRratings arise for two main
reasons: First, because the passageo f time may clarify the impact o f intangibles which leadto
alteredjudgments about the project's long-run achievement o f objectives; and, secondly, because
clustering project evaluations frequently yields insights that could not have been readily divined
through assessment of any single one o f them.

        The draft PPAR was sent to officials inthe federal and state governments, related agencies
and BNDES. Comments were received from BNDES on March27,2003. The comments inthe
original Portuguese, and an Englishtranslation, have been included inAttachment A and
Attachment B.

        Uponreview o f these comments, the text o f the PPARwas amended to report additional
details on BNDES efforts to restore compliance with the PSFL-covenanted ceiling on lending to
public intermediaries. N o further change inthe outcome rating was deemednecessary, since the
points made inBNDES' submissionhad already beentaken into account inthe draft PPAR,
which upgradedthe rating o f outcome from moderately unsatisfactory inthe PCR review to
moderately satisfactory. However, on the basis o f these comments, a decision was made to
upgrade the rating o f Borrower performance from unsatisfactoryto satisfactory. Inthe end,
BNDES' argument that a temporary breach o f the covenanted ceiling on lending through public
financial intermediaries was outweighed by long-term policy actions ensuring over-fklfillment o f
that and other covenanted ceilings proved persuasive.

Summary

1.       Attached i s the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the above loans to
Brazil, approved and operative from 1986 to 2001. A fourth loan inthe state reform loan (SRL)
series, approved by the Board for the State o fMinas Gerais (Minas Gerais State Privatization
Project - Loan4318-BR), never became effective. Although not formally assessed, its experience
i s briefly recounted.

2.       The Public Sector Management Loan (PSML) supported the strengthening of Brazil's
public sector planningandmanagement capabilities at the federal level inthe areas of information,
research, planning, budgeting, program implementationand operational control, including the
supervision o f state enterprises. The loan was designed under a wide umbrella as a multi-faceted
technical assistanceproject administered jointly by the ministries of planning and finance. Shifts
ingovernmentalpriorities over the lengthyimplementationposedmajor difficulties.

3.       The Private Sector Finance Loan (PSFL), one o f a number of credit line loans to Brazil's
National Development Bank (BNDES), supported the reorientation o f this public sector bank
toward the private sector, includingthe banking system, through its direct lending and lending
through financial intermediaries.

4.       The four StateReform Loans (SRLs) promoted state fiscal adjustment and structural
reforms, especiallyprivatization o f state-owned public enterprises.

5.       The results ofthe Public Sector Management Loan were mixed. However, the payoffs
from several components, including the SIAFI system, public enterprise reforms instrumental to
subsequent privatizations, and strengthened national income accounting, haveproven to be
substantial, justifying an upgrading o f the outcome rating from unsatisfactory to moderately
satisfactory. Moreover, the sustainability ofthese improvements, reinforced by complementary
reforms implementedby subsequent governments, justifies upgrading this rating from uncertain to
likely. Institutional development impact is ratedmodest, while Bank performance -owing to
careless accounting for project expenditures -is downgradedto unsatisfactory.

6.       Like the PSML, the Private Sector Finance Loan (PSFL) was preparedinthe late 1980s.
As with the PSML, some ratings were upgraded, relative to the PCRreview. Despite serious
flaws inthe loan design, the outcome o f the PSFLwas rated moderately satisfactory, rather than
moderately unsatisfactory. Noncompliance with a covenant requiring stagedreductions in
BNDES lendingthrough public financial intermediariesturned out, inthe end, to be only a minor,
and temporary, departure from a longer-term trend o f declining BNDES lending, directly and
indirectly, to the public sector. Given that this was the major stated objective o f the loan, an
improvement inthe outcome rating was inorder. Since the shift toward directing a larger
proportion ofBNDES lending to the private sector appears to be irreversible, sustainability is now
considered likely, rather than uncertain, as inthe PCR review. Institutionaldevelopment was rated
modest, unchangedfrom the PCR review, reflectingthat, althoughthe PSFL influenced a long-
term shift inBNDES policy on lending to the public sector, it had little impact on the internal
workings o fthat bank. Finally, due to the flawed loan design, the ratingo f Bank performance was
lowered from satisfactory to unsatisfactory.

7.      The SRLs were similar indesign and results. The outcome o f the Rio Grande do Sul SRL
i s rated moderately satisfactory, as it was inthe ES. The loan's many accomplishments were
partially offset by shortcomings inthe design o f the privatization strategy, inthe use o f
privatizationproceeds, from an unravelingo f state fiscal discipline in 1998, and inthe
establishment o f the state regulatory agency. Sustainability i s rated likely, up from uncertain,
since the privatizations are not reversible, and, more recently, because substantial follow-up fiscal
adjustment has taken place. Institutional development impact i s ratedmodest overall, although it
was substantial insome areas. Bankperformance i s ratedsatisfactory.

8.      The outcome o f the Rio de Janeiro SliL i s ratedsatisfactory, unchanged from the ES.
Given the irreversibility o fthe privatization actions, sustainability is rated likely. Hadthe state
regulatory agency not gotten off to such a poor start, institutional development impact would have
beenrated substantial, as inthe ES, but, because o fthis problem, and its longer-term
ramifications, institutional development impact was downgradedto modest. Bank performance i s
ratedhighly satisfactory, with special acknowledgment o fthe highquality o fthe technical
assistanceprovided.

9.      Ofthe three SRLs taken to effectiveness, the Mato Grosso SRL appearsto havebeenthe
most successful. The outcome o f the Mato Grosso SRL is ratedsatisfactory, with likely
sustainability. Despite a slow and uncertain start to the state regulatory agency, institutional
development impact was substantial, while Bank performance was satisfactory.

10.     Despite certain drawbacks, inthe end, the SRLs provided effective support to Brazil's
development priorities. When the currency crisis o f 1997-98 offered the opportunity for action,
the Bank proved itself adroit indiagnosingthe underlyingstate problems andpreparing suitable
interventions, which ultimately provided important underpinnings for the parallel fiscal
adjustment o f the federal government.

11.     Major lessons o f general applicability from the five loans assessedinclude:

     0  Continuity o f Bank interventions i s important for promoting lasting institutional change.
        Sub-nationalprogrammatic loans offer advantages, inthis respect, over time-bound SRLs.
     0  The principles o f the Levy Report remainrelevant for designing financial sector lending
        operations.
     a  Credit lines (financial intermediary loans) are unlikely to be appropriate instruments for
        supporting financial sector adjustment.
     a  Reconcilingproject expenditures fully and correctly at closing is a core Bank
        responsibility.
     a  An oversight agency operatingwithinan appropriate regulatory framework is animportant
        prerequisite to successful privatization o fpublic services.
     0  As investment loans, the SRLs provedto be cumbersome instruments for supporting
        structural change

1.      Introduction
Backgroundand Context

1.1     Duringthe late 1960s and 1970s, Brazil enjoyed aperiodofvigorous economic
expansion, with real GDP growth averaging nearly 9 percent annually. Exports grew rapidly,
andBrazil became an important industrial exporter of shoes, food products, andother products.
Highrates ofdomestic investmentwere financed, inpart, byhighlevels o fextemalborrowing,
andthe current account deficit grew to unsustainable proportions (Table 1.1). Inflation
burgeoned, as monetary and fiscal policies became increasingly lax, reinforced by a process o f
creeping indexation o f domestic prices, and the impact o f two international petroleum shocks
in1973 and 1979.

1.2     Bythe early 1980s, extemal debt hadmultiplied ten-fold from a decadepreviously,
leadingto a severe debt crisis. Unable to rollover existing debts, nor obtain new foreign loans,
the Governmentwas compelled to redress the extemal and intemal imbalances which had
accumulated. The externally-financeable current account deficit was quickly reduced, but so
was output growth, which slowed to a trickle. Suchwas not the case with domestic policies,

                                                         2


which, ifanything, became even more accommodative immediately after the onset ofthe debt
crisis than they hadbeenjust before.'

1.3       The acceleration o finflation duringthe 1980s and early 1990s prompted numerous
ineffectual efforts to stabilize. Price controls, price andwage freezes, delays inadjusting
public sector prices, alterations ofthe price indices on which indexationwas based, half-
hearted attempts to scale back indexation, debt moratoria, and even partial confiscationo f the
government's domestic debt inthe hands o f the public were tried, all without success.

1.4       A major ingredientmissingfrom the policy mix was concerted fiscal discipline.
Federal, state and municipal governments hadbecome over-dimensioned, while state-owned
enterprises hadproliferated. Fiscal imbalances imposed largeborrowing requirements on the
public sector, crowding out the private sector. Banking spreads remained high, andnumerous
government-imposed restrictions impededthe hnctioningo f financial markets. Public banks
channeled subsidized credit to preferred users, and served, ineffect, as fiscal agents for state
governments pursuingundisciplined fiscal policies.

1.5      Inanincreasinglyopen anddemocratic political environment, these economic problems
prompted a re-examination ofthe foundations o f Brazil's development strategy which persists
to this day.2 Only inthe early 1990s didthis search begin to yield h i t s . The Collor
administrationbegan redimensioningthe public sector - closing down federal agencies,
dismantling heavy-handed regulation, privatizing the first public enterprises, liftingprice
controls, reducing trade restrictions, andreforming the financial sector.

1.6      Butonly in1994were serious efforts to introduce macro-economic stabilization
policies begun, with the Plano Real. Usingthe exchange rate as a nominal anchor, it ledto a
systematically dismantling o fprice indexation inlabor, product, and financial markets. The
planwas an immediate success, yielding a sharp and lastingdecline inboth inflation and
p ~ v e r t y .Added to this were orthodox monetary and fiscal policies, the effects o f which canbe

1.7     Despite this dramatic improvement, the fiscal deficits o fthe state andmunicipal
governments continued to worsen. The Constitutiono f 1988 had made it virtually impossible
to fire state employees, whose wages constituted a highproportion o f total expenditures. When
rates o f inflation were high, control o fthe wage billcould be achieved by delays andpartial
adjustments. But, once price stability returned, these options no longer worked. Matters
worsened when the nominal interest rates the states were payingon their debt failed to decline
as fast as inflation, raising the real burden o f debt ~ervice.~      Ifthe state fiscal deficits couldnot
be contained, the Plano Real was effectively doomed. It was against this background o f events
that the three state reform loans (SRLs) were put together.


2.      Objectivesand Design

World BankAssistance Strategy

2.1     At the time the SRLs were conceived(1999, the relevant CAS specified several broad
objectives, including: (a) macroeconomic stabilization andmodernization; (b) poverty
alleviation andhumanresource development; (c) infrastructure andurbandevelopment; and (d)
environmentalprotection. Intermediate goals included assisting with the stabilizationplan, and
advising on fiscal, financial, social, monetary, tax, and privatization reforms. The instruments
specifiedto achieve these objectives included, inter alia, ESW on state finances and fiscal
management, loans to support state fiscal reform, the privatization of state banks, andtechnical
assistanceto the states. More recent CASs have reiterated these objectives.




  Thisproblemwas perceptively identified inNovember 1995by a Bankreport (Brazil -State Debt: Crisis and
Reform, No. 14842-BR) which served as the point o f departure for the subsequent SRLs.

Loan Objectives andDesign

Public Sector Management Loan

2.2     At its origin in1986, the Public Sector Management Loan(PSML) was comprisedo f
fourteen components, and a plethora o f subcomponents. They covered five major areas: (a)
the development o fbudgeting, evaluation, research andtraining inthe Ministryof Planning
(SEPLAN); (b) integrated systems for managingbudgetary execution, finances, and debt
through the recently established National Treasury Secretariat (STN) inthe Ministry of
Finance; (c) the imposition ofprocedures to evaluate state-owned enterprise (SOE)
performance and institute SOE rehabilitation; (d) improved information systems, including
national and regional statistics, and (e) research on future reforms. Jointly administered by
SEPLAN and the Ministryo f Finance, the loan contained no blueprint o f measurable,
anticipatedresults, which ledto confixion duringimplementation.

2.3     By 1991, Brazil's systemo fpublic administration remainedindire needo f
modernization. Boththe Bank and the incoming Government decided to transform the loan
into a vehicle to buildsupport for recasting the role o f the government inthe economy. The
ensuing redesign stressed flexibility, recognizing that project priorities would need to evolve
rapidly to keep pace with sweeping public administrationmodernization efforts.

Private Sector Finance Loan

2.4     The Private Sector Finance Loan (PSFL) emerged from discussions betweenthe Bank
and the Government about a possible financial sector loan to develop the private banking
system and increase the supply o f long-term private credit. However, the deteriorating
macroeconomic situation in1989-90 precluded a financial sector adjustment loan. Inits place,
the PSFLprovided a line o f credit intermediated by the BrazilianNational Development Bank
(BNDES). At the time of its preparation, an internal Bankreport, informallyknown as the
Levy report, questioned the rationale for line-of-credit operations inBank operations, and
proposeda number o f guidelines restrictingthe use o f such instruments. Box 2.1 summarizes
certain relevant principles which the PSFL largely ignored.

                                                               5



     Box 2.1: Relevant Principles of the Levy Report

     The Levy report deals with the preconditions for successful financial sector operations, including credit
     lines. Among the principles articulatedare:

           a. Financial sector reformand macroeconomic stability are intimately interrelated. Highinflation
               breedsuncertainty regardingprices, real interest rates and exchangerates, thus inhibiting savings
               and investment. Proposed financial sector operations, therefore, should be preceded by a
               determination that the macroeconomic environment is conducive to realizing their objectives.

           b. The market determinationof interest rates is an essential element o ffinancial market competition
               and o f the efficient mobilizationand allocation o f financial resources.. .Administered interest rates
               and credit lines usually lack the flexibility to adjust to changing economic conditions, [and] tend to
               lag behind inflationary and exchange rate expectations.

2.5        BNDES was an easy choice as intermediary for the Bank, since three credit-line
projects had already been implementedwith BNDES. Despite some past disagreements,
relations between the two institutions remained close andcooperative. And, from BNDES'
standpoint, a new credit-line project made sense, since lendinghad stagnated, and a new
administrationwas bent on modernizing andrefocusing BNDES on the private sector.

2.6        A keyconcern was the weakness o fthe private commercialbankingsector, which, at
the end of 1989, heldonly 40 percent o f total banking assets (see Table 4.1 on page 17). So,
the objectives o f the loanwere to: (a) reorient BNDES' direct lending and second tier lending
toward the private sector, including the banking system; (b) reduce credit segmentation; and(c)
strengthen credit policies andprocedures. Quantifiable criteria on BNDES lendingwere
complementedby measures to reorganizeBNDES so as to reduce directed credit lines and
strengthen BNDES' credit, planningand audit departments. The loan sought to finance only
technically sound, financially viable, and economicallyjustifiable private sector investments,
without regardto sector, regionor company sizea5As such, the loan was not a directed credit
line, as hadbeen the case with previous Bank loans to BNDES.

2.7        Were these the right objectives? Increasing long-term financing to the private sector
was a relevant objective, as was the aim o f increasingBNDES' lendingto the private sector, at
least as a short-term palliative. BNDES has been- and still is -the only financial intermediary
inBrazileffectively providing longterm financing to the privatesector. Ithasnoreal
competition. BNDES' dominance stems from its privileged access to payrolltax proceeds as a
source o f funding, which enables BNDES to lend at long-tenn rates, which (while positive in
real terms) are significantly lower than short-term marketrates. However, ifthe project goal
was to strengthen long-term credit markets andprivate sector competition inthose markets,
then the failure to include components to strengthen the capacity andinvolvement o fprivately-
owned banks represented a significant oversight.


   A controversial question not addressedinthe loanwas the issue o fcapital ownershp for borrowers. At the time
o f the loan, there was a BNDESrestriction against extending credit to foreign-owned firms. This restriction has
been subsequently relaxed.

                                                          6


2.8     Should the Bank have made the loan? The Bankhas long identified development o f
private long-term financial markets as a priority development goal. Yet the PSFLcredit line
operated at cross-purposes with that objective. StrengtheningBNDES' privileged role may
well have retardedthe emergence o f suchmarkets inBrazil.6 This drawback was not
considered so important at the time, because macroeconomic instabilitywas also undermining
the development o f such markets, andbecause the Bank still provided direct long-term credit
lines through public banks, a practice strongly criticized inthe LevyReport. Under conditions
o f macroeconomic stability, such a course of action would certainly have beenill-advised.

2.9     Yet, even under conditions ofmacroeconomic instability, such as prevailed at the time
the PSFL was being appraised, proceedingwith the operation can be viewed inretrospect as o f
dubious justification. Increasing instabilityhad actually depressed the demand for BNDES
investment finance, while rising inflation had distorted computation and interpretation of key
parameters usedinthe project analysis.

StateReform and PrivatizationLoans

2.10    By 1995, itbecame clear that emerging fiscal problems inthe states placedthe
consolidation and continuation o fthe country's macroeconomic stabilization at risk. This was
the point o f departure for development o fthe SRLs, which aimed to support fiscal adjustment
inthe states, apolicyobjective sharedbythe federal government.

2.11    A first questionconcerned selection o fthe states. The state o f Sgo Paulo, whose fiscal
problems and debt overhang were particularly large and daunting, was eliminated from
consideration, on the grounds it was too large, too politically-sensitive, andtoo weak inits
performance onpast Bank loans to the state to permit effective Bank involvement. The second
tier of states heavily weighted inthe aggregate o f state deficits anddebt includedMinas Gerais,
Rio de Janeiro andRio Grande do Sul. Onthe basis o fdiscussions with the political
leadership, Bank staff concluded that the will to deal with these problems was strong inthese
three states - a key selection criterion -justifring their inclusion inthe first round o f SRLs.
After exploratory discussions with other states, Mato Gross0 was added later.

2.12    Another selection criterion was the willingness to privatize or liquidate the state-owned
banks, all o fwhich constituted heavy fiscal drains. Inthe case Rio Grande do Sul, an exception
was granted, since the Government was unwillingto privatize its state bankbut chose, instead,
the state telecommunications company. This substitution was acceptable, because privatization
o f the Rio Grande telecommunications company provided a good test case for later
privatization o f the much larger federal telecom network. Indeed, subsequent privatization o f
the state-owned company (CRT) garnered a good price for the state.

2.13    Originally, the SRLs hadtwo primaryobjectives: (a) fiscal adjustment and(b) longer-
term structural reform, includingprivatization. Debtmanagement and debt workouts were to
form an integral part of the fiscal adjustment process. However, during loan preparation, it

  Inreality there are many explanations for the non-emergence oflong-term financial markets, including
regulatory considerations and financial contract enforcement.
'It  canbe noted that at the time o f loanpreparation for the PSFL (1990-91) the Levy Report was still being rather
contentiously discussed within the Bank.

                                                  7


became clear that a nationwide approach under the aegis o f the National Treasury (STN) to
refinance or write down state debts madebetter sense, ruling out a workout for just a few states.
Onthe other hand, untilthe impact o fthe nationwideworkout on individual state finances was
known, it became impractical to stipulate specific fiscal targets. Inthe end, the Ministry o f
Finance decided to refinance the state debts, rather thanpursue debt write-downs. These
politically-charged negotiations were not translated into individual state agreements untilearly
1998. To qualify for subsidized debt refinancing, states were compelled to adopt fiscal
adjustment programs, including quantified fiscal performance targets. With this delay, the
Bank faced a dilemma: (a) delay the SRLs untilthe debt refinancing agreements were
concluded, so as to ensure strong up-front fiscal conditionality; or (b) de-emphasize the fiscal,
and stress the non-fiscal structural reforms. Unwillingto allow this window of opportunity to
close, the Bank opted for the latter option.

2.14    Accordingly, non-fiscal reforms emerged as the focus ofthe SRLs. Hopes that
significant state government labor force reductions could be achieved were dispelled, once it
became clear that the requisite constitutional amendment would not be passed. Thereafter,
divestiture and the concessioning o f state enterprise services (including the creation o f
regulatory agencies to oversee the newly-concessioned services) became the foremost aims.
The objectives andkeycomponents o fthe SRLs are summarized inTable 2.1.

2.15 .Assessment of the SRL Objectives. The shift toward concessioning andprivatization
proved to be a sensible response to altered circumstances. It usefully supported the CAS
objectives o f macroeconomic stability, public sector modernization, andincreasedprivate
sector participation inthe provision o f infrastructure.

2.16    How well designed were the instruments? The design o fthese loans stressed front-
loading o f most Borrower actions, which were completed before Boardpresentation. With the
possible exception o fMinas Gerais (whose incoming administrationinJanuary 1999 was
philosophically opposed), participating state governments exhibited strong ownership o f the
loan objectives and design.

2.17    Although the SRLs supported reform measures more akinto adjustmentthan
investment loans, the Bank lackedprocedures at the time that would have permitted providing
adjustment lending to the states. So disbursement andprocurementhadto be handled as ifthe
SRLs were standard investment loans. This meant that it was impossible to synchronize
exactly loan disbursements with the timingo freform actions. Nevertheless, Bank staff devoted
considerable time - and resources -to working out disbursement arrangements consistent with
boththe intent o f the loans andprevailing Bankpractice.

   1. The electricity distribution andwater privatization/concessioning componentswere dropped inthe Minas Geraisduring
     the courseof loanpreparation.

2.17     An important design feature involved establishment o f state regulatory agencies for
those public services beingprivatized or concessioned. The experience withprivatization
amply demonstrates the needto have a regulatory framework inplace at the time o f
privatization. While some argue that separate regulatory agencies for each concessioned or
privatized public service is preferable (e.g., urban transportation, water, gas distribution, etc.),
the SRLs established a single regulatory agency ineach state covering all these services.8 The
justification for adopting this approach centered on: (a) resource constraints; (b) presumed
startup difficulties inestablishing several regulatory agencies; (c) possible benign externalities
from regulating multiple activities; and (d) a reduced likelihood o fregulatory capture. Should



8For some privatized activities inBrazil, a dedicated federal regulatory agency exists, e.g., for banking, electric
energy, and telecommunications.

                                                  9


subsequent experience demonstrate that separate regulatory agencies were necessary, it was
reasonedthat a single regulatory agency could easily be divided, as needed.


2.18     Timingthe approval andimplementation o fthe SRLs posedanother difficult challenge.
The planwas to time these loans so that they conformed to the electoral cycle, closing them
prior to the assumption ofoffice by incoming state governments onJanuary 1,1999. This
greatly compressed the time available for developing and implementing coherent economic
reformprograms, all the more so since roughly halfo f a four-year political cycle must be set
aside to undertake organization o f the new administration and, later, inpreparing for a new
election. Terminating the loans before a new administration took office reduced the risk that
parts o fthe reform program might not be implemented, due to a lack o f interest or commitment
by an incoming government. But, it also greatly increasedthe risk o frunningout o ftime
before complicated measures could be completed. Ofcourse, whenever a state governor was
re-elected, closure o f the SRL was readily extended. This was the case inMato Grosso,
enabling that Government valuable additional time to complete a complex process o f
concessioning water services and devolving them to the municipalities.

2.20     An added degree o fcomplexity pertained to the privatizationandconcessioning o f
water and sewerage services, whose functional assignments were greatly affectedby the
Constitution o f 1988. This Constitutiontransferred responsibility for providing these services
to the municipal governments. An exception was supposed to be made whenever water and
sewerage facilities were being shared bymultiple municipal governments, as i s often the case
inlargemetropolitanregions. Here, itwas believedthat the Constitution allowed the functional
responsibilityto remainwith the corresponding state, although this was not entirely clear, and
is currently the subject o f pending, clarifying legislation. Moreover, the Brazilian federation is
unlike the U S and German systems, inthat Brazilian municipalities have considerable
autonomy from state governments. This fact has greatly complicatedthe process of reaching
new agreements between the two. Particularly nettlesome were the problems o f establishing
municipal companies and concessions, and reimbursing state authorities for the physical
facilities and assets transferred. Finally, the absence o f any federal regulatory framework
meantthat project task managers could expect little guidance from that direction.

2.21     Inview o fthese uncertainties, some Bank staffadvisedagainst inclusionofthe state
water companies inthe SRLs. However, inthe end, it was decidedto support privatizationo f
the state water programs because of: (a) the strong interest andwill o f the state governments to
proceed; (b) the difficulties experienced nationwide infinancing and delivering adequate water
andsanitationservices; and (c) the potential for improving the quality o fthese services through
privatization. To mitigate the risk that privatization or concessioning might fail, "floating"
tranches were designed for the water components o f the SRLs.

3.      ImplementationExperience

Public Sector ManagementLoan(PSML)

3.1     The PSML became effective inDecember 1986, six months after Board approval. After
a slow start, the loan was redesigned in 1991,resulting incancellation o f $5 million o f the
original $29 million. Thereafter, the project gained momentum, closing three years late in
December 1993, after three amendments and four extensions.

3.2     The slowness inlaunching the project had several causes. First, the Bank andthe
Government underestimated the administrativedifficulties involved incontracting third-party
services and consultants, especially international consultants, for the various components.
Contracting was constrained byrestrictive features inBrazilian law andprocurement
regulations. Only after the UNDP became involved inthe project in 1991 was this constraint
overcome.

3.3     Second, the complexity o fthe project was daunting. The original project included
fourteen components, engagingthe same number of government agencies. Two economic
ministries - SEPLAN andthe Ministry of Finance-managed these components. A single
executing agency would have helped accelerate implementation ofthe loan, a step which was
not taken until five years after loan approval, when this responsibility was investedinPEA. A
Project Management Unitwas also established, and functioned reasonably well over the
remaining life o f the loan. Lastly, competition for funds ledto squabbling andjealousies
among Governmental agencies, tensions which could not be easily resolved. However, once
overall responsibility for project management was unified, this difficulty was attenuated.

3.4     Design and flexibility issues frequently arise inconnection with technical assistance
loans. One approach i s to introduce a great deal o f flexibility, sufficient to adapt to changes in
circumstances andor governments. However, this may deprive the loan o f adequate focus,
resulting inmeager results at termination. There i s also the risk that such a loan could become
a sort o f "slush fund", financing activities far from the original goals ofthe technical assistance.
The alternative is to have a fixed blueprint, with clearly defined objectives andmeasurable
results. The downside o f this approach is that it may become so rigid, as to preclude desirable
modifications due to changingcircumstances or government priorities. Inthe end, some
balance between these two approaches is called for. Unfortunately, the PSMLmayhave erred
on the side o f excessive flexibility, which ledto amorphous interventions.

3.5     The goals ofthe project were definedbroadlyenough to accommodate a wide set of
modifications. Over the course ofthree presidential administrations, Governmental priorities
changed frequently, forcing changes inloan content whichwere, at times, disruptive and even
wasteful. Examples o f components added after considerable discussion, then little utilized,
included components for creating a trade promotion andmarket information system inthe
Ministry of ForeignRelations and a tax administration andtraining facility inthe National
Revenue Service.

3.6     The PSMLwas implementedduringa period o fmajor instability (1986-1993).
Repeated stabilization attempts failed to hamess high, and accelerating, inflation. Political

                                                       11


uncertainty was heightened, not only by frequent changes inpolicy direction, but also by a
presidential impeachment, the enactment o f a new Constitution, and successive administrative
reforms. To some extent, these obstacles to implementationbluntedthe loan's ultimate
usefulness.

3.7      Banksupervisionofthe project was intensive andexpensive. Staffresponded flexibly
to changing Government priorities andadministrative mechanisms, modifyingproject content
and modalities appropriately. However, this required seventeen supervision missions over the
life of the loan, which consumed over 200 staff weeks. Moreover, supervision failed to pick up
inconsistencies inproject accountingwhich left US$2.6 millionunaccounted for (see Annex B
Table B1.3)

Private Sector Finance Loan (PSFL)

3.8      The PSFL, inthe amount o fUS$300 million, became effective on schedule inMarch
1991. Followinga dispute with the borrower, BNDES, over one o f the loan covenants
(described below), the loan was closed on its originally scheduled date inDecember 1993, with
an undisbursed balance o f US$116 million.

3.9      To meet a major project objective, increasingthe provision o f direct and indirect
BNDES lendingto the private sector, quantitative performance indicators were designed into
the loan covenants. These indicators are summarized inTable 3.1. BNDES' direct lending to
the public sector was scheduled to decline from 27 percent o f the total in 1989, to 19 percent in
1993, while indirect lendingthroughpublic sector financial intermediaries was set to decline
from 50 percent in 1989 to 40 percent in 1993. As can be observed, althoughthe direct lending
target was met and exceeded, lending through public sector financial intermediaries failed to
decline to covenanted levels, exceeding the limit inboth 1992 and 1993. This was the only
loan covenant which the Borrower failed to meet.

3.10     In1992, BNDES' senior management changed, andthe newpresident was less
supportive o f the project objectives than his predecessor. The new management stressedthat,
as a public institution, BNDES followed Government directives, andthat these directives
placed a priority on lendingto agriculture (where the public sector Banco do B r a dwas
dominant). At the end o fthat year, BNDES advised the Bank that, because of a Banco do
Brasil-financed agricultural credit program (FINAME) undergoing rapid expansion, the
covenanted ceiling on lending to public intermediarieswould be temporarily breached,
promising to restore compliance by late 1993.9 For purposes o fmeasuring compliance with
the end-1992 ceiling, BNDES proposed excludingits exposure to the Banco do Brasil
accounted for bythe FINAMEprogram. This was not acceptable to the Bank. InApril 1993,
BNDES wrote a second letter, indicating that it hopedto restore compliance by the end o f the
second quarter o f 1994 through new policy measures, including reductions inBNDES lending
to the Banco do Brasil for non-agricultural purposes andpromotion o f a larger role for
privately-owned banksinthe FINAMEprogram. Concerned that this meant a second
consecutive year inwhich compliance with a covenanted target hadbeenmissed, the Bank
counter proposedthat disbursements be suspended, and loan closing extended by one year until

  Ultimately, the ceilings for both 1992 and 1993 were missed.

                                                              12


compliance could be reestablished, but this proposal was not acceptable to the Borrower." So,
the PSFL was closed on its originally-scheduled date o fDecember 1993, leaving 39 percent o f
its committed funds undisbursed.

State Reform and Privatization Loans (SRLs)

3.11      The four SRLs were prepared nearly simultaneously.Project identificationbeganin
1995, followed by appraisals in 1996-97. The first approvedby the Board was for Rio Grande
do Sul, followed shortly thereafter by Rio de Janeiro and Mato Grosso. Loan effectiveness was
reached inJune 1997, April 1998, and April 1999, respectively for Rio Grandedo Sul, Rio de
Janeiro andMato Grosso. Although the Minas Gerais SRL was to first to undergo intensive
preparation, it was the last to be approved, and never became effective. Hadthe Govemor o f
Mato Grosso not been re-elected in 1998, a similar fate might havebefallen the Mato Grosso
SRL. The Rio Grandedo Sul andRio de Janeiro SRLs closedon schedule inDecember 1998,
but anextension was grantedfor the Mato Grosso loan, which closed inSeptember 2001-
nearly three years after the originally-envisaged date.

3.12      Front-Loaded Conditionality. Loanimplementationwas facilitated by front-loading
conditionality. Although this increasedpreparationcosts, it minimized implementation
problems, averting after-the-fact misunderstandings. Alteredcircumstances ledto ensuing
changes of conditionality duringpreparation, avoiding frictions further on downthe road.
Consequently, supervision was able to focus on verification that a few previously-agreed
actions left for the implementation stage had actually been completed on time.


loHadtheBank'scounterproposalbeenaccepted,itisllkelytheloanwouldhavebeenfullydisbursedbeforethe
end o f 1994, since, true to its promise of April 1993, BNDES did subsequently reduce its other operations with the
Banco do B r a d sufficiently to restore compliance before the end of 1994(Table 3.1).

                                                         13


3.13      Disbursement Mechanisms. Considerable time and energyhad to be invested during
preparation inmaking what were, inreality, policy-based adjustment operations conform to
Bank disbursement procedures for investment loans. Time slices o fthe states' public sector
investment programs were ineffect financed, with the specification and agreement on projects
conceivably suitable for Bank financing. Considerable, time-consuming efforts had to be
devoted to the identification o f eligible expenditures and subsequent follow-up verification
duringimplementation. The issue o fqualifying reimbursableexpenditures becameparticularly
problematic inMato Grosso, leadingto considerable misunderstanding and a major delay in
getting the loan signed. The political opposition inthe state legislature capitalized on the lack
o f clarity inthe disbursement mechanism by criticizing the treatment o f certain categories o f
reimbursable expense andoverall by questioning the loan's suitability for Mato Grosso's needs.

3.14      Time Constraintsfor CompletingActions. The deadline imposed by the political
calendar - December 1998 - left state governments with little time to carry out the agreed
reforms, many o f which were complex. The states were also constrained by a lack of staffwith
relevant experience, andby the press o f competing duties. Hence, for some o fthese reforms,
time ranout before they could be completed.

3.15      Water and Wastewater Services. Time limitations were especially acute inthe area o f
water andwastewater services. Critical legal problems had to be resolved, including the issue
ofhow to interpret and apply the relevantprovisions ofthe new Constitution o f 1988 with
regardto devolution to the municipalities. Secondly, politically-powerful opposition from the
state water companies, which, inthe case o fRio de Janeiro, employed 15,000 people, had to be
overcome during an election year. And deficiencies inmanagement and information systems
had to be rectified inshort order, so that the desired transfer o f assets could take place. For
example, inRio de Janeiro, the water company (CEDAE) hadno inventory o fits physical
assets or their whereabouts -much less any reliable information on their commercial value.

3.16      Because o f such difficulties, the privatization and concessioning o fwater services
envisaged intheir SRLs could not be completed inRio Grande do Sul and for Rio de Janeiro.
Only inone state, Mato Grosso, was the concessioning o fwater successful, andthat only
because re-election of a committed Governor justified grantingan extension o f loan closing so
that the process could be completed."

3.17      The question arises whether the Bank should have done likewise for the Rio de Janeiro
andRio Grande do SUI SRLs, inorder to initiate a dialogue with the incoming governments on
fulfilling the covenants onwater privatization. Inthe case o fRio de Janeiro, the new Governor
asked the Bank to extendthe loanclosing for additional time to conclude an agreement with the
state water authority, CEDAE. The Bank decision to not extend the loan may well have been
the correct course, as staff doubts about the state's commitment to the actions requiredfor
tranche release were reinforced by subsequent political developments. Inthe case o f Rio
Grande do Sul, the strong anti-private sector orientation o f the new Government -at least



11  Inthe endthe state government of Mato Grosso, tired of waiting for the federalgovernment to enact regulatory
legislation, decided to submit its own, very comparable legislation to the state assembly. Working through the
complex issues involved was assisted by Bank supervision o f the loan.

                                                         14


 duringits first year inoffice -reduced the likelybenefits ofkeepingthe loanopen for a longer
period o f time.

 3.18      StateRegulatory Agencies. The agencies andregulatory frameworks were not inplace
 at the time the major privatizations took place. Moreover, inRio Grandedo SUI andRio de
 Janeiro, the regulatory commissioners were appointed by the outgoing Govemors, producing
 immediate tensions with the incoming administrations. The result was that these were hobbled
 from the beginning.12 The absence o f staggered terms proved to be another design flaw, since
it meant that all commissioners inRio Grande do Sulhadto bereplaced at once, raising doubts
 about the continuity and future direction o f the AGERGS.


4.        Outcome andAssessment

PublicSector Management Loan

4.1       The objectives o f the Public Sector Management Loan supported the Bank's country
assistance strategy. The success o f individual components was mixed, but, on balance, the
overall outcome i s rated moderately satisfactory.

4.2       The most successful components entailed support for: (a) the national statistical
system; (b) integration o f the federal accounting and monitoring system (SIAFI) inthe National
Treasury; and (c) reform o f the state-owned enterprises and the system that controlled them.
Major improvementsto the national statistical system were particularly notable for the national
income accounts. Prior to the PSML, the national accounts were housedinthe Getulio Vargas
Foundation, and estimated inprecarious and incomplete fashion. The PSML facilitated the
transfer o f these accounts to the IBGE(Brazilian Statistical Institute), realignment o f the
estimating methodology with international practice, enhanced reliability, and improved
timeliness.

4.3       The establishment o fthe S U F I system o fintegratedpublic financial accounting
enabled the federal government to monitor expenditures andbudget execution transparently;
receive information on a timely basis; and increase expenditure control, all o fwhich were key
to ensuring greater fiscal discipline. Without such a system, the major fiscal adjustment
achieved duringthe late 1990s might not have been possible. Subsequently, SIAFI's scope was
extended, although not with Bank financing, to the state andmunicipal governments -the so-
called SIAFI-EM. More recently, the Bank has supported further improvements inthe SIAFI
system via an FYOl technical assistance operation.

4.4       The program for evaluation and, ifnecessary, rehabilitation o f the SOEs under control
o f the Secretariat for State Enterprises (SEST) had, as a sub-text, the privatization o f the most
problematic enterprises, although this was not an explicit objective. First-time operational
audits produced recommendations for improving performance, which then routinely became
*'  Inthe case ofRio deJaneiro, the incomingGovernor immediately firedallthe staffofthe regulatory agency,
leaving the newly appointed Commissioners with little professional support but with considerable encouragement
for their ownresignations. All of the originally appointed Commissioners were eventually replaced. This early
setback delayed making the operationalization o f the agency effective.

                                                  15


SEST requirements. Thanks to the extensive privatization which ensued, the need for SEST
oversight gradually diminished, to the point where the Secretariat was phased out o f existence.

4.5      While public asset administration and training were greatly improved, there were also
some notable failures. For example, progress was scant toward strengthening the budgetary
process, which resided inthe PlanningSecretariat (SEPLAN). Institutional rivalries developed
between SEPLAN andthe Ministry o fFinance (which houses the National Treasury). The
SIAFI system was perceived by SEPLAN as a threat to its budgetary authority, so integration
o f the two systems -budgetary and financial monitoring -never took place. Attempts under
the aegis o fthe loan to modemize the auditing system also encountered institutional resistance,
andwere, consequently, hstrated.

4.6      On balance, the impact o f successful components outweighed the failures. Moreover,
the intangible accomplishments, such as buildinga consensus for reform through research and
analysis o f public sector modernizationoptions, were considerable. Many Brazilians involved
intheproject emerged later as reform-mindedpolicy-makers. And, inaperiodo f limited
budgetaryresources, the PSMLprovided vital support to the Institute o f Applied Economic
Research (PEA),which served as an incubator for policy-makers andreformproposals. All of
these seedsnourished by the PSML were to bear h i t inthe policy reforms o fthe late 1990s.

4.7      The changing content o f the PSML can be seenby comparing originally-budgeted
amounts for different components to the amounts actually spent (Annex ByTable B1.3). Given
that the expenditure categories are broadly defined, the comparison actually understates the
change inloan substance. The budgetedamounts didnot predict accurately how the resources
wouldbe applied, or whether they wouldbe successful. The SIAFIcomponent             - arguablythe
loan's most striking, visible and enduringsuccess - absorbed slightly more thanhadbeen
originally budgeted. But other successful components, such as modemizing national income
accounting and rehabilitating state enterprises, actually wound up costing less thanhadbeen
originally planned. For example, the PSML failed to disburse for all the privatization activities
envisaged (andwas, therefore, considered a failure at the time o f its initial evaluation). But the
privatization work which didproceed under the loan eventually proved to be pivotal.

4.8      Managerially and administratively, the PSMLwas too complex. Its components were
far too numerous to be pursued effectively. Ineffect, it was a huge, and risky, gamble. The
fact that the gamble paid o f f ina few specific instances, with significant benefits for Brazil,
should not be seen as an endorsement o fthis kindo f approach to providing technical assistance.

4.9      From this longer perspective, substantial payoffs from several components      - the SIAFI
system, public enterprise reform, and the strengthened system o f national income accounting     -
loom larger than they did at the time OED reviewed the project completionreport (PCR).
Therefore, the PPAR upgrades the outcome rating from unsatisfactory to moderately
satisfactory. The sustainability o f these improvements is considered likely, compared to
uncertaininthe PCR review.

4.10     The institutional development impact isjudged to be modest, reflectingthe substantial
impact o f a few components, mixed inwith a larger number having no impact. Borrower
performance -reflecting the many shifts inpriority andbehavior which disrupted

implementation o fthe project -is rated unsatisfactory. These latter two ratings reconfirm the
ratings originally providedby OED's original PCR review. On the other hand, Bank
performance has been downgraded and i s now rated as unsatisfactory. Inconsistencies in
project accounting and supervision have come to light, as revealed ina more exacting
examination o f the PCR. OED was unable to fully reconcileproject expenditures from the
PCR, the numerous supervision reports or the project files (see Annex B Table B1.3). These
inconsistencies marredan otherwise satisfactory Bank performance.



Private Sector FinanceLoan

4.11    The PCR evaluation of the Private Sector Finance Loan (PSFL) was heavily influenced
bythe failure o fBNDES to comply with a single covenant, namely that it channel no more than
40 percent ofits lending through public sector financial intermediaries during 1992-93. Non-
compliance ledto a disagreement about remedies, ultimately leading to the suspension, and
eventual termination, of the loan, leaving a large undisbursed balance.

4.12    Lending to the Private Sector and the Private Banking System. ExaminationofTable
3.1 above reveals that the period o fnon-compliance was relatively brief, representing only a
temporary departure from the long-term trend showing amarked contraction inBNDES
lending throughpublic sector financial intermediaries. By 1999 and 2000, BNDES had fallen
to less than halfthe covenanted ceiling o f 40 percent.I3 Meanwhile, BNDES lending to the
public sector, which hadbeen declining since the late 1950s, continued to fall, from 12percent
in1993 (already substantially below thanthe covenanted ceiling of 19percent) to 2percent in
2000. l4  Withbotho fthe covenanted PSFLtargets now surpassed, the goal ofinducing
BNDES to increase activities supporting the private sector andreduce lendingto the public
sector can be considered fully met.

4.13    The general objective, to stimulate growth inthe private bankingsystem, was integral to
the Bank's country assistance strategy. The growth o f private sector banking, inabsolute terms
andrelative to the public banks, i s shown inTable 4.1. Bythe end o f 2000, private banks
accounted for 55 percent o f total bankingsector assets and 66 percent o ftotal equity, up from
40 and 35 percent, respectively, in 1989.

4.14    Financial Performance. BNDES has continued to improve its financial performance.
Non-performing loans fell from a three-year average o f 9.6 percent of the portfolio in 1990-92
to 2.7 percent in 1998-2000.'5 Retumon equity capital averaged 7.6 percent duringthe 1995-
2000 period.

4.15    Efficiency and Cost Effectiveness. Efficiency ina development bank is hard to
conceptualize or measure. One measure, albeit flawed, is the ratio o f disbursements per
employee over time. It is flawed because the denominator includes employees engaged innon-
lendingservices, such as risk analysis andresource acquisitions through capitalmarkets.
Nevertheless, the fact that the ratio for BNDES increased considerablybetween 1989 and2000
(Table 4.2) suggests a large improvement inoperating efficiency. Part o f this improvement
stems from an internalreorganization in 1990. As canbe seen, this ledto a significant reduction
inthe number of employees.

4.16    There i s little question BNDES has emerged as a stronger development institution. It
now places much greater emphasis on lending for social development andhumanresources,
and even lends to foreign firms, which was prohibited untilits intemal procedures were
changed duringthe 1990s. It also became an effective executor o f Brazil's national

comparable, but the trend seems undeniable.

privatization program. Bank technical assistance associated with the PSFL, although not
formally a part o f it, may have helpedinthis regard.16

4.17     PPAR Assessment. The PPARupgrades the outcome o fthe Private Sector Finance
Loan from the moderately unsatisfactoy rating of the PCR review to moderately satisfacto y.
Covenant noncompliance was a temporary departure from the longer-term trendtoward
reducedBNDES lending to the public sector andthroughpublic sector banks. Since there is
little likelihood such a vast transformationwill be reversed, sustainability i s rated likely (as
comparedto uncertain inthe PCR review). As inthe PCR review, institutional development is
ratedmodest, reflecting the fact that the PSFL had limitedimpact on the internalworkings of
the BNDES.

4.18     Bankperformanceis downgraded to unsatisfactoy,inview o fthe flawed andill-timed,
approach to promotion o f a market for long-term credit, which largely ignored the lessons o f
experience highlightedinthe Levy Report issued several months before appraisal and widely
discussed within the Region. However, the Borrower's performance has beenupgraded to
satisfactoy, considering that, despite temporary non-compliance with the financial
intermediary covenant, BNDES subsequently took measures whichmore than compensated for
that lapse. For all its deficiencies, the PSFL had a lasting impact on later BNDES decisions
which favored expansion ofprivate long-term credit markets.

State Reform and Privatization Loans

4.19     Role of the SRLs in Supporting StateFiscal Adjustment. The SRLs provided important
support to the fiscal adjustment process inthe states, a fuller discussiono f which can be found
inAnnex C. Thevery fact ofBank involvement strengthened STN's hand,providing
additional inducements for good fiscal behavior by the states. SRL preparation entailed a high
degree o f defacto technical assistanceto these states, while privatizationhelpedridthem o f a
hugefiscal burden. For example, inRio de Janeiro, the four state SOEs eventually privatized
hadabsorbed transfers equivalent to about one month o f the state's net current revenues.

4.20     Privatization Strategies. The SRLs contained no explicit strategy for privatization, but
two elements were evident. First, privatizationo f state-owned banks was given highpriority,
and became a criterion for state participation. Secondly, the maximizationo f sales returns was
considered more important than the maximization o f economic efficiency. Two examples will
suffice to illustrate this. First, none o f the state regulatory agencies or associated regulatory
regimes were inplace by the time the major privatizations were completed. Secondly, the
company acquiring the state-owned telecommunications company inRio Grandedo Sul was
granted a two-year monopoly over fixed line services, which likely increased the sale price.
Only in2001 was anew entrant admitted, which, by common account, hada markedimpact on
the quality o f consumer service.

4.21     Effects of Privatization. With one or two exception^,'^ the SRL-supported
privatizations appear to have had significantly positive effects." The fiscal drain on state

revenues was stanched, and the companies became net payers o ftaxes. Investments increased,
as did financial and operating efficiency, andthe quality and quantityo f service improved.
Even instates where the SRL privatizations were not politically popular, such as inRio Grande
do Sul andRio de Janeiro, state officials now concede that, although flawed, the privatizations
have since yielded significant fiscal and consumer benefits.

4.22       Use of PrivatizationProceeds. Given the fungibilityo fresources, the use o f
privatization proceeds must be set ina broader context. The Bank followed the leado f STN,
which, during SRL preparation, hadnot yet evolved a set o frules for how any sales proceeds
should be applied. With the exception o f Minas Gerais, Bank staff encouraged, but didnot
require, the states to use the proceeds for reducingtheir sizeable debts. However, with the
advent in 1998 o f elections, pressures to permit the states to spend the proceeds on politically
popular programs provedirresistible. Since there were no applicable loan covenants inthe two
Rio SRLs or inthe Mato Grosso SRL, the Bank hadlittle choice but to acquiesce. Itcouldbe
argued that the Bank should have anticipated an accommodation o f this sort, but this would be
expecting clairvoyance as well as prudence. Less understandable is why neither the Banknor
STN insisted onbindingexpenditure ceilings for the fiscal years duringand immediately
following the privatizations beingsupported. l9

4.23      InRio de Janeiro, privatizationproceedswere insignificant, becausethe statewas
selling a bank (BANERJ) with a large negative net worth. What little there was didbecome a
down payment to refinance the state debt. InRio Grande do Sul, privatizationproceeds o f
R$3.8 billion (approximately US$3.6 billionat the time) funded a substantial increase inroad
construction and other public investments (Table 4.3)."                 InMatoGrosso, use ofthe substantial
proceeds generated bythe 1997privatizationo fthe power company (CEMAT) didnot figure in
negotiationswith either the Bank or STN. Giventhe fungibility o fresources, it is still unclear
how they were applied. InMinas Gerais, the SRL -which was the last to go to the Board (in
April 1998) -didinclude a conditionthat the proceeds from the sale o ftwo statebanks be
appliedto the reductiono fthe state's debt with the federal government, a condition that was
rendered inoperative when the loan failed to become effective.



l7 exceptionmaybethesuburbancommutertrainsystem(FLUMITRENS) inRiodeJaneiro. Afterinitial
    One
improvement during 1998 and 1999 invarious indicators, such as ridership, the numberand condition o f coaches,
the regularity and frequency o f trains, investment, and passengerrevenues, a temporary deterioration of service
and financial performance occurred. Although performance remains less satisfactory than originally projected, it is
still better than that prior to the concessioning. More recently, there are signs that the originally planned
improvements inrolling stock are now being implemented, and that demand is recovering. The state regulatory
agency has, so far, not taken an active role inresolving disputes between the state and the concessionaire over
financial commitments, which clearly falls within its responsibility. By contrast, the concessioning of the Rio
Metro proceeded without major difficulties.
18This conclusion is basedinlarge part upon informationcontainedinthe implementationcompletion reports
(ICRs), and is consistent with more general analyses o fprivatization inBrazil. For a well-founded representative
analysis, see Armando Castelar Pinheiro, "Impactos Microecononhicos de Privatizaqlo," Pesquisa e
Planejamento Econbmico, Vol. 26, No. 3 (December 1996), pp. 357-398.
l9 State debt contracts with the STN were negotiatedaround this time, but never linkedto the SRLs. The state
contracts eventually didcontain binding annual fiscal targets which have beensuccessfully implemented since.
2o A state-owned thermoelectric generating facility (CGTEE) transferred to the federal government generated
R$508 million, which became a downpayment toward an S T N debt refinancing agreement.

4.24     Establishment of Regulatory Agencies and Frameworks. Appropriately, the SRLs
contained provisions for state regulatory agencies to oversee the services privatized or
concessioned to private operators. Significant difficulties were involvedinthe establishment o f
these regulatory agencies, and, insome cases, hadto be bypassed so as not to slow the
momentum o fprivatization. This decision, to privatize even though the regulatory framework
was not fully inplace, made sense, given the need to complete the process before the end of the
electoral cycle inall four states. Still, it was unfortunate that Bank technical assistance, which
hadbeen vital to the creation o f these regulatory agencies, ceasedat loan closing, while they
were still intheir infancy. Inall cases, the regulatory start-up has been delayed and flawed.
All o fthese agencies have experienced significant "teething" problems, bluntingtheir impact
on the newly-privatized companies and leaving uncertainwhat their ultimate effectiveness will
be.

4.25     Should the SRLs have included the state water companiesfor privatization or
concessioning? Itwas understood from the beginningthat attemptingto privatize or
concession water services posedhighrisks. Evenso, the legal, administrative andpolitical
difficulties were underestimated. Only inMato Grosso didthe gamble pay off, to the
considerable credit o fthe state and federal governments and the Bank. InRio de Janeiro, a
last-minute court rulingat the end o f the Alencar administration made the privatization o f
CEDAE unviable. But, there, as inRio Grande do Sul, SRL-sponsored studies and discussions
haveplantedusefbl seeds which may yet bear fruit.

4.26     Cost of SRL Preparation. Bankcosts for processing the SRLs inRio Grande do Sul
(US$727 thousand) andRio de Janeiro (US$955 thousand) were highrelative to those inMato
Grosso (US$294 thousand). Clearly, there has been considerable learning by doing, since the
Mato Grosso SRL was, ifanything, more ambitious indesign than its predecessors.
Considerable time and effort were expended intrying to fit disbursement and procurement
procedures intended for investment lending into what were essentially adjustment loans. The
recently-developed Sub-nationalAdjustment Loan (SNAL) i s aninstrument which should
avoid much of this unnecessary effort, cutting Bank processing costs, and allowing the
attention o f Bank andBorrower to be focused where it belongs -on policy issues, not
disbursement minutiae.

4.27     Context of PPAR Assessment. Distinguishingthe benefits o f a specific loan-or series
o f loans - from the concurrent benefits o f other Bank activities i s difficult. Economic and
sector studies, formal and informal technical assistance, andthe incidental benefits o f daily
contact between Bank and Government staff have all helpedfoster fiscal reform and adjustment
inthe Brazilianstates.21 That beingsaid, itmaybeworthwhile citingone former stateplanning
secretary, who, having dealt with a number o f development loans, argued that the SRL was by
far the most beneficial, mainly because it triggered profound changes inthe way the state's
political leadership thought about the role o f government inpromoting development, and the
need for greater efficiency inthe delivery o fpublic services.

4.28     PPAR Ratings. The ratings table on p.v displays the individual project ratings rendered
inthis, andinprevious evaluations ofthe SRLs, which are elaborated below.


21  The interaction of these interventions is discussed more fully inAnnex C.

                                                        21


4.29      Rio Grande do Sul. Like the OED ES, the PPARrates the overall outcome o fthe Rio
Grande do Sul SRL as moderately satisfactory. The loan's many accomplishments were
diminished by shortcomings inthe design o fthe privatization strategy, sub-optimal allocation
o fthe proceeds, an unraveling o f state fiscal discipline duringloan implementation, and a
flawed approach to establishing a regulatory agency. Unlikethe previous state government, the
present administrationaccepts that privatized services have brought improvedquality and
widespread social benefits. Hence, political support for the reforms has increased, andtheir
sustainability is now considered likely, rather than uncertain. All other ratings remain
unchanged from the ICR review. Institutional development impact is rated modest, although its
impact was substantial insome areas. Bankperformance is ratedsatisfactory, but Borrower
performance unsatisfactory, given how the privatization proceeds were spent, and the
relaxation o f state fiscal discipline duringloan implementation, a trend which was, fortunately,
reversed, but only after the SRL had closed.

4.30      Rio de Janeiro. Because o fthe poor start-up o f the state regulatory agency, a fact which
was not evident at the time the ES was prepared, institutional development impact was
downgraded fromsubstantial to modest. All other ratings remain unchanged. The outcome o f
the Rio de Janeiro SRL is ratedsatisfactory, and sustainability likely. Bank performance is
rated highly satisfactory, notablyinrecognition o fthe highquality o f technical assistance
provided. Borrower performance is ratedsatisfactory.

4.3 1 Muto Grosso. The PPAR re-affirms all the ES ratings. Indeed, the Mato Grosso loan
appears inretrospect the most successful o f the three SRLs actually implemented. Outcome is
ratedsatisfactory, with likely sustainability. The institutional development impact o f the loan
i s rated as substantial, despite a slow and uncertain start-up for the state regulatory agency.
BothBank andBorrower performance are rated satisfactory.

4.32      Minas Gerais. Although the first to be prepared, the Minas Gerais S R L was the last to
go to the Board (April 1998), and never became effective. After many disagreements about the
content o fthe state's fiscal adjustment andprivatization program, agreement was reached on a
set o f ambitious measures, which left aside the difficult fiscal problem.22 That program-the
basis for the loan -consisted o f four major, largely up-front, components: (i)                   the sale of the
two state-owned commercial banks; (ii) concessioning o fhighway maintenance on a toll-
                                                 the
financed basis; (iii) sale o f the state gas company; and (iv) the creation o f a new regulatory
                        the
framework for private providers o fpublic services. Only the sale o f the banks was ever
completed. A change o f administration inJanuary 1999 brought an incoming Governor who
displayed little zeal for reform. As a consequence, after reaching an advanced stage o f
processing, the other objectives were never achieved, andthe Bank appropriately allowed the
undisbursed SRL to lapse.



22 The 1996 primary deficit was enormous - amounting to 17 percent o f current net revenues. Although unwilling
to include performance targets inthe SRL, the state's new political leadershp soonrealizedfiscal adjustment was
inescapable. This was because a performance contract previously reached with the federal government to refinance
the state's staggering debt would have triggered a cut-off o f federal transfers. and higher interest rates inthe event
o fnon-compliance. Over the next two years, Minas Gerais converteda primary deficit o f 13.9 percent of current
net revenues in 1998 to a primary surplus o f 0.5% percent in2000 (Annex C Table C.l), a remarkable
accomplishment which occurred entirely outside the auspices o f the SRL.

5.      Lessons Learned

5.1     The lessons learned are not particularly new, especially for those deriving from the
technical assistance andcredit line loans. Indeed, they have beenreiterated inmany OED
reports and PPARs. Major lessons o f general applicability from the five loans assessed
include:


0   Technical assistance which lacks a clear blueprint i s hardto manage, and provides too
    manytemptations to apply unallocated funds to low-priority activities.


0   Macroeconomic instability and the absence o f market-determined interest rates greatly
    increase the risk o f failure for financial sector loans, confirming the findings o f the Levy
    Report.


    0   Credit lines (financial intermediary loans) are unlikely to be appropriate instruments for
        supporting financial sector reform.


    0   Fullandcomplete accounting for project expenditures is a core Bankresponsibility.


    0   Lending to sub-national governments can be a powerhl instrument for advancing
        specific country strategies.


    0   Continuity o f Bank interventions across state administrations promotes lasting
        institutional change inBrazilian state governments. Sub-national programmatic loans
        may prove to be better instruments thantime-bound SRLs. A prime example is the
        regulatory agencies, which have sufferedbecause, once the SRLs closed, the Bank
        effectively abandoned the agencies while they were still intheir infancy.


    0   A functioning regulatory agency with an establishedregulatory environment isvital to
        optimal privatization o fpublic services.


    0   The benefits o f dialogue during loanpreparation and supervision can outweigh the
        importance o f the funding, when complex issues o fprivatization and regulation are
        being addressed. Officials inall three SRL states cited the Bank's informal technical
        assistance as the most important benefit they derived from these loans.


    0   The SRLs were cumbersome instrumentsbecause o f their investment loan
        characteristics. Sub-national adjustment loans (SNALs) should be a major
        improvement, allowing the Bank and Borrower to focus on what is important -policy
        reforms -rather than the minutiae o f disbursement andprocurement.

 a.   Finaldisbursementsas reconstructedfrom the loan's incompletePCR. It shouldbe notedthat there is inconsistencyin
      the totals, which cannotbe accountedfor by managementcosts alone. Inother words, there seem to bemissing
      componentexpenditureitems. An examinationof the supervisionfiles didnot clear up the mysteryof the
      unaccountedfor US$2.6 million. Part ofthe explanationlies with the improperaccountingandnon-inclusionof
      projectmanagement fees, which includedat least US$121 thousand. Inaddition, the Regionnotesthat "The project
      implementationperiod(1987-1993) was ahighly turbulent time for Brazil's economy, with double andtriple digit
      monthly inflationratestoward the endof the period. It i s not inconceivablethat...theapparently "missing" project
      componentscouldbe due to the effect ofrapid devaluationof local currency vis avis the US$ during thattime period.
      The staffpreparingthe PCRandSPN reports (andconceivablyeven the PIUinformation systems) could well have
      useddifferent exchangeratesto convert local currency-denominatedexpenditures into US dollar values than the

                     Brazilian State Fiscal Adjustment andReform

12.       The SRLs were consistent with emphasis o f the Country Assistance Strategy on
macroeconomic stabilization and modernizationo fthe public sector. The Plano Real,
promulgated in 1994, was correctlyperceivedbythe Bank as the linchpin for re-
establishing a climate conducive to growth, development, andpoverty alleviation. By
1995, it was clear that the requisite fiscal discipline was still not inplace, jeopardizing the
entire program. Central to this issue were the fiscal imbalances o fthe states, which the
SRLs were invented to address.

13.       StateFiscal Adjustment and Reform. Shortly after the initiation o f the Plano
Real, the federal government sought to rein inthe free-spending states by restricting their
ability to borrow, linking access to some fiscal transfers to their fiscal performance,
promoting administrative reforms, and empowering the federal government to impose
harder budgetary constraints on the states through the Law o f Fiscal Responsibility.

14.       Thanks to these measures, the combined state andmunicipal government primary
balance moved from a deficit equivalent to 0.55 percent o f Brazilian GDP in 1996, to a
primarysurplus o f0.57 percent in2000, reversing a longstandingdeteriorationinstate
fiscal performance. Disaggregationo f state from the municipal accounts, as displayed in
Annex Table B1.4, shows that the aggregate state primary balance improved from a
deficit o f 0.41 percent o f GDP in 1998 to a surplus o f 0.42 percent in2000.23


15.       Inpreparingthe SRLs, the Bankstaffaccurately diagnosedthe states' fiscal
problems, despite reliance on projections which didnot prove to be particularly accurate
(Annex Table B1.5). The fiscal perfonnance o fthe four states inwhich SRLs were
initiated is presented inAnnex Table C.1. All four achieved a substantial adjustment, and
reduced the share o f current net revenues going toward personnel costs. By 2000, only
Rio Grande do Sul, burdenedwith a highpercentage o f emplo ee pensioners, still hada
primary deficit, which was subsequently turned into a surplus!                 Nonetheless, all four
remainburdenedbyheavy indebtedness, impedingtheir retumto creditworthiness, and
placing the sustainability o ftheir fiscal adjustment efforts under a cloud o f doubt.




23 A similar improvement occurred inthe state public sector enterprises, whose aggregate primarydeficit
o f 0.07 percent o f GDP in 1998 was transformed into a primary surplus o f 0.14 percent in2000. Combining
state governments with their SOEs, the total adjustment amounted to slightly more than one percent o f
GDP over a two-year period.
24 The state governments show a small deficit in2001, followed by a small surplus in2002.

Notes:
 1. Debt acknowledgedby the state interms of its responsibilityto service, as well as by the STN. Someof the growth
     during 1997-2000is due to inclusionofpreviouslyunrecognizeddebt.
  2. Real current revenues are definedslightly differently fromCurrent Net Revenuesbut are usedinthe Law 9496, which
     gives the STN the authorityto undertakedebt refinancingwith the states.
Source: CalculationsbaseduponSTN data.

16.      Thanks to a new law goveming the refinancing o f state debt, the National
Treasury (STN) became the lead federal agency charged with imposing fiscal discipline
onthe states. Debt refinancing contracts are now routinely negotiated by STNwith all
Brazilian states, except Tocantins, which has virtually no debt. The inducements for
entering into these contracts include more favorable terms o f service on the refinanced
debt, interest capitalization, and extended repayment periods.

17.      Puttingthis systeminplace was conceptually, administratively, andpolitically
complicated. The contracts contain quantifiable fiscal performance targets for primary
balances, debt ratios, personnel and investment expenditure ratios, etc. Inthis sense, they

                                                  30                                      Annex C

resemble fiscal adjustment programs o fthe type the IMFtypically negotiates with
sovereign governments. Debt default or noncompliance can result inwithheldfederal
transfers andhigher interest rates on the refinanceddebt.

18.      Role ofthe Bank. The Bank provided importantassistance o f various sorts toward
establishing the fiscal framework and control mechanisms. The PSMLhelpedthe STN
develop an integratedfinancial accountingand information system covering all
governmentallevels (the SUFI). Second, Bank ESWhelpedthe federal government
recognize early on that there was an emergingstate debt crisis, and aided inthe
identification o fpossible solutions. Day-to-day strategic advice hrther illuminated the
policy options, even though a number o fthem - such as a proposedconstitutional
amendment to facilitate laying o f f state employees, and a Brady-style initiative for
dealing with the overhang o f state debt -had to be discarded on grounds o fpolitical
infeasibility.

19.      Third, technical cooperationandinformaltechnical assistance to the STNwere
providedthrough the SRLs, including not only discussions with Bank staff on appropriate
fiscal targets for the refinancing contracts, but also grant-financed training. One seminar
for state secretaries o f finance to Australia andNew Zealand proved particularly
effective. One participant later notedthat what he learned on this tour proved critical in
convincing his Governor that the state needed to adopt a stringent fiscal adjustment
program andprivatize the state's public enterprises.

20.      A fourth form o fsupport were personnel exchanges. One ofthe mainarchitects
o f the fiscal adjustment framework for the states was a Bank staff member on external
assignment, who had also served two years at the IMF.

21,      Fifth,technical assistanceprovidedas partoffollow-on lendingoperations has
hrther strengthened federal      institution^.^^ A Fiscal and Administrative Reform Special
Sector Adjustment Loan (the FARL), which became effective inJune 2000, supports:
(i) adherence to the Fiscal Stability Program; (ii)      implementation o f state debt refinancing
contracts; (iii) enforcement o f ceilings on state borrowing: (iv) preparation o fthe Law o f
Fiscal Responsibility; and (v) administrative reforms. The First Programmatic Fiscal
Reform Structural Adjustment Loan (PFR-SAL), approved inJanuary 2001, had similar
goals.




25 The most prominent examples are the Fiscal and Administrative Reform Loan, the First Programmatic
Fiscal Reform Structural Adjustment Loan, and the Fiscal and Financial Management Technical Assistance
Project.

     1    Duringthe November 1984mission, the Bank andthe Government ofBrazil agreed that decisionson whether to
          proceedwith loanpreparationshouldbe left to thenew administration. Subsequent delays inthe transitionbetween
          Governmentsdue to illness and subsequentdeathof Dr. Tancredo Neves, who was electedPresidentinJanuarybut
          unable to take office, further delayedconsiderationof loanproposalsby new ministersandofficials. InJune, 1985,
          the Minister ofPlanningagreed, inprinciple, to proceed, and specific planningfor the loanbeganinJuly.

    ASSUNTO: AvaliaCgo do Emprkstimono3268-BR (Banco Mundial)



    Por correspondencia datadade 27 de fevereim de 2003, o Departamentode AvaliaMo de
    OperaNes do Banco Mundial encaminhou a aprecia@o do BNDES uma minuta de
    relatbrio sobre o desempenho de projetos no Brasilapoiados por aquela instituiMo,entre
    os quais o Private Sector Finance Project, realizado com a colabora@o do BNDES, por
    intermediodo empdtimo no3268-BR.

    Considerando a possibilidade de o BNDES manifestar-se previamente a elaboraMo do
    relat6rio final, cabem alguns comentarios a respeik da avaliaMo contida na referida
    minuta.

    o objetivo de apoiar a reorientaHodas politicas operacionais do BNDES em direCgo ao
    setor privado, incluindo o sistema ban&rio, mediante a concessao de emprkstimos
    diretos e atravb de intermedidnos financeiros. Nesse sentido, o BNDES estabeleceu
    como meta para o perlodo 1989 a 1993 a redu@o gradual do flwo de creditos
    direcionadospara o setor pdblico,que passariade 27% do total no primeiroano para 19%
    no dltimo. Outra meta acordadacom o BIRD foi a diminuiCgoda importancia relativa dos
    intermedianos financeiros pdblicos no repasse de recursos do BNDES, rnediante uma
    trajetbria que levariasua participagoa cairde 50% em 1989 para 40% em 1993.


    Como apontado no relat6rio, o BNDES cumpriu, em todos os anos, a primeira meta,
    chegandoa inexpressivos2% a participa@o doscrdditosdirecionadosa0 setor pdblico no
    final do ano 2000. Com relaMo a participago dos intermedianos financeims publicos,
    este banco deixou de atender, por uma margem nao muito elevada, os indicadores
    fixadas p i a os anos de 1992 e 1993. No devido tempo, o BNDESjustificou perante o
    Banco Mundial os desvios verificados e apontou o cartitertransitbrio dos mesmos, o que
    ficou sobejamente demonstrado pel0 desempenho nos anos posteriores, quando se

                                         47




conf~rmoua tendencia de reduGgo da importancia relativa dos bancos pc5blicos nos
repassesdo BNDES(16% em 2000).


Em pelo menos duas ocasides a administrago deste banco dirigiu-se formalmente ao
Banco Mundialpara explicar o nao-wmprimento da meta e as medidascorretivas que se
propunhaa adotar.


A primeira, em 30 de dezembro de 1992, quando o president0 do BNDES encaminhoua
Carta P-778/92 (Anexo I), demonstrando que o desvio deveu-se ao grande mscimento
do programa Finame Rural, destinado a0 financiamento de investimentos agrlcolas, no
qual o Banco do Brasil, por sua not6ria especialitago no setor, foi agente financeiro
destacado. Ja as instituifles privadas nao manifestaram maior interesse em partidpar.
Quanto aos bancos entao controlados pelos goveihos estaduais, os recursos a eles
liberados foram pouco expmssivos, fato que jd revelava a preocupago do BNDES, B
Bpoca,com a dificilsitua@ofinanceira de alguns deles. Essa importante distin@o entre o
Banco do Brasil e os bancos estaduais,feita pelo BNDES, provavelmente nao foi levada
na devida considera@o pelo Banco Mundial, que n8o concordou com a proposta,
apresentada informalmente, de excluir os recursos desembolsadosno ambit0 do Finame
Rural,para efeito da apuraGgo do limite de recursos repassadosas instituifles financeiras
pc5blicas.


A segunda ocasiao deu-se em 23 de abril de 1993, quando, pela Carta P-332/93 (Anexo
ll), o Presidente do BNDES informou sobre os esforgos realitados pel0 banco para se
ajustar aos padmetros acordados com o Banco Mundial, dentre os quais a pr6pria
red@o das opera@es com o Banco do Brasil. Assim, a diminuiMo da participaHo dos
intermedianos financeiros pdblimS, obsetvada a partir de 1994, resultou de uma a@o
politica e nao pot razdes fortuitas, cOmo se poderia equivocadamente deduzir pela
redago da notade rodape no1I da minutade relat6rio.


Apesar de o emprestimo nao ter sido integralmentedesembolszda,porfoqa dos desvios
comentados, seus objetivos foram alcanpdos e as metas ultrapassadas. 0 pr6prio
relat6rio assim o reconhece, ao destacar, no paragrafo4.12, que *...the                  y
                                                                        goal of inducing

    absolutamente secunddrio o n&cumprimento tempor4no de uma Qnica cldusula
    contratual (id plenamente justificado), como mais uma vez admitem os autores do

    financial intermediaries." Nao obstante, e contraditoriamente, o secunddrio prevaleceu
    sobreo principalna avalia@odo desempenhodo BNDES.


    Portodo o exposto, e considerando,ainda, o longo hist6ricode proficuacooperaflo entre
    as duas instituifles, pareceme conveniente que a administrago superior do BNDES,
    valendo-se da oportunidadegentilmenteoferecida pel0 Banco Mundial, levea apreciapo
    daquela institui@o solicita@o no sentido de que b relat6rio em analise seja revisto, de

MEMORANDUMAF/DECAP/COW No. 01/03                           Rio de Janeiro, March27,2003


SUBJECT: Assessment of LoanNO.3268 (World Bank)

        By letter dated February27, 2003, the Operations Evaluation Department of the
World Bank sent for review by BNDES a draft version of a report on the performmceof
projects inBrazilsupported bythe World Bank, which include the Private Sector Finance
Project, implemented with BNDES collaboration, bymeansof LoanNo. 3268-BR.

        Since BNDES has been given the opportunity to express its opinion prior to the
preparation of the final report, it would be useful to comment on the assessment
contained insaid draft.

        The loan, o f US$300 million, was approved on August 31, 1990, for the purpose
o f reorienticg BNDES's operating policies toward the private sector, including the
bankingsystem, bymeans ofdirect lending andthrough financial intermediaries. Inthis
connection BNDES set as the target for the periodJ989-1993 a gradual reduction of the
flow o f directed lending to the public sector, which was scheduled to decline from 27
percent o f the total in the first year to 19 percent in 1993. Another target agreed upon
with If3RDwas reductionofthe relative number o fpublic sector financial intermediaries
inindirect lending, whichwas set to drop from 50percentin1989to 40percent in1993.

        As the report notes, BNDES achieved the first target in each year, with the
proportionof directedlendingto the public sector beingno more than a mere 2 percent at
the end o f the year 2000.       With regard to lending through public sector financial
intermediaries, BNDES failed --though not by a very large margin-- to achieve the
indicators fixed for 1992 and 1993. At the appropriate time, BNDES provided an
explanation to the World Bank for the differences observed and underscored their
transitory nature, which was amply demonstrated by its performance insubsequent years,
when the downward trend in the relative share of public banks in BNDES indirect
lendingwas confirmed (18 percent in2000).

  '     On at least two occasions, the BNDES management formally approached the
World Bankto explain the failure to meet the target andthe measuresproposedto correct
the situation.

        The first o f these occasions was on December 30, 1992, when the President of
BNDES sent Letter P-778/92 (Annex I) that the difference between the target
                                            showing
andthe actuals was due to the markedincrease inthe operationso fthe FXNAMERURAL
gregmn, set up to finance agricultural investments, in which, on account of its well-
known specialization inthe sector, the Banco do Brasil was a major player. Moreover,
the private institutions did not display much interest in participating. As to the banks
then controlled by the state governments, the funds made available to them were o f no
great magnitude, a circumstance which derived from the BNDES's concern at that time
about the difficult financial situation of some o f them. This important distinction made

                                             54



byBNDES betweenthe Banco do Brasil andthe statebanksprobably was not givendue
 consideration by the World Bank, which did not agree with the proposal, put forward
 informally, to exclude the fimds disbursed in the context of FNAME RURAL for
 determining the amountson-lent to the public frnancial institutions.

        The second occasionwas on April 23,1993, when, byLetter P-332/93 (Annex JI),
 the President of BNDES reported on the efforts made by BNDES to bring itself into
-compliance with the parameters agreed upon with the World Bank, which included
 reduction of operations with the Banco do Brasil. Consequently, the reduction in the
participation of the public financial intermediaries observed as of 1994 was the outcome
 of a policy action andnot the result of fortuitous circumstances, as might be mistakenly
 deduced from the wording of footnote No. 11o fthe draft report.

        Althoughthe loanwas not hllydisbursed, dueto the instances ofnon-compliance
noted, its objectives were achieved andthe targets exceeded. The report itselfrecognizes
this, in emphasizing, inparagraph 4.12, that    'I...the goal of inducing BNDES to increase
activities supporting the private sector and reduce lending to the public sector can be
 consideredfully met." This finding should rendeqthe temporary non-compliance with a         .
 single covenant (which was already hlly explained) an absolutely secondary
 consideration, as the writers of the report admit more than once in another part o f
paragraph 4.12, as follows:      'I...the period of non-compliance was relatively brief:
 representing only a temporary departure from the long-term trend showing a marked
 contraction in BNDES lending through public sector financial intermediaries."
Nevertheless, and on the contrary, the secondary prevailed over the primary in the
 assessmentofthe performanceofBNDES.

        In light of the foregoing, and also taking into consideration the long history o f
 fhithl cooperation between the two institutions, it seems to me appropriate that the
 senior management o fBNDES should utilize the opportunity kindlyofferedby the World
Bank to request the Bank to consider revising the report in question by adjusting the
 assessmentcriteria to levels that actually reflect the results achieved.
