outcome was\n            satisfactory, risk to the development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was rated as satisfactory. Some of the\n            lessons learned included: 1) the process and pattern of\n            change in the PSRP1 indicates the critical importance of\n            leadership at different levels of the Government. In\n            retrospect, the design of the reform strategy of the PSRP1\n            was a key factor in subsequent performance. The contextual\n            factors were generally enabling. The relationships with the\n            development partners (DPs) were largely supportive. But what\n            integrated these elements and focused them on productive\n            outcomes was the nature of Tanzanian leadership. 2) A key\n            outcome of the PSRP1 was the capacity development of the\n            President's Office, Public Service Management (PO-PSM),\n            the main Government agency with a mandate to manage\n            system-wide change and reform. One perspective on this\n            process is to disaggregate this emerging capacity into four\n            capabilities, all of which were essential for effective\n            PO-PSM performance. These were the following: a) the\n            capability to carry out technical, managerial and logistical\n            tasks; b) the capability to adapt and change; c) the\n            capability to engage and form relationships with other\n            actors; and d) the capability to achieve greater coherence\n            both internally and externally."}, "docdt": "2008-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
