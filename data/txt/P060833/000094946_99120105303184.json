{"cdata!": "The Public Service Reform Program\n            Project for Tanzania seeks to improve accountability,\n            transparency, and resource management for service delivery.\n            The program comprises three phases, the first of which,\n            installs a strategic process for sustainable performance\n            improvement (2000-2004), Five main components are described\n            here. The first and central component, performance\n            improvement, decentralizes and expands key government\n            ministries, departments, and agencies; establishes a core\n            group of strategic planners; trains ministries and build\n            their capacities to implement their plans; strengthens their\n            performance orientation; and provides incentives for\n            performance. The second component obtains private sector\n            participation by continuing the transfer of functions,\n            services, and operations from one institution to another;\n            contracting out non-critical services; divesting and\n            privatizing services and facilities; and redeploying surplus\n            staff. The third component creates and operationalizes\n            executive agencies, isolates select non-policy and executing\n            functions, and introduces client orientation and\n            results-oriented management. The fourth component modernizes\n            information and communication systems, and introduces an\n            integrated computerized personnel and payroll system. The\n            fifth component helps the public service system transform\n            into a meritocracy by developing leadership and management\n            skills, reinstating ethical conduct, and mainstreaming\n            gender issues in to public service activities."}, "docdt": "1999-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
