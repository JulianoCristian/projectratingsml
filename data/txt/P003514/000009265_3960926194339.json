To achieve this broad objective, actions will be\n            taken in: the following key policy areas: (a) agricultural\n            and food price and trade liberalization; (b) marketing and\n            market integration, (c) rural land system reform; and (d)\n            rural industrialization and commercial activities. This\n            project also entails actions to be taken in: (e) marketing\n            and service systems in the less commercialized areas; (f)\n            state-level support for public agricultural investment; and\n            (g) rural financial market reforms. Typical of China's\n            approach, the reforms are being introduced first at the\n            regional levels under central government supervision, then\n            will be generalized for nationwide implementation."}, "docdt": "1988-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
