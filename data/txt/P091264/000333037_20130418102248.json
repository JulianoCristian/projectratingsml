for Poverty\n            Reduction Project for Afghanistan were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was significant, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: jump\n            starting a microfinance sector in a conflict affected\n            country requires allowing sufficient time to understand the\n            market and to adjust previously used models to the\n            particular country context. Building a strong apex\n            institution requires building strong institutional capacity\n            before expanding its portfolio and menu of services.\n            Effective capacity building requires careful monitoring and\n            design, including tailoring the activities to the specific\n            needs of the institutions. Effective development of a\n            microfinance sector requires aligning incentives toward\n            responsible risk management. Successful project\n            implementation requires a solid governance structure with\n            clearly defined roles and responsibilities. It is critical\n            for the project's success to ensure the existence of\n            proper information and reporting systems and risk\n            management, as well as monitoring and supervision systems."}, "docdt": "2012-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
