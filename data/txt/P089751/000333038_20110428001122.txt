SUMMARY
The proposed changes involve responding to the request of the Ministry of Finance of the
Government of Azerbaijan to process a reallocation of proceeds under Credit 4935 AZ in support
of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Economic Development Support Project (P089751).
The proposed reallocation involves transfer of funds of SDR 240,000 (USD 380,000 equivalent)
from Category (5) ‘Unallocated,’ to Category (2) ‘Consultant’s Services Including Audit’ as set
forth in the table in Section IV of Schedule 2 to the Financing Agreement. The reasons for
requesting a reallocation of funds are: i) higher than expected costs for consultant services under
the current IDP-EDS project due to the large number of consultant services required for the
technical design of more than 250 small-scale micro-projects in a range of sectors; ii) the need to
contract consultants to undertake feasibility studies and preparatory work for a proposed new
project, the IDP Living Standards and Livelihoods Project.

PROJECT STATUS
The project implementation progress is satisfactory and the project is on track to meet the
project development objective of improving living conditions for IDP through funding 250 small
scale infrastructure and service delivery micro-projects. A total of 151 community based micro-
projects have been completed and another 84 are either under implementation or are being
appraised. Recent supervision missions have concluded that all fiduciary arrangements are being
satisfactorily implemented.


PROPOSED CHANGES
The proposed change would revise the withdrawal schedule whereby category 5
"Unallocated" would be decreased and category 2 "Consultants’ services including audit"
would be increased by SDR 240,000.
