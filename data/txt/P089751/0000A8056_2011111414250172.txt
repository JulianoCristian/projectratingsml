                         The proposed IDP Economic Development Support Project (IDP-EDS) is a repeater project that replicates part of the Pilot Reconstruction Project (Cr.
                         31090/31091-AZ), and its objective, like that of its predecessor, is to help improve the living conditions of IDPs and enhance their economic opportunities and

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Although the Project Development Objective was revised for the IDP-EDS Additional Financing, the change was not reflected in the portal. The new PDO is to, "improve living
