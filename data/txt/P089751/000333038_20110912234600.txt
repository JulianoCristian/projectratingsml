SUMMARY
The proposed changes involve responding to the request of the Ministry of Finance of the
Government of Azerbaijan to process a reallocation of proceeds under Credit 4935 AZ in support
of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Economic Development Support Project (P089751).
The proposed reallocation involves transfer of funds of: (i) SDR 70,000 from Category (3)
‘Training,’ and SDR 80,000 from Category (5) ‘Unallocated,’ to Category (1) ‘Goods and Works’
and, (ii) SDR 125,000 from Category (4) ‘Operating Costs’ to Category (2) ‘Consultant’s
Services Including Audit’ as set forth in the table in Section IV of Schedule 2 to the Financing
Agreement. The reasons for requesting a reallocation of funds are: i) the unallocated funds have
not been required during project implementation and as the project enters the final six months it is
proposed to use them towards the completion of works on micro-projects, ii) lower than expected
costs for training activities, iii) higher than expected costs for consultant services under the
current IDP-EDS project due to the large number of consultant services required for the technical
design of more than 250 small-scale micro-projects in a range of sectors and the need to contract
consultants to undertake feasibility studies and preparatory work for a proposed new project, the
IDP Living Standards and Livelihoods Project.




                                                 4
PROJECT STATUS
The project implementation progress is satisfactory and the project is on track to meet the
project development objective of improving living conditions for IDP through funding 250 small
scale infrastructure and service delivery micro-projects. A total of 189 community based micro-
projects have been completed and another 84 are nearing completion. Recent supervision
missions have concluded that all fiduciary arrangements are being satisfactorily implemented.


PROPOSED CHANGES
The proposed change would revise the withdrawal schedule whereby Category (5) ‘Unallocated’,
and Category (3) ‘Training’ would be decreased and Category (1) ‘Goods and Works’ and
Category (2) ‘Consultants' services including audit’ would be increased by SDR 150,000 and
SDR 125,000 respectively.

2.       The current project implementation progress is satisfactory and the project is on
track to meet the project development objective of improving living conditions for IDP through
funding 250 small scale infrastructure and service delivery micro-projects. A total of 189
community based micro-projects have been completed and another 84 are nearing completion.
Recent supervision missions have concluded that all fiduciary arrangements are being
satisfactorily implemented.

been required during project implementation and as the project enters the final six months it is
proposed to use them towards the completion of works on micro-projects, ii) lower than expected
costs for training activities, iii) higher than expected costs for consultant services under the
current IDP-EDS project due to the large number of consultant services required for the technical
design of more than 250 small-scale micro-projects in a range of sectors and the need to contract
consultants to undertake feasibility studies and preparatory work for a proposed new project, the
