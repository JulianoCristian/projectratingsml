The project's objectives are to: a)\n            protect unique biodiversity in eligible biosphere and\n            special biosphere reserves; b) strengthen protected areas\n            management at the reserve level; c) promote local\n            participation in the implementation of protected areas\n            operating and management plans; and d) ensure long-term\n            recurrent cost financing for core protection and\n            conservation activities. The project has the following\n            components: 1) Reserve conservation programs will improve\n            reserve management and ensure effective biodiversity\n            conservation in the 10 project reserves. 2) Central\n            coordination program will strengthen project performance at\n            the national level, with particular emphasis on protected\n            area management, the Technical Advisory Committee mechanism,\n            and project evaluation. 3) Permanent endowment for protected\n            areas will consist of the establishment and operation of the\n            Fondo para Areas Naturales Protegidas for supporting reserve\n            conservation and coordination programs benefiting the 10\n            project reserves."}, "docdt": "1997-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
