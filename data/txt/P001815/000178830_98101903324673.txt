MRURITANIA
APPRAISAL OP A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
SUMMAP.Y AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Governmezit of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania has asked
IDA to help finance a tour-year prog-aa to improre highvay maintenance
operations. This request in based on an IDA-financed maintenance study
carried out by the French consultants BCEOM.
ii.       The program, to be implemented vith the assistance of consultants,
provides for the lmpronement of the existing netvork through minor vorks
and more effective maintenance, the training of local personnel and the
purchase of maintenance and shop equipaent. IDA vill finance the for*igzi
exchange component of the capital expenditures and of the costs for consult-
ing services, fôr a total of US$3.0 million. Other than the iaport duties
and taxes on the equipment purchases, which are transfer payments, the Gov-
ernment contribution vîll cover the local costs of the consultant services,
US$200,000, plus the recurrent costa of the maintenance and betterment pro-
gram over and above present recurrent expenditure levels, approximataly
US$3.0 million.
iii.      The Directorate of Public Worka (DTP) vill be responsible for the
execution of the project and is competent to do so vith the assistance of
consultants. Contracta for maintenanee equipuet vill be avarded by inter-
national competitive bidding.
iv.       The project la aimed at improving the condition of l0v standard
rmade, particularly în the southern part of the country, on vhich the
agricultural development of Mauritania depends. The quantifiable bénefits
from the proposed investment, based on vehiele operating cost savinga
alone, yield an economlc return of about 11%, vhich i satisfactory. The
project vill rurther the development strategy of the Government by benefit-
ing the traditional sectors of the econouy uhieh have been largely unaffect-
ec by the growth in large scale mining operations.
V.        In 1964, an IDA crodit or US$6.7 million (CR. 69-MAU) vas uade
to Maurîtania for engineering and construction of the 200 km Nouakchott-
Rosso road.  The European Development Fund (FED) in contributing a third
of the construction coat. The project vas due for completion by mid-1969;
however, in May 1968 it vas found that the original specifications for the
bituiaînouw stabilization vere impracticable and had to be revisîd. Con-
struction coste for the nev pavement design remain vell belov the original
estimate. Performance la generally satisfactory and it in expected that
construction will be completed by the end of 1969.
vi.       The proJect is suitable for an IDA credit in the amount of US$3.0
million equivalent to the Goverment of Maurit4nis.






MAURITANIA
APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1       In 1964, an IDA credit or US$6.7 million (CR.69-MAU) va mad
to tle Governmnt of the Islamic Republic of Msluritanïa for the onelinrini
and construction of a nev 200 km road betven #ouakchott, tha capital,
and Ro"so on the Senegal River.  The European Devlopmnt Fuiid (Fm)
through a grant is financing one-third of the construction co0t. 'ibo
appraisal mission found that the general condition of the road network
vas deteriorating due to insufficient maintenance, and the Association
recoumended that consultants be engaged to prepare an appropriate main-
tena.i&ce rrogram. The credit included funda for the maintenance st'my
whichl vas undertaken by the French consulting fira, BCEOM, and coajleted
in Auxguit 1967. About a year later, in September 1968 the Governiaint sub-
mittted a requent to IDA for assistance in finaùcing a four-year progrea.
to iuprove the highvay network through more effective maintenance.
i 2       The road construction project financed under Credit 69-M.U in
approximately 50% complete and vas due tor completion by mîd-1969. In mid
1968 it vas found that the original specifications for the bitiflnclus
stab:lization and surfacing vere impracticable si4ce these parts ot the
vork progressively disintegrated through the presence of salt in the
loca. materialu. The vork vas suspended for about 6 mnths until ,t nev
design had been tested and agreed.  This solut:.on vili raise the ccst
from US$5.0 million to US$6.0 million but remains vell below tht original
estisate of US$9.3 million.  Construction in  "ep.cted to be coupleted by
the Eind of 1969.
1.3       In 1960 the Bank ma" a loan (249-FR) oi uS$66 million tc) Miines
de Fer de Mauritanie (MIFERMA), the venture vorking the iron-ore Min* at
Fort Gouraud. The loaui finanuced the installatiois of the mine, th-0 rail-
vay uo the port and necessary port facilities at Por-t Etienne. In 1968,
IFC ugreed to invist US$20 million (MAU-132), US$3.45 millîon in ecluity
funds and us$16. 55 million in a loan, in Societt Minieres de Maurituaie
(SK JMA), the company operating the copper mine at Akjoujt vhich wlth the
Gove inment vill upgrade the road trou the mine to Nouakchott to aiphait
standards.
1.4+      The present project, based on the BCEOM report and inforlbaticn
suwpp.Led by the Directorate Of Public Works (DTP) was appraiîed by Messrs
Ludvmg, Engineer, and Brandreth, Economict attachpd te the Bank's P*rManent
Miss:0on to Vest Africa, the authors of this report, who visited Mauritania
in DIcember 1968.



-2-
2. BACKGROUND
A. G eral
2.1       Mauritania, an indepndent republic sine* 1960, lien on the
vestern edge of the Sahara Desert, bordered on the vent and northweut by
the Atlantîc Ocean and Spanïsh Sahara, on the northeat by Algeria, on
the eaut by Mali, and on the south2by both Mail and Senegal. Mauritania
has an area of around 1,000,000 km , about tvice that of France.
2.2       The populatioi, estimated at slightly over 1 million in 1965,
in believed to be grovlng at about 1.7% anually. About 90% of the
population le engaged in traditional agrieultural and liveutock pursuits
although the northern tvo-thirds of the country have desort or sub-desert
characteristics vhich make it unsuitable for agriculture purposes other
than marginal llvestock grazing. The rainfall increases and in more relia-
ble in the southern thîrd of the country vhere mont agrieultural activity in
located. The mont productive agricultural area ln along the country'u
southern border, li the fertile flood-plain of the Senegal River. Millet
sad sorghum are the main crops grovn, interaperued with 1mli quantities of
groundnuts and rice. Crop production, hovever, îa very underdeveloped and
ia insufficient to meet local consumption needs; millet and rice, dietary
staples are imported fron Senegal, Mali and overseau.
2.3       Livestock raislng accounts for over 75% of agrieultural output.
Lîvestoek aetivities range from distinct seasonal migrations of cattle in
the south to sporadic snd unplanned movements o! camel hords ln search o!
vater in the arîd northern vautelands. As a result, some 80% of the popula-
tion la nomadtie. Population dansity averages about one person per square
kilometer ove:r the totaI. area but most of the population ls concentrated ln
the couthern 15% ot the land area, particularly along the Scnegal River.
Here population densltios rime to about 7 persons per km - a level vhich
romains low for West Africa.
2.4       Industrial and comercial activities have grown impressively oyer
the lent decade and nov aecount for vell over half of GDP. Thess undertakin a
(mining, fishing) are of the "enclave", capital-intensive type, made possible
by European private capital and technical services. In the Judgment of the
Bank mission formed to prepare Guidelines for a Four-Year »evelopment Prograa,
these industries have htid very little direct effect on the economlc or social
standards of the bulk of the population. (See Report Mauritania: Guidelines
for a Four-Year Development Program, Chapter 1, Section C, dated November
1968). They have been developed in the northern areas o! the country at
Nouakchott, Port Etienne, Akjoujt, und Fort (souraud, far fron the important
population areas.
2.5       While GDP grev at the rate of about 16% annually during the period
1959-64 in constant prices and, according to a Bank mission estlmate, at
about 7% per year betveen 1964-66, mont of this vas attributable to the



- 3 -
enclave economic activities.  These grev rapidly up to 1964, accounting for
the aubstantial grovth rate in this period, but production peaked and levell-
ed off thereafter. Per capita income grev from about US$65 in 1959 to over
US$10 in 1962, r.aching about Us$14o in 1964.  Hovever, it in clear that in
the traditional sector, where few technological changes occurred, Increases
in output did not exceed population growth and thus individual incoams for
the 'ulk of the population romain at the previwus very lo  levels. The
stral;egy of devalopment adopted by the Governuent calla for an osphasis on
bringing the traditional sectors into the cash econouy, in order to sottle
the people and reduce the long run dangers of a dual economy. The proposod
road improvement program forma an integral part of this strategy.
B. Transport System
a) General
2.6       Historically, the transport system of Mauritania vus designed to
link the population centres vîth the major port of Dakar in Senegal, through
vhieh the import and exporte of the area floved. The bulk of the population
located in the flood plain of the Senegal River, vas served by river trans-
port or via the Senegal-Mali Railvay vhich passes cloue to the Mauritanian
frontier, as it entera Mali. Road transport and the more traditional camel
carav ans vere used to provide the lnmited onvard movements from the umal
river ports to the more inaccessible areas   A main road running north froe
Rossc, the principal Senegal River port, offered acces to the sparaely-
settled semi-desert areas lying hundreds of kilomuters beyond.
2. 7      With the completion of tho new port at Nouakchott in 1966, thore
has leen some diversion of traffic movements from the Dakar-orîented
patttrn and, to a considerable extent, a reversal of the northward flow
over Ithe Rosso-Nouakchott road as Mauritanian importe tend to enter
through Nouakchott rather than Dakar and nove aouth or north fram that
point. However, mavoments through the more populated uouth sud southeast
remain largely unaffected by this change because traffie destined for this
area, vhether originating at Nouakchott or Dakar, must pasS through Rosso
and utilize the traditional river or road system (or both) beyond that
point to its ultim»te destination.
t>) ei&hvy
2.6       The road system totale about 6,000 km, of vhich 3,200 km are
na&iical routes sad 2,800 km are dîrt tracks serving the various sub-
divisions. Mont of the roads are in poor condition. It is evident that
the roadu need considerable rehabilitation vork snd subsequently beoter
maîntunsnce.  (Further details regarding the road system are given li
paragraphe 3.1-3.3). lu 1967, about 6,000 motor vehicles vere ln operation
on tbls road network, of whlch about 3,700 ver. buses, trucks snd other hesvy
vehic3les.



c ) Railvyu
2.9       There is only one railvay in Mauritania, traversing the 670 km
botveen the MIFEMA iron ors deposit. near Fort Gouraud and the export out-
lot of Port Etienne. The railay ins ovned aud operated by MIFEMA aud traftic
is largoly confined to iron-ore movments although some minor amounts of
imported general traffie are carried. In any évent, the railvay il located
far fram the basic population asd traditional production centres of the
country.
d) Ports and Vaterusys
2.10      The organized vatervay services on the Sénegal River coansist of
five powered craft and a nuaber of barges ovned and operated by a Senegalese
tirm based in St. Louis. On the Mauritanian shore, a number of amll and
relatively primitive ports provide anual loading and unloading facilities
for the povered veusels and sasll itinerant craft on the river. The river
i soeasonally navigable trom Rosso to Kaedi (tee para. 3.6).
2.11      Sea-port facilities are located at Port Etienne on the extrme
northern coast, snd at Nouakchott, the capital. Port Etienne is in effect
tvo specialized ports, one serving the bulk loading needs of MIFE1MA and
the othor general commerce and fishing.  The Nouakchott facility is a
lighterage port vith a current capacity of 50,000-60,000 tons p.a. vhich
could easily be raised to 100,000 tons. Traffic in 1967 totalled 34,600
tans, 78% of vhich consisted of imports of rice sud sugar. Traffic for
the first 10 onths of 1968 totalled 35,850 tons suggesting an annual
total slightlr in excees of 405000 tons.
e) MDrways
2.12      To overcomoe the long distances over largely inhospitablo areas,
Mauritania is equipped vith a relatively vell-devoloped airway netvork.
Thore ara 12 aîrports capable of handling 4-engined aircraft (although
only Port Etienne can receive inter-continental jets) and 10 other fields
suitable for DC 3-type and amaller aircraft. Eleven of the airports have
radio facilities. Local air services play sn important role by componsat-
ing for the lack of adequat* surface communication to remote or seasonally-
isolated areas. The regular services are limited, hovever, in both coverage
and transport capacity bocause of the relatively umall demand for air travel.
Costa are beyond the means of the average domestic traveller. As a result,
the services are us.d mainly by administrators, businessmen, technical assis-
tance experts, snd occasional tourists.
C. Transport Policy
2.13      Mauritania's transport policy in recent years has been daminated,
by the folloving features in order of Importance:
a) A desire to reduce dependency on Senegal and the Port
of Dakar as a source of imported supplies.



b)  The use of traniiport as a unifying medium to link the
videspread areas of the country and by cross-subsidiza-
tion of transport coste, to reduce the vide descrepan-
cies in living standards in the various areoâ and to
generate a concept of nationhood.
c) The need to develop the south and southeast areas uhere
80% of the population is located.
2. 14     The Nouakchott whsrf, completed in 1966, represents a determined
effort to divett import movements from Dakar to Mauritanian facilities.
The construction of a paved route from Nouakchott to the riverine port
of Rosso (financed by Cr. 69-MAU), gatevay to the entire south and south-
east sections of the country, i another vital link in this diversion
program.
2.15      Until recently, the chief instrument of Goverument pollcy to
achîeve the goals outlined in b) and c) of paragraph 2.13 vas the National
Office for Public Transport (ONTP), vhich set road transport rates and
allocated freight to individual road transporter. Competition vas non-
existent under ONTP contibl and the rating policy subsidized freight
moveménts into isolated aresa.
2.16      Upon the advice of a 1967 Bank mission organized at the request
of Mauritania to establish guidelines for a Four-Year Development Program,
the ONTP Wa8 abolished. In Mardh 1968, a number of lave and decrees
vere passed vhich permit entry into both public and private road transport
by Mauritanian nationals, subject to the issuance of a transport license
snd the payment of an annual vehicle license fee, and vhich sp.cify rates
(per ton-kilometer) for the various routes. These rates represent the
maximum level chargeable since scope i provided, when aufficient volume
exista, for rate reductions to be proposed by the Transporter's Syndicate,
an organization repreuenting the operators' interests. With the elimination
of the ONTP, the introduction of competition, and the provision for
inereased road-usr taxes specificailly allocated to road maintenance and
construction, the general environnent in vhich the road transport industry
operates is satisfactory. Transport coordination, in the sense of compe-
titîon as between modes, ls not an issue nor in it likely to becoue one in
the foreseeable future (see paragraph 3.6).
2.17      Transport developuent policy, in line vith proposals contained
in the Bank's Guidelines t1or a Four-Year Develop4ent Progrua, does not
envisage any significant road construction or improvemmet plans over
the next four to five years beyond those contained in this project proposal.
Whîle transport development i important, only llimted transport inve«tments
are required to promote and sustain agricultural developuent. Far greater
returns, from extremely modest inputs, are to be gained from investment
directly in agricultural projects in the south and southeait. In the longer
run, scope existe for large-scale agricultural developuent in the southern
areas vhieh vill depend for its Succesu on improved transport services.
Kovever, many of these agricultural undertakinge vill involve control of



- 6 -
the Soeegal River vhieh uay ueriously affect the existing roaUd and mater
arteries tbrough the ares in vays as yet unknown   It is deaeod best then,
as exmplified in the proposed projact, to limit roadvorks in this entire
area to modest upgrading of the vrious road sections as the tratfie
available warrants, and adequate road maintenance to keep thece roade
passable for agricultural purposes.

3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Highvay Network (Table 1)
3.1       As noted in para. 2.8, the total length of the national road net-
vork is about 3,200 km and there are about 2,800 km of district or local
earth roade vhich are to a great extent mere trackse.
3.2       There are about 50d km of existing laterite roads nov being
upgraded to bituminoug surface roade. The Nouakchott-Rosso road, about
200 km in length, is expected to be completed by the end of 1969 (para 1.3).
The Nouakchott-Akjoujt road, leading to the site of the copper ore develop-
ment at Akjoujt vill be completed by 1971. Its construction is being financ-
ed by the Government and SOMIMA, the company operating the copper mine.
About 1,200 km of the national roada have laterite and bituminous surface
and are all-veather roads. The remaining 2,100 km of the national roads
are earth-roads but in some places they are no more than tracks vithout any
sub-structure, drainage or surface. Road transport in the south is inter-
rupted from July to November through inundation of the Senegal River.
3.3       The average density of the road system is about 5 km per 1,000 km2
or 5.5 km per 1,000 inhabitants, which is similar to the network density
of neighboring Saharan countries (Thtble 1). The most important trunk
road runs north-south from the border vith Algeria to Rosso on the
Senegal River, passing through the iron ore mine of MIFERMA at Fort
Gouraud, the copper mine or SOMIMA at Akjoujt, and the capital Nouakchott.
A second trunk road runs from Rosso, eastwards to the towns of Boghe and
Kaedi on the Senegal River and Kiffa and Nema in the southeast of the
country. From these tvo trunk roade there are branches or secondary and
tertiary roads to towns of lesser importance in the interior.
B. Characteristics and Growth of Traffic
3.4       The subsïstence level economy common in much or Mauritania generates
little traffic. Excludîng the mining industry, vhich not only croates a
special transport market but also provides its ovr transport service, goode
traffic consists almost entirely of importe.  It has been estimated by
consultants (SEDES) that exporta and local goods movements contributed legs
than 10% of total traffic in 1961. There is no evidence to suppose that
this proportion has altered substantially since then.
3.5       About 75% of import traffic is dominated by basic foodMtuffl (45%)
and petroleum products (22%) destined for the more populated areas in the
south and southeast. Despite the new vharf at Nouakchott, Rosso remains
the major point Of entry to these regions, whether by road or vater. A
8mall quantity of importe flovs northvard further lnland from Bakel through
Selîbaby and M'Bout.



- 8 -
3.6       Betveen Rosso and K»di, somie 300 kilometers to the est, vater
and road transport are complementary and, only to a mal1l degree, competitive.
The road îe only available for six to soyen montis of the year (Decoember-July)
mince it in subject to flooding during the remainder. During thls flood
period, hovever, boats ot up to 2.5 mntera in draught can ply betveen theme
points. Betveen Rosso and Boghe (200 kllometers ea.t of Rosso) year-round
navigation i possible ror imall vessel of 1 imeter draught vhich campote
vith road transport during the dry se*aon.  Thun, this stretch of the main
east-vest road, vhich carries the heaviest traftic, is served by both road
and vater, each of vhich has seasonal advantages. This situeaion i  un-
likely to change in the foreseeable future.  The total volume of road traffil
offering vould not oufifce to justify the construetion of a road on a flood-
free alignment, particular1y on the difficult Rosso-Boghe sector.  River
transport remaine cheaper than road and could be materially improved through
relatively small expenditures (blasting rocks clear of the channel, etc.).
3.7       East of Kaedi, traffie movements tre dépendent on road services,
vhich are subject to interruption by flooda in the rainy season. North-
nouth movements over the Rosso-Nouakchott-Akjoujt-Atar road (most of vhich
is beiig reconstructed or improved to paved standards) are not troubled by
seasonal interruptions.
3.8       Traffic te extremely light over al  rond links.  Tbe ONTP recorded
the origin and destination of traffie tonnages c&rried under its authority
during its existence but since a great deal of the traffie in knovn to have
evaded ONTP control, the results do not give a rçliable picture of road
use. No traffle surveyu have ever been recorded on a national scale.
Improvements ln traffiî statistics are vital as a basis 0f future planning
for the highvay sector. An assurance vas obttalned during negotiations that
traffie data vull be collected in the future on a regular basia.
3.9       Rosd traffie recorded in 1965 by ONTP totalled 31,200 tons.
Assuuing, as estiinted by the Bank Mission vhich prepared the Guidelines
for a Four-Year Developnent Program, that this roepresented about one-half
of total road tratfic ln that year, actual movements amounted to about
60,000 tons. Wlth GDP grouth in the traditionsl sector approximating
that of population (about 1.7% annually) it is unlIkely that traffie
grovth has exceeded 3% per year. On this basis, the current road traffic
level is about 67,000 tons per annum and ulll approximate 70,000 tons in
1970.
3.10      Motor fuel consumption statisticu (Uee Table 2) reveal a growtb in
total vehicle oporations considerably in exceas Of estimated goods traffic
development.  Gazoline consumption increased about 10% per annum during
the period 1964-67 reflecting, in part, a substantial increase in the
use of private cars, taxis, etc. Diesel fuel consumption including that
by the railray increased over 21% annually in the came period. While the
latter figures are înf1 xenced by MIFERMA operations, the activîties of
that organization had peaked by 1964; thus, the grovth in diesel fuel
consumption refleots thii groving tendency to utilize larger 12 ton trucks
for freight movements, In place of smaller 3-5 ton trucks, wherever road
conditions permit.

C. Highvay Administration
3.11      The Directorate of Public Works (DTP) in the Ministry of Equil  nt
is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the national highvay
system (See chart). The Director of Public Works ïs a Mauritanian engineer;
most of the senior poste in the DTP are held by Prench expatriates. Hovever,
a graduail Mauritanization is underway and young Mauritanian engineers vhc
studied abroad sre filling ponts held by expatriates. For administration
of maintenance, the country i8 divided into three geographical divisions
vhich are administered by engineers vho supervise the activities of three
to five subdivisions. Each division han a pool of maintenance equipment
anid a workshop and is responsible for the maintenance of the national roadi
in its subdivisions. The organizational structure of the DTP is adequate
fôr its tank.
D. Highvay Financing
3.12      Over the past 4 years (1965-1968) total highv.y expenditures
have averaged about CFAF 410 million annually (approximately US$1.7 million
equivalent). of this, about 22% (US$0.35 million) was devoted to main-
tenance and 78% to new construction. Foreign aid contributions made up
about 92% of expenditures on new construction during this period, vith
IDA and FED providing about 45% each and FAC the remaining 2% (Table 3).
3.13      Highvay construction vorks costing about US$14 million equivalent
are undervay. They consist o? (i) the Nouakchott-Rosso road (us$6.0
million) financed by IDA and FED on a 65%-35% basis respectively, and
(îi) the Nouakchott-Akjoujt road (US$8.0 million), financed by the
Government and SOMIMA on a one-third - two-third basis respectively.
±io other major new road construction projects are envisioned in the
perîod to 1975.
3.14      Expenditures on maintenance in 1969 are budgeted at CFAF 170
million (US$0.7 million equivalent), about twice the recent annual
average and are acheduled to reach CFA! 300 million (US$1.2 million equiva-
lent) by 1973. Road maintenance and minor improvement vorke vere financed
by ordinary budget allocations up to 1968, at which time the Governimnt
created a Road Fund on the recommendation of BCEOM. The Fund in credited
vith (i) part of the proceedo trom specific fuel taxes; and (ii) the proceedi
from the annual road transport license tees. For 1969-1973, total revenues
frce these sources are estimated as follovu:
-Million of CFAF-         (US$Mil.
Fuel Taxes          License Fees      Total     E uivalent
1969               190                  50              240        (1.00)
1970               200                  55              255        (1.05)
1971               210                  60              270        (1.10)
1972               220                  65              285        (1.15)

3.15      Although cert&in revenues from fuel taxes vill be vithheld
during the poriod 1969-1971 to help finance the Govermment'  share
(para 3.13) of the Nouakchott-Ajoujt road improvemet, it appears that
sutticient femda vill be available to meet the budgat requiremta envisio-
ned in the proposed project.
E. RighvaY Maintenance
3.16      As stated previously, maintenance of the national highvsy net-
vork is carried out by the three geographical divisions of the DTP and
their subdivisions.  Hovever, the Nouakchott-Akjoujt road vill be
maintained after completion by SOMIMA.  Local authorities are responsible
for the district or local roads.
3.17      Maintenance operations conîsit of reshaping, regraveliing and
eliminating o! "vash board'  surfaces.  To the extent that equipuent in
available these vorks are c.arried out by  echanized units.  The timing
depends on elimatic conditions; reshaping is impossible in the south
during the rsiny ceason and vhen the Senegal River in in flood.
3.18      Maintenance techniques are poor and hampered by obsolete main-
tenance equiplment and vorkshop facilitiez. Maintenance funds allocated
to the DTP are inadequate and, as a result, the condition of the national
road system has deteriorated. The puiTose of the proposed program is to
improve the roads to a condition vhere they can be properly maintained
and to upgrade the efficiency of maintenance operations, thereby rectify-
ing the serious deficiencies noted above.
3.19      The Equimaent Division is in charge of the maintenance, over-
haul, and repair of all equipment. Ueavy equiplent is overhauled in the
central vorkshop at Naouakchott, and the divisional vorkshops do routine
maintenance and minor repairs.
3.20      The otperation of the Equipment Division is not effective.
The equipment is obsoleteq and overage, and because of a lack of standard-
ization a vide range of spare parts in needed. Repairs are hampered by
insufficient maintenance installations and shop equipment. Maintenance
personnel have limited skill and ability and large scale training at
all levela îu required.
3.21      The Technical College at Nouakchott offers a three-year
training program comprising specilization for general and automotive
mnchanicu, electricians and sheet metal vorkers.  This achool has the
capacity to train about 50 mechanica a year but as this only partly meets
the country's need ît is neceauary te train additional mechanice under
the program.

4. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.1       The proposed project consists of a four-year road improvement
and maintenance program, to be iînplemented vith the assistance of con-
sultants, providing for
(i) the purchase of maintenance and shop equipent,
(iî) improvement Of the efficiency of maintenance operationa,
and,
(iii)training of personnel at all levels.
(a) ObJectives
4.2       The DTP is responsible for the national highvay netvork of about
3,200 km, but at present it only maintains 'he paved and laterite roadu
(Class I and II) totalling about 1,200 km. The presont condition of
these roads is generally poor; road beds are not properly shaped, laterite
and other selected soii vearing courses are vorn avay, pot holes and ruts
are common. Most of the roads în the south are impassble after heavy rain
or during flooding by the Senegal River.
4.3       Under the proposed program, the road network vill be genorally
upgraded mnd thus road transport reliability vili be iiproved. In
addition, more substantial betterment vorks including the surfacing
of sections of the earth road netvork vith laterîte vill be started in
1970, concentrating at the outset on the roads fiom Boghe to Kaedi
(110 km) and the remaining 50 km of unimproved road southweat of Kiffa,
and then continuing vith the road Bakel-Selibaby-M'Bout (about 170 km)
and starting vith the road from Kiffa to Nema.
(b) EquiL'=t and Personnel Needa
4.4       In estimating equipuent needs for the maintenance organization,
BCEOM took into account estîmates of the traffie served by the different
types of roada, the number of possible sessonal vorking days, and the out-
put of the equipment under average vorking conditions.
4.5       The lîst of equîpment needs (See Table 4), to be purchased
under the project vas prepared by the consultants and the DTP after
taking into account the major exiating and reusable equipment. The
equipmeant is considered suitable for the tank. The project alo includes
a spore part stock amounting to CPAP 40 million (US$0.16 million equivabent)
for the existing reusable equipmeut sad an initiai stock Of parts for the
nov equipment, amounting to about 10% of its value. The emti3ated cost
of the equipment and spare parts as shovn in Table 4 is considered to be
realistie. The project further includes CFAP 125 million (US$0..5 million
equiîalent) for renewval ot existing equipient during the prograu period
(Table 6).



- 12 -
4.6       Personnel requirements for the program are listed in Table 5.
Training of existing and new drivers, mochanies, operators, and
maintenance personnel would be carried out under the supervision of
consultants. Also, students from the Technical College at'Nouakchott
vould fill vacancies of skilled mechanica and operators in the Equipment
Division.
(c) Improvement of Maintenance Operations
4.7       The organizational structure of the DTP is adequate for carrying
out the project and the order of duties and responsibilities in correctly
established. The Association concurs vith BCEOM's findings that no major
organizatïonal changes are needed.  Hovever, technical services by
consultants are required to supervise the execution of the project, and to
provide general training of local technical personnel, mechanies, and
operators.
4.8       BCEOM has proposed that the DTP should be assisted by a team of
five experts supplied by a consulting firm. The team should be composed
of:
1 Mechanical Engineer
1 Equipment Inspector
2 Mechanices
1 Store Officer
4.9       The staffing proposal for the team is satisfactory; the mechanical
engineer vill act as head cf team. Consultants acceptable to IDA, have
been invited to submit proposals and a contract vas negotiated vith the
French consulting firm BCEOM in May 1969. The consultant's services include
the five experts vho will be required for varying lengths of time over a
period of four years, at a coet of CFAF 250 million (US$1.O million equiva-
lent).
B. Coat Estimate and Financing
4.10      The estimated capital cost of the maintenance prograa is given
in Table 6 and is summarized belov. IDA vill finance the foreign component
of the program including US$160,000 for the consultants subsistence allov-
ance vhieh is mainly spent on imported goods; the remaining local expendi-
tures vould be borne by the Government.

The recurrent epnditures during the program period, estimated at CFAF
1,182 million (US$4.8 million equivalent) will be borne by the Governuent.
They vill be increased to CFAF 170 million in 1969 from a previous average
level of CFAF 90 million for the yearu 1964-68; as from fiscal year 1970
these expenditures vill be gradually increased to reach CFAF 300 million by
1973. The total increase over past average levelu of expenditure vlll
amount to approximately CFAF 742 million (US$3.0 million) over the progran
period.
4.11      The cost estimate for nev equipment and spare parts in based on
the consultants' 'estimate vhich vas updated during the appraisal. As shovn
in Table 4, a contingency allowance of about 10% han been included in the
equipment cost for price escalation over the two-year supply period. A
further contingency allovance of about 15% has been added to cover additional
equipment needs vhich may become apparent during the execution of the project.
4.12      The average life of the equipment to be purchased is estimated at
eight yearu. To enable the continuous reneval of the equipment, the cost
e8timate, Table 6, shova allocations for this purpose under recurrent
expenditures. The Government vill finance ail of these expenditures.
During negotiations, the Government confirmed that it vill meet the recur-
rent expenditures.
4.13      Dimbursement vill be made for 100% of the CIF coit of the imported
equipment and the foreign exchange conts for the conuulting engineeru hired
for the maintenance program. If any surplus in the credit occurs it vould
be cancelled. On the assumption that the credit vould be signed in mid-1969,
IDA diabursements vould be as tollovw:

C.  Exceution
4.14      The DTP assisted by consultants vill be responsible for exoeuting
the project. The consultants' team provided for under the program vill
carry out the training program, drav up bidding documents for the purchase
of equipment in cooperation vith the DTP, and analyse the bide. The teoa
vill be stationed at the central vorkahop at Nouakchott, but the equipment
inspector vill periodically visit the divisions in the field. The Store
Officer vill organize the centrail store attached to the central vorkshop
at Nouakchott.
4.15      Equipecnt vill be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance vith Bank/IDA Guidelines through separate
contracte for each type or each group of similar types of equipmnt. The
contracte vill provide for delivering the bulk of the equipment in 1970
and the rmrainder in 1971. Suppliers vill be required to provide an
adequate servicing organization in Mauritania and to maintain a reasonable
spare parts inventory. The contracta viii be avarded on the baois of the
lovest evaluated bids ln terms of equipment purchase price as vell as spare
parts prices, taking into account the advantages of standardization on as
re. additional modela as possible. Bidding documents vill be submitted to
IDA for reviev to assure that they conform vith its procedures.

5.  ,CONl0MI7 JUSCIFICATION
5.1       The economy of Mauritania, apart from the enclave industries,
is based largely on subuistence--le-vel noadic agricultural and livestock
activities vhieh generate a very nodest demand for transport services. The
existing road netvork, theugh quite extensive, la primitive. Wîth tbe
exception of thé Rosso-Nouakchott an-r Neu,akcehott-Akjoujt road sections
which are currently under constructien, the national road wF'itom consista
largely of earth tracks lacking bo-'Xh dralnage structures, ad adequate
uurfacing.  The main southern route uerving the hea.v4ly popuiated rogion
betyeen Rosso and Nem is subject to seasonal flood damage. Tbe extent
to vhich this part of the netvork ean oe used durin2g the dry sesaon cepends
on the effectiveness of the maintenance services provided.
5.2       The primary purpose of the project is the generai .mproirext
and maintenance of the unpaved road netvork as necessary to  -u_pport the
development of economie activity iî the southern part of the ceÂuntry.
About 85% o! the proposed expenditure of 745 midllion CFA? (US$3.0 Eillion)
on equipment (net of taxes) and technical services can be direî tly related
to these requirements. The balance is applicable to the antici-ated
maintenance needs of the paved Roseo-Nouakchott liLk after it  copletion.
The consultants (BCEOM) have concluded that this investment, sud an increase
în ennual expenditures on maintenance and minor betterments to Pbout CFAF
300 million by 1973 (net of taxes) over the loy annual average level of
CFAF 90 million incurred in the period 1964-68, vould be required to piovide
the needed general improvement and recurrent maintenance of the road
system.  The Association concurs vith the consultants' conclusîons.  With
gbods traffic reaching an estimated 18.5 million ton-km by 1970 cnd savings
of about 6 CFAF per ton-km resulting from the împroved road conditions, the
incremental expenditures in both capitai equipnent and recurring maintenance
viii yield an econamic rate of return of about 11% over the *ight-year life
expectancy of the capital investment.
5.3       The eqlipment and techmical services included in the projeet Vill,
additionally, provïde some scope for a more substantial Upgrading nc  some
unpaved road sections. According to the consultants, an investment
(including taxes) of about CFAF 725,000 per kilometer (about uJS3,OO0> vould
suffice to improve substantially thà charseteristies oe the roads, particular-
ly vith respect to laterîte surf&cing and the passage over vater courses
during the vet seasen. Improvements of this nature can be expected to yield
benerits of about 8 CFAF per ton-kilometer, largely through allweIng a sub-
stantial increase in the use Of 12-ton vehicles in place of the currsntly
employed 5-ton variety. Using a minimum rate of return crîterion ct 10%,
wornks oe this nature are JustÎifed on some 500 kîlometers of road, as out-
lined in pagraph 4.3.  Scope for al extension of the progren beyonda 1973
may be Justifiable in the light oe botter information as to trnsffic flove.
5.4       VebicJXe oper4ting cost saving3 uwed in preparing these
calculations have been limited to those for trucks, these vere derived
fro  data drawn from the consultants' atudies (BCEOM) and are suuarîzed

in Table 7. Additional benefits vill accrue to passenger vehicle movemnts,
but reliable trof.fic figures are not avuilble sand estimttes are not considar-
ed sufficiently reliable to mesaure benefitu. Road treight traffie figures
have been dravu frcm ONTP statistics for 1965 which, aceording to several
sources, notably the Bank Four-Year Development Program Mission, represented
only one-half of actual movements. It has been arbitrarily assumud, hoverer,
for purposes of this appraisal, that the ONTP figures represent about two-
thirds of actual moements. A traffic grovth factor of 3% per annum has
been uwed to estimate future movements   It is belleved that the adoption
of these traffie levels and groith patterns has remulted in a eonservative
evaluation of the economie potential of the proposed projeet. Accordingly,
it 1i concluded that the project is economicslly Justified.

6. RECO*MNDATIONS
6.1       During credit nogotistions, agreement va* reached that the Govern-
nmt (i) vill finance all of the recurrent expenditures during the program
period (para 4.12); and (ii) vill meet the local conts of the consultant
services (para 4.13).
6.2       The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$3.0
million.
