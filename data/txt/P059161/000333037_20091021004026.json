 Friendly Measures in Transport Project for Mexico were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            global environment outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            case of Mexico City has demonstrated that the creation of an\n            enabling environment is necessary before sustainable\n            measures can be implemented. The adequate regulatory,\n            institutional and technical frameworks were in place before\n            starting construction and provide a solid base for the\n            expansion of the system. Specifically the creation of a\n            stable institution for the management of the corridor, the\n            involvement of private bus operators, the new regulatory\n            framework under which services are being provided, and the\n            structuring of an integrated fare represented success\n            factors in the development of Metrobus. Further field\n            testing of bus technologies is needed for defining emission\n            standards and for the decision-making process on alternative\n            bus technologies for public transport. The field test has\n            provided helpful data for the operation of alternative bus\n            technologies under real conditions at Mexico City's\n            altitude. However, because the test fleet consisted of only\n            a few vehicles per type and in many cases for advanced\n            technologies a single vehicle was tested, further field\n            testing is needed to strengthen the database for decision\n            making on bus technologies for public transport with major\n            emission reduction potentials."}, "docdt": "2009-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
