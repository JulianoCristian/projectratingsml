To\n            this end, the components include: 1) rationalization of\n            sector strategies on air quality issues, through the\n            revision of plans, and through workshops on integrated\n            environment and transport issues. This component will\n            support the design, development, and monitoring of the\n            Metropolitan Climate Change Action Plan for Transport in the\n            MCMA; 2) definition of an enabling environment, to\n            facilitate the implementation of sustainable transport\n            strategies, through a revision of institutional frameworks,\n            that includes integration of metro and bus transport, reform\n            of bus regulations, particularly regarding quality control\n            of the corridors system, business and management structure\n            on corridor operations, and measures to promote increased\n            numbers of metro customers; 3) field tests of\n            climate-friendly high capacity vehicles, through comparative\n            tests for alternative bus/fuel technologies; 4) technical\n            assistance, and training to integrate climate change, and\n            air quality considerations in the design, and analysis of\n            transport strategies, supported by cost-benefit analysis of\n            sustainable transport projects, with environmental\n            considerations; 5) public awareness and information\n            dissemination, to sensitize communities on the benefits of\n            new transportation modes, in addition to workshops to\n            increase stakeholder participation."}, "docdt": "2002-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
