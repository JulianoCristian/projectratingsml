                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall program objective is to improve quality, equitable access, and efficiency in primary education through a sub-sector program approach. Specifically,
                         the program will assist the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) to: (a) improve the quality of teaching and learning, and raise student achievement; (b) increase
                         access to schooling for the disadvantaged; and (c) strengthen planning and management of primary education, including establishing a national monitoring and
                         evaluation system for primary education.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         PROGRESS: Evidence from the PLU points to good implementation progress in 5 of 6 areas which had motivated a 1-year extension of the project (until June 30, 2011): (i) filling key
                         staff vacancies; (ii) distributing all Grade 1-5 textbooks to the districts; (iii) constructing additional classrooms (all contract awards were completed by December 2010); (iv) providing

                         IT and equipment to Primary Teacher Training Institutes; and (v) training DPE field-level staff and teachers. In the sixth area regarding scaling up the block grant transfer to schools to
                         finance school improvement plans (SLIPS), progress was weak and limited to the provision of training.
                                    Over the life of PEDPII, key results have been a very fast increase in enrollment and a substantial increase in primary completion rates for both boys and girls. On the
                         implementation side, increase in the number, printing quality and availability of textbooks, implementation of a national primary completion exam and completion of the infrastructure
                         development component have been major achievements. However, initial plans to upgrade the curriculum, develop and implement a teacher professional development plan, create a
                         primary education cadre, and decentralize management have been delayed and will not be fully realized by the close of PEDPII. There was also little progress towards setting up a
                         solid assessment system that would allow for assessing and monitoring the quality of learning over time.

                         IMPLICATIONS FOR FOLLOW-ON PROJECT: Activities geared to improving quality which were delayed under PEDPII will be carried forward under PEDPIII. It is expected that the
                         focus on results and links to disbursement (with a precise time frame) will allow for a timely implementation.
