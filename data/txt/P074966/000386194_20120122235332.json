risk to\n            development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            usefulness of an education sub-sector approach. Under the\n            project, the Government took increased ownership and\n            activities began to be somewhat mainstreamed and integrated\n            into the regular system activities. Harmonization of\n            management, planning, procurement, accounting and reporting\n            arrangements helped to reduce Government of Bangladesh (GOB)\n            transaction costs significantly. Need for a robust\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E): during the early phases\n            of PEDP II, it was difficult to obtain sufficient focus on\n            results and timely reporting. Much of the information\n            available centered around progress of activities instead of\n            key implementation reforms and outcomes. Development partner\n            coordination: use of the results-based financing approach,\n            the pooling of development partners funding, and use of the\n            Government's systems for PEDPII resulted in the\n            development partners having more harmonized implementation\n            arrangements and joint planning towards key program results.\n            Implementation support: a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) that\n            uses a common results-based approach with Government and\n            development partners, and implements through regular\n            government systems requires joint responsibilities for\n            supervision within an integrated Implementation Support Plan\n            (ISP) defined before the SWAp is launched and ideally,\n            adequately funded."}, "docdt": "2011-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
