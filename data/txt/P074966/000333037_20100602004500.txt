                                    Proposed Changes
a. What are the proposed changes, as applicable, in the project's development
   objectives, outcomes, design, and/or scope?

No change is proposed to the Program Development Objectives.

A level-two project restructuring is proposed to facilitate: (i) reallocation of the Credit
between unallocated funds and Categories of Expenditure for better utilization of funds;
(ii) extension of the Closing Date from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011 (12 months) to
permit time for implementation of several important activities to better achieve the
development objectives, as well as facilitate a smoother preparation transition for the next
program; (iii) inclusion of some changes in the key performance indicators/targets which
were agreed at the Mid-Term Review to ensure consistency with newly available base-
line data at that time; and (iv) amendments in DCA to reflect changes in implementing
arrangements.

b. What are the other complementary changes, as applicable:
Institutional arrangements                               __X_Yes         ___No
If, yes, please explain:

In view of the importance and size of the PEDP II and its proposed successor, and the
increased leadership from MOPME/DPE, the GOB dissolved the Program Coordinating
Unit (PCU) upon completion of its contractual arrangements, and transferred the full
responsibility of project implementation and coordination to the Joint Program Director
in the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) . This is a welcome change and requires
minor amendments to the DCA Schedule 4 and replacement of PCU with DPE in all
places in the DCA.

Financing mechanism/Conduit                                  _X__Yes     __No
If, yes, please explain:

Additional funds were provided by some development partners after the Mid-Term
Review to fund expanded activities including provision of free textbooks annually to all
primary school students with the discontinuation of the re-use policy, further expansion
of additional classrooms and schools cum cyclone shelters, and continuation of partner
funding for School-Level Improvement Plans. The IDA loan amount of SDR 104.2
million was reduced by SDR84,571.45 (US$126,310) because of cancellation of funds on
February 20, 2009 due to misprocurement which occurred in the early stages of the
program.

Outputs                                                      _X__Yes     ___No
If, yes, please explain:

While the overall program development objective remains unchanged, there were some
changes recommended at the Mid-Term Review to adjust some KPIs, but mostly targets
to be more realistic and to be aligned with the available data collection. In the absence of

                                             5
more reliable data available at the commencement of PEDP II, targets were made based
on the information available. After the baseline was completed in 2005/2006, GOB and
development partners were aware that many of the initial targets were too ambitious and
were adjusted accordingly at the Mid-Term Review. Also, it was difficult to collect some
data and so some KPIs needed to be adjusted, but still in alignment with measurement of
the Program Development Objectives (see Annex 4). Some less critical KPIs are dropped
as the number was already high.

In addition to these, the program is also tracking a large number of intermediate
indicators. Three additional "core" indicators have also been added to the results matrix.
Government collects information on these already as component indicators, not as the
main set of KPIs.

Project Costs and financing plan (include summary tables) _X__Yes               ___No
If, yes, please explain:

No additional funds are required to cover costs for the extension period of one year.
However, based on information provided in the GOB's financing plan, it is proposed to
reallocate some funds from the unallocated category of expenditure (indicated in the
PAD and Development Credit Agreement) to the category for "goods" to ensure purchase
of sufficient textbook paper (ICB procurement) for provision in 2011 for textbooks in the
extension year. The remaining funds from the unallocated category will be allocated to
the "eligible local expenditures" category for the other remaining activities to be funded
under the pooled account.

If, yes, please explain:

During the last Joint Annual Review mission in May 2009, MOPME/DPE had indicated
that more time would be needed to allow satisfactory implementation of all the program
components and to reach the planned outcomes. The request is supported by
development partners. The task team supports the extension request of 12 months (from
June 30, 2010 to June 30 2011) in view of the following: (i) there was an initial delay of
nearly 12 months in commencing many activities under PEDP II largely due to the
dramatic changeover from project to programmatic approach for the Government and
development partners; (ii) further delays and disruptions were experienced due to the
national election in December 2008; and (iii) Government needs sufficient time, with no
funding gap, to adequately prepare for the new primary education program, so as not to
have similar start-up problems as were experienced under PEDPII. This includes trying
to design more harmonized processes, especially for disbursement. Therefore, the
extension is important to continue with the implementation progress, sustain the
momentum gained and secure the necessary continuity towards the next program both by
GOB and development partners.


A follow-up program is expected to be in place by July 2011. An earlier start of a new
program would not be possible considering the elaborate consensus building process
required for harmonizing inputs into the primary education sector particularly in the
context of a sector-wide approach. Steps have been initiated on a GOB-led process to
plan for the follow-on program. A draft National Education Policy has been developed, a
road map l is under preparation and development partners and GOB are embarking on
several analytical and knowledge generation activities and working group discussions to
support policy dialogue and the design of the program.


Implementation schedule                                     _X__Yes     ___No
If, yes, please explain:

The extension of one year will allow further implementation of PEDP II activities,
especially areas including several key activities in the Component 1 (strengthening the
monitoring and evaluation and EMIS system), Component 2 (quality including
preparation of the new Diploma of Education for teachers, and expanded teacher
recruitment), and Component 4 (reaching more disadvantaged students). The Joint
                                               7
Annual Review Mission planned for May 2010 will undertake a more in-depth review of
the planned activities which have been set out in the GoB's strategic financing
plan/schedule of activities for the next 18 months.

area of vulnerability and                  2. Measures have been taken by the GOB to control systemic
institutional capacity in                    corruption:
this area remains limited.                 (a) The Parliament approved in July 2006 a new Procurement
                                             Law, with most features of international good procurement
                                             practices, better competitiveness, transparency, efficiency, and
                                             system accountability, with no restriction on participation in
                                             bidding.
                                           (b) While the Law was significantly weakened in 2009, many
                                             reforms remain in place, with reasonable positive impact,
                                             including reduced delays, improved transparency and
                                             accountability of public procurement officials. GOB has been
                                             informed about which changes are not acceptable with IDA
                                             financing.
                                           (c) The passage of the Right to Information Act 2009 provides an
                                             institutionalized mechanism for accessing information held by
                                             public authorities that has the potential to significantly
                                             transform relations between citizens and government, leading
                                             to more transparency in project activities.

                                              Schools, and for head teachers and teachers to purchase
                                              quality inputs locally.

                                           3. Improved transparency and accountability of decentralized
                                              education expenditures and reliability of financial reports.




Other risks in the sector remain about the same as they were at appraisal of PEDP II, including
chronic vacancies and capacity to implement. Because of concerns raised during the
discussions of the closing date extension and the new program regarding chronic vacancies and
limited professional capacity of several key institutions, MOPME prepared a position paper
and an action plan for the filling of more vacancies, and then worked with the Ministry of
Establishment (MoEst) to enable regulations to expedite recruitment, thereby signifying their
commitment to work on these issues. MOPME has also taken steps to try to resolve the issue
of using direct GOB funding to schools for the school level improvement plans. A viable
solution has been proposed and is awaiting approval.
