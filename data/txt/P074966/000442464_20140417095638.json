Education\n            Development Project for Bangladesh were as follows: outcome\n            was satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            significant; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory;\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: in a sector-wide approach (SWAP),\n            the leadership of development partners requires a mix of\n            \"hard skills\", \"soft skills\", and\n            flexibility. The World Bank proved to play an important role\n            in supporting fiduciary processes and participating in the\n            technical dialogue. While there is agreement that ownership\n            is an important determinant of success, the concept of\n            ownership is often seen as a dichotomous process either\n            there is ownership or not. The World Bank expressed repeated\n            concerns about the government's ownership of the\n            program, for example, the use of consultants to prepare the\n            macro plan and concerns that the government initially raised\n            about a SWAP. No sector is an island and it is important for\n            sector programs to coordinate with efforts to strengthen\n            public administration and governance. A SWAP is an\n            evolutionary process that requires flexibility and\n            adaptation to succeed. With support, governments can\n            transform monitoring and evaluation (M and E) systems from a\n            pro forma system of collecting data to a powerful tool for\n            monitoring and decision making."}, "docdt": "2014-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
