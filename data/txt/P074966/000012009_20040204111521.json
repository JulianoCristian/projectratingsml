Project is to improve quality,\n            equitable access, and efficiency in primary education\n            through a sub-sector program approach. Specifically, the\n            program will assist the Government to: (a) improve the\n            quality of teaching and learning, and raise student\n            achievement; (b) increase access to schooling for the\n            disadvantaged; and, (c) strengthen planning and management\n            of primary education, including establishing a national\n            monitoring and evaluation system for primary education. This\n            program is in line with both the Country Assistance Strategy\n            (CAS) and sectoral goals, and the Interim Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper (PRSP), which aims to develop a\n            cost-effective, and better managed primary education system.\n            The first component will improve quality through\n            organizational development and capacity building ,including\n            program management, and monitoring and evaluation. It\n            comprises three subcomponents, aimed at supporting\n            investments which will result in improved educational\n            management, including good governance of the primary\n            education system, with a focus on increasing authority and\n            accountability at district, upazila, and school levels while\n            addressing fiscal, and supervisory irregularities in the\n            sub-sector. The interventions proposed in the second\n            component represent the core quality inputs of the project,\n            and provide the framework for systemic and institutional\n            change, interventions that are designed to ensure program\n            schools meet the agreed primary school quality level\n            criteria. Other interventions, linking capacity building to\n            program implementation, would include strengthening primary\n            education apex institutions such as the National Academy of\n            Education (NAPE), and the National Curriculum and Textbook\n            Board (NCTB), support for Primary Training Institutes for\n            initial teacher training, and Upazila Resource Centers for\n            in-service teacher training. The third component consists of\n            a summary of all physical facilities requirements under the\n            other components, and includes support for improving\n            existing ones, and providing new infrastructure, facilities,\n            furnishings and equipment. Finally, the fourth component\n            focuses on promoting, and facilitating access to quality\n            schooling for those children who have never attended formal\n            primary schooling, or who have dropped out, mainly due to\n            poverty. It also includes capacity building interventions\n            which are essential for institutionalizing strategies, and\n            processes critical for ensuring access for children\n            disadvantaged by poverty, and special needs."}, "docdt": "2004-01-16T00:00:00Z"}
