Environmental aspects will be considred in both\n            design and construction/reconstruction of buildings,\n            latrines, and tube wells. Since arsenic has contaminated the\n            tube well water, remedial measures will be taken. Engineers\n            will sink/re-sink the tube wells into arsenic free layers\n            and re-test the water of the new tube wells with the help of\n            the health department to ensure safe drinking water in the\n            primary schools. In geographical locations where arsenic has\n            contaminated the tube wells, alternate measures will be\n            taken. For example deep-set hand tube wells will be sunk in\n            alluvial normal areas; half deep-set hand tube wells with\n            Tara pumps will be used in high alluvial areas; ring wells\n            will be used in hilly areas; and deep-set hand tube wells at\n            designated lower depths will be used in saline-affected\n            coastal areas. Water testing laboratories have been\n            established in different districts and regional levels to\n            test water quality--for bacteria as well as arsenic. For\n            sanitation, twin pit latrines (alternating pit use) will\n            ensure one pit is dry and made germ-free. The dried-up\n            residual matter can be used as green manure. Building design\n            and construction will incorporate environmental practices.\n            They will ensure soundness to resist cyclone and tidal\n            surges, withstand earthquakes of moderate magnitude,\n            facilitate cross-ventilation, and minimize dampness with\n            pre-cast hexagonal ventilators."}, "docdt": "2003-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
