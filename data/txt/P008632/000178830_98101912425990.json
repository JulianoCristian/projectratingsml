         pilot highway rehabilitation program initiated under the\n            First Highway Project to Portugal as a whole; a significant\n            number of highways have deteriorated to the point where they\n            need reconditioning to make it possible to maintain them\n            with a reasonable amount of maintenance effort. Many of the\n            roads are now in such poor structural condition that even\n            with intensive and expensive maintenance they will break up\n            under present traffic loads unless rehabilitation is\n            expeditiously carried out. Thus, the project aims not only\n            at lowering transport costs throughout Portugal, but at\n            reducing maintenance costs and protecting investments in\n            highway infrastructure. The project would also include a\n            training and fellowship component. The benefits from the\n            project will accrue to the economy of Portugal as a whole.\n            The project faces no special project related risk."}, "docdt": "1979-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
