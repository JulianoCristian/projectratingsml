three-year\n            program of technical assistance and a pilot program of\n            rehabilitation works. Technical assistance would consist of\n            5 engineers and 1 management consultant to strengthen\n            services of the Office du Niger and to prepare the plans\n            required for the appraisal of a comprehensive infrastructure\n            rehabilitation project within two years, as well as\n            short-term consultancy services for special studies. The\n            pilot program would carry out urgent repairs on the\n            irrigation infrastructures; it would also aim at\n            establishing the most cost-effective methods of on-farm\n            works to be used in a subsequent large-scale rehabilitation\n            project. Other project components include support for\n            agricultural research and trial programs, an aerial\n            photographic survey, a socio-economic study of the settler\n            population, an audit of the Office du Niger accounts, and\n            training scholarships for Malian engineers."}, "docdt": "1978-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
