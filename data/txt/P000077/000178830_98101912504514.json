comprise: (a) construction by force account of about 700 km\n            of feeder roads; (b) maintenance of about 1,200 km of feeder\n            roads; and technical assistance to the feeder roads division\n            within the Ministry of Public Works for carrying out civil\n            works, project monitoring, staff training and the\n            preparation of future feeder roads programs. Project\n            benefits will accrue to farmers who will have year-round\n            access to markets for their surplus production, and\n            transporters in the form of savings from reduced vehicle\n            operating costs. Institutional strengthening will also be a\n            major benefit. Project risks are limited."}, "docdt": "1980-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
