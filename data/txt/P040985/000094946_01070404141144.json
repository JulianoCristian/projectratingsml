The lessons\n            learned from the implementation of the project include:\n            Strong institutional development efforts are needed for\n            partner organizations (PO) to become sustainable in\n            accessing market funds. Intensive supervision and monitoring\n            of POs by skilled staff of APEX institutions such as Palli\n            Karma Sahayak Foundation(PKSF) with sensitivity to clients\n            is essential for maintaining portfolio quality. A rating\n            system for POs is useful at apex institutions such as PKSF\n            for managing risk related to resources allocation and\n            provide early warning of problems. A \"business\n            plan\" showing its strategic goals, expansion plans,\n            institutional development needs, and measures to attain\n            them, is a useful management tool for apex institutions and\n            its POs. Evaluation of the creditworthiness, institutional\n            capacity, and empowerment efforts of all POs is necessary to\n            make a sustainable positive impact on borrowers. Review of\n            the POs' interest rate policy to absorb the cost of\n            funds and to raise capital in financial markets is essential\n            to achieve sustainability. A human resource development\n            (HRD) policy for apex institutions and POs is required to\n            promote staff motivation and ensure their career paths for\n            efficiency and sustainability of the sector."}, "docdt": "2001-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
