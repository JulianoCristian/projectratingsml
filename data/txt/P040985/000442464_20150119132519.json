The first\n            project, begun in 1996, channeled funds an innovative\n            quasi-government poverty foundation that lends to promising\n            small and medium non-government organizations (NGOs) to\n            expand microcredit programs. It helped reduce poverty by\n            stabilizing income and consumption as well as by increasing\n            access to clean water and better health. The project also\n            increased school enrollment rates and boosted family assets.\n            In addition, by supporting partner-NGOs that retail\n            microcredit, it enabled them to seek part of their funding\n            needs from the financial market, and allowing their gradual\n            integration into the formal financial sector. Inspired by\n            this success, the World Bank approved the second poverty\n            alleviation micro-finance project in January 2001. The\n            Bank-sponsored project alone is projected to reach an\n            estimated 1.2 million new borrowers and support 19,500 micro-entrepreneurs."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
