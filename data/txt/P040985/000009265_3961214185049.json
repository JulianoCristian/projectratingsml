Partner\n            Organizations' (POs) credit programs through: (a)\n            financing expansion of lending; (b) enhancing the role of\n            PKSF; (c) assisting in institutional strengthening of PKSF\n            and its borrowers by providing resources for training and\n            institution building; (d) providing insight and possible\n            solutions to several issues/problems currently facing the\n            microfinance system in Bangladesh; and (e) disseminating\n            best practices for increasing cost effectiveness of these\n            programs. The project components will be the following: 1) a\n            line of credit for loans to the poor through POs that meet\n            predetermined criteria; and 2) technical assistance for\n            capacity and institution building of the POs, PKSF and\n            Bangladesh Bank."}, "docdt": "1996-08-14T00:00:00Z"}
