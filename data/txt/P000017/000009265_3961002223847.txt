EN1CRANDUM AND   NNENDaTIO  OP THE PRESIDENT
OF Ton IITRTIONaL  OVPMT  ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TE RIPUBLICS OF BEIM AtND TOGO
FOR AM EMINENG ANID TECHNICAL ASSISTANC3 PROJECT
1.          I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and
recommendation on two proposed development credits to the Republic of B6nin
and the Republlc of Tog* for SDR 2.1 mllion each, the equivalent of U8$2.75
mllion each, an standard IDA terms wlth a maturlty of 40 years to help
finance engineering and other studies, as well as tochnical aselstance and
training for Communaut6 Electrique du B6nin (CSB).  The proceeds of the
credits would be relent to CEB under the same terms and condltlons, except
that the repaymenc. period would be 10 years, following 4 years of grace. CUB
would bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.         IJakJUMgMd.  In 1968, the States of Binin and 5ogo concluded a
treaty creating CBB, a blnational joint power generation and tranamission
company. CB has been operatlonal since 1971 and lts role has been largely
that of wholesale supplier of electricity, purchased from the Volta River
Authorlty (VPA) in Ghana, for sale to the national power utilitles of B6nin
(Scci6t6 B6ninolse dElectricitf et d'Uau - SBEE) and Togo (Compagnle Energie
Ulectrlque du Togo - CURT) whlch, in turn, dlstribute lt to retail consumers.
Although thli arrangement has worked well since 1971, relationships between
the three utilitles require further clarlflcation and modiflcation,
particularly as relates to definitlon of responsibility for thermal power
generation, bulk transmisslon and prielng mechanisms (gse para. 3 of the
Technical Aniex). CUD's system consists of a 161 kV transmission line from
Ghana's Akosombo hydroelectric plant to substatlons in both Togo and B6nin.
Since late 1987, CUB has also operated the Nangbeto hydroelectric power ;-lant
(60 MV, 1SO Gah) which was partly flnanced by IDA. Nangbeto is the first of
two, possibly three, sites which could eventually be developed to harness the
hydroelectric potential of the Mono rlver. Studies on Adjarala on the Mono
River on the border of Togo and B6nin, and on Rstou on the Ou6m6 River in
B4nin are underway, under financing from the Nangbeto Credits (1507-BUM/1508-
TO). A SPPF (Gl3l-BEN/G132-TO) was granted in June 1991 to finance the
feaesbillty study of the extension of the transmiosion nL nwork to North-
Togo/North-Bnln. Furthermore, CUB, boing located between Ghana and Nigeria,
is a main link in the West Africa Interconnectlon schme now belng studled
under Nordic financing wlth the AfDB as executing agency. As a first step in
this interconnectlon, CEB is envisaging a short (about 50 km) interconnectlon
between sakete in B6nin on CUB's ystem and Ikeja West ln Nlgeria on the
National Electric Power Authorlty's (NEPA) system. Thls would provide a test
case for the regional interconnection proposed along the West Afrlca coast,
wlth links to the Bahel countries (see para. 6 of the Technical Annex).
3.          Proict  Descriution.    The  proposed  project,  a  reglonal
undertaking involving W6nin and Togo, emphasizes technical assistance and
training for institutlonal strengthening and regional development, as
reflected in the following components: (a) updating of the countrles' least-
cost generation, transmisson and dlstribution master plans; (b) evaluatlon
of CB'a short-term  supply requirements, including a review of existlng
thermal plants, and definitlon of a model for reglonal power Lnterchange; (c)
detaLled engineering and bldding documents of the northern interconnectionsl
(d) the design of standard models for substations, towers and conductor*. for



the 161 kV system expansions (e) tariff studies for CE3, So3 and C$ET,
including an analysis of long run marginal costs as a guide to tariff
structure and of revenue requirements to set the rates; (f) updating supply
options, including hydroelectric scheme, international interconnections and
environmental assessment; and (g) institutional strengthening of CEB,
including training, legal, planning and computerization (see para. 9 of the
Technical Annex). The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at
US$6.1 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$SS.
mllion (90%). The breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of dLsbursements, and the
dLsbureement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the RepublLcs of
B*nin and Togo are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
4.          Project Implementation.   CEB has a good track record as an
executinq agency; its Department of Studies and Control would be responsible
for impi menting the proposed project. It is appropriately staffed and would
provide regular progress reports, prepare a detailed mid-taem review and
coordinate with 83S3 and CENT to ensure effective project implementation.
S.         Project SustaLnabiltv.  The project adopts an approach that is
f3cused and operatlonal in line with CeB*s objectives and charter.  C$B has
strengthened its ability to plan and implement investment projects.  The
proposed project looks beyond th-s aspect and is designed to prepare CEB to
play a broader role in the context of regional cooperation and integration.
CUBI's staff understands this role and has been involved in project design
since its initiation.   This has ensured ownership of the project and
identification with its objectives.
6.         Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project follows directly IDA's
past and present involvement in the sector, i.e. the Engineering & Technical
Assistance Project (Credlts 1189-333/1190-TO), the Nangbeto Hydroelectric
Project (Credits 1507-BUN/1508-TO), the Togo Power Rehabilitation and
Extension Project iCredlt 2171-TO), the Benin Power RehabllitatLon and
Xxtension Project (Credit 2284-BEN) and the study of the North-Togo/North
D6nLn interconnection (SPPPs G053-BEN/Go54-To and G131-BB3/132-TO). Its maln
purposes are to: (a) improve sector efficLency and mnlimize the long-term
cost of electricity supply in B6nin and Togo; (b) strengthen CUB's management
and operations through technLcal assistance and trainLng; and (c) encourage
regional cooperation and lntegration.
7.         Proiect Desian and Lessons learned. A noteworthy feature of the
proposed project is its regional nature, covering not only Togo/D6nin and
Ghana, but also with links to C8te d'Ivoire, Nigeria and the Sahel countrles.
A primary lesson is that regional cooperation can be achieved if the
incentives and environment are correct. The project therefore builds on this
experience but also incorporates a number of other modifications in the light
of experience. For example, institutional relationship  and responsib3lity
of generation and transmissLon have not always besn clear and the project
design is addressing this explicitely.   Thus, under the project the
respective roles of GOB/GOT and SBZN/CEET on the one hand, and CEB on the
other, will be clarified and strengthened.  Further in line with OlD's
fLndings, the project emphasLzes the need to transfer know how and to train



- 3 -
local staff, particularly in area of nasnagemnt and planning, to ensue that
Cm becomes self reliant in the longer rn.
S.          Rationale for IDA Involvment.  IDA's involvement in the power
sector of B3nin and Togo, which dates back to 1978 when IDA was executing
agency for a UNDP-financed powrw developmnt study, aims at assisting the
authorities to provide efficient electricity supply and meet reasonable
demand while reducing the sectorIs dependence on government fiscal resources.
IDA's role is catalytic and consistent with that for other countries in West
Africa. It encourages the promotion of regional exchange and development of
power and energy within the frameork of regional integration and
cooperationt strengthens the relationship and coordination between CUS and
the two national distribution entities in Togo and 8Dning and promotes
conservation measures, including appropriate pricing policies. Without IDA's
participation it is unlikely that these aims would be achieved, given the
predominantly bilateral natura of other aid for the sector. Furthermore, on8
and GOM have already requested that IDA act as co-ordinating agency for
future binational projects. Finally, continued involvement of IDA at both
th regional and national levels provides the means of reinforcing not only
the power sector, but also the SAL process underway in B6nin and Togo, with
its emphasis on efficient investments, parastatal reform  and financial
stabilization.
9.            jions agreed.  During negotiations, in addition to discussing
and agreeing on the terms of reference of the studies financed by the
project, agreement was reached on the followings (a) confirmation of C$B's
responsibilities concerning the development of joint transmission and
generation resources, (b) strengthening the cocrdinating mechanisms among the
three entities; (c) continuation of the external audit requirement; (d)
financial covenants covering rate of return targets and minimum debt service
coverageI (e) continuation of the annual consultation on CUB's inveutment
plan to ensure that it is least-cost; (f) review and implementation of agreed
recommendations on tariffs and their structure and level to ensure that they
reflect long-term marginal costs and are consistent with financial
performance  objectives;  (g)  reconfirmation  of  the  agreement whereby
receivables are to be paid within three months; (h) arrangements for project
implementation; and  (i) a mid-term project review.   Execution of the
relending agreemnt between GOB/GOT and CUB is a condition of Credit
effectiveness.
10.         Environmental Aspects and Program Obi ctive Cateorie .  The
proposed project, being an Engineering and Technical Assistance Project, has
no adverse environmental impact. it is classified as a Category C project.
The engineering studies for the transmission lines and technical audits of
thermal plants, nonetheless, would address environmental concerns.  The
mandatory dam safety inspection would also continue. The proposed project is
designed to promote public enterprise reform through strengthening of the
agency involved with emphasis on ccummrcial operations. The proposed project
also fits generally in IDA's antipoverty strategy by promoting least-cost
wholesale supply by CUB, with a life line supply for low-income consumers and
by stimulating network extension in established urban areas and in the
interlor, where it is reaching increasingly lower income strata of the
population.



11.         Proimot Rnef.  The proposed project would set the stage Zor
providing least-cost power to the northern parts of Togo and 3nin while, at
the sawm time, reinforcing regionma cooperation and integration. It would
also maintain and, wherever possible, reinforce technical cooperation among
the three entities, with a view to defining more clearly the boundaries, both
for ownership and operational purposes, at the substation level.
Purthermore, tariffs and investment plans would be closely scrutinized, the
former to ensure that they are providing the right signals to consumers, and
the latter that they are least-cost.
12.         3ik.. No significant risk have ben identified in the proposed
project other than the current political situation in Togo. The political
risk arising from the binational status of CUB is minimal thanks to the 20
year history of cooperation in the power ectore of Togo and 86nin beginning
with the establishment of CII and followed by the successful implementation
and operation of both the interconnection with VRA and Nangbeto.
13.         Recommndati*.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreemnt of tbh Association and recommend that
the Nxecut._-e Directors approve it.

Disbursements - Implementation Issues
In Togo, certain projects show significant disbursement lags. The
reasons for such performance is due to lack of counterpart funds as in the
case of the pre-investment project (Credit 2018-TO) and TR III (Credit
1600-TO). The Government and implementation agencies of these projects
where the closing dates expire during CY92, will be informed that an
extenion of said closing date would only be granted provided specific
actions -were put into place. If this was not to occur, the respective
credit. would be closed and the credit balance cancelled.
In D6nin, a significant disbursement lag is shown in the Public
Enterprise project (Credit 1748-BUN). This is mainly due to the changes in
the country circumstances resulting in little demand for enterprise
rehabilitation. The action taken is to have a mid-term review for the
project in September 1992, and redesign the project as needed with the
Government.

TA WAL ArNE TO THE 3MONAUMMS U7D  C DIaaXOF 0THE PAIDET
FM An ZNGIX AMD TECHNaICL AssiTANCE¢ PROJECT
CiON A: DA TAD PROCT DESCRIPTION
1.    Responsibilities in the power sectors of Togo and Benin are dividd
among thre entitieas CUB, CUT and 8B3.  In Togo, Compagnie EnergLe
Blectrique du Togo (CEUT), and in B4nin, BociL6t4 Bninoise d'Ulectricit6
et dl'au (8933), are by law responsible for the generation. transmission
and distribution of electrLeity in their respective countries.
2.    Under the terms of a treaty betwen Togo and BDnin concluded in
1968, a large part of the responsibilities of GOT and CENT on the one
hand, and of GoB and 5833 on the other, wore transferred to a new bi-
national entity, Coumunaut& Blectrlque du B6n$n (CBS). Both C laT' and
3333s statutes are Ln the process of being modified to reflect the
change, with technical asesitance financed by Credits 2171-TO and 2284-
BEN, respectively.
3.    The treaty creating CUB marked a slgnificant step Ln Lnternatlonal
^ooperatLon: CUS was one of the fLrst supra-national public enterprlses ln
Afrlca, and the Code B6nino-Togolals de 1`'lectrLcit6 L the first common
electric utility legislation adopted by two independent AfrLcan states.
Under the treaty, CUB has a dual mandate as: (a) a publlc utlilty with a
monopoly of generation and transmLisLon throughout Togo and Bnln, wLth
the exception of faciltLes in servLce before 1968 and captive plants of
less than 100 kYAX and (b) a directorate to which GOT and GOB have
delegated extensive regulatory powers, speciflcally: the regulation of
generatlon, transmission and dLstributLon of electrLcity; tarlff setting;
lLcensing captlve plants in excess of 100 kVA; the conduct of negotiations
concerning interconnectLons with other countriLes planning and
implementing electrLflcation in the two countrLes; and operating a
training center for the beneflt of the three power sector entitLes.
4.    CU' s organization is three-tiered and comprLsesn
(a)   the  ffaut ConseLl Inter0tatLque de la Communaut60 (HCIC),
composed of eLght membero of ministerial rank, four from each
country, of whom two act as concurrent presidents; it mets at
least onoe a year to determine and monitor CU'a broad policy;
T'his report is based on dn   of an appaisad _ison consstg of Chades Sigwal (TWk Muzager,
Sr. Finaci Aulyst, APBI and Said Mikam (Sr. Power Bingw, APE, who vibd Too in

(b)   the "Saute Autorit6o (VA), composed of ten members, five from
each country (including the General Managers of CEET and SUN),
nominated by the two Governments and appointed by the UCIC; it
is equivalent to a Board of Directors and establishes the broad
lines of action on technical and commercial matters for the
General Manager and oversees management; It also proposes new
investment and sets tariffs for review and agreement by the
UCIC; and
(C)   the "Directeur G4neral" (General Manager), appointed by the UCIC
after nomination by the NA, who is responsible for the day-to-
day management of CUB.
5.    To ensure optimal power sector management and coordination in Togo
and B6nin, the arrangement described above has recently been reinforced by
the creation of a Permanent Coordinating Committee (PCC) of the General
Managers of CEB, CUET and SBEE which meets regularly to discuss policies
and to prepare major proposals for joint submission to the HA. It is
supported by ad-hoc working level committees, such as for sector planning
and investment, operations, finance and training.
6.    During the first twenty years or so of its exzitence, CzB has
largely confined its role to that of a wholesale supplier of electricity
to the two national power entities, CURT and SBHU. In the process, and
with strong support from IDA, CUB has developed into a well-managed
utility which, by being in charge of imports and major indigeneous power
facilities, has assured the security of supply in the main load centers of
the  coastal region  and  relieved the weaker national entities  of
responsibilities for which they were less well equipped. CSB's role is
now further enlarged with the study and eventual implementation of the
northern interconnections and the West Africa Interconnection scheme.
7.    Details of CUB's financial situation are shown in Anpendi  1-1
(Income 8tatement), AnR=d_ix 1-2 (Balance Sheet) and Abgdix 1-3 (Funds
Flow Statements). Since 1979, both operating and not income have always
been positive, with an average operating ratio of about 80%, which is
satisfactory. The rate of return on net fixed assets, which reached up to
3S% just prior to the incorporation of the Nangbeto investment into the
asset base in FY88, since then still stands at 6%. CUB's capitalization
is sound with a debt/equity ratio of 46s54 and a current ratio of above 6.
Funds Flow Statements show a consistently healthy pattern, with an average
net internal cash contribution to investment of 28% over the period FY78
to FY90, which augurs well for CUB's ability to contribute to major future
investments such as the northern interconnections and the Adjarala
hydroelectric project. on the basis of the above, the following financial
covenants have boen agreed upons minimum debt service coverage of 1.5 and
rate of return on net current fixed assets of 6 minimum. This RoR should
ensure that CXB will maintain a sound financial position, cover its
operating and capital costs and provide for a contribution to investment
from internal cash generation and at the same time provide power
efficiently and at its economic cost.

8.    CBS's present tariff, unchanged since 1984, is about CrAr 24/kWh.
The table below shows some relevant data:

Av. Revenue, CPAW/kwh       24    25   22    24         24
The average cost of purchase from VRA, at US cents 5/kWh, is equivalent to
ClAP 15, taking an average rate of exchange of CFAF 300 to the dollar.
The average cost of generation at Nangboto is about CFAF 24/kWh,
comprising CFAP 10/kWh for debt service, CFAP 12/kWh for depreciation and
ClAP 2/kwh for operations.  Rence, the average cost of energy purchased
and generated for the period under consideration is: (0.8*15)+(0.32*24)
C-AF 18/kwh. The average revenue per kWh being CIFI 24, the difference
Is CMA 6/kwh, which covers the following items, in CPAP/kWh:
operations, excluding Nangbeto:       1
depreciation, excluding Nangbetot     1
interest, excluding Nangbetos         1
retained earnings:                    3
Retained earnings are set aside by CEB and become part of its net internal
cash generation which will help finance future investment. The simplified
presentation above illustrates some major elements to be further examined
as part of the tariff etudies planned under the project.
Detailed Project Description
9.    The proposed project, which emphasizes institutional strengthening
and technical studies, would include the f0'lowing components, some of
which could be combined:
(a)   the technical audit of the thermal plants in the interconnected
system of Togo and B6nin, and completion of any rehabilitation
work required, and negotiation of a contract to operate them.
This would also require the procurement of spare parts for the
safe operation of the plants. The two main plants concerned -
CTL in Togo and Akpakpa in B6nin - have been operating as stand-
by in case of loss of power from the CZB system. The purpose
of this operation is two-fold: first, to enlarge the supply
options of CEB, as VRA may run short of capacity until they get
their planned gas turbines on line; and second, CUB may have to
supply all of its load growth starting in 1993 from the thermal
plants in Lom6 (about 100 NW) and Cotonou (about 25 MW) and
therefore the plants should be ready for commercial operation
on a larger scale;



- 16 -
(b)   updating and integrating the generation, transmlssion and
distribution master plans of Togo and B6nin to ensure that they
are least-cost, and thereafter, using the investment costs of
the three utilities ln the financial analysis of the entire
power sectort
(c)   preparing the detailed engineering and bidding documents of the
northern interconnections, and evaluating their short-term
tariff implications;
(d)   preparing standard models for substations, towers and conductors
for the high voltage gridt
(e)   tariff studies for the three entities concerned, i.e CEB, CEET
and SB,n taking into account the costs and benefits of regLonal
interchange, as well as a detailed analysis of underlying
economic and financial costs;
(f)   environmental assessments of future generation and transmission
projects, including some environmental preservation works;
(g)   updating as required the technical, economic and financial
studies relating to the Adjarala hydroelectric project on the
Mono river and the R&tou hydroelectric project on the Oudm6
river; and/or the feasibility study of the next generation and
transmission project on the least-cost investment program;
(h)   institutional strengthening of CeB, in particular its legal,
planning and computerization components, as well as its
relationship with CENT and SBEN, including the definition of a
model for the operation of the thermal plants and allocation of
their operating costsl and
(i)   continued technical assistance (in particular to help CUB in
upcomlng negotiations for a new contract with VRA and later with
MlPA) and training, including further reinforcement of CUsB'
training capabilities at the Abomey/Calavi training center,
which would also benefit CENT and SUEZ; this would include about
15 man-month of short-term technical instructors, teaching aids
and equipment, and about 10 short-term scholarships.
Xmpluu'atiJon
10.   CUB will be responsible for the implementation of the project.  In
order to ensure the operationIs sustainability once it is launched, CUB
has agreed to appoint the head of the Department of Studies and Oontrol as
Project Manager. His position in CB'Ss organization chart is shown in
AVgrdix__2., and he will be assisted as necessary by qualified staff of
other Departments. The project will be implemented as follows:
(a)   the institutional strengthening component will consist of a
series of studies covering inter, ala the legal and regulatory
framework of CUB, its relationship with the two national
distribution companies (CENT and 581), and its computerization,



- 17 -
investment planning and internal accounting and control
policies, including transparoncy in accounting and audlting.
It will also examine possible strategy options, including
privatlsation. It will also consist of technlcal asesitance and
training, covering dam safety inspection, load dispatching,
technical audlt of back-up thermal power plants, negotiatlon of
interchane agreemnts and economic justification of projects;
the audit of the thermal plants will be joLntly don by CUD,
CEeT and SUNK under CUB leadership. Procurement of spare parts
and any other rehabilltatLon wc-:k will be paid for by CBS to the
respective utllity under arrangements to be Liventigated and
agreed under the institutLonal components
(b)   studies, as detalled in para. 9 above, will mainly cover
generation, transmission and distrLbution master plans, short-
term supply requirements, detailed engineering and bLdding
documents for the northern interconnections, tarlffe, and
technical, economic and financlal aspects of future major
projects;
(c)   environmental aspects to be covered under the project are
Unvironmental Assessments (NAs) for future transmisslon and
generation projects, dam safety and the audit of thermal plants;
(d)   miscellaneous  equipment  covers  mainly  addltional  offlce
equipment and computers, including the relevant software, both
for operational and trainlng purposes; and
(e)   training wlll cover expendltures incurred by CDB ln runnlng and
developing lts abomey-CalavL training center such as teachers,
instructors and teaching aids. A major extenslon of the center
is presently underway under financing from the Caisse Centrale,
and IDA's proposed contributLon would ensure effective use of
the facillty for the benefit of all three entities. The center
and these traLnlng programs are funded by the three entities and
are self supporting.
Term  of reference for the main poLats listed above were agreed upon
during negotlations and are available in the Project Flle. In particular,
the TOs contain provLsions for transfer of technlcal know-how  to
counterparts and achLevement of these crlteria wll be dLscussed during
the mld-term review. The consultants will also be required to traLn local

tables are shown in An2ne L.aL. The average cost of consulting servlce'



- 18 -
has been estimated at about US$15,000 per month, which reflects the cost
of local and foreign expertise. The costs are based on December 1991
prices, and on the cost of obtaining similar services of satisfactory
quality in Togo, D6nin and neighboring countries.   The amount of
consultant services to be financed under the project is estimated at about
250 man-months, of which most would be expatriate. Physical contingencies
of 4%, and price escalation contingencies of 4% p.a. for foreign ant local
costs have besn applied.
Project Financaig
12.   An IDA credit of SDR 4.2 million (US$5.5 million equivalent) will
be provided towards financing 90% of the total cost of the project. C0B
will contribute the remaining 10% (US$0.6 million equivalent) to finance
the local costs.  Retroactive financing of up to US$200,000 would be
provided for technical assistance to CEB from the date of appraisal, in
particular in its negotiations with VRA.
ProIFemNa--
13.   All procurement under the project, with the exception of the limited
part devoted to environAental aspects and the supply of equipment, will be
for consulting services, technical assistance and training, and will be in
accordance with Bank guidelines.   Terms of reference,  letters of
invitation, short lists of firms or individual consultants, and draft
contracts will be subject to prior IDA review. Contracts for procurement
of miscellaneous equipment are expected to be about US$200,000 and
procurement will be based on LCD procedures, in line with the Bank's
Guidelines on Procurement. To the extent possible, item will be packaged
in lots of US$50,000 or more. Post-award procurement documentation will
be forwarded to IDA, as set out in the guidelines, prior to disbursement.
Procurement of spare parts and limited equipment for the thermal plants up
to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$600,000 equivalent will be
procured through sole sourcing, given the nature of thi equipment.
Uquipment that could be supplied by different suppliers will be procured
through Limited International Bidding. The list of suppliers will be
subject to review and clearance by IDA, and once cleared, .he list cannot
be changed.   All IDA financed contracts for amounts of US$150,000
equivalent or more, will be subject to prior review; other contracts will
be subject to selective post-award review.   Amounts and methods of
procurement are sunmmarixed in Schedule B.
14.   Experience from previous IDA operations in the sector has shown that
CEB with its special binational status has not suffered from any lengthly
procedure to obtain COB or GOT approval for procurement matters. Large
contracts above US$2 million are approved by the UCIC members without any
formal meeting. The present status is expected to continue in the future.
Furthermore, no large contracts are expected to be awarded under the
propooed project.

DisburematsY
15.   Disbursements will be made against standard Dank documentation. For
expenditures on purchase orders and contracts not exceeding US$50,000,
disbursemente will be made on the basis of statements of expenditure
(8O2s). The proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed against expenditures
as follows: 100% of expenditures for consulting services, technical
assistance and training, 100% of foreign and 90% of local expenditures for
equipment ard activities related to the environment.  In order to ensure
the timely availability of funds to finance the costs of services and
equipment to be procured under the Project, CUR will establish a separate
Special Account in a bank acceptable to the Association.  An initial
deposit of CFAF 60 million (about US$230,000 equivalent) will be made from
the credit account. The estimated schedule of disbursements is set out in
Bchodulo . Disbursements are oepected to be completed by December 31,
1995, with the closing date scheduled for June 30, 1996.  Since the
Project consists mostly of studies, this timetable is considered
reasonable.
16.   CEB has an excellent proven record of project implementation.  For
the Nangboto Hydroelectric Project (Credits 1507-BUN/1508-TO), all
principal components were completed within the time schedule and below
budget. With the reallocation of funds after completion of the dam, a few
activities were expanded such as paving the access road to the site and
building the operator's village.   These activities necessitated the
postponement of the closing date of the above Credits. Such conditions,
however, are not expected to pertain during implementation of the proposed
project.
Accondting, Auditing and Reporting
17.   CBS's accounting system is satisfactory, and CUB has performed well
in respect of audits. Auditors have always certified CUB's accounts and
audit reports have been received on time. CUB will continue to maintain
its accounting system in accordance with sound and internationally
recognized accounting principles and practices acceptable to IDA to
provide annual financial statements that reflect the financial performance
and position of the project and the entity, from the comencement of
project execution. An auditor's opinion and report satisfactory to IDA on
such statements will be provided within six months of the close of the
fiscal year.   The auditor's report will include a statement on the
adequacy or otherwise of the accounting system and internal controls, the
reliability of statements of expenditures as a basis of credit
disbursements, and compliance with financial covenants. Tha foregoing
accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements should provide
adequate and timely information to IDA for supervision of the project.
18.   Project implementation will be regularly reviewed by CEB and IDA.
C$B will be responsible for reporting on project progress.  Progress
reports will be prepared quarterly, will cover project implementation and
expenditures, and will contain key indicators for monitoring the progress
of the project. The program of activities for the subsequent year will be
agreed between CUB and IDA by October of each year. The Supervision Plan
is given in AMMAd& 4 together with the implementation schedule and the

required sank input into project supervision. PLslly, a mid-term review
of the project wvil take place in 1994.

Reporting Requirements. Superision Plan and Implementation Schedule
A.    Reporting Requirements
Project execution will be monitored to record progress against the implementation
schedule, identifying any corrective action that may be required in respect of individual
components. Reporting is the responsibility of CEB. Reports will be prepared quarterly and will
comprise a fmancial section recapitulating project expenditures, a section assessing the progress
of each of the programmed activities by reference to the implementation schedule, and an
evaluation of progress made.
B.    Supevsion Plan
Twice yearly Bank supervision missions would allow for adequate supervision of the
Project. Expected skfll requirements would include engineering, financial, economics,
procuremetit and training. A mission in 1994 would perform a mid-term review. A last mission
in 1996 oE i997 would prepare the PCR.
C.    Implementation Schedule
