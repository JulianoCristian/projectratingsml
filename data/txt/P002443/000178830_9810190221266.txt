INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT A1ID RECO  EgDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPIMNT CR-EDIT TO THiE
SOMALI DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC FOR THE TRANS-JUBA LIVESTOCK PROJECT
IX subnmit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Somali Democratic Republic for the equivalent of
$10 million on standard IDA terms to help finance livestock development
in the Trans-Juba area. The major portion of the credit proceeds would be
relent to the Livestock Development Agency for 20 years, including 5 years
of grace. Interest would be payable at 7¼5 percent per annuim but would be
deferred during the grace period and capi-talized.
PART I - THE ECONOMfY
2.        A report entitled "Recent Economic Developments in Somalia"
(Report No. AE-28a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 28,
1972. Country Da-ta Sheets are attached as Annex I. A Bank economic mission
is planned to visit Somalia by June 1974.
3.        Somalia comprises the mountainous ridge that forms the Horn of
Africa and the coastal plain that lies southeast of the Ethiopian highlands.
The Somali Democratic Republic was born as an independent nation in 1960
-through a merger of the former Italian Trust Territory of Somalia and the
-former British Protectorate of Somalia. In October 1969, the Government of
Somalia was taken over by the military in a bloodless coup. Since then,
the Supreme Revolutionary Council consisting of army and police officers has
bfen the highest decision-makLng body in the counitry.
Recent Economic Performance
4.        Somalia is recognized to be one of the Least Developed
Countries with an estimated per capita income in the order of $70. The
economy is simple and largely undeveloped and there are few natural resources
which can be easily exploited at present. Most of the people depend upon
livestock and subsistence crops for their livelihood. Living conditions
for the largely nomadic population are generally harsh. "r±ich of the country
is arid, water supplies are scattered and often unreliable and periodic
droughts bring great hardship to both people and their livestock. The small
monetary sector of the economy provides only limited opportunities for
employment. Apart from the traditional export of livestock, commercial
agriculture is mainly centered around the production of bananas, principally
by Italian concession holders, and the production of sugar for the domestic
market. Mainufacturing and other sectors of the economy are restricted in
their potential by the small size of the market, poor infrastructure and
the shortage of capital and entrepreneurial ability. Social services are
sti:ll very inadequate; only a small minority of children go to school and
most rural communities are virtually isolated from the rest of the country
by poor roads and communications.



-2-
The first decade since independence was characterized by chronic
financial difficult;ies which were manifested in a complete reliance on
external assistance to balance the country's recurrent bVdget as well as
to finance all deve:lopment expenditures. This assistance was, however, less
effective than it might have been because of the limited administrative
capacity to evaluate, prepare ad implement sound projects.
6.,       The Revolutionary Government which came to power in October 1969
is seriously committed to the goal of economiic development. It places a
premium on self-reliamce, which is evident in its management of public
finance.  Somaliats budgetary position showed considerable improvement
starting in 1970, and in 1971 and 1972 the Government achieved a recurrent
budget surplus. This achievement was due mainly to effective control of
expenditure, improved tax collection and cuts in salaries and wages of
government employees. Expenditures on defense still account for about
one-fourth of total recurrent expenditure, but their rate of increase was
reduced to about 7 percent between 1970 and 1972 compared with the average
annual rate of increase of about 15 percent between 1967 and 1970. Budgetary
support from Italy, which Somalia has been receiving since 1961, continues
but is now used to finance development expenditures.
7-        Somalia's trade balance has been constantly in deficit in recent
years, the average deficit over the period 1968-71 being $17 million annually.
During this period, exports and imports have increased by 31 percent and
25.percent respectively.  Over the last four years livestock, animal products
ard bananas have accounted for over 90 percent of total exports. Since 1968
Somalia's overall balance of payments has been in surplus mainly because of
capital inflow. In 1970-and 1971 the surpluses (excluding allocations of SDRs)
were $5.6 million and $6.5 million.  Somalia's gross foreign reserves amounted
to $'41 million at the end of July 1973, the equivalent of about six monthst
imports.
8.        Since independence Somalia has received substantial amounts of
foreign aid.  From 1965 to 1971 the average annual disbursement of loans
and gr'ants was in the order of $23 million, 70 percent of' which was in grants
to finance development projects as well as deficits in the recurrent budget.
The major donors during this period were Italy, the LUnited States, the European
Economic Community, the United Nations, the Federal Republic of Germany and
the USSR. In the last few years the People's Republic of China. has made
substantial loan commitments. The United States and the Federal Republic of
Germany suspended new commitments to Somalia in 1970. The United States      ,
sluspended aid because ships under the Somali flag had been calling at North
Vietnamese and Cuban ports and the decision of the Bonn Government was due to
Somalia's recognition of the German Democratic Republic.
9.        At the end of 1972 Somaliats total debt amounted to $232 million
equivalent, of which $107 million was disbursed. The USSR accounted for
Ihh pererit of the disbursed debt while the shares of' Saudi Arabia, the Federal
Republic of Germany, United States and IDA were 13 percent, 12 percent,
11 percent and 10 percent respect ively. The debt service ratio in 1972 was
about 4 percent. FIowever, starting in 1973 interest and amortization payments
are scheduled to increase substantially and, in the absence of a corresponding
incrense in exports, the debt service ratio would probably rise above
10 percent during the next three to four years. Somilia experienced some
difficulties in the past in servicing its external debt and sought relief
through a series of rescheduling arrangements with the USSF in 1966, 1968



3
and mnost recently in 1971.  In view of the strained budgetary position of the
Government, the management of the public debt, particularly the terms of new
debts, is of critical importance.  However, new commitments obtained in the
past two years have been generally on concessionary terms, particularly
those from the Peopids Republic of China, the USSR and IDA.
10.       In May 1970, the Government nationalized a number of foreign
(mainly Italian) private enterprises, including an electric power company,
a sugar refinery and commercial banks. The Government has stated that it
will pay compensation and negotiations on the terms of compensation are
under way.
Development Planng
11.       The Government is now about to complete the implementation of the
three-year Development Program, 1971-1973, which has an investment target
of So.Sh. 1000 million ($160 million).  The program gives high priority to
transport, communications and agriculture which claim about 70 percent of
the planned expenditures., The Government, placing a high premium on
self-reliaace, planned to finance 20 percent of the development expenditures
from internaJ sources in contrast to the earlier economic plans (1963-67 and
1971-73) which looked to foreign aid for virtually all the financing.
12.       During the firEV two years of the program, development expendituries
amounted to only 50 percent of the planned levels for each year.  The
shnrtfalll is mainly attributable to uncertainty of external finance as well
as administrative constraints.  During the same perio-1, the share of the
domestic financing (38 percent) was higher than the target (20 percent)
mainly because of the shortfall in investment.
)3.       The Government has beern in the process of formulating-a new
Five-Year Developm-et Plan to start this5 year.  The Bank economic mission
planned for June will review and assist the Government in the formulation
of the new Plan. We are also helping to arrange a UNDP-financed planning
assistance project- tr.strengthen t,he planning machinery of Somalia.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SOMALIA
14.       Starting in 1965, IDA has made six credits totalling.about $35
million, about 90 percent of.which has been. for transportation development,
including construction of two trunk roads (Afgoi-Baidoa in the central region
and Hargeisa-Berbera in the northern region) and a new deep-water port of
Mogadiscio.  The economic future of the country depends on the development
of agriculture and the livestock export trade. Provision of basic trans-
portat.ion infrasTructure is an essential prerequisite fir development and
also helps in the important task of nation-building b, `ying together
Somalia's geographically isolated regions. Another IDA credit in 1971
assisted Somalia in education which is also at a very early stage of development.
No Bank loans or IFC investments have been made in Somalia.
15.      -Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA -credits as of
December 31, 1973 and notes on the execution of on-going projects. Performance
has been generally satisfactory except on the education project which is



about six months behind schedule. However, remedial action is being taken
and we plan to intensify our follow-up of the project by freqaent staff
viSit3.
16.       We are now concentrating our efforts on the country's most
important productive sectors, agriculture and livestock. Agriculture offers
the greatest potential for development but most rural development activities
are only at the beginning stage. Moreover, agricultural development in
Somalia is particularly difficult because most of the people in rural areas
are nomadic.  The first fruit of our efforts is the proposed project. Within
the next two years we hope to present another agricultural project covering
the northern region.,
17.       Despite the efforts of the Government and external assistance
from various donors including IDA, the country's transportation and
communication facilities are still inadequato. Both IDA and the Government
will continue to support transport development in the next few years. The
second highway credit under implementation provides for feasibility studies
and detailed engineering for the improvement of the Hargeisa-Borama road
in the northern region, which would further promote livestock aid agricultural
development in the area. The studies are expected to be completed in the
spring of 1975 and to provide the basis for a further project IDA could support.
18.       As mentioned above, Somalia's education system is inadequate for
the country's needs; for instance, only 8 percent of the relevant age group
are attending elementary school, one of the lowest attendance ratios in
Africa. A UNESOO/IBhD Cooperative Programme identification mission visited
Somalia in January 1973 and, taking into account the mission's findings, we
plaen to consider a second e6ucation project soon.
19.       Becaase Somalia is one of the least developed countries in the
world and lacks exploitable resources it will, despite recent improvement
in economic performance, continue to need a substantial amount of external
aid for development. As much of this aid as possible should be on.concessionary
terms and because of the dearth of domestic resources external financing
should be provided for a large part of domestic costs as well as the foreign
costs of investments. Since Somalia's limited administrative capacity
continues to be an important constraint, intensive technical assistance will
be required.
PART III - THE SECTOR
Agricultural Sector
20.       Because of Somalia's harsh arid or semi-arid climate, 87 percent
of the country is unsuitable for cultivation and about 70 percent of the
population are nomads engaged in livestock production. Of the remaining
13 percent of the area (8 million ha) only about 600,000 ha is now cultivated,
mainly in the higher rainfall areas along the Juba and Shebelli rivers and
in the northwest region. Along the two rivers, about 100,000 ha is under
irrigation; flood irrigation is used to grow subsistence crops such as maize
and sorghum and controlled irrigation, mainly on the Shebelli, to grow such
crops as bananas, sugarcane, fruit and oilseeds.



21.       Besides livestock, bananas are the most important product,
accounting for 26 percent of export earnings in 1971.  The industry is now
recovering from the effects of the closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 and
the withdrawal of the preferential treatment on the Italian market in 1969.
Although Italy still absorbs about 75 percent of the exports, the search
for new markets shouid continue to enhance the industry's viability.
Sugarcane, irrigated with water drawn from the Shebelli river, is the most
important commercial crop for domestic consumption. Maize, millet and
sorghum are the major subsistence crops but their yields are low. Potential
exists for citrus fruits, rice, cotton and groundnuts.   Some efforts to
exploit this potential have been started with external assistance from the
EEC, the USSR and the Peoplels Republic of Korea. Barring a few exceptions,
farming yields little more than subsistence living at present and Somalia
still imports substantial amounts of foodgrains averaginig about $7 million
per year.  However, improved exploitation of livestock, conservation of land
and water and diversification of agriculture, supported by improved farm
inputs ard techniques; could go fw ttowards developing the potential.
Livestoclc Sub-Sector
22.       Livestock is most important in the Somali economy and still has
the greatest imexPloited potential. The total livestock population comprises
about 2½ to 3 million cattle, roughly the same number of camels and about
12 million sheep and goats combined. Major constraints to increased
supply are:
(a)   inadequate nutrition and disease control;
(b)   absence of a fattening schemne;
(c)   inadequate marketing and watering facilities causing
inadequate offtake, and mortality and weight loss during
transoortation-
(d)   over-grazing in certain areas; and
(e)   absence of an organlzed market for young immature animals
for subsequent fattening and sale, resulting in high
slaughtering of young calves and a loss in border trading
of potential feeder cattle to Kenya.
23.       Livestock exports have been rapidly increasing in recent years,
rising in value from $1.7 million in 1967 to $26 million in 1971. Over the
same period their share of total exports increased from 55 percent to 66
percent.  Cattle and meat exports increased from 13 percent to 24 percent
of the total livestoclc exports. Of the total ex-ports of the livestock industry
an overwhelming proportion is live animal exports (camels, cattle, sheep and
goats). In 1971, for example, 1)264)O00 head, fetching 77 percent of total
livestock industry export receipts, were shipped live. Live animals are
mainly exported to Saudi Arabia, Yemen md Gulf States. Demand for Somali
livestock in these countries is expected to remain strong. Trade with Egypt
has a good potential and a considerable number of animals, not appearing in
official statistics, are sold overland to Kenya. The state-owned Kismayu
meat factory, opened in 1969 with assistance from the USSR, is now the main
source of' processed meat for export. The factory mainly supplies canrned
stewed steak to the USSR but has recently started producing chilled and
frozen beef, production of which the Government plans to expand in connection
with this project. Chilled or frozen meat would be sold in Somalia's
traditional markets in the Middle East as well as in certain countries in
Ehrope and Asia.



-6-
24.       In 1966 the Government established the Livestock Development
Agency (LDA) as an autonomous body which initially concen'trated on providing
holding grounds and marketing facilities, but later becmne also responsible
for port veterinary work, issuing health certificates, and livestock trading
including export. The export of live animals will eventually be transferred
to a Livestock Trading Agency. LDA is also responsible for some rtivities
in the improvement of the livestock industry such as the operation of a sheep
breeding farm, a dairy farm and holding grounds. Under this project LDA will
pur-hase cattle of which most will be sold to the Kismayu meat factory and
some exported live, and also manage marketing and fattening facilities.
PART IV - THE PROJECT     '
25.       The project will be the first Bank Group lending to the agricultural
sector. It was prepared by the Government with assistance from the'Bank's
Regional Mission in Eastern Africa. The appraisal mission visited Somalia
in January/February 1973 and negotiations were conducted in Washington in
December 1973. The Somali delegation was headed by Col. Osman Mohamed Jelle,
Secretary of State for Livestock, Forestry and Range and included the General
Manager of LDA.,
26.       A, report entitled "Somalia - Appraisal of the Trans-Juba Livestock
Prv,ject" (No.261a-SO, dated January 10, 197L) is being circulated to the
E..ecutive Directors separately and a Credit'and Project Sunmary is attached
as Annex III to this report.
Project Area
27.       The project area covering about 65,QQo K2 is located iKn  he southwest
corner of the country bounded by the Juba river, Kenya and the India.> Ocean.
The area contains about 1 million cattle- about one-third of the count'v1s
total cattle population.  The Juba river, the perennial river in the area,
assures the necessary water supply, and the area is close to the Kismayu meat
processing plant located at one of country's four major ports (map attached).
28.       The Juba river enters Somalia from Ethiopia but no agreement exists
between the two countries for the use of the water. It is unlikely, however,
that the Ethiopian river basin would be developed in the foreseeable future
since its topography and soils are unsuitable for agricultural development,
and there is as yet limited demand for power. The irrigation component of
the proposed project would require only 4 percent of the natural flow of the
Juba, which, at present has a potential of irrigating about 40,000 ha but
irrigates only 6000 ha. The project would add 1200 ha to this irrigated area.
Project Description
29.       The project will concentrate on improving cattle marketing and
fattening so that the potential of the available herd in the project area
can be more fully utilized. The project consists of the following components:
( ) Marketing and TranEpcrtation
(i)    Construction of five markets to give incentives to
nomads to sell more cattle to LDA;



(ii)   Development of water supplies, staging points arnd
other necessary improvements on 1,000 km of 6xisting
. ,stock routes connecting the markets with holding
grounds;
(iii)  Construction of one 20,000 ha new holding ground with
the capacity of 30,000 head throughput per year to
regulate the shpply to the Kismayu meat factory, and
to select immature cattle for fattening under item (b);
(iv)   Bush clearingl of over 12,000 ha and. de:velopment of
two water poi'nts orn the existing holding ground near
the Kismayu 'mieat factory; and
(v)    Provision of vehicles and equipment for the T DA
marketing teams in the project area.
(b1)  'attening
(i)    Establishment of two 80,000 ha grazing ranches on
natural grassland each providing 10,000 cattle per
year for subsequent intensive fattening in the
feedlot; and
(ii)   Establishment of a 1200 ha pump-irrigated fodder farm
and feedlot supplying about 25,000 cattle per year;
(the feedlot product would be sold to the Kismayu
meat factory for processing as chilled or frozen beef).
(c)   Disease Control
Construction of five veterinary,_enters and five veterinary
dispensaries.
(d-)  Technical Assistance, and the Financing of Operating Costs
(i)    Project staff, including key expatriate staff and training
of local staff;
(ii)   Feasibility studies for future agricultural development;
and
(iii)  Financing of the first three years' operating expenses
for the implementation of the project amounting to
$2 million excluding contingencies. Until the end of
the third development year, LDA revenues will be
insufficient to cover these expenses.
Prodect Cost and Financing Plan
30.       The total project cost is estimated at $l.-15 million including
$o.6 million taxes and duties of which $7.3 million (64 percent) represents
foreign exchange requirements. IDA would finance $10 million, or 87 percent



-8-
of the total project cost and the Government would finance the remaining
8l.5 million, or 13 percent of the total7 cost and about 8 percent of the net
of tax cost. As indicated in paragraph 19 above, because of Somalia's
poverty, lack of development and dearth of resources, it is appropriate
that an unusually high proportion of the cost of projects be financed
externally.
31.       The funds needed for disease control, training of staff other
than LDA staff and feasibility studies will be expended directly by the
Government.  All other IDA and Government funds for the project will be lent
to LDA at 7 1/4 percent per annum for 20 years, including a five-year grace
period. Interest payment will be deferrced during the grace period and cap-
italized to enable LDA to build up adequate cash balances during the initial
years of-the project.
Organization and Management
32.       The project will be executed mainly by LDA under the general
direction of thLie Ministry of Livestock, Forestry and Range.\\ The Veterinary
Department of this Ministry will be responsible for the disease control and the
feasibility studies will be the responsibility of the concerned ministry. LDA
will carry outs its responsibilities through a project development and training
unit. LDA is managed by a General Manager accountable to the Minister (Secretary
of State) concerned. In view of the crucial role of the General Manager of
LDA in project implementation, the Government will consult the Association prior
to making any change in or appointment to this position. The Government will
also ensure proper coordination of the activities of all ministries concerned
with the project.
Benefits
33.       At full development in the sixth year, the project will make available
ror marketing by LDA 52,000 head of cattle annually, of which 18,000 will be
attributable to increased offtake and 34,000 to the expansion of LDA's marketing
role. -About 25,000 head will be exported as chilled or frozen beef, 19,000 as
canned beef and 8,000 as live animals. The exports of chilled and frozen beef
produced from fattened animals will help Somalia to expand and diversify its
beef markets and make exports more profitable.   The disease control program will
also facilitate exports of Somali products to European markets presently
excluded on sanitary grounds.   The 52,000 head of cattle to be produced by the
project will be equivalent to 8,000 tons of carcass weight, of which 3,900 tons
will be incremental weights attributable to the improved marketing and fattening
under the project. The rate of return to the economy is estimated at 25 per-
cent. The net foreign exchange gain is estimated at about $3.8 million annually.
34.       As a combined result of the increased prices and sales volume, nomadst
annual cash income per family is estimated to increase by about 50 percent from
$100 to $150 - a total increase of $1 million to about 20,000 families. Of the
incremental income tc be generated by the project, nomads will receive over
30 percent, LDA 30 percent and the remainder will go to the Kismayu meat factory
and the Government.



35.       The project will not have any appreciable adverse effect on
the area's ecology. Ilowever, precautions will be taken in designing the
irrigation system to minimize the incidence of bilharzia and malaria.   The
project will provide permanent employment for 600-700 persons within LDA
and an additional 200 will be-employecd in project-related construction
over a period of five years.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       Civil works for irrigation, drainage, access roads and equipment
including tractors, trucks and vehicles costing $2.8 million will be sub-
ject to international competitive bidding.   Construction of boreholes,
buildings, water and stock-handling facilities for the new holding ground,
the grazing ranches and the irrigated fodder farm and feedlot, at an
estimated cost of $0.8 million, will be subject to local competitive bidding.
Because of the small size of individual purchases the remaining equipment
items, such as tractor attachments, office equipment and. furniture, amounting
to about $1.8 million, will be procured locally without bidding.   Due to the
absence of, suitable contractors, construction of facilities for most of the
marketing and disease control programs is expected to be carried out by LDA.
37.       Consultants will be employed for the following purposes:
(a)  to advise LDA on the engineering aspects
of the irrigation component;
(b) to fill key project staff posts; and
(c) to carry out feasibility studies for future
projects.
38.       Disbuirsement of the Credit will cover 92 percent of total expen-
ditures except for training of Governmenit staff, feasibility studies and
LDA's operating costs for which the Credit will cover 70 percent of expen-
ditures.  The disbursement is expected to continue until FY 1980.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
39..      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Somali
Democratic Republic and the Association, the draft Project Agreement

B. Projects in Execution
123-30: Highway (Afgoi-Baidoa) - The construction of the Afgoi-Baidoa road
was substantially completed in March 1971. The contractor has
submitted four major claims amounting to US$2.40 million for
arbitration. The UNDP Financed Highway Management Consultants
services have been extended for an additional year from
August 15, 1973.
247-SO: Education - The project mainly provides for the construction,
furnishing and equipping of ono new secondary school, extensions
to ten secondary schools, thti National Teacher Education Center,
one technical school, and one technical and commercial school
and eight mobile units for agricultural training. J,nplementation
is about six inonths behind schedule due primarily to changes in
Project Unit staff, revisions of the project as requested by
the Borrower and late racruitment of technical specialists,
Project implementation has improved since December 1972,
however, and if present momentum continues, the lost time is
likely to be regaiined but the project requires close monitcring.

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.
