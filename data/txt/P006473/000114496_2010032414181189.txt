SCHEDULE 4
Procurement and Consultants' Services
Section I.
Procurement of Goods and Works
 
Part A:
International Competitive Bidding
 
Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and works shall be procured under 
contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those  set forth in 
Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under  IBRD Loans and IDA 
Credits" published by the Bank in May 1985 (the Guidelines).
Part B:
Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
 
In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures described in Part 
A hereof, goods manufactured in Brazil may be granted a margin of preference in 
accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the 
Guidelines and paragraphs 1 through 4 of Appendix 2 thereto; provided, however, that:
(a)
All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly  
indicate any preference which would be granted, the information required to  establish 
the eligibility of a bid for such preference and the following  methods and stages 
that will be followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
(b)
After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the 
following two groups:
(1)
Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if the bidder 
shall have 
established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank 
that such goods 
contain components manufactured in Brazil equal to at 
least 50% of the value 
of the complete goods.
 
(2)
Group B: bids offering any other goods.
 
Page  20
(c)
In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group, all 
evaluated bids in each group shall first be compared among themselves, without taking 
into account customs duties and other import taxes levied in  connection with the 
importation, or the sales and similar taxes levied in connection with the sale or 
delivery of the goods, pursuant to the bids. Such lowest evaluated bids shall then be 
compared with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison, a bid from group A 
is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award.
(d)
If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph (c) above, the lowest 
evaluated bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall be further compared  with 
the lowest evaluated bid from group A after adding: (i) to  the  evaluated bid price 
of goods to be imported in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (A) the 
amount of customs duties and  other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would 
have to pay for the importation of the goods offered in such group B bid; or (B) 15% 
of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods; and (ii) to the ex-factory bid price of goods 
supplied domestically offered in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: 
(A) the amount of customs duties and other import taxes which would be levied on the 
goods offered in such group B if they originated from the same foreign country as the 
bid included in group B which enjoys the lowest customs duties and other import taxes; 
or (B) 15% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods. If, as a result of this 
comparison, the bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if 
not, the lowest evaluated bid from group B, as determined under paragraph (c) above, 
shall be selected for the award.
Part C:
Other Procurement Procedures
 
1.
Works, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the equivalent of  $18,100,000 
and goods estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $300,000 up to an aggregate 
amount not to exceed the equivalent of $2,200,000, may  be procured on the basis of 
competitive bidding, advertised locally, in  accordance with procedures satisfactory 
to the Bank.
2.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, works under Microcatchment 
Subprojects or under Part E of the Project, which are small and scattered throughout 
the Project Area, and to the extent they do not  exceed in the aggregate the 
equivalent of $4,000,000 may be executed under  force account of the Executing Agency 
in question.

equivalent of $250,000 or more, and for goods estimated to cost the  equivalent of 
$150,000 or more, the procedures set forth in paragraphs  2  and 4 of Appendix 1 to 
the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made out of

conformed copies of the contract required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to 
paragraph 2 (d) of the said Appendix shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the 
making of the first payment out of either CESA or the FESA, as appropriate, in respect 
of such contract.

the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall 
apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made  out of either the CESA or the 
FESA, as the case may be, such procedures  shall be modified to ensure that the two 
conformed copies of the contract together with the other information required to be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be furnished to the Bank as 
part of the evidence to be furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this 
Agreement.
(c)
The provisions of the preceding subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall not apply 
to contracts on account of which the Bank has authorized withdrawals from the Loan

For the purposes of this Schedule:
 
(a)
the term "Eligible Categories" means Categories set forth in the table in 
paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement other than Category (9);
(b)
the term "Eligible Expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the  corresponding Eligible 
Categories in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02 of, and Schedule 1 to, 
this Agreement; and
(c)
the term "Authorized Allocation" means an aggregate amount equivalent to 
$2,150,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the CESA and FESA 
($2,000,000 into the CESA and $150,000 into the FESA  respectively) pursuant to 
paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.
Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, payments out of CESA or FESA, as the 
case may be, shall be made exclusively for Eligible Expenditures in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 2.02 of this Agreement and of  this Schedule. The Account 
Bank shall authorize withdrawals from the CESA or FESA, as the case may be, on the 
basis of the evidence that the Bank shall have reasonably determined. For each such 
withdrawal so authorized the Account Bank shall debit or cause to be debited CESA or 
FESA, as the case may be, with the dollar equivalent of the amount of the Eligible 
Expenditures in question in Cruzeiros, in the case of CESA, or with the actual dollar 
amount or the dollar equivalent of the Eligible Expenditures  in currencies other than 
dollars or Cruzeiros, in the case of FESA.
3.
After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the CESA and FESA 
have been duly opened, withdrawals of the corresponding Authorized  Allocation and 
subsequent withdrawals to replenish the CESA or FESA, as the  case may be, shall be 
made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the corresponding amount of the Authorized Allocation, 
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits 
which do not exceed the corresponding amount of the  Authorized Allocation. On the 
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 
from the Loan Account and deposit into the CESA or FESA, as the case may be, such 
amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
(b)
(i)
For replenishment of the CESA or FESA, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank 
requests for deposits into the CESA or FESA at such 
intervals as the Bank 
shall specify.
Page  22
(ii)
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to 
the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of 
this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 
of which replenishment is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the 
Borrower withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into the CESA or FESA, as 
the case may be, such amount as 
the Borrower shall have requested and as shall 
have been shown by 
said documents and other evidence to have been made out 
of 
the 
CESA or FESA, as the case may be, for Eligible Expenditures. All such 
deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the 
respective Eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, 
as 
shall have been justified by said documents and other evidence.

For each payment made by the Borrower out of the CESA or FESA, as the case may

the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that  such payment was made 
exclusively for Eligible Expenditures.
5.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into either the CESA or the FESA:
(a)
if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
(b)
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the aggregate 
of the Eligible Categories for the Project, less the amount of any  outstanding 
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section  5.02 of the General 
Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount 
of the Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the 
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the corresponding Eligible 
Categories of the Project shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by 
notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the 
extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on 
deposit in the CESA or FESA, as the case may be, as of the date  of such notice will 
be utilized in making payments for Eligible Expenditures.
6.
(a)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
either the CESA or FESA: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount  not eligible 
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not  justified by the evidence 
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the CESA 
or FESA, as the case may be, (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an 
amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or  
justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the  Bank into 
the CESA or FESA, as the case may be, shall be made until the Borrower has provided 
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
(b)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in either the CESA or the FESA will not be required to cover further payments for the 
corresponding Eligible Expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the 
Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
(c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the CESA or the FESA.
