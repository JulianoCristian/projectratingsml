project aims at supporting\n            innovative technical approaches for economically viable\n            investment in soil conservation. It's objectives are to\n            increase agricultural production and farm incomes by\n            promoting the adoption of sustainable forms of land\n            management and soil and water conservation by Santa\n            Caterina's farmers. This would improve farm\n            profitability through cost effective and sustainable\n            productivity gains, and better land use, as well as halting\n            soil loss, the silting of river beds and dams, floods, the\n            destruction of rural roads, pollution of water sources and\n            depletion of natural resources. The project would support\n            adaptive agricultural research, land use mapping, planning\n            and monitoring, rural extension, an incentive program for\n            land management, soil conservation and pollution control\n            carried out by farmers and farmers groups, erosion control\n            works along rural roads, forestry development and natural\n            resource protection, project adminsitration, monitoring and\n            evaluation, and training."}, "docdt": "1989-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
