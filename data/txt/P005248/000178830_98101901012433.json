An\n            International Development Association (IDA) Credit for\n            US$6.0 million was extended to Jordan in March 1975 to: (i)\n            expand and reinforce vocational and technical education\n            including training of adults to produce the specialized\n            skills needed for the development of priority sectors of the\n            economy; (ii) improve the relevance and quality in both the\n            lower and upper secondary cycles by replacing uneconomically\n            small, rented school buildings and providing schools with\n            adequate workshop and other teaching facilities; and (iii)\n            support integrated rural development projects in the Jordan\n            Valley through provision of a pilot scheme of non-formal\n            basic education.
