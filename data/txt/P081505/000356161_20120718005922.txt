                                       P081505
                                 LOAN NUMBER 7634JO

                                   Restructuring Paper



1.    The closing date for Jordan, Al\IJA1AN DEVELOPMENT CORRIDOR PROJECT,
Loan No 7634JO, P081505 will be extended from December 31, 2011 until December
31,2012 (one year).

2.      The implementation of the project is progressing well and the proposed change,
namely an extension of the closing date would allow finalizing all activities under the
project and consequently increase the chances of meeting the development objectives.
The Bank and the Borrower have agreed in writing to a specific action plan and a
schedule to complete the project within the extension. In this regard, the implementation
schedule has been revised to reflect the completion of all contracts of the project hence
the disbursement of the Loan proceeds for the remaining period up to the new closing
date of December 31,2012.

3.      The proposed extension does not result in a change to'the Project activities nor .
require a modification to the Project description in the Loan Agreement.

4.     The proposed extension is necessary to ensure the implementation of the
remaining activities, based on the current status of the Project as highlighted below:
       The construction of Sections 2 and 3 of the Ring Road (RR) is scheduled for
       completion by the Fourth Quarter of2011;

       The construction of Section 1 is scheduled for completion by the Third Quarter of
       2012;

       The services of the Project Management Team (PMT) will be required to the end
       of 20 12 to cover all construction and managerial activities, including those related
       to Section 1 and the preparation of the Final Completion Report that shall
       encompass all components of the Proj ect;

       The study ofthe light rail is ongoing and scheduled for completion by mid 2012.



                                             3
5.      An earlier extension of the closing date (of 30 months, from the original closing
date of June 30, 2009 to December 31, 2011) was processed in the context of an
Additional Financing, in January 2009.

6.    This restructuring proposes a new (and second) extension which brings the
cumulative extension of the project to 42 months.
