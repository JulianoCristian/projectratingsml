                         Extension of the Loan Closing Date: The opening of the entire Phase 1 of the Amman Ring Road (ARR-1) by mid 2013 is due to the late start of the construction of its first section
                         (funded by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development). To maintain the project management arrangements in place until substantial or full completion of the road, the
                         Government submitted a formal request to the Bank to extend the Loan closing date from December 31, 2011 to December 30, 2012. This request was approved and the closing
