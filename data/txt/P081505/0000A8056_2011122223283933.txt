                         Extension of the Loan Closing Date: The opening of the entire Phase 1 of the Amman Ring Road (ARR-1) by mid 2012 is due to the late start of the construction of its first section
                         (funded by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development). To maintain the project management arrangements in place until full completion of the road, the Government
