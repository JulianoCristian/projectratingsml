                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The works for Amman Ring Road have been completed for the sections 2 and 3, and they are back on track for Section 1. This progress allowed opening part of the road to traffic in
                         early February 2012. However, the whole facility will open to traffic by end of 2013 after completing section 1. This will delay the achievement of the first part of the Project
                         Development Objective.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
