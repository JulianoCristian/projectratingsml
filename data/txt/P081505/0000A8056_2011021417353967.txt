                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project will support more efficient transport and logistics services by removing key infrastructure transport bottlenecks, and by providing access to
                         affordable land for productive investment and urban development purposes.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Customs Depot: The launch of the construction of the Customs Depot and associated logistics platform seems compromised by the delayed expropriations to clear the selected new
                         site in the Sahab area. With the time left to the Loan closing date, it is unlikely that the new customs depot could be constructed prior to the project completion date, the Ministry of
                         Public Works and Housing would consult with the Customs Administration and the Ministry of Transport for the preparation of a report on (i) the impacts of rescheduling the relocation
                         of the Customs Depot on the traffic of trucks traffic on the Amman Ring Road (Phase I); and (ii) any needs for road works to improve the access to the existing Customs Depot
                         pending its relocation after the securing of the required Land in the Sahab area.
                         Transport planning in the Amman Metropolitan Area and Development of an Integrated Public Transport System. The feasibility and detailed design study, financed by the ADCP
                         Loan, for priority rail-based rapid transit lines was launched. Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) will continue to regularly report on the progress of this study as well as on the
                         construction plans for the retained priority BRT lines.
