1.      INTRODUCTION

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval o fthe Executive Directors to provide an additional
financing inthe amount o fUS$33 million to the Hashemite Kingdom o f Jordan for the Amman
Development Corridor Project (ADCP, PO81505, Loan 7228-50). The additional financing
would help finance the costs associatedwithunanticipated cost overruns due to increases inthe
costs o fkey inputs (specifically, oil-based and energy intensive inputs, including fuel, asphalt
and cement) that occurred between appraisal and contract signing, and due to technical
modifications identifiedafter the start o f constructionto improve overall access and safety o f
section 2 (the World Bank-financed section o fthe Amman ringroad). There are no significant
changes to the original design o fthe road. The modifications to be carried out are not expected
to significantly extendthe completion date for section 2.

2.      Theproject scope hasnot changed significantly andthe additional financing will thus
allow the original development objectives o fthe relevant components to be achieved. The
additional financing i s assessed as being an appropriate means o f addressing the cost overruns
andtechnical modifications that have emerged inimplementation. No changesto the objectives
or general designand implementationmodalities o fthe project are proposed.

3.      Other donors, including the Arab Fundfor Economic and Social Development (AFESD)
and the European Investment Bank (EIB), have pledgedto provide the additional parallel
financing requiredto cover the cost overruns on their respective sections (section 1 and section 3,
respectively) o fphase 1o fthe Amman ringroad.

2.      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING

Country context

4.      The Hashemite Kingdom o fJordan, with 5.5 million inhabitants, is notably resource-
poor, with limitedagricultural land, no oil resources, and considerably scarce water. The
population i s urbanized at around 80 percent, and is one o f the youngest among lower-middle
income countries, with 38 percent underthe age o f 14. Although demographic growth, currently
at around 2.6 percent per year, is slowing, total population i s expected to reach almost 7 million
by 2015.

5.      Notwithstanding the difficult regionalpolitical environment and the lack o fresources,
Jordan has achieved above-average development outcomes compared to other lower middle-
income countries. This favorable situation can be credited to sound development policies, recent
capital inflows and to one o fthe world's highest levels o funilateral transfers, inthe form o f
workers' remittances and public grants, together amounting to between 20 and 25 percent o f
GDP.

6.      However, Jordan has not caught up with the levels o fper-capita income it had attained in
the 1980sboom, punctured bythe financial crisis o f 1989. The subsequentstructural adjustment
period o fthe 1990s, while restoring some positive economic growth, saw per capita incomes
eroded by strong populationgrowth. Poverty andjoblessness are the most important problems to
be solved.


                                                  1

Sector context

7.      As the country's capital and major commercialandindustrial center, the Amman
Metropolitan Area, which includes the cities o f Amman, Zarqa, Ruseifa and surrounding areas,
accounts for more than 50 percent o f Jordan's population, contains about 80 percent o f the
country's industrial sector, and provides employment for around 55 percent o f the nation's
inhabitants. Since the 1 9 8 0 the
                                ~ ~ population o fthe metropolitan area has increased, on average,
by 3.3 percent per year, andnow stands at about 3.0 million. By2020, the metropolitanarea is
forecast to have 4.5 million inhabitants. Over the next twenty years, the labor force inthe
metropolitan area will more thandouble to 1.2 million (equivalent to the national workforce in
2001).

8.      Inrecent years, the AmmanMetropolitan Areahasexpandedto the extent where areas
designated for development inthe 1980shave become saturated and are no longer sufficient to
accommodate continued growth. As a result, congestion i s becoming an issue. Urbanmaster
plans, including designation o f new areasfor commercial, industrial andresidential
development, have not keptpace with economic growth, increasing levels o furbanization, and
steadily rising motorizationrates.

9.      For the AmmanMetropolitan Area to beginaddressing the pressing issues associated
withits rapidly expanding municipalities, itmustdevelop keymissinglinks inits highway
system, and designate landto accommodate on-going andfuture growth. For Jordan to buildon
its geographical advantage as a regional trade andtransport hub, benefit from higher transit
revenue and generate employment opportunities, it mustreduce freight transport costs and
increase existing trade flows. Achieving these objectives necessitatesmodernizingthe country's
transport infrastructure, particularly inthe Amman MetropolitanArea, by improving the
connectivity o f i t s main highways, andupgradingtransport facilities and services to be more
efficient and competitive.

Project description

11.     The project i s one o fthe government's highest priorities. Itwas approved by the Board
on June 3,2004 and became effective on December 6,2004. The project's estimated cost was
US$161.0 million, o fwhich the Bank would finance around US$38.0 million. The project's
financing planinaddition to World Bank finance included parallel financing from: (a) the
AFESD (US$39.4 million), (b) European InvestmentBank (US$32 millionloan and US$500,000
grant), and (c) government (US$51.1 million).

12.     The project's objective i s to support more efficient transport and logistics services. It
will achieve this objective by removing key infrastructure transport bottlenecks, and by
providing access to affordable landfor productive investmentand urbandevelopment purposes.
The project comprises three components. These are (a) construction o f Amman ring road phase
1(40 kilometers), dividedinto three sections; (b) developingaccessinfrastructure andutility
services for inlandport facilities, relocatingthe Ammancustoms depot, and supportingthe
government's ongoing program to restructure the trucking industry; and (c) providing technical
support for urbanandtransport planning, traffic engineering, and project management. The
project's original objectives, design, and scope have not changed.

Performance of the project

12.     The project has been consistently rated as satisfactory for both the project development
objective and implementation progress. There are no outstanding or unresolved fiduciary,
environmental, social or any other safeguard problems. The government i s committedto the
project, and has complied with the covenants specified inthe LoanAgreement. The Project
accounts were audited for the fiscal years endingDecember 31,2006, and December 31,2007.
Unqualified reports were issued for both years.

13.     As partofproject preparation, the government prepared an extensive landacquisitionand
resettlement actionplanthat i s inline with best practice inthe region for resettling persons
affected by major infrastructure projects. The process for determining compensation mirrored
the Bank's safeguard policies and followed the guidelines set out inthe landacquisition and
resettlement plan, which provided more compensation thanwhat would normally be permitted
under Jordanian law. This requiredsubstantial financial resources fromthe government (about
US$41 million), which i s a strong indication o fthe authorities' ownership and commitment to
the project.

14.     The environmental risks and associatedmitigation measuresthat were identified inthe
Project Appraisal Document anddocumented inthe project's environmental management plan
have been regularly reviewed for compliance with O.P. 4.01 on environmental assessment. The
supervisingengineer has full-time environmental specialists on-site, andthey regularlymeet with
the contractors andreport backto the project managementteam. Throughout implementation,
theprojectmanagement team hascoordinated successfully withkey stakeholders andheld
several consultation meetings on environmental matters, including withthe Ministryo f
Environment, the Department o f Antiquities (Ministryo f Tourism and Antiquities), the Ministry
o f Municipalities and Villages, and several municipalities affected by the project. A series o f
training seminars for stakeholders were carried out, which consisted o f lectures, site visits and
practicalhands-on training on usingmonitoring tools and equipment. An environmental quality
monitoring programhas been developed, and baseline surveys have beencarried out at 23 sites,
including construction and residential locations. Conditions at the sites have beenmonitored
regularlysince the baselines were established.

15.     The midtermreviewo fthe project, completed inMarch 2007, affirmed that despite early
delays, the Project i s likely to achieve its objectives. There were some initial delays in
implementingsome activities (including a one-year delay ininitiating work on section 1 ofphase
1 o fthe Amman ringroad (government and AFESD financing). The contract for works for this
section has been awarded andthe contractor startedwork inMarch2008. Work i s expected to be
complete by July 2010. Although work on section 2 (World Bank financing) and section 3
(European InvestmentBank financing) startedwith delays, the activities are now progressing
satisfactorily and actions are beingtaken to finishwork withinthe contractual completion date o f
September 2009. The government has decided not to finance activities insupport o fthe trucking
industryunderthe project, preferring insteadto use grantresources provided by the European
Union. The government andthe Bank agreed on precise measures at the midterm review to




                                                     3

speed up implementation andto ensure that the project meets its objectives. As o f July 2008,
US$25.11 million (66 percent) o f loanproceeds had been disbursed.

Proposedadditionalfinancing

16.      The proposed additional financing i s intendedto address unanticipated increases inthe
costs o f key inputs and additional work requireddue to technical modifications to designs during
construction. The overall cost o fthe project will approach US$344 million, or some US$183
millionmore thanwhat was estimated at appraisal. The total amount o f additional World Bank
financing that will be requiredhas been estimated at about US$33 million. Ittakes into account
(a) the difference between the engineers' estimates andthe initial contract value for construction
o f section 2 (World Bank financing) o fthe ringroad; (b) revisedcosts for access andutility
infrastructure for the customs depot; (c) extra quantities for underpasses, asphalting o f shoulders,
and protection o f gas pipeline; (d) variations orders for highway lighting, ducting for
telecommunications; and quality enhancement; (e) price escalation from October 2005 including
impact o fthe February7,2008 increases; (0cost o f extension o fproject management by two
years due to late start o fthe section 1 o fthe ringroad; and (g) higher cost for preparation o f
priority integrated public transport system at the request o f Greater Amman Municipality. The
proposed Additional Financing i s assessedas beingan appropriate means o f addressing the cost
overruns that have emerged inimplementation.

17.      Because o fthe fiscal constraints the country currently faces, the government has ruled out
the possibility o fproviding financing to cover the additional costs. Although Jordan i s capable
o f issuingbonds on the international capital markets, this would be more costly than borrowing
from the Bank.

3.       PROPOSEDCHANGES

18.      Underthis Additional Financing, there will be no changesto the project development
objectives andthe project activities carried forward from the Original Project. And the
implementationarrangements remainthe same. The Additional Financing i s expected to address
a cost overrun for the completion o f existing Project activities pertaining to: (a) the rehabilitation
o fthree underpasses, (b) the erection o fprotective structures to protect gas pipelines, and (c) the
carrying out o f full surfacing o f shoulders.

19.      Several Safeguard Policies were triggeredunder the original project. These include OP
4.01 (environmental assessment), OP 4.11 (cultural property), and OP 4.12 (involuntary
resettlement). These Safeguard Policies continue to apply to the additional financing project.

20.      The additional financing planis summarized below intable 1. The detailed financing
planis presented inannex 2.

21.      The closingdate of the project will be extended untilDecember 31,2011. This will
provide adequate time to complete the works (especially section 1) and to thoroughly preparea
future Ammanpublic urbantransport program, which the government, the Bank, other donors,
andthe private sector may support technically and financially.

22.      The current project management team will continue to execute the project. This team has
gained considerable experience inmanagingthe project and has been able to overcome
numerous challenges posed by this complex operation, which include a major urbanplanning
initiative, full evaluation and design of phases 2 and 3 of the ringroad, relocation ofthe main
customs depot, and support to the trucking industry.

23.     Procurement arrangements will not be affected. All procurement has been
completed, except for consultancies to prepare the priority phase of the public urban
transport program (specifically, preparation of terms of reference and requests for
proposals, the feasibility study, the environmental impact assessment, and detailed design
and tender documents). Procurement will be carried out according to Consultant and
Procurement Guidelines published by the Bank in May 2004 and revised in October
2006.

24.     The project will continue to use the financial management arrangements that are
already in place. The financial management risk assessment originally made in 2004 was
updated in the light of the overall financial management performance during the past
years. The updated assessment report is contained in the project files.

25.     Thefinancial management riskfor theproject is low. At the country level,
according to recent analysis, the financial management risk in the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan is moderate. At the entity and project level, the risk is low due to the acceptable
performance of the project management team including the project financial officer that
had their contract extended for the project life, and the experience of the Ministry of
Public Works and Housing (MoPWH) with management of Bank-financed projects. The
ring-fenced implementation arrangements have been successful and the project will need
to maintain this arrangement throughout the project life to avoid disruption. The MOPIC
budget will include the allocation for the additional financing and counterpart fund
related to the project. However, the project management team will continue preparing
the detailed project's budget, entering it in the project accounting software, and using it
for monitoring purposes. The project had purchased and been using ring-fence
accounting software for that purposes. The project will continue to follow the
government applied controls as stipulated in the local laws, with the needed enhancement
to separately and timely follow up and report on the project's activities. The accounting
arrangements will continue to reflect the project financial transactions separately and
generate the quarterly financial monitoring reports. The project had already its
documented financial management policies and procedures. The project will continue to
have its project financial statements annually audited by an independent private audit
firm acceptable to the Bank. Audit reports are disclosing an "unqualified" audit opinion.

4.      CONSISTENCY WITH THE COUNTRYASSISTANCE STRATEGY

26.     The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Jordan, discussed by the
Board on May 4,2006, is based on four pillars. These are (1) productive job creation
through strengthening the investment environment and human resources, for a skill-
intensive and knowledge-based economy; (2) local development through increased access
to services and economic opportunities; (3) social protection and expanding inclusion;
and (4) public expenditures' restructuring and public sector reform. All are directly
aligned with the poverty reduction and job creation objectives of the government.

27.     The Amman Development Corridor Project is a central element of the CAS,
supporting pillar 1,which is also the government's highest priority. It contributes to this
pillar by helping to reduce the costs of transport and creating infrastructure for trade.
These include the Amman ring road, key missing inks in the highway system, the
customs depot and the inland port. Investments in transport infrastructure will improve
Jordan's competitiveness as a regional trade

network. This will encourage investmentfor growth andjob creation, while improving
resident's access to services. The project i s thus fully consistent with the World Bank's CAS for
Jordan.

5.      ECONOMICANALYSIS OF COST OVERRUN OR FINANCING GAP

28.     An economic analysis ofthe project onthebasis o fthe newcost projectionsindicates that
the project has a net present value o f US$81.3 million (JD57.46 million) and an economic rate of
returno f 15.9 percent. This assumes a discount rate o f 12percent, the same as the rate used in
the 2004 economic analysis ofthe project. Benefits were calculatedby aggregating benefits
associatedwith five different flow groups, representingtraffic flows at different times of the day.
The values are basedon only base traffic and divertedtraffic. They do not include benefits
associatedwith inducedtravel, because calculations that can be made o f induceddemand would
be subject to considerable error givenuncertainties with respect to future land use and other
factors. This compares with the project's original appraisal estimate (base case) o f net present
value of US$121.7 million (JD86.3 million) and an economic rate o freturno f 17.5.

29.     Sensitivitytests were carried out to account for the potential for: (a) future changes in
costs o f civil works and (b) effects of inducedtravel on time and operating costs for base and
divertedtraffic. These show that should project costs rise by 30 percent over current projections,
the net present value o f the project falls to US$17.36 and the economic rate o f return declines to
13.42 percent. Increasing traffic on critical links by 2 percent reduces the economic rate o f
return to 15.89 percent and increasing traffic by 50 percent reduces the economic rate o f return
only slightly more to 15.87 percent. The detailed economic analysis is presented inannex 2.

6.      EXPECTED OUTCOMES

30.     The additional financing will permitthe project to realize its development objectives.
Most o fthe key performance indictors presented inthe original project appraisal document
remain valid. However, some have been revised for clarity. The revisedresults framework and
monitoring arrangements is presented inannex 1.

31.     Keyperformance indicators include:


0       Traveltimes along the roads improvedunderthe project falls (average time to travel
        between the Queen Alia InternationalAirport and Zarqa falls from 60 minutesin2004 to
        40 minutesin2010).


0       Quantity of cargo trafficthrougha new customs facility (exportsand imports)rises
        (cargo traffic rises from 0 tons in2004 to 1.6 million tons imports in2011).



                                                   7

7.      BENEFITS AND RISKS

32.     BeneJits. The project will generate significant benefits for the people o fAmman and for
the economy o f Jordan. These include reducing travel times and costs for travelers along the
Ammanmetropolitanarea's mainnorth-south axis by providing amuchneededalternative route
for transit traffic to the airport road, which is becoming increasingly congested. Completion o f
the road will also open access to landfor urbanand economic development, which is much
neededfor investment,job creation, and economic growth. A new customs depot and inlandport
will helpmake Jordan an attractive regionaltransportation hub, bringingjobs andgrowth.

33.     Risks. The additional financing i s not expected to generate any risks not already
specified inthe 2004 project appraisal document. The risks have so far been adequately
addressed. Inparticular, the riskthat construction could be delayed because the process o f
acquiring landtakes longer than expected has been mitigatedwith the passage o f a new
expropriationlaw aimed at ensuringexpedientandtransparentexpropriation o f landfor public
purposes. Risks associatedwith involuntary resettlement have beenmitigated through the
implementationo f a landacquisition and resettlement action planthat fully compensates land
owners for expropriated land. Risks o f environmentaldamage have beenminimized through
application o f a comprehensive environmental management plan. Risks that project funds are
not usedas intended have beenreduced through appointment o f competent staff inthe project
management team and careful supervision o fprocurement and financial management by Bank
staff.

8.      FINANCIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE ADDITIONAL
FINANCING

34.     Financial terms for this additional IBRDfinancing would be a 20-year maturity,
including a five-year grace period. Payments would occur bi-annually on March 1 and
September 1,commencing on March 1,2014 and ending September 1,2028.

                             Annex 3: UpdatedEconomicEvaluation


Introduction

The Greater Amman Municipality and the Ministry o f Public Works and Housing have
commissioned and developed a numbero f traffic studies, for Amman, since the late 90s. These
studies have relied on a comprehensive transport study that was developed in 1999 for Greater
Amman. The major studies that havebeencarried out are:


0   The 2003-04 Ammandevelopmentcorridor study
0   2006-2007 AmmanUrbanDevelopmentTransport Study
0   2006-2007 Feasibility Study for Amman Ring Road-Phase 2 and 3 (carried out by Lotti
    Consultants).

The2003-2004 Amman DevelopmentCorridor study

The Amman developmentcorridor (Sections 1 and2) will replace and/or alleviate the existing
linkbetweenthe southandthenortheast ofAmman. This existingroute (Airport Roadto Zarqa
via Hizamroad) follows anurbanareathat i s becoming heavily congested as it handles
substantial volumes o f freight traffic.

The 2003-2004 Amman development corridor study included an economic evaluation and the
results o f the evaluation were as follows:


0   Economic rate of return (ERR)= 17.5 percent
0   Economic net present value = 86.3 JD million.

Updateof EconomicEvaluation

Following a review o f construction costs, the economic evaluation o fthe 2003-2004 Amman development
corridor study was also updatedin2005 and again inFebruary2007. The results of the economic
evaluation were:


0       2005 update:ERR = 14.68 percent, net present value = 56.96 JD million
0       2007 update: ERR= 18.71 percent, net present value = 123.32 JD million

Objectiveof this PresentReport

Thisreport is centered on two main components. The first component is the needto further
update the economic evaluation o fthe 2003-2004 Amman development corridor study because
estimates o f construction costs (part o f Component A) have increased. The economic evaluation
considers the increased construction costs against the benefits, after implementationo fthe
project, for two types o ftraffic: normal anddivertedtraffic. These two types o f traffic are




                                                13

definedas.    1



0    Normal traffic: traffic that continues to use the existing facility. Inthis case, this refers to
     traffic that continues to use the rest o fthe network, apart from traffic usingthe RingRoad.
     Traffic on the existing network will benefit from less congestion, as some traffic diverts to
     the RingRoad, andhence faster travel speeds.
0    Divertedtraffic: traffic shiftingfrom the existing network to use all or part o fthe RingRoad,
     which will benefit from much faster speeds away from the congested central network.

The second component i s the determination o fthe impact that inducedtraffic will have on
divertedtraffic. The proposed RingRoadwill reduce transportation costs for existingusers and
may also attract new users as inducedtraffic. The presence o fthis possible inducedtraffic, by
increasing the volume on the RingRoadbut with no corresponding increase inroad capacity,
will have a negative effect onthe speedo fdivertedtraffic that will usethe RingRoad. This then
has implications for the updated economic evaluation. Inducedtraffic i s defined as the following:


0    Inducedtraffic: the additional traffic `that has been induced by the project through mode
     changes, destination changes, trip re-timing, trip frequency changes or new trips associated
     with different landuses.*

Methodology

This section sets out the basic approach for calculatingthe economic benefits for normal and
divertedtraffic, inorder to update the economic evaluation o fthe Amman development corridor.
Giventhat induced traffic may decreaseaverage speeds for other traffic on the ringroad, an
approach i s also set out for taking this into account through the use o f sensitivities.

Base economic evaluation

An economic evaluation compares the costs to society o f aproposed project (the with project
case) andthe alternative costs to a society ifthis proposed project is not implemented(the
without project case). The comparison between the two cases leads to the estimation o fthe
project benefits to society as a whole. The benefits, for both normal and diverted traffic, will be
time savings and lower vehicle operating costs.

Based on past studies, the following are the main parameters to be used in the economic
evaluation:

     Investmentcostswill be adaptedto economic costs usinga standard conversion factor. The
     2004 update study used an standard conversion factor of 0.93 (based on value o f imports less
     taxes) and this has been adopted for this exercise.

0    The 2004 update study used a discount rate o f 12percent andthis rate will be adopted for this
     exercise.
0    The project evaluation period i s 25 years, startinginthe year 2004, when the first
     expenditure took place, and finishinginthe year 2028.
0    All costsusedinthe economic analysis are inJordanian dinars (in2007 constant prices).
0    Residual values are estimated for the investment, based on a life o f 40 years.

The economic evaluation identifies cost andbenefitsineachyear o fthe evaluationperiod,
calculates the net benefits to estimate the economic rate o freturn, and using discounting
techniques, the economic net present value. The previous evaluations o fthe Amman
development corridor have all usedthis approach.

Treatment of induced traffic

The implementationo fthe RingRoadis expected to result inthe attraction o f inducedtraffic.

The estimation o fthe volume o f inducedtraffic is not possible usingFixedTrip Matrix modeling, the
modeling approach used for this study, and must be calculated manually and extraneously.

Traditionally, economic benefits for this type o ftraffic are calculated usingthe Rule o fthe Half,
whereby inducedgeneratedtraffic benefits are equal to the averagejourney cost saving volume    *
o f induced traffic *  50 percent. The resultingbenefits are then added to the benefits for normal
and diverted traffic. This will result inan improved ERR. These economic benefits are not
included inthis economic analysis.

One disadvantage o fthis approach is, however, that it does not take into account the reduction in
travel speeds for diverted traffic usingthe RingRoadthat would result from the presence o fthe
induced traffic. It i s likely that this additional traffic would result inlesser speeds and, hence,
less cost savings per user. Therefore, the likely benefits for diverted traffic would be smaller. In
order to calculate the impact o f individual traffic on the divertedbenefits and the ERR o fthe
project the following steps have beenundertaken:

1. Rerun model to calculate vehicle hours, vehicle kilometers and speed on Ring Road
     with increasedvolumes

The volumes that use the Ring Road, as part o fthe Do-Something network, were increasedby 2
percent, 5 percent, 10percent and 50 percent to reflect all possibilities o fthe additional induced
traffic. This was undertaken usingselect link analysis. This gives vehicle hours, vehicle
kilometers and speeds on the RingRoadthat reflects this higher traffic.

1.       Apply average speeds on ringroadto do-something, basecase results

The vehicle hours for only the divertedtraffic volumes on the RingRoad, were amended to
reflect the lower average speeds causedby the presence o fthe induced traffic. The vehicle




                                                      15

kilometers, o fthe divertedtraffic on the Ring Road, will not alter. The inducedtraffic flows were
not usedinthe analysis.

2.     Reruneconomic analysis for each sensitivity

For each traffic increase, the Do-Something case, with the amended vehicle hours and speeds for
the divertedtraffic onthe ringroad, was comparedwiththe Do-Minimumcase. The ERRandthe
net present value was thenrecalculated.



Updated Economic Evaluation

Giventhe update of construction costs andvehicle operating costs andusingtraffic volumes
taken from the existing traffic model, a preliminary economic evaluation has beenundertaken.
The base evaluationassessesthe benefits for normal and divertedtraffic only and does not take
into account the impact o finduced traffic, as discussed inthe previous chapter. Sensitivity tests
for construction costs and the impact o f inducedtraffic (see also section 2.2) have also been
carried out.

Recent construction cost estimates

The mostrecent estimates ofthe construction and supervision element o fthe project (Component
A), implementedover the period2006-2010, are $8m (2006), $38m (2007), $55m (2008), $50m
(2009), US$16.9 million (2010). The total investmentcosts o f Component A are, therefore,
$167.90m (JD117.53m).

A summary o fthe updatedproject costs is shown inthe following table:

Background to Traffic Modeling

The 2003-2004 AmmanDevelopmentCorridor study was basedonthe 1999 Greater Amman
UrbanTransport Study (GAUTS)model. The GAUTS was developedto assess and identify
junction problem areas caused by traffic congestion withinthe Greater Ammanurbanarea andto
develop solutions for the short to medium term horizonsbaseduponeconomic rates o freturn and
traffic operational characteristics.

The GAUTS was basedon 262 zoning o fwhich 151were withinthe Greater Amman andthe
rest were external zones. The 1999 model was built usingRoad Side Interview Surveys (RSI) at
40 locations covering screen lines andcordon crossing for 13 hours duration. As well as RSI
survey manualclassified counts and 24 automatic surveys were also undertaken. The GAUTS
highway networks were built by incorporating a buffer network (representing all the major links
outside the boundary of Amman central area and a simulation network that covers alljunctions
apart from the Sweilehjunction. All majorhtrategic junctions withinthe simulation areatotaling
216 hadbeen coded. The modeling o f GAUTSwas carried out usingSATURN suite o f
programmers.

For the 2003-2004 Amman developmentcorridor Study, the Consultant built a base year model
usingSATURNsoftware, from the 1999-GAUTS usinginformation from a limitednumber o f
traffic counts and by employing matrix estimationtechniques producedthe base year 2003-2004.
The forecasts traffic from the baseyear 2003 took into account the general growth o ftraffic in
Greater Amman and the proposed landuse expansion program to the east o f Amman, between
Hizam Roadand the proposed Amman development corridor and the proposed Amman
developmentcorridor development for opening year (2008) over evaluation period o f20 years.
Due to uncertainties on the magnitude o fthe proposed development, an estimate o fthe Amman
development corridor and HizamRoaddevelopment were made.

Traffic volume estimates

Basedonthe traffic model developed for the 2003-2004 Ammandevelopment corridor study,
traffic volumes were calculated for both the Do Minimum(DM) without project case andthe D o
Something (DS) withproject case.

Interms ofcommercial, industrial andresidential development inthe area, the following has
been assumed:
    No Amman development corridor development with the exception o fthe InlandPort for both
    cases, DMand DS
    Highly likely committed development along HizamRoad, includedfor both cases.

Sensitivity Tests -Impact of Induced Traffic

Following the select link analysis, traffic on the RingRoadwas increasedby 2 percent, 5
percent, 10percent and 50 percent. This resulted inlower speeds and increased vehicle hours.
The model output, following the volume increases, is showninannex B, for flow groups 1and2,
the critical peakhours.

As can be seenfrom the table, traffic conditions inthe peak hours on the RingRoad are not
significantly affected by the presence o f the inducedtraffic. This i s particularly the case for the
years 2008 and 2018. There are some decreasesinspeed in2028, although this is not true for all
sections and directional flows.

As anexample ofthe impact ofinducedtraffic on divertedtraffic, the following was estimated
for Section 1 (1lkm) for the northboundflow, for the year 2028 and for Flow Group 2.



Northbound flow on Ring Road (with 0% induced = 1135 vehicles
traffic)
Northboundvehicle kilometers                        =1135 * 11=12485
Vehicle meed (0% induced traffic)                   =86.3 knh



Vehicle hours (50% inducedtraffic)                  = 12485179.0= 158.03797

Increase inannual hours due to presence o f induced = 13.368* 2808 =   37537.34
traffic (see Table 3.2 for annual hours per Flow




                                                   20

 The additionalannual hours of approximately 37,500, showninthe above table, can be roughly
 translated into monetary values for time. Givenan average time value per vehicle (driver +
 passenger) of 3.26 J D h , this would result ina decrease intime benefits o f approximately 0.12
 JD million, for the year 2028. However, after discountingthis value becomes 0.086 JD million,
 whichis extremely low and indicates that benefits will be largely unaffected bythe induced
 traffic. Vehicle operating costs will be less affected.

 On the basis o f the calculations carried out, the impact o f the induced traffic on the Ring Road
 traffic can be estimated. The resultingERRSare shown inthe table below.

 Conclusions

 Fromthe results o fthe economic evaluation, it i s clear that the viability o fthe Amman
 development corridor project i s still positive, 16.72 percent, eventhough estimates of the civils
 investmentcosts have increased considerably since the original study. As a comparison, the
 original ERRwas 17.5 percent.

 The sensitivitytests indicatethat, even ifthe estimates ofcivils constructioncosts were
 considerably higher (i.e. up to 110 percent), the project would still be economically viable.

 The sensitivitytests regardinginducedtraffic indicate that the presence o fthis additional traffic
 has virtually no impact on the performance of divertedtraffic usingthe RingRoad, and a
 consequent insignificant impact on the ERRo fthe proposed project.

 This economic evaluation uses the long-termprice o ffuel as the basis for the economic cost o f
 petrol and diesel. The long-term forecast from the U S EnvironmentalIntelligence Agency
 indicated a cost of US$55 per barrel.Therefore, the fuel costs do not needto be increased
 annuallyinthe economic evaluation. Usingthis price o ffuel o f$55 per barrel, the economic cost
 o f fuel was estimated to be as follows:


 0    Premiumpetrol per liter = 0.30 JD.
      Diesel per liter = 0.29 JD.

A.4     Vehicle capital costs

When improvements to the network take place, then speeds are likely to increase. For
commercial vehicle operators, this may allow themto makethe same number o ftrips with fewer
vehicles. Thus for commercial vehicles there is a potential capital cost saving due to the savings
invehicle time. Therefore, estimates needto bemade ofthevehicle time savings whenthe
project i s implementedandthe impact this has on annual vehicle utilization.

A utilizationfactor (EVU)is introduced becausewithout it, the implicit assumption would be
that all time savings could be converted into vehicle time savings. Inpractice this i s not the case.
Research inBrazil, Malaysia and Pakistansuggests that the percentage utilization o ftime savings
vary between countries and byvehicle type. The more efficient the transport operations the
higher the utilization. FromWorld Bankresearch, the utilization factor (EVU) for vehicle types
are as follows:

The estimation o fvehicle capital costs hasbeenbasedon the methodologyusedfor the World
Bank'sHighway Designand Maintenance program. The cost ofvehicle depreciation per
kilometer (DEP) i s based on the annual depreciation o f a vehicle (ADEP), the baseline vehicle
annual utilization (AKMo), the baseline average vehicle service life (LIFE$, the baseline hours
drivenper year (HRDo)and the average speed(ASPEED). The formulae usedfor the
depreciation calculation are as follows:

DEP = ADEP / AKM
             izo
where ADEP =(1 / LIFE) 100andwhere:
                            *

Estimateso fvehicle maintenance costs have usedupdated values fromthe 2004 update study.
This assumesthat 2/3s ofmaintenancecosts are distance related, while the remaindervaries with
speed. The 2004 values have beenupdated to 2007 values, based on inflation over the
intermediate period. Table 3.9 details the updated maintenance cost parameters `a' and `b',

A.6     Drivers' time

Salaries for drivers, for varyingvehicle types, were obtained for this presentstudy. The table
below presents the ranges o f salaries.



 Occupation                    Basic SalaryMonth (JD)        Basic Salary (JD/hr)
 Taxi driver                   300                           1.70
 LGV driver                    300                           1.70
 Minibus driver                250                           1.42
 MGV/HGV driver                250                           1.42
 Busdriver                     350                           1.99



To accurately reflect economic resource costs, 30 percent o fthe salary i s added to take into
account employers contributions.

The value o ftime o f car drivers i s considered to be the same as that o f car passengers.

A.7     Passenger travel time

The 2004 update study calculated passengervalues o ftime basedon government employment
surveys, with the assumption that 90 percent o f trips are inwork time with 10percent innon-
work time. This resultedina value for work time o f JD 1.64hour and JD 0.46hour for non-
work time. Updatingthese values to the present day, results inan average passengervalue o f
time ofJD 1.95hour.

A.8     Increasesinvalue of travel time

For an economic evaluation, values o ftime needto be increased on an annual percentage basis,
to reflect increases inthe wealth o f society, inreal terms. A common approach i s to increase the
value o ftime by 50 percent o f an assumedfuture annual growth inGDP. The GDP growth rate,
assumedto 4 percent per year, i s adjusted by 50 percent on the assumption that not all increases
ina society's wealth are directly passedoninthe form ofhigherwages to inhabitants. This
wealth factor has been applied to the value o ftime and increased on a yearly basis.
