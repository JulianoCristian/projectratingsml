"loan_no": "7228;7634", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Amman Development\n            Corridor Project for Jordan were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: a strong coalition of all the\n            local authorities have been able to work with trade\n            interests to enable the government to stick to its\n            commitment for the more efficient (and less polluting)\n            arrangements for handling international trade in the Amman\n            area. With strong support from the central leaders of\n            government, a programmatic approach have been able to\n            achieve more over the last ten years in Jordan than what was\n            possible for Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) or any single\n            authority. When the implementation of a major project will\n            depend on timely completion of a number of large and complex\n            independent contracts, it is vital to precede the eventual\n            launch of bidding with: (a) double-check that cost estimates\n            are fully up-to-date with latest information on prices of\n            major inputs and current market conditions, so that\n            sufficient funds are in hand to proceed immediately with the\n            project; and (b) experienced and knowledgeable packaging of\n            the bids including division of the works amongst different\n            packages so that they do succeed in attracting enough offers\n            to enable a sound decision in favor of one bidder for each\n            package and, consequently, timely commitment of all the\n            contracts required for implementation of the project. The\n            development objectives should be attributable to the\n            specific interventions implemented by the project. They\n            should focus on the outcomes for which the project can be\n            held accountable given its duration, resources, and design\n            be clear and precise, and not encompass ambitious higher\n            level objectives that depend on other efforts outside the\n            project scope. The Bank's country management unit is\n            working closely with the government to find the best ways of\n            adjusting the management of sectoral capital investment\n            programs to fit within the constraints of the\n            government's fiscal and public-debt situation. As\n            regards land acquisition activities, government's\n            agreement to pay for the first time for all land\n            requisitioned was obviously crucial, but the package of\n            arrangements introduced to ensure good implementation on the\n            ground, sensitive to the needs of the different people\n            directly affected, was an important factor in the overall\n            success and the basis it establishes for future land\n            acquisition programs. Systematic environmental monitoring,\n            reinforced by small monetary incentives, can make a\n            worthwhile difference to contractors' adherence to good\n            environmental standards throughout the work. Ministry of\n            Public Works and Housing (MoPWH's) staff were fully\n            trained to take over the system and the special measuring\n            equipment involved from consultants who had developed it,\n            and to maintain regular monthly readings."}, "docdt": "2013-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
