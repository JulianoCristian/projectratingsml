This\n            restructuring is a new (and second) extension which brings\n            the cumulative extension of the project to 42 months. The\n            closing date of the project will be extended from December\n            31, 2011 until December 31, 2012 (one year). The extension\n            does not result in a change to the project activities nor\n            require a modification to the project description in the\n            loan agreement. The extension is necessary to ensure the\n            implementation of the remaining activities."}, "docdt": "2011-10-13T00:00:00Z"}
