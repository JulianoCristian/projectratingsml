The additional\n            financing will help finance the costs associated with\n            unanticipated cost overruns due to increases in the costs of\n            key inputs that occurred between appraisal and contract\n            signing, and due to technical modifications identified after\n            the start of construction to improve overall access and\n            safety of section two. There are no significant changes to\n            the original design of the road. The modifications to be\n            carried out are not expected to significantly extend the\n            completion date for section two. Under this additional\n            financing, there will be no changes to the project\n            development objectives and the project activities carried\n            forward from the original project. And the implementation\n            arrangements remain the same. The additional financing is\n            expected to address a cost overrun for the completion of\n            existing project activities pertaining to: (a) the\n            rehabilitation of three underpasses, (b) the erection of\n            protective structures to protect gas pipelines, and (c) the\n            carrying out of full surfacing of shoulders."}, "docdt": "2008-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
