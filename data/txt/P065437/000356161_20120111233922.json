Management and Sustainable Use Project for Uganda were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; GEO outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was moderate; risk to GEO outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: project design should have a robust\n            assessment of the governance challenges and plan mitigation\n            measures accordingly. Long-term engagement in the sector and\n            consistency of the supervision team are assets in using\n            adaptive management methods to resolve issues. A phased\n            approach allowed for the implementing agencies to, first,\n            build a basic operational capacity and, then to benefit more\n            fully from substantial field investment was appropriate\n            under the circumstances. Decentralized institutional support\n            is critical when protecting a vulnerable natural and\n            cultural resource base. In developing an environmental\n            program, competing needs of ecosystems and commercial\n            development need to be balanced."}, "docdt": "2011-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
