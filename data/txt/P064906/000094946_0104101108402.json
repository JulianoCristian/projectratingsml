strategy,\n            and by continuing to improve access to small-scale social,\n            and economic infrastructure to the poor. The components\n            include: 1) subproject financing, to enable a continued\n            support from the Emergency Social Investment Fund (FISE), in\n            the replacement, expansion, and improvement of basic social\n            services. Training in community organization, operations,\n            and maintenance will be provided. The component aims at\n            improving the quality, and comprehensiveness of investments;\n            ensuring community participation; coordinating with service\n            providers to ensure adequate supply-side interventions; and,\n            addressing the specific needs of indigenous populations; 2)\n            financing of participatory municipal planning, which\n            includes technical assistance (TA), and training provision\n            for communities, and municipalities alike, so as to be able\n            to conduct future planning by themselves. Decentralization\n            of subproject management will continue, through TA from\n            FISE, while capacity building will be provided not only to\n            communities, and municipalities, but to private\n            stakeholders; 3) supporting the development of safety nets\n            within a strengthened social protection strategy, and\n            improved management of public investments in social areas,\n            including monitoring and evaluation of safety net programs.\n            An innovation fund will be established within FISE to pilot\n            safety net measures for poverty reduction; and, 4) project\n            management covering institutional strengthening, supply of\n            equipment, and external auditing."}, "docdt": "2001-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
