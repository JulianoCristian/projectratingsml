First Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
Excellency: 
 
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement dated June 6, 2001 between the International 
Development Association (the Association) and the Republic of Nicaragua (the Borrower). All the terms 
defined in the Development Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) have the same meaning as therein set 
forth. 
 
We are pleased to inform you that following our recent discussions on the subject, the 
Association hereby agrees to amend the Credit Agreement as set forth below: 
 
Section 1.02 (f) is deleted and consequently, the term “Fiscal Year” in Section 4.01 of the Credit 
Agreement shall be replaced by the words “fiscal year”. 
 
Sections 1.02 (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (m), (n), (o), (p), (q), (r), (s) and (t) are relettered as Sections 
1.02 (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (m), (n), (o), (p), (q), (r) and (s), respectively. 
 
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by signing and dating each copy of this letter in 
the spaces provided below. This amendment letter shall be executed in two counterparts, each of which 
shall be an original. Upon your confirmation, please return one fully executed original to us. The 
provisions of this amendment letter shall enter into effect as of the date of this letter, once the Association 
has received one fully signed original. 
 
Sincerely,
