satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: bottom-up and demand-driven initiatives can\n            improve the quality and relevance of social and economic\n            investments. Community Driven Development Projects (CDD)\n            must be integrated with local government programs rather\n            than by-pass them in order to ensure long-term\n            sustainability of the small-scale social and economic\n            investments carried out at the community level, provide\n            enabling conditions for the scaling up and prevent erosion\n            of local capacity. The choice of targeting approach is\n            relevant for equity, transparency, program ownership and\n            effectiveness. The Nicaraguan State needs to significantly\n            strengthen its coordinating efforts among line Ministries\n            and agencies to increase effectiveness and efficiencies in a\n            context of limited financial, physical and technical\n            resources. Impact evaluation included at the onset of\n            project implementation and monitoring are needed as a means\n            to correct course if it becomes necessary. They also provide\n            appropriate information to test alternative mechanisms,\n            prior to scaling-up. This project paid close attention to\n            establishing a functional Management Information System\n            (MIS) and a series of evaluations. Ensuring implementation\n            readiness conditions prior to negotiations leads to a more\n            effective and timely physical and financial execution cycle."}, "docdt": "2007-09-27T00:00:00Z"}
