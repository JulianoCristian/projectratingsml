Project\n            constitutes the first tranche of a long term national\n            program aimed at strengthening agricultural support\n            services. Specific objectives are to: 1) increase\n            farmers' and pastoralists incomes; 2) improve the lot\n            of rural women; 3) improve the links between extension and\n            research; and 4) strengthen producer organizations. The\n            primary component of the project is the improvement of\n            livestock and crop extension services. There are also two\n            secondary components, which are the following: 1)\n            strengthening of producer organizations through functional\n            literacy training; and 2) strengthening the analytical\n            capacity of the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR) through\n            training and short term consultancies."}, "docdt": "1990-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
