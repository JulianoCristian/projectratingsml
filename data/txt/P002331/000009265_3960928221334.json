Specific objectives are to : 1) increase\n            farmers' and pastoralists incomes; 2) improve the lot\n            of rural women; 3) improve the links between extension and\n            research; and 4) strengthen producer organizations.  The\n            primary component of the project is the improvement of\n            livestock and crop extension services.  There are also two\n            secondary components, which are the following : 1)\n            strengthening of producer organizations through functional\n            literacy training; and 2) strengthening the analytical\n            capacity of the Ministry of Rural Development ( MDR )\n            through training and short term consultancies."}, "docdt": "1990-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
