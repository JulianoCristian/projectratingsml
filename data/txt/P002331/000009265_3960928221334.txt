MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION 0F TEE PRESIDENT
OF TUE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPHENT ASSOCIATION
TO TUE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO SENEGAL
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
#   1.    The  folloving  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed
development credit to Senegal for SDR 13 million (US$ 17.1 million) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit vould be on standard IDA terms
vith 40 yearu maturity and help finance the first phase of a long-term
program aimed at improving agricultural services to farmers and herders.
2.        Background.  Agriculture in Senegal accounts for only 202 of GDP
and 20Z of exports but is still the main or ouly source of livelihood for 70S
of the people. Agriculture grevwat only 1I per year between 1960 and 1988,
but wvth considerable inter-annual fluctuations due to rainfall variability.
While improved performance ln agriculture vill not be critical for future
growth, it vill be crucial for employment and income for a majority of the
population for a long time to come.  Starting in 1985, under SALs II and III,
real farm prices were brought up to or even above border parities, most input
subsidies vere eliminated and input distribution has been largely privatized.
T=.e priority needs for further policy reform are to seek economies in crop
collection, processing and marketinsg  and greater flexibility in setting
producer prices for gru 'dnuts, cotton and rice; actions in these directions
vill constitute the key features of the Agricultural Sector Loan that is
under preparation. Meantime, public investment planning ii being improved,
and annual revievs have led to improved design and a significant switch from
Irrigation to rainfed farming. Area development projecte are being phased
eut in favor of national programs in support services and environmental
management. The proposed project has been prepared on the.basis of a pilot
extension program undertaken by the Goveriment and financed by IDA over the
past two years, as vell as a functional literacy program undertaken under the
Eastern Senegal Agricultural Development project (Credit 1406-SE).
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project forms an integral part
of IDA's sector devrlopisent strategy and is closely related to the ongoing
and follow-up projecte in national Agricult;zral Research. IDA's considerable
experience in agricultural extension has made a valuable contribution to the
above-mentioned pilot program and vill help Goverament make a success of the
proposed project.
4.        Prolect Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to improve
agricultural services to farmers and herders and thus increase their incomes.
The project also seeks to harmonize gradually the approach to extension,
reshape extension into a polyvalent service addressing farmers' and
pastoralists' main activities, improve the links between extension and
research and strengthen producer organizations.
5.        Project Description.    The project would have  one principal
component, namely improvement of crop and livestock extension services, based
on lessons learned during pilot operations undertaken for two yearst
systematic in-service training of extension staff at all levels, formal
research-extension linkages, and careful implementation and effectiveness



monitoring vould be key ingredients of this component. The project vould
have two secondary componentes (i) strengthening of producer organizations
through training of their leaders and a functional literacy program; (ii)
strengthening of the analytical capacity of HDR through training and short-
term consultancies in policy formulation, project preparation and appraisal
and performance monitoring. The project, to be carried out over four years,
vould provide funding for vehicles, equipment and modest infrastructure,
manpower development and training costs, and operating costs. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$ 20.2 million equivalent with a foreign
exchange component of US $ 11.4 million (562). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of diabursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing evente and the statue of Bank Group
operations lu Senegal are given in Schedules C and D respectively. Maps are
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8079, dated February 1, _990,
is al8o attached.
6.        Agreed Actions.   The Government has agreed on the following
actions: <a) establishment of the Central Accounting and Procurement Unit
(CAPU) and the appointment of a Chief Accountant with qualifications
satisfactory to IDA and (b) signature of protocoles d'accord between the
Borrover and the various executing agencies both as conditions of
effectiveness;  (c)   establishment not later than April 30, 1990 of the
national and regional technical committees end adoption of arrangements
satisfactory to IDA for the planning, implementation and financing of the
project's on-farm research trials component; (d) after two years of project
execution, a joint mid-term review would be held to review project progress
by each executing agency, to decide on the pace of further geographic
expansion of the project and to review the institutional framework (i.e., its
executing agencies), and the findings and recommendations would be
implemented promptly thereafter; and (e) regular, timely deposit of its
counterpart contribution; (f) model plans for rehabilitation of provincial
agriculture and livestock department buildings vould be submitted to the
Association for approval by December 31, 1990.
7.        Benefits.   The main thrust of the improved crop and livestock
extension services is to increase land productivity by lmproved cultural
practices and improved herd management, i.e. low-cost and low-risk measures
such as soil conservation, vater harvesting, contour planting, zero tilling,
composting, alley-cropping, agro-forestry and better integration of crops and
livestock, as vell as more efficient application of chemical fertilizers and
pesticides. Adoption of these measures vill both increase land productivity
and arrest soil degradation, and it is anticipated that the proposed project
vould be environmentally positive. The improvement of agricultural support
services to farmers and herders vill contribute to the well-being of about
60S of the rural population (360,000 families), but 1---r many of these
householde would choose to adopt the recommended practices cannot be
estîmated with any precision.  The main benefits would beo  (a) increased
crop and livestock output, (b) increased autonomy and self-reliance of
producers' organizations due to functional literacy and management training,
(c) more effective identification, testing and dissemination of new-
techniques due to the training of large numbers of extension staff in
communication and management skills, as vell as technical matters, and (d)



institutional strengthening by building up the capacity of the Livest ck and
Agricultural Departments to provide extension services, and enhancing MDR's
analytical capacity.
8.        Risks.  Possible risks includes  (a) ineffective muanagement aad
training of extension personnel, (b) low adoption rates of technical
recomendations by farners and/or slow build-up of applicable technology by
research, and (c) the possible failure of Government and/or donors to sustain
the long-term comitment required to achieve durable improvements in the
effectivenees of agricultural support services. To minimize these risk8, a
two-year pilot operation vas undertaken, and lessons have been built into the
a      ~project design.   The project's implementation and effectiveness will be
carefully monitored, and a mid-term review vill be held after two years of
project execution to review progress by each executing agency snd to
determine the pace of further geographic expansion of project activities.
