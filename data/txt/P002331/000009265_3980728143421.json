The project constituted the first tranche of a\n            long-term program aimed at strengthening Senegal's core\n            agricultural services. The program's long-term\n            objective was to promote the sustained increase in\n            farmers' and pastoralists' productivity and\n            incomes through technological change. The specific\n            objectives of the program's first phase (the project)\n            were to harmonize the different extension activities in use\n            in the country around a system based on a farming system\n            approach and to improve the links between extension and\n            research. In support of these objectives, the project\n            included three components: (a) the restructuring of the\n            agricultural and livestock extension services of the\n            Ministry of Rural Development (MDR); (b) the strengthening\n            of producerorganizations; and (c) the strengthening of\n            MDR's analytical and policy-making capacity. The main\n            lessons to be learned from the implementation of this\n            project are: (a) Ensuring sustained responsiveness and\n            efficiency of extension services through a top-down\n            centralized system is hardly, if at all, possible. The\n            identification and prioritization of farmers' needs and\n            constraints is a prerequisite for the success of an\n            extension program. Contact groups are a very effective\n            instruments for two-way communications in a technology\n            diffusion system. However, the CGconcept needs to be\n            reviewed. Experience under this project has shown that\n            criteria for the establishment of GCs need to reflect\n            existing social structures and/or commonality of economic purpose."}, "docdt": "1998-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
