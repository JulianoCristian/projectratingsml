The lessons\n            learned indicate that any novel technology and IT software\n            being introduced by a project of this type should take into\n            account the ground conditions, the capacity for absorption\n            by the users and therefore appropriate training and phasing\n            needs to be part of the project design. Hydrology Project\n            (HP) design did not include data-related, value-addition\n            studies as part of its MIS/learning environment. Practical\n            application and use of HIS should be further strengthened by\n            introducing Decision Support Systems for water related\n            operations. Any project of this recurring nature needs\n            understanding and firm support of the high level management\n            for success of project implementation and its\n            sustainability. There is a need to develop a project\n            planning and monitoring mechanism suited to Indian\n            conditions as externally developed Hydrology Institutional\n            Development Action Plan (HIDAP) has proven ill-suited due to\n            an insufficient recognition/ incorporation of institutional\n            settings and culture in India. At Project closure, it\n            appears that the use of HIS data remains opportunistic and\n            meetings of data user groups (HDUG) have mostly served as a\n            means of informing potential users about Hydrological\n            Information System (HIS) rather than exploring, in a dynamic\n            and participatory manner, feedback for improved HIS management."}, "docdt": "2004-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
