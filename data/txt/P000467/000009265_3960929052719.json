Republic. However, it has accelerated over the last\n            decades, and experience in other countries shows that once\n            deforestation reaches a certain stage, it is very difficult\n            to stop. The CAR government must therefore start to plan\n            now, while there is still time, for the conservation and\n            long term sustained use of its forest and wildlife\n            resources. At the same time, planning should take into\n            account the substantial potential for increasing the\n            contribution of these resources to the national economy.\n            Accordingly, the main objective of the project, which will\n            constitute the first phase of a longer term program, is to\n            reinforce CAR's capabilities to protect and manage its\n            forest and wildlife resources on a sustainable basis."}, "docdt": "1990-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
