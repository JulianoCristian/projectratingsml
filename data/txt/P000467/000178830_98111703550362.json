component were achieved and it was rated\n            satisfactory throughout its life, despite the\n            socio-political instability and civil strife in the country\n            which endangered implementation. However, the achievement of\n            the objectives for the forestry sector adjustment program\n            fell short of expectations, although the Bank and the\n            government did agree on a forestry audit that provided\n            useful information for future sustained policy action.\n            IDA's performance is rated satisfactory for project\n            identification and preparation, and for supervision of the\n            investment component. The borrower's performance is\n            rated satisfactory for implementing the investment\n            component, and rated unsatisfactory for policy reform\n            implementation and institutional development. Key lessons\n            learned included: 1) Appropriate policy and institutional\n            reforms should strongly focus on sector work in advance of\n            appraisal. 2) the borrower's capacity to absorb reforms\n            should be estimated more carefully at appraisal. 3)\n            Implementation of timetables should be more realistic and\n            adapted to sector constraints. 4) Complex projects should\n            use Bank experts to supervise policy reforms. 5) In\n            designing forestry and biodiversity conservation programs,\n            more attention should be paid to local constraints and\n            policy distortions underlying natural resource degradation\n            and forest depletion. 6) Forestry development and\n            biodiversity conservation recurrent costs should not come\n            solely from the government."}, "docdt": "1998-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
