                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This update is based on a field visit to the northern region between January 31 and February 10, 2011 and an implementation support mission between March 14 and 23, 2011.

                         The project has suffered major implementation delays from the beginning mainly due to (i) weak ownership of the project; (ii) sub-optimal capacity and readiness of central, regional,
                         and districts to scale up interventions; and (iii) unwillingness of/inability to take mitigation measures to expedite implementation.

                         Since the mid-term review in December 2009, and its modification with revised implementation and institutional arrangements in July 2010, project performance has improved
                         considerably. This is partly due to significant efforts made in the areas of project management with the Policy Planning Monitoring and Evaluation Department (PPMED)at the Ghana

                         Health Service (GHS) taking ownership of the project and supporting the technical departments as well as regional and district health management teams in the delivery of
                         community based health and nutrition services. This improved leadership support has resulted in a considerable scale up of community based services in the last several months,
                         from 10% of target communities in June 2010 to 51% in March 2011 in 3 northern regions (38 districts). Development of key policies and strategies is also moving forward. Further,
                         the GHS has shared the mitigation measures they are putting in place to ensure that intended beneficiaries will receive and use the long lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) to be
                         procured. For example, the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) has changed the LLINs distribution policy from routine channel distribution to universal campaign with 'hang-
                         up' (i.e. door to door distribution with LLINs hung up in the house by GHS volunteers and supervisors) which has shown to be effective. The NMCP also agreed that (i) if the
                         government does not have enough LLINs to distribute to all 10 regions, LLINs to be procured under the project will be distributed to one of the five target regions of the project (as
                         part of the universal campaign); and (ii) a post-campaign survey be conducted to provide the data ensuring LLINs distribution to intended beneficiaries.

                         However, slow procurement has been continuously affecting overall project implementation and financial management issues raised during the mission in July 2010 have been
                         partially addressed.

                         (i) project implementation team members will be assigned to individual regions to provide regular implementation support to the regional and district teams and to address issues as
                         soon as they arise;
                         (ii) the Ministry of Health (MOH) will submit a quarterly interim financial report with an withdrawal application(s);
                         (iii) the GHS will submit the annual work program and budget approved by the MOH to the World Bank: once cleared, the MOH will transfer the funds to the GHS quarterly without
                         further requests from the GHS to the MOH; and
                         (iv) those activities that cannot be completed by the agreed deadlines will be dropped and savings be reprogrammed or canceled.

                         A one day review meeting (possibly via VC) will be held in early July 2011. The next implementation support mission is planned in September 2011.
