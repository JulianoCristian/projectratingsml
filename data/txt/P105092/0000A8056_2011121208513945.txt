                         Since the last mission in March 2011, project implementation has progressed satisfactorily as a result of continuous improvement in project management. There continues to be
                         considerable scale up of community based services in the Northern, Upper West and UpperEast Regions (in 38 Districts) from 51% in March, 2011 to 63.4% by end of June, 2011.
                         Between June and September 2011, additional districts that were to come on board are at various stages of preparation before beginning implementation of the community based
                         services. As planned, all 20 (twenty) districts in the Central and Volta Regions have trained their district and subdistrict teams and some are currently training their community

                         Preparation of key policies and strategies continues and drafts have been shared with the Bank Team for comments. Validation meetings are expected to be completed by end of

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In order to further expedite project implementation, it was agreed that:

                         (i) the Ministry of Health (MOH) will ensure all new districts reach 25% of target communities with community based health and nutrition services by December 2011.
                         (ii) no activities will be dropped as considerable progress has been made on all.

                         A one day review meeting by VC was held on September 20, 2011 where all aspects of the project were reviewed. Due to the mission free period instituted by the Government from
                         September 15 to December 15, 2011 the next implementation support mission has been rescheduled for December, 2011.
