                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve utilization of selected community-based health and nutrition services for children under the age of two and
                         pregnant women in the selected districts.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The likelihood of achieving project development objectives has improved and therefore the PDO rating has been upgraded to Satisfactory. The overall implementation is maintained
                         at moderately satisfactory. The project performance has continued to improve since March, 2011 under the management of the Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (PPME)/
                         Ghana Health Service (GHS) and the more active participation of the technical departments as well as regional and district health management teams in the delivery of community
                         based health and nutrition services.

                         Development of policies and strategies has progressed significantly since the last review meeting in September, 2011. Intensive consultations have been carried out with many
                         stakeholders on these policies and strategies. While coordination has improved at all levels, the oversight committees at the lower levels such as the district advisory committees and
                         the community implementation committees are not functioning as expected.

                         Efforts to improve the monitoring and evaluation system are on track as piloting of the new system has been completed and plans are underway to roll it out into all the project target
                         districts. The pilot was a proof of concept and a demonstration of how data collation and analysis can be improved for better results and timely reporting on the project.

                         Scale-up of community-based health and nutrition services has progressed according to plan with activities initiated in 20 districts in the Central, Volta and Western regions. However
                         the target agreed for the new districts that were beginning was not reached; accounting for the moderately satisfactory (MS) rating of implementation progress (IP). Once scale-up in
                         all districts is completed the implementation progress will be upgraded to satisfactory.

                         An institutional assessment of the nutrition area was carried out in 2011 and the report that was submitted to the government was discussed during the February 2012 mission and
                         agreement was reached as to how carry forward the recommendations.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         (i) Project will scale-up to all districts and communities by June, 2012.

                         (ii) In order to improve the functioning of the oversight committees at the district and community levels, the Regional Health and District Health Management Teams will carry out
                         massive sensitization programs for the district chief executive officers and community leaders about the importance of the program and their participation in it.

                         (iii) With support from the World Bank, the project implementation team will develop participatory mechanisms to strengthen collaboration among key actors at the district and
                         community levels, and improve community participation in M&E processes. The participatory monitoring process will also aim to enhance accountability and responsibility of key
                         players in the delivery of the project activities at the community level.

                         (iv) The new monitoring and evaluation system will be rolled out to all project districts by June, 2012.
