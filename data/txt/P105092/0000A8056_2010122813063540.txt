                         Implementation Status Overview
                         While significant efforts have been made in the areas of project management since the project's mid-term evaluation in December 2009, this is yet to be translated into results.
                         Community based health and nutrition services, which can improve the project outcomes, are still being implemented in a limited number of target communities. In addition, the
                         achievement of the project has not been systematically captured due to weak monitoring of the project activities including distribution of commodities procured under the project.
